US president favours Nasry ‘Tito' Asfura of rightwing National party, as polls show three candidates are neck-and-neck

Hondurans have begun voting in an election held amid threats by Donald Trump to cut aid to the country if his preferred candidate loses.

Honduras could be the next country in Latin America, after Argentina and Bolivia, to swing right after years of leftwing rule.

Polls show three candidates neck-and-neck in the race to succeed President Xiomara Castro, whose husband, Manuel Zelaya, also led the country before being toppled in a 2009 coup.

Trump's favourite is 67-year-old Nasry “Tito” Asfura of the rightwing National party. His main challengers are 60-year-old lawyer Rixi Moncada from the ruling Libre party and 72-year-old TV host Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal party.

Polls opened at 7.00 am (1300 GMT) for 10 hours of voting, with the first results expected on Sunday.

Trump has conditioned continued US support for one of Latin America's poorest countries on Asfura winning. “If he [Asfura] doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad,” he wrote on Friday on his Truth Social platform, echoing threats he made in support of the Argentine president Javier Milei's party in that country's recent midterms.

In a dramatic move on Friday, Trump also announced he would pardon the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez of the National party, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US for cocaine trafficking and other charges.

Despite making narco-traffickers the target of a significant military buildup in the Caribbean, Trump claimed the Honduran “has been, according to many people that I greatly respect, treated very harshly and unfairly”, without elaborating.

Hernandez was convicted of turning Honduras into a “narco-state” while president between 2014 and 2022. He was convicted in Manhattan last year and sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Some Hondurans have welcomed Trump's interventionism, saying they hope it might mean Honduran migrants will be allowed to remain in the US. But others have rejected his meddling in the vote.

Nearly 30,000 Honduran people have been deported from the US since Trump returned to office in January. The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country of 11 million people, where remittances represented 27% of GDP last year.

Moncada has portrayed the election as a choice between a “coup-plotting oligarchy” – a reference to the right's backing of the 2009 military ouster of Zelaya – and democratic socialism. Moncada has held ministerial portfolios under both Zelaya and Castro.

Nasralla also served in Castro's government but fell out with the ruling party and has since shifted to the right. Asfura was a building entrepreneur before being elected mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, where he served two terms.

Pre-emptive accusations of election fraud, made both by the ruling party and opposition, have sown mistrust in the vote and sparked fears of post-election unrest.

Ana Paola Hall, the president of the National Electoral Council, told all parties “not to fan the flames of confrontation or violence” at the start of the single-round elections, in which Hondurans are also picking members of the unicameral Congress and local mayors.

Asfura has distanced himself from Hernandez, his party's figurehead. “I have no ties [with Hernandez] … the party is not responsible for his personal actions,” he told AFP on Friday.

President William Lai's (賴清德) historic announcement on Wednesday, Nov. 26, of a supplemental defense budget valued in excess of US$40 billion is a testament to the seriousness with which Taiwan is responding to the relentless expansionist ambitions of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), the Chinese Communist Party and its People's Liberation Army (PLA). Lai is responding to the threat posed to Taiwan sovereignty along with US President Donald Trump's insistence that American partners in good standing must take on more responsibility for their own defense.

The supplemental defense budget will be broken into three main parts. The first and largest piece will be several Foreign Military Sales or FMS programs that are government-to-government transactions. FMS allows for both governments to negotiate directly on the value of procured equipment, such as previously procured HiMARS or NASAMs, while conferring sovereignty to Taiwan through the government-to-government nature of the transaction. 

It equips Taiwan with important, modern, difference-making weapons while binding the two governments together in the training and sustainment of the equipment. FMS is the bedrock of America's primary security relationships throughout the world.



Second, the budget will contain several Direct Commercial Sales or DCS programs. Where FMS is not a priority, DCS is utilized to expedite the delivery of equipment while placing increased pressure on price; it's cheaper and faster. 

This is the direction more defense transactions can go as Taiwan builds out its domestic defense industrial base and becomes further embedded in American and European supply chains. 

This is possible because a new wave of relatively inexpensive unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are not tied to onerous technology restrictions and can therefore be co-developed and co-produced inexpensively and at scale.

The third set of programs are intended for Taiwan's domestic defense industrial base. This is a critical area of investment, as Taiwan must expand the ability to produce more of what it needs, domestically. Taiwan's contract manufacturers are the best in the world and employing their manufacturing expertise to produce large quantities of needed items, particularly UAS, is crucial for Taiwan's defense. 

As Cathy Fang at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET) recently noted when discussing the utility of UAS, “quantity has its own quality”. It is imperative that Taiwan significantly expand its procurement of UAS capabilities; however, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates, the pace of innovation means you cannot over-procure, because the battlefield is changing so rapidly. Most UAS capabilities must be bought in tranches every two or three years, so the military and other agencies can constantly assess their needs and adjust procurement over time. 

Indeed, Ukraine embeds decision making on procurement with some fighting units so they can provide input on new product development quickly.

Lai, in his recent column in The Washington Post, stated, “This landmark package will not only fund significant new arms acquisitions from the US, but also vastly enhance Taiwan's asymmetric capabilities.” Since 2020, the US has narrowed its security assistance to Taiwan to include only so-called asymmetric capabilities. Please note, the term asymmetric is highly subjective, resulting in different interpretations. With Taiwan it mostly means procuring large quantities of munitions and mobile equipment to complicate the planning and execution of a D-Day-style attack on Taiwan's main island. While this has the benefit of pushing off any PLA timeline regarding this scenario, it leaves Taiwan under-supported in dealing with quarantine, gray zone and blockade domains. It is no surprise that we now see China expanding its pressure on everyday challenges such as gray zone incursions. Taiwan seeks a balance between the D-Day domain and everyday challenges in the sky and on the sea. 

US security assistance still needs to adjust to the reality of all of Taiwan's challenges, not just one of them, and with the passage of the supplemental budget we should press for a less boundaried approach to Taiwan's defense with equipment that can manage everyday challenges.

Additionally, it is essential that Taiwan's political parties find a path forward to assess and pass the government's regular annual budget. The defense budget, embedded in the regular government budget, is at the core of support for Taiwan's military. A special supplemental budget is a useful mechanism to surge spending; however, it is the regular year-on-year defense budget that provides sustained resources for all the military's needs. 

To deny the military that certainty undermines the country's defense with one step forward on the supplemental defense budget and two steps back on the regular defense budget. Both must pass in the coming several months for Taiwan's security to be enhanced.

So what comes next? Several of the programs are already under review in the US system. When ready for contract finalization, the Trump administration will alert the US Congress, through a congressional notification or CN, of an impending sale such as the recent November 13 CN, which represented the first arms sales to Taiwan in Mr. Trump's second term. 

Given the sheer size of the programs captured in the supplemental budget, we can expect the Trump administration, over the next 6-12 months, to notify to the US Congress the largest gross value of arms sales to Taiwan since the switch in recognition in 1979. 

This is an extraordinary response to the Chinese threat from the people of Taiwan and the partnered support they receive from the US.

The timing of Lai's commitment is most welcome. The Chinese have chosen to pick an early fight with Japan's new prime minister Sanae Takaichi when she noted in parliamentary question time, “If there are battleships and the use of force [in the Taiwan Strait], no matter how you think about it, there is a possibility that it becomes a survival-threatening situation [for Japan].” 

China has rapidly escalated its rhetoric against Japan, threatened its leader with assassination, pursued some modest and frankly inconsequential economic actions while flooding the international media with claims of Japanese neo-militarism.

 The latter assertion is simply preposterous given China's recent militaristic behavior.

Takaichi's comments are significant and worthy of consideration and support from the US and Taiwan. Like the United States, the Japanese have long pursued a policy of ambiguity over what military involvement in a Chinese attack on Taiwan would entail . As the threat from the Chinese has expanded, particularly under Xi, we are seeing increasing clarity fr2om countries affected by this threat. 

Strategic ambiguity is increasingly being replaced by strategic clarity, not all at once, but with each step. We have seen multilateral and bilateral declarations include the demand for “peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.” China naturally objects given its contention that this is a domestic matter, but it is the only belligerent threatening peace. We saw former US president Joe Biden on four separate occasions state the US would come to Taiwan's defense. Yes, three instances were walked back by his staff, but the boundaries around acceptable clarity of global interest in Taiwan's future is expanding and clarifying.

Taiwan's supplemental defense budget is the correct response to China's daily harassment of Taiwan. Takaichi's statements along with her government's consideration of deployment of Type 03 Chu-SAM missiles on Yonaguni Island, in response to constant PLA harassment of Japanese sovereignty, is the correct way to push back on Chinese threats and elevated tensions. 

President Trump would do well to robustly support Japan when speaking to China. Conversely, in the United Kingdom constant violations of British sovereignty by Chinese intelligence services are met with appeasement as the government moves toward approving China's mega-embassy designed for a single purpose: to undermine UK sovereignty. An utterly discredited approach where Mr. Starmer's government self-censors sovereignty for marginal economic gain. The US spent two decades plus pursuing this approach, and it was a disaster; only China wins.

Trump's insistence that partners and allies do more for their own defense is well-established. Lai's recent commitments place Taiwan's defense ambitions concurrently in line with the United States, Japan, Australia and other partner nations who are expanding their military capabilities to deter China's destabilizing military modernization — the largest expansion of hostile combat power, by any country, since the end of World War II.

Trump, Lai and Takaichi should receive global support for their leadership.

The Japanese developed Kaohsiung. There was little to show before they arrived. The city does not define itself as a “Japanese” place, but it does not anchor its identity in anything that would oppose Japan, such as revanchism — a barbaric ideology that has only ever generated suffering — or national pride.
The residents of Kaohsiung are too pragmatic for that. The city might have become a wonderful                                    



                                                                                Urban prosperity does not always begin with industrial parks or investment briefings — sometimes, it begins overnight, when the heartbeats of 170,000 people land in a stadium, shaking the ground like an invisible wave of urban renewal. 
During the two nights that K-pop group Twice performed in Kaohsiung last weekend, the city was not just a city. Instead, it felt like a massive body that had just woken up — the MRT's blood flow sped up, the night markets' sense of smell remained active until 4am and the shopping districts swelled as if injected with oxygen. This was not a                                    



                                                                                The recent confirmation hearing for Austin Dahmer, US President Donald Trump's nominee for assistant secretary of war for strategy, plans and capabilities, was potentially groundbreaking. 
Asked how the US could help Taiwan deter or defeat a Chinese attack, Dahmer said: “The US strategy of denial complements Taiwan's plans for layered defense by providing combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines, to provide a strong local defense that is difficult and painful to dislodge while bolstering allied confidence in our resolve.”
For the US to provide “combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines,” it would be necessary for Washington to implement an assertive forward                                    



                                                                                I recently watched a panel discussion on Taiwan Talks in which the host rightly asked a critical question: Why is the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) spearheading a robust global movement to reject China's ongoing distortion of UN Resolution 2758?
While the discussion offered some context, a more penetrating analysis and urgent development was missed. The IPAC action is not merely a political gesture; it is an essential legal and diplomatic countermeasure to China's escalating and fundamentally baseless campaign to manufacture a claim over Taiwan through the deliberate misinterpretation of a 1971 UN resolution.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated.

Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the Washington-backed peace plan aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, at Witkoff's private gold club in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami.

After nearly two hours of talks, Witkoff emerged from the meeting room telling reporters that he evaluated the talks as "positive," without elaborating further. The meeting will continue after a short break.

As the talks continue, a source with direct knowledge of the negotiation told CNN that the conversations were "tough but very constructive." The source added that the talks included discussion of some of "the most sensitive issues" surrounding a peace deal. "So far so good," they concluded.

"I remain in constant contact with the President of Ukraine," Umerov said ahead of the meeting on X. "We are working to secure real peace for Ukraine and reliable, long-term security guarantees. "

The talks are built off the recent negotiations in Geneva, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European representatives worked to revise the original 28-point proposal — a plan that initially demanded sweeping concessions from Kyiv in line with Moscow's maximalist demands.

Talking to reporters ahead of the meeting, Rubio said the end goal is to secure a peace deal "that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity."

Sitting across from Rubio, Umerov expressed gratitude to Trump and the American people for the 10-month effort to end Russia's invasion, adding he is "looking forward to have a successful, productive meeting today."

The talks come as Ukraine is grappling with one of the most explosive political crises in recent years, with President Volodymyr Zelensky's top advisor, Andriy Yermak, resigning amid a major corruption investigation.

Yermak, Zelensky's long-term ally and regarded as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine's history, was expected to lead the negotiations before announcing his resignation on Nov. 28.

Ukrainian negotiators also include Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia, Ambassador Olha Stefanishyna, Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov, and Deputy Head of Military Intelligence Vadym Skibitskyi.

Ukraine and the U.S. have not fully disclosed the revised peace agreement reached in Geneva, which is said to have eased some of the harshest conditions imposed on Kyiv, with some issues still to be ironed out in subsequent talks.

The Kremlin has confirmed receipt of the proposal agreed on in Geneva, while Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow early next week to continue negotiations with the Russian side.

An unnamed U.S. official told Axios that the White House aims to resolve two key outstanding issues with Ukraine: territory and security guarantees. Witkoff and Kushner reportedly hope to finalize discussions with the Ukrainian side before presenting the result to Putin on Dec. 2.

Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House.

The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have been promoting a "peace through business" approach to diplomacy for months, hoping to entice Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for helping Russia's economy emerge from isolation.

Speaking before the talks in Florida, Zelensky noted that the "American side is demonstrating a constructive approach, and in the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end."

The Ukrainian president also held a phone calls with world leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb — who maintains a friendly relationship with Trump.

"We discussed the situation in diplomacy and share a common view on the key issues," Zelensky wrote on social media following his talks with von der Leyen. 

Kyiv has repeatedly called for increased international pressure on Moscow to force it to accept a ceasefire. Just hours before the talks began, Zelensky announced Ukraine is synchronizing its sanctions regime with Washington's sanctions targeting Russia's Lukoil and Rosneft energy giants.

Russia, meanwhile, continues to reject a ceasefire and presses its maximalist demands, including international recognition of its occupation of Ukrainian territories and the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas.

Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the latest Washington-backed peace plan on ending the Russia-Ukraine war.



 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers leaked calls showing U.S.-Russia coordination on a controversial peace plan and reports on backlash to Reese Witherspoon's Moscow-set novel. 

According to Bloomberg's sources, Russia and India are expected to discuss the potential purchase of the fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft and the S-500 air defense system.

Nawrocki and Orban were set to meet a day after the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Hungary.

HUR and Ukrainian partisans orchestrated two explosions at a site where Chechen fighters fighting for Russia sold stolen diesel, the military intelligence agency claimed.

Markarova's advisory role will cover topics such as the "business climate, enhancing our state's financial resilience, attracting investment, and planning reconstruction together with our strategic partners," Zelensky said.

The comments come as Zelensky grapples with one of the most politically turbulent moments of his presidency. 

While Ukraine will share its experience and innovations, Norway will provide a "strong production base, as well as research and development cooperation with leading Norwegian institutions," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported intercepting 104 of the 122 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles from occupied Crimea. 

The attack seriously damaged the mooring point two (SMP-2), prompting port authorities to halt all loading operations and order tankers out of the water area.

The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions.

A Russian drone attack killed a man and injured 19 people in the town of Vyshhorod in Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 30, local authorities reported.

Ukrainian officials will meet with Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Florida on Nov. 30. Zelensky said a final agreement could be ready "in the coming days." 

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, resigned from parliament after being accused of helping lure 17 South African men to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine, her party announced on Nov. 29.

The Vancouver Whitecaps know their work is not done. 

The team downed expansion side San Diego FC 3-1 to earn the title of Western Conference champions Saturday. 

Even as they raised the trophy in the air, confetti falling around them, the players were already turning their minds toward their next task: the MLS Cup final against Lionel Messi's Inter Miami on Dec. 6.

“Obviously winning the conference and getting a trophy is nice. And we'll enjoy that,” said striker Brian White. “But the ultimate goal is to win an MLS Cup. And we know how hard that will be in Miami.”

The ‘Caps finished the regular season second in the West with an 18-7-9 record and eliminated FC Dallas and Los Angeles FC before taking on San Diego in Saturday's conference final.

Vancouver was dominant from the outset, with White poking a ball from teammate Andres Cubas into the San Diego goal in the eighth minute. 

The visitors doubled their lead in the 11th off an own goal by 'keeper Pablo Sisniega. 

Emmanuel Sabbi collected a ball from Whitecaps superstar Thomas Muller and launched a shot, but Sisniega turned it away. The rebound popped out to Vancouver's Ali Ahmed, who sent it flying back toward the net, where it pinged in off the netminder. 

Ahmed set up another striker in the second minute of first-half injury time, slicing a ball across the six-yard box to White, who chested it in for his second goal of the night. 

Vancouver took a 3-0 cushion into the locker room. 

San Diego made a trio of changes out of the half in a bid to spark its offence, including bringing Mexican forward Hirving Lozano on for Corey Baird. 

The move paid off in the 60th minute when Lozano lobbed a right-footed shot up and into the Vancouver net from above the penalty area, cutting his team's deficit to 3-1.

San Diego's bid for a comeback took a hit in the 79th minute when Sisniega was sent off after coming up out of the penalty area to challenge attacking midfielder Ryan Gauld. The 'keeper sent Gauld flying and was quickly shown the red card, leaving the home side down a man for the rest of the game.

While the two sides were even in shots across the match at 12-12, Vancouver had the better chances with an 8-4 edge in on-target chances. 

“We played with conviction in the way we wanted to play,” said Whitecaps head coach Jesper Sorensen. “And we played with pace on the ball but still with good movements and with some patience, so we didn't attack too fast. We waited until the openings were there. 

“I think it was a great game from the players.”

The victory marks Vancouver's first MLS conference title. Next week, the club will make its first appearance in the league's championship game. 

The Whitecaps know Saturday's win was a big achievement, Muller said, but the team is staying level-headed. 

“The boys are calm,” he said. “We know that there's one more step to go. And that's a really good feeling, to be with them.”

Vancouver has already faced Miami twice this year, taking a pair of wins to advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final, where the 'Caps ultimately fell to LIGA MX side Cruz Azul. 

Next week's battle at Chase Stadium will feature a matchup of global superstars. Miami has Messi, while Vancouver's Muller is a German soccer legend. 

Despite the big names, the game will be about more than two players, Muller said. 

“It's not about Messi against Thomas Muller. It's about Miami against the Whitecaps,” said the star attacking midfielder. “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me because we are such a good group.”

The Whitecaps have lost just once since Muller joined the team in mid-August. 

“Since August, it's like a Cinderella story. And I try to keep on dancing,” he said.

MINSK, November 30. /TASS/. Minsk seeks to ensure security in Eastern Europe and is ready to build dialogue with NATO countries, said Valery Revenko, head of the Belarusian Defense Ministry's Department for International Military Cooperation and the defense chief's defense cooperation assistant.

"We have accredited a number of NATO member states in Belarus. The number currently stands at ten. We are ready to explain Belarus' positions to them and we are also ready to listen to their positions to reach a consensus in order to ensure security in our region," he told VoyenTV.

According to Revenko, there are many issues between Belarus and the West, including NATO members. "The West sought to make Belarus follow its interests and narratives; it wanted to isolate Belarus and inflict certain economic, political and moral damage on the country," the official noted.

"We clearly don't agree with that. We pursue our own policy, aimed at ensuring good-neighborliness and security in the Eastern European region, which runs counter to the West's views. This entire situation has affected our relations with Western countries, including European Union and NATO nations," Revenko stressed, adding that Minsk still maintained contact with Western countries.

Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner meet Kyiv delegation, after another weekend of deadly Russian attacks in Ukraine

Ukrainian negotiators are meeting with US officials in Florida to thrash out details of Washington's proposed framework to end Russia's war in Ukraine, as Kyiv faces pressure on military and political fronts.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, are sitting down with a Ukrainian delegation on Sunday before planned US talks this week in Moscow with Vladimir Putin.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the national security and defence council in Ukraine, posted a photo of the meeting on X and described it as focusing on “steps toward achieving a just peace”.

Diplomats focused on revisions to a proposed 28-point plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticised as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.

“The end goal, obviously, is not just the end of the war. But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity,” Rubio said in brief remarks.

“This is not just about peace deals,” he added as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach.

Umerov responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for US efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has previously claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for US assistance during the war. “US is supporting us. US is working beside us,” he said.

At least six people were killed and dozens wounded across Ukraine over the weekend. A drone attack on the outskirts of Kyiv on Saturday night had killed one person and wounded 11, the regional governor said.

A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by naval drones on two oil tankers off Turkey's Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil.

The talks will focus on details of a draft framework to end the war, more than three years after Russian forces launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The US has pared back an initial draft after criticism from Kyiv and Europe that it was too favourable towards Russia, but the contents of the latest proposals remain unclear. Witkoff, a New York property developer turned Trump official, is expected to travel to Moscow next week.

The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy, and Witkoff. It called on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato. Washington's original proposal – drafted without input from Ukraine's European allies – would have involved Kyiv's withdrawal from its eastern Donetsk region and the US's de facto recognition of Donetsk, Crimea and Luhansk as Russian.

During negotiations last weekend in Switzerland – led by Rubio and Ukrainian negotiators – the plan was revised substantially. Kyiv and its European partners say the existing frontline has to be the starting point for territorial discussions. They say there can be no recognition of land seized by Russia militarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he expected that the results of recent meetings with the US in Geneva would be “hammered out”.

The US talks come amid turbulence for the Ukrainian government. Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, was forced to resign on Friday after his flat was searched by anti-corruption officials investigating a kickback scheme.

Yermak had been the lead negotiator in talks with the US. Zelenskyy has said the Ukrainian delegation in Florida includes Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, Andrii Sybiha, the foreign minister, and Rustem Umerov, head of the security council.

Ukraine is facing significant pressure from Washington to agree to the terms of a deal while Zelenskyy finds himself in increasing difficulty. Russia is making incremental gains on the frontline and Ukrainian cities suffer hours of blackouts every day due to a rolling bombardment of its power grid.

Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is in one of the most difficult moments in its history, but promised his people in a dramatic address last week that he would not betray the country.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian ambassador to Britain and former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, who is considered a potential challenger for the future presidency, wrote in the Telegraph: “We are in an extremely difficult situation, where a rushed peace will only lead to a devastating defeat and loss of independence.”

He said “effective security guarantees” were essential to any framework.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is to meet Zelenskyy in Paris on Monday. “Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of reconstituting the Soviet empire by first subjugating Ukraine,” the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, told La Tribune Dimanche.

Barrot said: “Vladimir Putin must accept the ceasefire or accept exposing Russia to new sanctions that will exhaust its economy, as well as intensified European support for Ukraine.”

            Heavy rainfall has unleashed widespread flooding and landslides across Asia, killing more than 700 people with hundreds still missing.
    


            Cyclone-fueled downpours battered parts of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia this week when a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait – a narrow waterway separating the Indonesian island of Sumatra from the other two nations.
    


            Sri Lanka was struck by a separate storm from which heavy rains are now approaching India's southern coast.
    


            The severe weather has claimed the lives of at least 435 people in Indonesia, 153 in Sri Lanka, 162 in Thailand and two in Malaysia, officials told the Reuters news agency.
    


            Indonesian rescue teams are struggling to reach the hardest-hit areas of Sumatra, where Cyclone Senyar caused catastrophic landslides and flooding.
    


            At least 435 people have died, government data on Sunday showed, an increase from 303 on Saturday. A further 406 people are reported still missing.
    


            Video footage shows helicopters delivering supplies to the island, renowned for lush rainforests, active volcanoes and a critically endangered orangutan population.
    


            “During the flood, everything was gone,” a resident of Bireuen, in Sumatra's northernmost province Aceh, told Reuters.
    


            “I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.”
    


            Maulidin, a 41-year-old resident of North Aceh, fled her home with her family when she woke to the sound of flooding.
    


            “My house is already destroyed, all my belongings are ruined, and mud is inside,” she told AFP.
    


            Rescuers have been trying to reach residents stranded by the floodwaters since Tuesday when monsoon rains caused rivers to overflow in North Sumatra province.
    


            Local media footage shows people using rubber boats to evacuate those trapped.
    


            On the flood-hit Indonesian island of Sumatra, some residents have turned to stealing food and water in order to survive, according to authorities there.
    


            “The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,” police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said, according to AP. “(Residents) didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.”
    


            Across the strait, at least 162 people have died due to the extreme weather in southern Thailand, government spokesperson Siripong Angkasakulkiat told Reuters on Saturday.
    


            Some 3.5 million people have been affected, with authorities airlifting patients and flying critical supplies, including oxygen tanks, to submerged communities, the outlet said.
    


            Amphorn Kaeophengkro and her family of eight had no time to escape when floodwaters swept into their home in Hat Yai city last Saturday.
    


            Instead, they rushed to the second floor as water levels swelled, eventually spending 48 hours perched atop a table, washing machine and on a window frame.
    


            “We weren't thinking about anything else except surviving,” the 44-year-old told Reuters by candlelight, as her family began to clean their dwelling after the water had receded.
    


            “Sometimes we sat at the edge of the window and had to lift our legs to avoid keeping them too deep in the water.”

            Hat Yai city was Thailand's hardest-hit region, recording the type of heavy rain the occurs once-in-300-years, bringing floodwaters more than eight feet high on Tuesday and cutting off access to a maternity ward holding 30 newborn babies, staff and officials said.
    


            It is not yet clear when power will be restored to the area where agencies have provided evacuations, medical support and essential supplies.
    


            The city is part of Thailand's Songkhla region, where the government declared an emergency on Tuesday due to severe flooding, an official said on X.
    


            Ten tourists, from Australia, Britain, China, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa, were rescued in Songkhla province on Friday, the Ministry of Tourism told CNN.
    


            “The situation has improved significantly. Water levels have almost completely receded, with only some areas remaining flooded,” a spokesperson said.
    


            More than half a million people felt the wrath of Cyclone Ditwah, which triggered mud slides and flooding on Friday, Reuters said.
    


            Over 25,000 homes have been destroyed and 147,000 people have been forced into state-run temporary shelters, AP reported.
    


            Mallika Kumari was among more than 78,000 people moved to relief centers, mostly set up in schools, after her home was quickly submerged, according to the news agency.
    


            “I first heard about the flood warning on TV but we never expected the river to overflow so quickly. We just rushed out of the house without anything,” Kumari told reporters.
    


            “We haven't even had breakfast. Two of my sons have caught the flu. I have to get them medication. I've brought a few garbage bags to collect their clothes.”
    


            In the rush, Kumari left behind her cat, which was later picked up by a navy boat and brought to dry land.

            Some 191 people remain missing in Sri Lanka and most homes in low-lying areas near the capital, Colombo, are under water and without power, authorities told Reuters.
    


            Some residents chose to stay on the upper floors of partially submerged homes to protect their belongings, the outlet said.
    


            Selvi, a 46-year-old resident of Colombo's Wennawatte suburb, fled her home with four bags of clothes and other possessions. “My house is completely flooded. I don't know where to go, but I hope there is some safe shelter where I can take my family,” she told AFP.
    


            At the Dalugala Thakiya Mosque, volunteers prepared rice parcels with chicken and dhal curry for flood victims.
    


            “We are getting more requests for food because people who work daily jobs cannot find work and are running low on savings,” meal organizer Risham Ahmed told Reuters.
    


            “They are worried about how to piece their lives back together.”
    


            In Malaysia, two people were confirmed dead after Senyar, then a tropical storm, made landfall shortly after midnight on Friday, Reuters said.
    


            Around 34,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, but Gon Qasim and her husband were less fortunate, stranded in a field in northern Perlis state last weekend when rising floodwaters cut off their escape.
    


            The elderly couple were eventually rescued by one of their children and brought to an evacuation center in the state capital of Kangar, where hundreds of families sheltered in tents provided by the national disaster management agency, Reuters reported.
    


            “I was inside, and I couldn't go out. When I was out, there was nowhere to stay but the field,” the 73-year-old Gon said told its reporters, recalling her ordeal in an interview on Wednesday.
    


            “The water was like the ocean. That's what it looked like.”
    


            Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change, scientists have warned.
    


            Current extremes of weather in the region could stem from the interaction of two active systems, Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the unusual formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait, meteorologists told Reuters.
    


            Elsewhere in Southeast Asia this month, deadly floods devastated parts of Vietnam, where flooding and landslides killed dozens of people.
    


            Also in the region this month, the Philippines endured two deadly typhoons – Kalmaegi and Fung-wong – in a week, which killed hundreds of people and forced more than 1.4 million to evacuate.
    


            This summer, the region also saw temperatures reach unprecedented levels, with little respite from merciless heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN.

Editor's note: The story was updated with the latest details.

The United States is displaying "a constructive approach" in peace negotiations with Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Nov. 29, as delegates from Kyiv arrived in the U.S.

A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov traveled to the U.S. on Nov. 29 to continue negotiations on the latest U.S.-backed peace plan to end Russia's war against Ukraine. 

The delegates will meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, in Florida on Nov. 30, a U.S. official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. 

Despite earlier speculation that military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov might join the delegation, Ukrainska Pravda's sources reported that Budanov remained in Kyiv, with HUR to be represented at the talks by his deputy, Vadym Skibitskyi.

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to the military agency for comment.

"The American side is demonstrating a constructive approach, and in the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end," Zelensky said. 

The talks will build off the recent negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European representatives worked to revise the original 28-point proposal — a plan that initially demanded sweeping concessions from Kyiv in line with Moscow's maximalist demands. 

The revised version reportedly aligns more closely with Ukraine's position, but a new framework has not been finalized. 

Following the Florida talks, Witkoff is set to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin for separate talks in Moscow. Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House. 

The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have for months been promoting a "peace through business" approach to diplomacy, hoping to tempt Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for bringing Russia's economy out of isolation. 

Ukraine's peace negotiations have also been disrupted by political turmoil at home: Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's top aide and lead negotiator, resigned on Nov. 28 amid a major corruption investigation. 

In comments to the Financial Times (FT) on Nov. 29, Yermak claimed credit for successfully revising the plan in Geneva. 

"The delegation under my leadership in Geneva, together with our American partners, managed to ensure that the 28-point document no longer exists," he told the FT. 

"A few difficult points remain that need to be agreed upon, and I believe that this is possible. In any case, the president — no matter the pressure — will not sign or approve anything that goes against Ukraine's interests."

Russia, meanwhile, has shown little interest in declaring a ceasefire or negotiating peace under the revised Geneva terms. Putin on Nov. 27 demanded that Ukrainian troops withdraw from their current positions as a condition for a ceasefire and said that negotiating with the Ukrainian leadership was "pointless."

Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the latest Washington-backed peace plan on ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers leaked calls showing U.S.-Russia coordination on a controversial peace plan and reports on backlash to Reese Witherspoon's Moscow-set novel. 



According to Bloomberg's sources, Russia and India are expected to discuss the potential purchase of the fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft and the S-500 air defense system.

Nawrocki and Orban were set to meet a day after the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Hungary.

HUR and Ukrainian partisans orchestrated two explosions at a site where Chechen fighters fighting for Russia sold stolen diesel, the military intelligence agency claimed.

Markarova's advisory role will cover topics such as the "business climate, enhancing our state's financial resilience, attracting investment, and planning reconstruction together with our strategic partners," Zelensky said.

The comments come as Zelensky grapples with one of the most politically turbulent moments of his presidency. 

While Ukraine will share its experience and innovations, Norway will provide a "strong production base, as well as research and development cooperation with leading Norwegian institutions," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported intercepting 104 of the 122 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles from occupied Crimea. 

The attack seriously damaged the mooring point two (SMP-2), prompting port authorities to halt all loading operations and order tankers out of the water area.

The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions.

A Russian drone attack killed a man and injured 19 people in the town of Vyshhorod in Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 30, local authorities reported.

Ukrainian officials will meet with Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Florida on Nov. 30. Zelensky said a final agreement could be ready "in the coming days." 

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, resigned from parliament after being accused of helping lure 17 South African men to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine, her party announced on Nov. 29.

ROSTOV-ON-DON, November 30. /TASS/. As many as 128 apartment buildings have been left without heating in Russia's southern Rostov Region after a Ukrainian drone attack on a boiler house, regional Governor Yury Slyusar said.

"A boiler house that provides heating to 128 apartment buildings, two hospitals, four schools and six kindergartens was damaged in the town of Gukovo. Its personnel were evacuated; heating was suspended," he wrote on Telegram.

Repairs will begin after bomb disposal engineers examine the facility.

Novoshakhtinsk, as well as the Chertkovsky and Myasnikovsky districts, also came under attack, the governor added. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 16 drones were intercepted and destroyed over the Rostov Region last night. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Four people have been killed and ten wounded in a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California.

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said a total of 14 people were shot, four of whom were confirmed dead, just before 6pm local time in Stockton, which sits approximately 80 miles east of San Francisco.

The shooting took place at a banquet hall where a family had gathered to celebrate, local media reported.

A spokesman for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said early indications suggest the incident was targeted and that some of the victims were children.

The suspected shooter is still at large, police told local media.

Christina Fugazi, the mayor of Stockton, said “heaven is a little bigger” as she paid tribute to the victims of the deadly shooting.

“This is Thanksgiving weekend. This is when families come together to celebrate, share memories, give each other love. Unfortunately tonight, heaven is a little bigger with the children and adults who did not make it,” Ms Fugazi said during a press conference on Saturday night.

“What happened tonight, again, unacceptable. Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.”

Ms Fugazi said she had spoken on the phone with Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, and that he had offered additional support to city officials and law enforcement.

Mr Newsom's office said he had been briefed on the “horrific” shooting and was monitoring the situation.

Jason Lee, the vice mayor of Stockton, said the outbreak of violence “shakes me deeply”, in a statement released after the incident.

“Violence touched my life as a young person, and seeing our own children, parents and neighbours go through this shakes me deeply. Stockton is my home. These are our families. This is our community,” Mr Lee said.

Josh Harder, the Democratic congressman for Stockton, said he was “devastated” by news of the shooting and was “praying for the victims and their families”.

ASTANA, November 30. /TASS/. The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs has voiced its protest against the attack on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, the ministry's spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov said in a statement.

"The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs protests another targeted attack on the critical infrastructure of the international Caspian Pipeline Consortium in the waters of the Novorossiysk seaport. This incident is the third act of aggression against a purely civilian facility, the operation of which is guaranteed by international law," the statement noted.

The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that Kazakhstan, as a responsible participant in the global energy market, consistently supports the preservation of the stability and security of energy supplies.

"We stress that the CPC plays a significant role in maintaining the stability of the global energy system," the press service explained.

The Foreign Ministry also noted that it views the attack on the CPC infrastructure as an act damaging to Astana's relations with Kiev.

"We view this incident as an act damaging to the bilateral relations between the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future," the statement read.

On November 29, one of the single-point moorings at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's marine terminal near Novorossiysk was attacked by unmanned boats and sustained significant damage. According to the CPC press service, its further operation is impossible.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article contains images and descriptions that some readers may find distsurbing.



            Two human skeletons lie entangled on the rough earth – the arms of one wrapped around the other's head, as though protecting them from danger.
    


            Simply known as numbers 177 and 178, their identities remain a mystery.
    


            They are among 240 human skeletal remains, including children and babies, uncovered at this mass gravesite in Chemmani in Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna district.
    


            “This place is a crime scene no entry,” reads a sign at the entrance.
    


            Numbered white cards placed alongside the bones mark how many skeletons have been found since digging began in May of this year, reviving decades-old allegations of wartime atrocities and cover-ups.
    


            In the heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority, a bloody and brutal history is re-emerging from the soil.
    


            But it is difficult to bury the past entirely.
    


            From 1983 to 2009, the South Asian island nation of 21 million endured a brutal civil war between the Sri Lankan army and the separatist militant group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). More commonly known as The Tamil Tigers, the group was listed as a terrorist organization by many countries including the United States.
    


            The war was fought along ethnic lines, pitting the majority Buddhist Sinhalese state against the predominantly Hindu ethnic minority rebels fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east after years of anti-Tamil violence. The Tigers were ultimately defeated.
    


                    “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”
                


                    Mariranjini Nirmalanathan
                


            Atrocities were committed by both sides, according to the United Nations, which estimates up to 100,000 people were killed in the conflict, with thousands of others forcibly disappeared.
    


            Sixteen years after the war ended, families of the victims and missing are still fighting for justice and accountability.
    


            “One day the truth will come,” said V S Niranjan, a lawyer representing relatives of people who went missing in Jaffna.
    


            Just a stone's throw from a main road, the Chemmani gravesite is one of more than 20 mass graves identified in Sri Lanka.
    


            Many of the gravesites that pockmark the north and east of the country are believed to contain the victims of atrocities committed during the civil war. Caught between warring rebel fighters and the Sri Lankan army, the Tamil community in these regions bore the brunt of the violence.
    


            The military occupied Jaffna from 1995 until the end of the war. Chemmani first gained international attention in 1998 when Sri Lankan soldier former Lance Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse, who was on trial for the rape and murder of schoolgirl Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, confessed that hundreds of Tamils had been buried there after the Sri Lankan army retook Jaffna.
    


                    “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings.”
                


                    Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka
                


            For decades, the mass grave remained hidden until construction workers clearing land in the grounds of a Hindu cemetery in February unearthed human skeletal remains.
    


            Their discovery prompted a court-ordered forensic excavation of the site in May and June, which initially uncovered 19 skeletons.
    


            Since then, the bones of hundreds more people have been found.
    


            A baby's milk bottle, a blue schoolbag, bangles and cloth fragments have been uncovered alongside the bones.
    


            More than 90% of the remains had no form of clothing. The bodies were buried in a disordered way, heaped together in shallow graves of 1.5-2 feet, according to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, an independent national body that investigates violations of fundamental rights.
    


            Tamils, who have lived in the north and east of Sri Lanka for thousands of years, are primarily followers of Hinduism, with a significant Christian minority population, but the commission determined that the fact the bodies were buried naked rules out customary Hindu burials. “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings,” it said.
    


            Teams of archaeologists, crime scene officers, and forensic medicine specialists under the jurisdiction of the Jaffna magistrate were working at the site digging, dusting and storing the remains. As investigators carefully chipped away the earth at one location, the head of a skeleton slowly emerged from the dirt, followed by a torso, arms and the rest of the body.
    


                    “These are very disturbing things.”
                


                    V S Niranjan, lawyer.
                


            Equipped with fine tools, shovels and hammers, they meticulously separated earth and rock from bone, often using their gloved hands to sweep away the dirt.
    


            One small, rectangular block of earth has been cut out of the ground. A tiny spine and rib cage can be made out – the remains of what investigators believe was a baby.
    


            “There are children with a doll we recovered… These are very disturbing things,” said Niranjan, the lawyer who attended the gravesite every day to monitor the excavation on behalf of the families.
    


            Investigators in September appealed to the Jaffna court for a greater area to be mapped and excavated as ground radar suggests additional human remains could be buried there. But by the end of November, work had not restarted.
    


            Amnesty International estimated as many as 100,000 people were “forcibly disappeared” – the secret arrest, imprisonment or abduction of a person with the blessing of state organizations, or rebel groups – in Sri Lanka during the war, and the United Nations Human Rights Office has laid most of the blame on Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups.
    


            CNN sent repeated and detailed requests for comment about the Chemmani gravesite and allegations of wartime abuses to the Sri Lankan army, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice. The army directed CNN to a defense ministry spokesperson who said the matter “is being handled purely by the law enforcement authorities under the supervision of the judiciary.” Sri Lankan Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara said he was not available to comment.
    


            Speaking at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances in Geneva on September 29, Nanayakkara said the Sri Lankan government “believed in securing justice for the victims and finding truth and closure, in line with its commitment with human rights and fundamental freedoms.”
    


            Mothers and widows are leading the charge in Sri Lanka demanding answers.
    


            For more than 30 years they have struggled to find out what happened to their loved ones, pressing the government and authorities through the courts and on the streets.
    


            Previous investigations into other gravesites were not successful in identifying victims, did not lead to prosecutions, or were halted due to lack of funds or political will.
    


            Clutching photos of their missing relatives, hundreds of residents marched in the stifling heat from Jaffna to the Chemmani gravesite on August 30, calling for independent international oversight of the investigation because they don't trust the local justice system to give them answers.
    


            “Where are our children?” the protesters chanted.
    


            Each came with similar stories – a husband, a brother, a son; sometimes a whole family missing, without a trace.
    


            At the protest, Sivapatham Elangkothai dropped to the dusty ground, and in an expression of grief and anger slammed her hand to her head and heart.
    


            “Where are you? I want to see you all, I want you all to come to me,” she cried.
    


            Elangkothai, who helped to organize the protest, held a photo of her daughter, son-in-law and her three young grandchildren, who she hasn't seen in more than 16 years.
    


            Back at her house in Jaffna, she recounted their last months together.
    


                    “When I hear a knock at the door, I think it's my child.”
                


                    Sivapatham Elangkothai
                


            Like many others living in the north and east of Sri Lanka during the war, intense fighting had forced Elangkothai's family to flee their home.
    


            They ended up in Vavuniya, a strategically important district for the Sri Lankan army as a gateway to the largely Tamil-controlled northeast.
    


            In late 2008, Elangkothai's daughter gave birth to her third child – another grandchild for Elangkothai and her husband to dote on.
    


            “We loved them dearly,” she said.
    


            But the family was split between north and south Vavuniya, and when the Sri Lankan army began its final and most bloody assault, they became separated forever.
    


            Elangkothai later learned through family friends that her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren were herded onto a military bus, along with other residents, and taken away by Sri Lankan army soldiers. Her youngest grandchild was just 7 months old at the time.
    


            At her home in Jaffna, surrounded by photos of her family, Elangkothai hugged two saris that belonged to her daughter.
    


            “When I hear a knock at the door, I think it's my child,” she said. “I searched everywhere for them. They aren't to be found.”
    


            Despite filing multiple affidavits and appeals to the government, Elangkothai still does not know what happened to her family.
    


            She now assists the Jaffna branch of the Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances, a civil society group of Tamil families of the disappeared that holds regular protests and pushes for accountability from the state.
    


            “What was our crime? Was it being born a Tamil?” she said.
    


            UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk laid flowers at a vigil demanding justice near the Chemmani mass grave in June.
    


            “Today, an opportunity presents itself for Sri Lanka to break from the past,” said Türk, after he visited the gravesite, and called for “a clear and formal acknowledgment of the violations, abuses and crimes that occurred, including during the civil war.”
    


            Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office last year, has promised to restore trust, investigate crimes and bring justice to victims' families. The government said it would establish a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate wartime abuses in Sri Lanka, and an independent public prosecutor's office.
    


            But the discovery of the Chemmani mass graves has strengthened calls from Tamils for international justice, including referring Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court.
    


            Those calls for an international investigation appeared to have been shut down in September when Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that accountability would be handled “through credible domestic processes” as “external action will only serve to create divisions.”
    


            Herath said investigations into the Chemmani gravesite are being conducted “independent of any government interference” and “the government has and will continue to provide adequate resources for the related processes.”
    


            Over the years, successive Sri Lankan governments have established various state-run commissions of inquiry and investigative bodies, but they have had little success in bringing perpetrators to account.
    


            Families of victims, human rights defenders and international bodies such as the UN have criticized the commissions for a lack of transparency, for being ineffective and ultimately unfit for delivering accountability.
    


            The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was established in 2017 with an explicit mandate to establish the fate of missing persons. It has records of more than 23,000 cases, but has traced just 23 people, a Sri Lankan delegation told the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances on September 29.
    


            The UN human rights office said the OMP's independence had been “undermined” by “appointing members lacking credibility and independence” and it had lost the trust of victim communities.
    


            CNN has reached out to the OMP for comment.
    


            The Sri Lankan delegation told the UN committee that “Sri Lanka had a long-standing practice of investigating complaints of disappearances” and “all investigations of mass graves were carried out with judicial oversight in accordance with legal standards.”
    


            The government was “working on addressing” challenges within the OMP, had allocated additional funding to the body and hoped to “achieve positive results through its investigations and gain public trust,” it added.
    


            Sri Lanka's government “had the political will to investigate cases of enforced disappearance” and was “working to introduce a new system to compensate victims' families,” the delegation said.
    


            Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan is in her 70s and spent her whole life in Jaffna.
    


            She and her husband saved hard to build their dream home but it sat between an army camp and the Jaffna hospital, and as the war intensified around them, they were forced to abandon it, she told CNN.
    


            Her husband did some work for the army as a translator – Nirmalanathan thought it would offer them some protection. But one day in 1990, he didn't return from the army base.
    


            Nirmalanathan said she used to go to the military camp demanding answers from the soldiers. As a lone woman with two young children in tow, she said she feared for her life and that of her sons.
    


            Soldiers would say her husband was working and fine.
    


            Weeks became months, months became years, and her husband never returned home.
    


            Her two boys grew up without a father and carried the trauma of war.
    


            “They saw children their own age die before their eyes,” Nirmalanathan said. “When there was an airstrike, the children would run to the bunkers. That's how they played. We did not teach them. Even while studying, if they saw a plane, they would drop everything and hide.”
    


            She would tell her children that, one day, their father would come home.
    


            But the fighting got worse. She applied for passports for her sons to move away from Sri Lanka – to join the huge exodus of Tamils who fled to Europe, India, Canada and elsewhere during the war.
    


                    “Many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope.”
                


                    Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan
                


            In 2007, tragedy struck again. The morning that her eldest son's passport arrived, he was taken on a motorbike by soldiers.
    


            Her son, 19 at the time, was last seen at a massive army camp near the airport in Jaffna. She has had no word from him since.
    


            Today, she and other women hold a protest every month demanding answers and an international investigation.
    


            Nirmalanathan said she faces harassment from the authorities for her protests. Some nights, between 2 and 4 a.m., she sees and hears security personnel outside her door.
    


            She believes it's an intimidation tactic to stop her galvanizing other family members.
    


            United Nations observers noted in a report released in August “continued patterns of surveillance, intimidation and harassment of families of the disappeared, community leaders, civil society actors, especially those working on accountability for enforced disappearances and other conflict-related crimes.”
    


            Speaking in Geneva in September at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, a Sri Lankan government representative accused freelance Tamil journalist Kumanan Kanapathipillai, one of the authors of this CNN report, of “terrorist activities and financial crime.” Kanapathipillai had previously been brought in for questioning by counter-terrorism police following his reporting on the Chemmani mass graves.
    


            The Committee to Protect Journalists and several other press advocate groups called on the government to end its “harassment” of Kanapathipillai. More than 100 other Sri Lankan organizations and individuals issued a joined statement saying the “ill-founded accusations and persistent harassment are an attempt to silence” Kanapathipillai, and serve as “a warning to other Tamil-speaking journalists and activists” working on historic and continued repression of the Tamil community.
    


            The country's Foreign Minister Herath said the government “will not hesitate to take action on any alleged harassment or intimidation.”
    


            The discovery of the Chemmani gravesite reopened old wounds but also gave many mothers like Nirmalanathan hope that some answers may finally come.
    


            “Today there is a reason why the relatives come and sob. After all these years they strongly believe that (their loved ones) will come home… many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope,” she said.
    


            “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”

LUSAIL, Qatar (AP) — Max Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix on Sunday to send a tense Formula 1 title fight into the season's final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

Championship leader Lando Norris would have clinched his first F1 title with a win but finished in fourth place, with his McLaren teammate and title rival Oscar Piastri placing second. 

All three title contenders have won seven races this season. Verstappen is aiming for a fifth straight F1 title, with Piastri and Norris chasing their first.

“That's a very lovely race,” Verstappen said on team radio after his 70th career win. “Great job everyone.”

Norris can still become the first British driver to win the championship since Lewis Hamilton clinched the last of his seven titles in 2020. But having entered the Qatar GP weekend with a 24-point lead over both his rivals, Norris is now 12 points ahead of Verstappen and 16 clear of Piastri, who dropped to third overall.

“Speechless. I don't know any words,” a dejected-sounding Piastri said. “It is a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.”




Piastri started on pole position ahead of Norris, with Verstappen starting from third.

Although Verstappen overtook Norris heading into Turn 1, Piastri made a clean start and took a comfortable lead early on.

A strategy error cost McLaren after an early safety car prompted a flurry of tire changes, but both McLarens stayed out on track when Verstappen and the others came in.

“Clearly we didn't get it right tonight,” Piastri said. “I think in hindsight, it is pretty obvious what we would have done. I am sure we will discuss it as a team.”

The decision played into Verstappen's hands and the elated Dutchman climbed out of his car and jumped into the arms of his mechanics and engineers after winning.

“This was an incredible race for us, we made the right call as a team to box under that safety car and yeah that was smart,” Verstappen said. “Super happy to win here, we stayed in the fight until the end. Incredible.”

The safety car came out after Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sent spinning off the track on Lap 7 after being clipped by Alpine driver Pierre Gasly.

The decision to stay out on track was questioned over team radio by Norris, in a race where drivers had to take two mandatory pit stops over the 57 laps — a measure imposed on safety grounds due to a high risk of tire degradation at the Lusail International Circuit.

Changing tires behind the safety car constituted the equivalent of a free change, with no time lost. The McLaren team gambled on holding track position, leaving them at risk later on.

Norris seemed calm before the race, standing with his arms folded and looking into the distance. Piastri chatted to McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown moments before getting into his car.

Former England soccer star David Beckham watched the race from the McLaren motorhome, flanked by his former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville.

Because drivers were restricted to a maximum of 25 laps on the Pirelli tires at this race, those who already pitted had to change again on Lap 32.

After the McLarens made their first tire changes, Norris was in fifth place behind Piastri in fourth. That left Verstappen out in front and with several laps to build his lead before having to change tires again.

McLaren pitted Piastri on Lap 43 and Norris soon after, but when Norris came back out on Lap 45 he was fifth with Antonelli and Sainz barring his way.

Desert battles seem to suit Verstappen, who clinched a third straight win in Qatar and has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. Norris may take hope from the fact he won there last year.

But the McLarens head to Abu Dhabi with a hard-charging Verstappen looking to repeat history by clinching a championship in the last race at Abu Dhabi, having done so when he overtook Hamilton on the final lap after a controversial finish in 2021.

“It's possible now but we will see,” said Verstappen, who had written off his chances earlier this season. “I don't really worry about it too much.”

Travelers at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday on Sunday were finding hundreds of flights delayed and canceled in Chicago following a winter storm in the Great Lakes region, while a wintry mix of rain and snow developed in the Northeast.

In Wisconsin, utility crews worked to restore power to thousands of people while the airport in Des Moines, Iowa, reopened by midday on the critical travel day after a Delta Connection flight landing from Detroit slid off an icy runway. No injuries were reported, and passengers were transported to the terminal by bus.

Hundreds of churches in western Michigan told worshippers to stay home or watch services online. Up to 12 inches (about 30 centimeters) of snow has fallen since Saturday in areas close to Lake Michigan.

Over 250 flights into and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had been canceled by about 1 p.m. while over 900 had been delayed, according to the tracking site FlightAware. 

In Wisconsin, We Energies reported more than 6,000 power outages, with more than half in Milwaukee and South Milwaukee. Mark Paladino said on Facebook that he was shoveling snow Sunday when his apartment complex lost power in Fredonia. Others said power lines were sagging under heavy, wet snow. 

Elsewhere in Iowa, gusty winds Sunday were blowing snow back onto roads, extending hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said.

“We did have areas of Iowa and Illinois that saw over one foot of snow,” including 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Fort Dodge, Iowa, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison.




He said snow in the Great Lakes region was tapering off, but a new storm was heading to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with up to a foot of snow by Tuesday.

“It's going to be the first snowfall of the season for many of these areas, and it's going to be rather significant,” Orrison said. “The good news is that it does not look like the major cities at this point are going to be looking at any significant snowfall.”

Live Updates


            • Ukraine talks: Top Trump administration officials are meeting now with a delegation from Kyiv in Florida. Key sticking points remain despite a mounting US effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with a team from Washington expected to visit Moscow later this week.
    


            • Military buildup: President Donald Trump is also maintaining his pressure campaign against Venezuela, which the administration says is aimed at cutting off the flow of drugs from South America. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have expressed alarm about Trump's use of the military in the region as he threatens potential land strikes in Venezuela.
    


            • Immigration crackdown: Trump is doubling down on aggressive anti-immigration policies after last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC. An Afghan national is suspected of carrying out the attack.
    


            Republican Rep. Don Bacon says modifications to the US-proposed plan for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appear to have made it more mindful of Kyiv's interests than the original draft.
    


            “I do think that agreement has shifted a little more back toward the middle,” Bacon said today on ABC's “This Week.”
    


                    “But I would like to see the president be a stronger advocate for the free country, the sovereign country of Ukraine that wants to be a democracy, wants to be allied with us, and have a little more clear idea of who Putin is — that Putin is the invader. He's the dictator.”
                





            Bacon, who has consistently advocated for Ukraine, maintained that he is not seeing “moral clarity coming out of the White House” at the moment.
    


            The Nebraska congressman previously told Axios that the original draft of the plan — which was widely viewed as favorable to Moscow — made him seriously consider resignation.
    


            The comments come as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner hold talks with Ukrainian officials in the Miami area.
    


            While a delegation from Kyiv meets with Trump administration officials in Florida, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been checking in with other allies today, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
    


                    “These are important days, and much can change,” Zelensky said in a social media post about his call with Rutte. “We are coordinating closely, and in our efforts – and in the efforts of all our partners – it is our joint measures and shared positions that will be extremely effective.”
                





            The Ukrainian leader also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen today.
    


            “We have a shared understanding of the key issues. It also matters that Ursula is paying close attention to the need to strengthen our resilience amid Russia's constant strikes on our infrastructure and the energy sector,” Zelensky said.
    


            Moscow launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight Friday into Saturday, killing at least three people and leaving large parts of Kyiv without power, according to Zelensky.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine thinks more senators will join his attempts to limit President Donald Trump's war powers in Central and South America if the president follows through on his threat of military action against Venezuela.
    


            “I do believe the numbers will change,” Kaine said of his resolution with Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and GOP Sen. Rand Paul to block the potential use of US Armed Forces in the South American country without congressional approval.
    


            Kaine said he would force another vote on the legislation “immediately” should there be US military action in Venezuela.
    


            The Virginia Democrat also led a resolution to rein in strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. He said “the circumstances have changed” in terms of gathering support for that motion, citing a report that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on one of the vessels earlier this year after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


What the administration is saying: Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the Trump administration's escalating military and intelligence campaign in the region today, saying in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the US won't temper its fight against “narco-terrorists.”
    


            Asked about a reported classified memo that outlines expanded authorities for operations inside Venezuela, Bondi declined to elaborate.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended President Donald Trump's threat to “permanently pause” migration from some countries to the US, saying the administration's approach is rooted in concerns about national security and vetting failures.
    


            “These Third World countries don't have stable governments,” Noem said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            “Third World countries,” a term used by some to refer to developing nations, has repeatedly been used by Trump as part of his anti-immigration rhetoric.
    


Some background: Trump said in a social media post Thursday that his administration will work to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.”
    


            The post came after the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC. The shooting suspect is an Afghan national who came to the country after working with the CIA in the Middle East.
    


            It wasn't immediately clear which specific countries Trump was referring to.
    


            Asked for details, US Citizenship and Immigration Services pointed CNN to 19 countries “of concern” listed in a June presidential proclamation, including Afghanistan.
    


            While the DC shooting suspect came to the US in 2021 under a relocation program launched by the Biden administration, he was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration, law enforcement officials tell CNN.
    


More from Noem: The DHS secretary argued on NBC that instability in developing nations — and what she described as the inability of those countries to aid in vetting migrants — has created unacceptable risks.
    


            Noem said the Trump administration is also reviewing asylum cases and will deport people with pending claims if it's necessary.
    


CNN's Kaanita Iyer contributed to this post.



            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has kicked off another round of high-level talks with Ukrainian officials today aimed not only at ending the war, but “creating a pathway forward that leaves Ukraine sovereign, independent, and prosperous,” he told reporters.
    


            The top US diplomat, speaking at the start of the meeting outside of Miami, Florida, said the two delegations would be building from progress already made.
    


                    “The end goal is obviously not just the end of the war, obviously, that's central and fundamental,” said Rubio, who was flanked by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
                





            “This is about ending a war in a way that creates a mechanism and a way forward that will allow (Ukraine) to be independent and sovereign, never have another war again, and create tremendous prosperity for its people, not just rebuild the country, but enter an era of extraordinary economic progress in the country,” Rubio said, noting the country has “tremendous economic potential.”
    


            Top Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov told reporters there had been “great progress” and thanked the US negotiating team.
    


                    “We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine. And we are thankful for the efforts of United States and its team to helping us,” Umerov said.
                





For context: The meeting is the second round of high-level talks between the Ukrainian and US delegations in as many weeks. It is the first since Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead Ukrainian negotiator, resigned.
    


            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar rebuked President Donald Trump for a Truth Social post on Thanksgiving that accused Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of entering the United States illegally and mocked her hijab.
    


            Trump's post also referred to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz using a slur that demeans people with disabilities.
    


            “These words shouldn't even be repeated by anyone, much less a president of the United States,” Klobuchar told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            For his part, Walz called attacks by Trump a “badge of honor” this morning in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press,” though he said that as a former educator, he worries about the impact of the president's language on kids.
    


            “We have fought three decades to get this out of our schools. Kids know better than to use it,” Walz said, referring to the slur. “But look, this is what Donald Trump has done. He's normalized this type of hateful behavior and this type of language.”
    


This post has been updated to reflect Walz's remarks.



            The suspect accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House was “radicalized” after arriving in the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today.
    


            Asked about the probe into the suspected shooter on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Noem said investigators are still going through information, adding, “I will say we believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country.”
    


            The suspect, who was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national. Noem said investigators believe he was radicalized within his local community in Bellingham, Washington, though she did not provide any details on what that may have entailed.
    


                    “We do believe it was in his home community and state,” Noem said. “And we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members, to talk to them.”
                





            When pressed on if there was a vetting process in place to approve the asylum request during the Trump administration, Noem said: “the vetting process all happened under Joe Biden's administration.”
    


More on the suspect: According to officials, Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 under a relocation program launched by the Biden administration following the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
    


            He was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration after applying in 2024, multiple law enforcement officials have told CNN.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called President Donald Trump's warning that “seditious” activity is punishable by death — prompted by a video the senator participated in urging service members not to follow illegal orders — “obviously ridiculous.”
    


            Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds published the video reminding members of the military of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting the furious response from Trump and a military review by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
    


            Hegseth should be fired, Kelly told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” this morning.
    


                    “What he is doing is sending a very chilling message across our entire nation, not only in the military, but the civilian workforce,” the Arizona senator said. “Who's going to speak up and say anything if they see something that's unlawful or see something — waste, fraud and abuse.”
                





            Asked by Bash if he has been contacted by the FBI, which has also launched a probe, Kelly said he's received communication that amounts more to “intimidation,” with a request to come in for an interview but no point of contact.
    


            “I'm not backing down. These guys don't scare me. They're not serious people,” he said of Trump and Hegseth.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly says he would not have carried out a reported follow-up strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean had he been given the order.
    


            “It seems to,” Kelly, who served in the Navy for 25 years, told CNN's Dana Bash this morning when asked if that second strike constitutes a war crime.
    


                    “If what has been reported is accurate, I've got serious concerns about anybody in that, you know, chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said on “State of the Union.”
                





            CNN has reported that the US military carried out a second strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


            Pressed on if he would have carried out the order to execute a second strike, Kelly responded, “No, no,” adding, “and I'm a guy who — I have sunk two ships.”
    


More context: Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers published a video recently reminding service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting a furious response from President Donald Trump and an FBI investigation.
    


            The second strike reporting also comes as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Trump has made the regime in Caracas central to his case for the boat strikes and potential other military action in the Caribbean, saying it's all part of an effort to curb the flow of migrants and drugs from South America to the US.
    


            While President Donald Trump's team has heralded “tremendous progress” toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of the negotiations told CNN last week that substantial gaps remain even between the delegations from Washington and Kyiv.
    


            There are at least three crucial areas where significant differences remain, the source said, including the sensitive issue of whether Ukraine would surrender key territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, annexed but not yet conquered by Russia.
    


            Differences also remain over the controversial US proposal for Ukraine to limit the size of its military to 600,000, as outlined in the original draft of Trump's 28-point plan.
    


            That plan also called for Ukraine to renounce its ambition to become a member of NATO, a longtime Kremlin demand that the source told CNN remains unacceptable to the Ukrainian side.
    


Meanwhile, in Moscow: Those three issues — the surrender of annexed territory, the demilitarization of Ukraine and its permanent exclusion from NATO — are Russian President Vladimir Putin's most-cited reasons for waging the war in the first place.
    


            Putin has shown little signal he's ready to offer concessions on those fronts, saying the war will only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.”
    


            That leaves glaring sticking points when a US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Putin later this week, regardless of what happens during today's meetings between the US and Ukraine in Florida.
    


            President Donald Trump will return to the White House later today after spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
    


            His arrival at the White House, along with first lady Melania Trump, is expected around 5:50 p.m. ET.
    


            There have been no shortage of developments on the politics front, however. Here's what else we've been reporting over the weekend:
    


            Top officials in President Donald Trump's administration will meet with a Ukrainian delegation in the Miami area today, a White House official told CNN.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will participate in the talks, the official said.
    


            The Ukrainian side will be led by Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, who Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed following the resignation of his top aide on Friday.
    


How we got here: Today's meetings mark the latest step in a flurry of diplomacy that kicked off this month after a plan put forward by Trump triggered alarm in Kyiv, as the original draft heavily favored Russia.
    


            Ukraine is hoping to build on developments from subsequent meetings in Geneva, where Kyiv and its European allies put forward a counter-proposal. Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation involved in the talks voiced a more upbeat assessment following the Geneva meetings, and Rubio indicated the draft was a “living, breathing document” that was evolving based on their input.
    


Keep in mind: There's no indication yet of Russia's openness to the terms being discussed by the allies.
    


            A US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week.
    


Meanwhile: The talks come after Ukraine said its underwater drones struck two tankers belonging to Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Friday and Saturday. Both tankers sustained critical damage, said a Ukrainian security source, adding that “this will deal a significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.”
    


            Russia launched its largest barrage of drones and missiles in a month across Ukraine, killing at least three people overnight Friday into Saturday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Large parts of the Ukrainian capital were without power yesterday.
    


            Another key storyline we're monitoring for today's coverage involves the Trump administration's military buildup in the Caribbean.
    


            President Donald Trump is keeping up a pressure campaign on Venezuela, days after implying US land strikes on the country could be imminent. He issued a broad directive on social media yesterday, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.
    


                    “Please consider the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela to be closed in its entirety,” he wrote in a Truth Social post.
                





The big picture: This is the latest turn of the wheel in the administration's efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro out of office. Officially, Trump says he is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts.
    


            Venezuela's foreign minister denounced Trump's airspace message, calling it a “colonialist threat” constituting an “extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.”
    


            Trump previously said he's signed off on plans for the CIA to operate inside the South American nation. And the US president designated Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization, a move administration officials argue will give the US expanded military options.
    


Some key context on Trump's latest comment: The US can't close another country's airspace.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration did issue a warning last week to major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for South American flights.
    


            In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week, President Donald Trump has argued he has a mandate to toughen immigration enforcement even further.
    


            The suspect in the attack is an Afghan national who came to the US in 2021 after working with the CIA in the Middle East.
    


Before the shooting: Trump made vows to deport tens of millions of people central to his reelection platform.
    


            Since taking office, he's overseen removal flights, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in major US cities, and an executive order suspending the refugee program, though some in the administration have been frustrated over lagging immigration arrests.
    


In the hours following the shooting: An emboldened Trump painted a picture of a country with millions of “unvetted” migrants. Trump vowed a crackdown to expel them and “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”



In a few days since, we've seen the following:



            • All asylum decisions halted: The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a halt on asylum application decisions, saying it's to ensure that migrants are vetted and screened “to the maximum degree possible.”
    


            • Visas paused: The State Department says it has paused the issuance of visas for travelers with Afghan passports.
    


            • Green cards under review: The US immigration service also announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern,” including Afghanistan.
    


Keep in mind: While Trump makes the case for more stringent checks and limitations on people entering the US, sources tell CNN that the suspect in the National Guard shooting cleared numerous rounds of vetting, including earlier this year when he was approved for permanent asylum in the US by the Trump administration.

Silverfield will come over from the Memphis Tigers where he spent six years. He took the Memphis job before the 2020 season and led the Tigers to four bowl games, all of which he won.

The Tigers didn't have a great year, but managed to win eight games and reach as high as 22nd in The Associated Press top 25 poll. He also guided the Tigers to two 10-win seasons – the most since Mike Norvell was the head coach of Memphis.

He will be in charge of trying to revitalize the Razorbacks.

AUBURN HIRES ALEX GOLESH AS NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH

Arkansas fired Sam Pittman after five games this season. The team replaced him with Bobby Petrino, but the Razorbacks didn't win a game with him. Pittman was with Arkansas from 2020 to 2025. He had the school as high as eighth in the AP poll in 2021 as they finished with nine wins. But the team dropped off from there.

The Razorbacks have not won at least 10 games since 2011 under Petrino. But his tenure at Arkansas ended in scandal.

Netanyahu comments on request for pardon during his ongoing corruption trial

People on the streets of Jerusalem reacted on Sunday to news that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked the president for a pardon during his ongoing corruption trial. (AP video shot by: Shlomo Mor)

TEL AVIV (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Netanyahu, who has been at war against Israel's legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous change in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from opponents, who said a pardon would weaken democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he's above the rule of law.

Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President, the prime minister's office said in a statement. The president's office called it an “extraordinary request,” carrying with it “significant implications.”

Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He hasn't been convicted of anything.

Netanyahu rejects the allegations and has described the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.




His request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Trump also sent a letter to President Isaac Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Herzog is a former political rival of Netanyahu, but the men have a good working relationship. Later Sunday, Israeli media reported a small protest outside Herzog's home, including a pile of bananas with a sign saying a pardon equals a banana republic.

In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead.

“The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,” he said.

Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year. But the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents: a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the Justice Ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the legal adviser at the president's office, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.

Legal experts say the pardon request isn't able to stop the trial.

“It's impossible,” said Emi Palmor, former director-general of the Justice Ministry.

“You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,” she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said.

In rare cases, the system could pardon Netanyahu. Experts say the president has broad discretion to grant one, and oversight is limited.

However, “as a rule, the president reviews a pardon request only after all legal proceedings have ended. The possibility of a preconviction pardon ... is extremely rare,” the Israel Democracy Institute wrote earlier this month. “A pardon before conviction, while legal proceedings are ongoing, threatens the rule of law and seriously undermines the principle of equality before the law.”

In 2008, as opposition leader, Netanyahu called on then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down as he faced a growing corruption scandal. At the time, Netanyahu said that a prime minister “up to his neck” in scandal did not have a mandate to lead the country, and there was a risk that Olmert would make decisions that served his personal interests and not those of the nation. 

Olmert resigned even before he was indicted that year and would later serve 16 months in prison.

Netanyahu has struck a different, defiant tone since his own legal problems began. He has portrayed himself as the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy trying to oust him from office.

Shortly after forming his current government in late 2022, Netanyahu launched a plan to overhaul Israel's justice system.

Netanyahu presented the plan as a much-needed reform. But his opponents accused him of trying to weaken the justice system, damaging the country's system of checks and balances and having a conflict of interest at a time when he was on trial.

The plan triggered large street protests against the government, and critics have said the deep divisions sent a message of weakness to Israel's enemies that encouraged Hamas to launch its 2023 attacks.

Netanyahu's request also sparked backlash on Sunday, with an immediate response from the opposition and advocacy groups urging the president not to give in to his request.

“You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel said that granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offenses of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law.

But some Israelis expressed support for Netanyahu's request. 

“Bibi Netanyahu did totally the right thing requesting the pardon,” said Lior Gal, a Jerusalem resident, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “He deserves to be pardoned. This chapter should be over and to remain united people and carry on.”

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Auburn hired South Florida's Alex Golesh as its next coach on Sunday, counting on him to revitalize an offense that has ranked in the bottom half of the Southeastern Conference each of the last six years.

The 41-year-old Golesh, who was born in Russia and moved to the United State at age 7, is signing a six-year contract that averages more than $7 million annually to replace Hugh Freeze. Freeze was fired in early November after failing to fix Auburn's offensive issues in three seasons on the Plains. Freeze lost 12 of his last 15 SEC games.

Golesh went 23-15 in three seasons with the Bulls, a tenure that culminated with USF ranking second in the country in total offense (501.7 yards a game) and fourth in scoring (43 points a game).

“He has produced wins and record-setting results throughout his entire career, including over the last three seasons at USF,” Auburn athletic director John Cohen said. “Alex is known nationally for his player development prowess, ability to shape creative and explosive offenses, and his relentless approach to building winning programs.

“In our conversations, he showed the determination and edge that this program demands of its head coach.”

Golesh becomes Auburn's fourth football coach in seven seasons. The Tigers fired Gus Malzahn in 2020, Brysan Harsin in 2022 and now Freeze in 2025. Together, the school will end up paying $52.5 million in buyout fees.

Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll.

The Tigers owe Freeze $15.8 million, with no mitigation, from a six-year, $39 million deal he signed to replace Harsin in 2022. Freeze got the boot at 15-19 overall and 6-16 in the conference. The last five losses included more offensive woes.




Golesh could be the answer. His Bulls upset Boise State and Florida — both ranked — in September and lost road games at Memphis and Navy by three points each to miss out on the American Conference championship game and a potential berth in the College Football Playoff.

He previously worked as Josh Heupel's offensive coordinator at UCF (2020) and Tennessee (2021-22) before taking over at USF, and he implements an up-tempo style that can be taxing on defenses.

His offenses have consistently been among the nation's most productive and highest scoring, averaging more than 35 points and 450 yards during his time with the Bulls. USF ranks in the top 25 of 20 national statistical categories, including 11 offensive, seven defensive and two special teams statistics.

“Auburn Football is one of the proudest, most tradition-rich programs in all of college football and my family and I could not be more excited to join the Auburn Family,” Golesh said. “This will be a player-driven program, and no one will outwork our staff.

“Auburn has won, can win and will win championships. Let's get to work.”

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are expected to launch a monthslong immigration crackdown on Monday in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi dubbed “Swamp Sweep.” 

The deployment, which aims to arrest 5,000 people, is centered in liberal New Orleans and is the latest federal immigration enforcement operation to target a Democratic-run city as President Donald Trump's administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign.

Many in the greater New Orleans area, particularly in Latino communities, have been on edge since the planned operations were reported earlier this month, even as Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

Here's what to know about “Swamp Sweep.”

Bovino has become the Trump administration's go-to operative for leading large-scale, high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns. During his operation in Chicago, federal agents rappelled from a helicopter into a residential apartment complex and fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters.

Federal agents arrested more than 3,200 immigrants during a surge in the Chicago area in recent months, but have not provided many details. Court documents on roughly 600 recent arrests showed that only a handful had criminal records representing a “high public safety risk,” according to federal government data.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Border Patrol, which does not typically operate in dense urban areas or in situations with protesters, has been accused of heavy-handed tactics, prompting several lawsuits. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Chicago accused Bovino of lying and rebuked him for deploying chemical irritants against protesters.




Bovino has doubled down on the efficacy of his agency's operations.

“We're finding and arresting illegal aliens, making these communities safer for the Americans who live there,” he said in a post on X.

The Department of Justice has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement and included it on a list of 18 so-called sanctuary cities. The city's jail, which has been under longstanding oversight from a federal judge, does not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under most circumstances, and its police department views immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction.

However, Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature has passed laws to compel New Orleans agencies to align with the Trump administration's hard-line immigration stance. 

One such law makes it a crime to “knowingly” do something intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. Anyone who violates the law could face fines and up to a year of jail time.

Additionally, lawmakers expanded the crime of malfeasance in office, which is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, for government officials who refuse to comply with requests from agencies like ICE. It also prohibits police and judges from releasing from their custody anyone who “illegally entered or unlawfully remained” in the U.S. without providing advance notice to ICE.

In and around New Orleans, some immigration lawyers say they have been inundated with calls from people trying to prepare for the upcoming operation. One immigration lawyer, Miguel Elias, says his firm is conducting many consultations virtually or by telephone because people are too afraid to come in person.

He likens the steps many in the immigrant community are taking to what people do to prepare for a hurricane — hunker down or evacuate. Families are stocking up on groceries and making arrangements for friends to take their children to school to limit how frequently they leave the house, he said.

In the days leading up to Border Patrol's planned operations, businesses have posted signs barring federal agents from entry and grassroots advocacy groups have offered rights-related trainings and workshops on documenting the planned crackdown.

While New Orleans is famous for its blend of cultures, only around 6.7% of its population of nearly 400,000 is foreign-born, though that rises to almost 10% in neighboring metro areas. That's still well below the national average of 14.3%, according to U.S. census data.

The city's Hispanic population ballooned during rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now makes up around 14% of the population, according to census data compiled by New Orleans-based Data Center.

The Pew Research Center estimates 110,000 immigrants who lack permanent legal status were living in Louisiana as of 2023, comprising approximately 2.4% of the state's population. Most of them are from Honduras.

Amanda Toups, who owns local restaurant Toups Meatery and runs a nonprofit to help feed neighbors in need, said she expects the federal operations to negatively impact the city's tourism-dependent economy, which supports the rest of Louisiana.

“If you're scaring off even 5% of tourism, that's devastating,” she said. “You're brown and walking around in town somewhere and you could get tackled by ICE and you're an American citizen? Does that make you want to travel to New Orleans?”

Employees with the Minnesota Department of Human Services accused Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) of creating a “cascade of systemic failures” that led to statewide fraud.

A report from the New York Times prompted a response from the agency regarding the fraudulent cases of Somali residents in Minnesota enrolling in nonexistent services through nonexistent companies. Employees with Minnesota DHS thanked the New York Times for its reporting.

“Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota. We let Tim Walz know of fraud early on, hoping for a partnership in stopping fraud but no, we got the opposite response. Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression, and did his best to discredit fraud reports,” Minnesota DHS employees wrote on X on Saturday.

“This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz. Agency leaders appointed by Tim Walz willfully disregarded rules and laws to keep fraud reports quiet – even to the extent of threatening families of whistleblowers,” the post added. “These same leaders are not qualified for their jobs, instead getting leadership jobs via Tim Walz's friendship so state government were left floundering.”

According to the agency, there are many who should be “held responsible for their role” in the scheme but haven't faced consequences, naming DHS temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi, former DHS Commissioner Jodi Harpstead, DHS compliance officer Jess Geil, Assistant Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services Natasha Merz, and former DHS Assistant Commissioner for Homelessness Eric Grumdahl. Harpstead notably resigned from her position in January, while Grumdahl was fired in September.

“Fundamentally, Tim Walz is dishonest, lacks ethics and integrity, has poor leadership abilities, and has never taken any accountability for his role in fraud,” the employees wrote. “Fact is, Minnesota never had a surplus, we had been given federal ARPA funds that were conflated as surplus money otherwise, we'd be in a deficit. And those ARPA funds, which were meant to be temporary funds were used to create more leadership positions for Tim Walz ‘buddies.'”

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump ended the temporary protected status for Somali residents in Minnesota. Trump alleged “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.”

TIM WALZ RESPONDS TO JAB FROM TRUMP WITH CALL TO ‘RELEASE THE MRI RESULTS'

While Walz was quick to respond to Trump name-calling him in a Truth Social post this week that was unrelated to the fraud, Walz has not commented publicly on the matter as it circulated in media reports for over a week.

The Washington Examiner has reached out to Walz for comment.

The Afghan man accused of shooting two National Guard members blocks from the White House had been unraveling for years, unable to hold a job and flipping between long, lightless stretches of isolation and taking sudden weekslong cross-country drives. Rahmanullah Lakanwal's behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.

Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal mounting warnings about the asylum-seeker whose erratic conduct raised alarms long before the attack that jolted the nation's capital on Wednesday, the eve of Thanksgiving. The previously unreported concerns offer the clearest picture yet of how he was struggling in his new life in the United States.

Even so, when the community member who works with Afghan families in Washington state saw on the news that Lakanwal was named as the suspect in the attack, they said they were stunned, unable to square the violence with the memory of seeing Lakanwal play with his young sons. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to share undisclosed details while cooperating with the FBI in its investigation. 

West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in the shooting, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically wounded. Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with first-degree murder.

In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as a Zero Unit. The units were backed by the CIA. He entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the American withdrawal. Many had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats.




As investigators work to determine a motive, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press” that officials “believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country. We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members.” She offered no additional information to support her statement.

Lakanwal resettled with his wife and their five sons, all under the age of 12, in Bellingham, Washington, but struggled, according to the community member, who shared emails that had been sent to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit group that provides services to refugees.

“Rahmanullah has not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023. He quit his job that month, and his behavior has changed greatly,” the person wrote in a January 2024 email.

The emails described a man who was struggling to assimilate, unable to hold a steady job or commit to his English courses while he alternated between “periods of dark isolation and reckless travel.” Sometimes, he spent weeks in his “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids.” At one point in 2023, the family faced eviction after months of not paying rent.

The community member, in an interview, spoke of becoming worried that Lakanwal was so depressed that he would end up harming himself. But the community member did not see any indication that Lakanwal would commit violence against another person. 

Lakanwal's family members often resorted to sending his toddler sons into his room to bring him the phone or messages because he would not respond to anyone else, one email stated. A couple of times, when his wife left him with the kids for a week to travel to visit relatives, the children would not be bathed, their clothes would not be changed, and they would not eat well. Their school raised concerns about the situation.

But then, there were “interim” weeks where Lakanwal would try to make amends and “do the right things,” according to the email, reengaging with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services as was mandated by the terms of his entry into the U.S. 

“But that has quickly evolved into ‘manic' episodes for one or two weeks at a time, where he will take off in the family car, and drive nonstop,” the email outlined. Once, he went to Chicago, and another time, to Arizona. 

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, said this past week that Lakanwal drove across the country from Bellingham, which is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, to the nation's capital.

In response to the two emails, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants or USCRI, visited Bellingham a few weeks later in March 2024 and attempted to make contact with Lakanwal and his family, according to the community member, who, after not receiving any updates, was left with the impression that Lakanwal refused their assistance. 

A request for comment and clarification from USCRI was not immediately returned.

            Pope Leo XIV touched down in Lebanon's capital Beirut on Sunday with the hope of being a “messenger of peace” as he began a three-day visit to the nation at the heart of a Middle East battered by recent conflicts, just days after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut.
    


            Standing below a message that read “Blessed Are The Peacemakers” at the presidential palace in Baabda, Leo urged people to remain in Lebanon amid an “exodus of young people and families seeking a future elsewhere” due to “uncertainty, violence, poverty and many other threats.”
    


            “We must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable,” he said in his address to the country's authorities and civil society.
    


            Peace knows “no fear in the face of apparent defeat” and is not “daunted by disappointment,” Leo said. “It takes tenacity to build peace. It takes perseverance to protect and nurture life.”
    


            Leo's visit will offer support to Lebanon's sizeable Christian minority, which has ancient roots in the country. The pontiff is due to meet political leaders and young people, take part in an inter-religious gathering and celebrate mass on the Beirut waterfront as part of the second leg of his first foreign trip since his election in May.
    


            Large crowds, some holding Lebanese and Vatican flags, lined the streets to welcome the first American pontiff to the presidential palace. More spectators gathered inside palace grounds in the hopes of spotting the pope, donning plastic raincoats under a gray sky.
    


            Leo's calls for dialogue and unity come at a time of heightened tensions in the region and days after the Israeli strike last week on southern Beirut.
    


            The strike, which targeted Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai, killed five people and injured 28, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.
    


            Moments before arriving in Beirut, Leo told reporters aboard the papal plane that he had come to Lebanon and Turkey – the first port of call on his international trip – as a “messenger” to “promote peace throughout the region.”
    


            He also reiterated the Holy See's support for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, saying it is the only way to offer a “solution to the conflict they continually live.”
    


            “We seek with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help to draw close to a solution with justice for all,” Leo said in the first in-flight press conference of his papacy.
    


            One stop on Leo's tour will be the Monastery of Mar Maroun, or Saint Maroun, in the town of Annaya, high in the Lebanese mountains. There, he is expected to pray at the tomb of Charbel Makhlouf, a monk known for bringing people of different faiths together.
    


            Lebanon has 18 officially recognized faiths and sects – including 12 Christian communities – with Shia Muslims now Lebanon's single largest sect. Leo is due to have private meetings with Christian leaders, as well as with Muslim and Druze leaders.
    


            On Tuesday, the final day of his visit, Leo will pray at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which left more than 200 people dead and injured at least 6,000 others. He will then depart for Italy's capital Rome.
    


            Earlier this week, while condemning the use of religion for justifying “war,” Leo urged Catholics to mobilize their faith and unify others “regardless of ethnicity, nationality, religion or personal perspectives.”
    


            “We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism,” Leo reflected.
    


            Leo's trip comes at a tense time, one year after an uneasy truce was established between Israel and Hezbollah through US mediation.
    


            The Vatican has long been engaged in diplomacy in the Middle East, and in 2021 the late Pope Francis hosted Lebanese Christian leaders in the Vatican to address the country's political crisis. The last papal visit to Lebanon took place in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.

One of humanity's biggest achievements may be slipping away.

Thanksgiving is traditionally a good time to start counting your blessings. And for years, hundreds of millions of people have had this to be thankful for: they live in a time that has made historic progress against the scourge of extreme poverty.

Between 1990 and today, the number of people living in extreme poverty — meaning on the equivalent of $3 or less per day in US purchasing power — fell from 2.3 billion to around 800 million, even as the global population nearly doubled. To put it another way, each day over the past 35 years, an average of 115,000 people escaped from extreme poverty. Through financial recessions and technological revolutions, through wars and climate change, even through pandemics, this fundamental progress continued. It was the ultimate good news story.

And now it may be ending.

That's the dire conclusion of a recent post by Max Roser, founder of the website Our World in Data. While Roser projects that the number of people in extreme poverty will decline by about 40 million over the next five years, he writes that “after 2030, the number of extremely poor people is expected to increase.”

If that projection holds, it would mark the end of one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. And it wouldn't be because the tools that worked for decades mysteriously stopped working. It would, in a way, be precisely because of the success of those tools.

The last few decades of astonishing global progress were propelled above all by growth.

In the 1990s and 2000s, hundreds of millions of people in China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and other rapidly developing countries rose above the extreme poverty line because their economies were growing at extraordinary speed. And because most of the planet's poorest people lived in these countries at that time, they were able to experience explosive gains in income, infrastructure, education, and health.

Today, however, the majority of people living in extreme poverty are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and in fragile and conflict-affected states — places where economic growth has been weak, volatile, or nonexistent for decades. This means the remaining pockets of extreme poverty are concentrated in places where our usual engines of progress barely turn over at all.

Madagascar — where my Vox colleague Benji Jones just returned from — is Roser's example of a country stuck in this trap: GDP per capita today is roughly what it was in the 1950s, even as its population has grown by 700 percent.

When an economy doesn't grow but its population does, the math is brutal. More children are born into extreme poverty, and the total number of people living in deprivation stays flat or rises. And the problem will become more challenging in the future, as much of the world's population growth is projected to be in countries mired in extreme poverty.

Layer on conflict and the situation becomes even more intractable. By 2030, the World Bank estimates that nearly 60 percent of the world's extreme poor will live in conflict-affected economies. A civil war can wipe out a decade of economic progress. Climate shocks can do the same. When drought, flooding, or crop failure hits a region where people already live one bad break away from destitution, millions can fall back below the poverty line overnight.

Roser acknowledges that his projections are not prophecy. Change the growth pattern — through better governance, fewer conflicts, more investment, cheap clean energy, or even dramatically expanded migration opportunities — and the projections change with them. The future of extreme poverty depends on whether the countries where the poorest people live can finally begin to grow.

Keeping this progress going will be harder, but we shouldn't mistake “harder” for “hopeless.” The gains of the last 35 years might feel like a miracle, but they were the result of specific choices, investments, and reforms that helped billions of people build better lives.

The challenge now is to extend that success to the places that were left behind. If we can do that, the age of progress against extreme poverty doesn't have to end. If we can't, then this past Thanksgiving might be one of the last moments when we can look at the global numbers and confidently call them a blessing.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — English phrases once bothered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro so much that he urged his State of the Union address audience to phase out words like skatepark and fashion. 

But as the White House now ponders whether the U.S. military should strike Venezuela, Maduro is embracing English, singing John Lennon's Imagine, advocating for peace and dancing to a remix of his latest English catchphrase, “No War, Yes Peace.” 

While his turnaround is seen as a sign of desperation by supporters of Venezuela's political opposition, whose leaders have repeatedly told their backers in Washington that the threat of military action would crack Maduro's inner circle, months of pressure have yet to produce defections or a government transition. 

Behind this knack for staying in power is a system that punishes disloyal associates harshly and allows loyal ministers, justices, military leaders and other officials to enrich themselves.

“The Bolivarian Revolution possesses a remarkable ability: the capacity for cohesion in the face of external pressure,” Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuela Observatory in Colombia's Universidad del Rosario, said referring to the political movement, also known as Chavismo, that Maduro inherited from the late President Hugo Chávez. “When pressure comes from abroad, they manage to unite, defend and protect themselves.”

Underpinning the loyalty-or-punishment principle are corruption networks blessed by Chávez and Maduro that give the loyal permission to get richer. The policy has vexed previous efforts to unseat Maduro and has helped him and his close associates to skirt economic sanctions, obtain U.S. presidential pardons and claim an electoral victory they resoundingly lost.




Rodríguez explained that prison and torture can be part of the punishment, which is usually harsher for accused wrongdoers with military affiliation. The strategy has been crucial for an authoritarian Maduro to keep control of the military, which he lets traffic drugs, oil, wildlife and myriad goods in exchange for coup-proof barracks.

“This has been a very effective tool because Chavismo has always been able to eliminate those actors who at some point try to rise up, and it has been able to expose corrupt practices from all sorts of actors,” Rodríguez said.

Venezuela's political opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, had banked on the military's support to dislodge Maduro after credible evidence showed that he lost the 2024 presidential election. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López and other military leaders stood by Maduro, just like they did in 2019 during a barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized at the time by the first Trump administration as Venezuela's rightful leader.

Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has increased the pressure on Maduro and his allies, including by doubling to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest on narcoterrorism charges. A 2020 indictment accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. State Department on Monday designated as a foreign terrorist organization. 

Maduro denies the accusations. 

On Saturday, Trump said that the airspace “above and surrounding” the South American country should be considered as “closed in its entirety.” Maduro's government responded by accusing Trump of making a ”colonial threat,” rallying supporters behind what it called an assault on national sovereignty.

In early September, the U.S. military began blowing up boats that the Trump administration has accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people. 

Many, including Maduro himself, see the U.S. military moves as an effort to end Chavismo's hold on power. The opposition only added to this perception by reigniting its promise to remove Maduro from office.

Two weeks after the first boat strike, Chavismo's loyalty was tested directly when Maduro's pilot rebuffed efforts from the U.S. to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into custody to face the charges.

“We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Bitner Villegas, a member of the elite presidential honor guard, wrote to a retired U.S. officer trying to recruit him. “The last thing we are is traitors.” 

On Tuesday, ruling party supporters marched in Caracas to demonstrate what they described as the “anti-imperialist spirit” of Chavismo. The march ended in a ceremony in which Maduro raised a jeweled sword that belonged to South American independence hero Simón Bolívar and guided attendees, including Cabinet ministers, to swear in God's name to defend peace and freedom.

Susan Shirk, a research professor at the University of California, San Diego, said authoritarian leaders have a “fetish for unity” and like public displays of loyalty to prevent splits among leadership and social upheaval. She explained that division can lead people to believe that the risk of protesting has lessened. 

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the designation of Cartel de los Soles provides Trump with additional options for dealing with Maduro. Hegseth hasn't provided details on those options, but administration officials have signaled that they have trouble seeing a situation in which Maduro is still in power as an acceptable endgame.

David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for more than three decades, said that only people who don't understand Chavismo would think that a show of force will cause a government change.

“This is exactly the type of thing that unifies them,” Smilde said of the deployment of U.S. military forces. “They also talk about the $50 million reward, but what military officer in their right mind would trust the U.S. government? And more broadly, if the whole premise of the operation is that the Venezuelan armed forces are a drug cartel, what motivation could they possibly have to turn on Maduro and participate in regime change?”

Maduro's entire presidency has been marked by a political, social and economic crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than 7.7 million people to migrate. The crisis has also caused support for the ruling party to plummet across the country.

With loyalty keeping his inner circle intact despite mounting U.S. pressure, Maduro has also sought to maintain his diminished base through the long-established practices that include organizing marches in the capital.

Zenaida Quintero, a school porter, has seen the country come undone under Maduro's watch, with vivid memories of the severe food shortages that Venezuelans experienced in the late 2010s. Her support for Maduro, however, hasn't wavered, and her commitment comes down to one fact: He was handpicked by Chávez to lead the Bolivarian Revolution.

Quintero, 60, said that Maduro, like Chávez, won't abandon his supporters.

“I trust him,” Quintero said of Maduro. “We have to remain united. We have to defend ourselves.”

            As the final hues of autumn linger in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the 200-person community of Churchville, Virginia, is grappling with the loss of its health clinic.



            Gone are the days of seniors walking down the road from their house to see the town doctor. 



            Augusta Medical Group cited the health care provisions in President Donald Trump's signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for closing the rural clinics in Churchville and two other locations.
    


            “I've called around trying to find a replacement, a new doctor, and for just a well-being appointment, the soonest is the end of January,” said Teresa Leach, 56, in an interview while sipping her coffee at the MTN. Mystic shop just a few feet from the shuttered clinic. Leach, who has asthma, said she voted for Trump last year.
    


            Democrats are hoping to make health care a defining issue nationally in next year's midterms. But the environment in Churchville illustrates the challenges the party faces, particularly in rural communities.
    


            Trump carried Augusta County, which includes Churchville, by nearly 50 points in 2024. Jena Crisler, a physician, ran to represent the area in the Virginia House of Delegates and lost this month to the Republican incumbent by more than 40 points even in a Democratic statewide sweep.
    


            A woman sitting in the same coffee shop whispered under her breath that she supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. It takes her over an hour to visit her doctors in Charlottesville. Rural health care is always precarious, she says, and the clinic closure was especially a blow for her husband.
    


            But she said she wouldn't put up a sign for a Democrat “because of the environment,” and she declined to be named by CNN.
    


            Across the street from the coffee shop, a sign in the window of a storefront reads, “Thank you, Trump, Save America Again.”
    


            Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, primarily by instituting work requirements and more eligibility checks.
    


Here's how Trump's megabill will affect you



            Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural Ground Game, a group focused on driving up Democratic participation in rural areas, says Democrats will continue highlighting the significance of accessible health care through town hall-style events and canvassing, trying to win back credibility and trust in rural America.
    


            “I think people have an interest in having real conversations about what's going on with their lives, and there's really nothing that can replace that person to person at your doorstep conversation,” Thorne said.
    


            Crisler knew she faced long odds when she took on incumbent Delegate Chris Runion in the state's 35th district. She suggests her race was less about the outcome and more about the need for Democrats to show up everywhere instead of simply surrendering communities where they're outnumbered.
    


            “I think they are very concerned, and they're going to be even more when it starts hitting them personally,” said Crisler of the clinic closures.
    


            A spokesperson for Runion said he was not available for comment.
    


            CNN has reached out to US Rep. Ben Cline, a Republican who represents the area in Washington and voted for the Trump policy bill. His office did not respond.
    


            Pediatrician Mark Downey defeated incumbent Republican Chad Green in the state's 69th district, which includes Newport News, York, James City and Gloucester counties. In an interview with CNN, he said it's important Democrats continue to run on health care even if the message does not immediately resonate with voters.
    


            “It may not happen overnight. People's minds don't change right away, but when they start seeing loss of access, loss of services, eventually there's going to be a situation where it's not going to be as convenient for them or more of a hardship for them,” said Downey, who had made two previous unsuccessful tries for the state legislature.
    


            Irene Holmes, 59, moved to Churchville three years ago. When her son died, she and her husband wanted a change of scenery from New York. Beset with a host of medical challenges from liver issues to high blood pressure, she relied on and valued the town clinic.
    


            “I'm a mixed bag of tricks, a lot of medical issues,” she said.
    


            On politics, she tends to “keep her mouth shut” to avoid getting into it with her neighbors. But when asked if Trump was to blame for the clinic closure, Holmes said, “Absolutely.”
    


            “What he's done is destroying rural areas,” said Holmes.
    


            Dale White, a Churchville resident and church administrator, says the concerns about the clinic are overblown.
    


            “These are old-time rural farming folks, and they've been going to get medical care in Staunton and Fishersville, Waynesboro and Charlottesville since they can remember,” said White.
    


            Back at the MTN. Mystic coffeehouse, shop owner Dane Buse suggests now is the time for rural communities to get creative.
    


            “To lose the clinic is the same as losing a grocery store or a local provider,” Buse said.
    


            He suggested the community could band together to find a doctor to make house calls.
    


            “Maybe that would fit the bill for us,” Buse said.

The reality star called the case against him a "trophy prosecution," making it clear there is no money missing.

Steve McBee Sr. is preparing to begin his two-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme involving crop insurance.

In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, the 52-year-old reality star shared how he reacted to learning he would be going to prison, saying, "It was a sobering moment."

He explained that when he first heard about the investigation, he "really wasn't overly concerned," because, as a business owner for more than 33 years, he had "gone through every audit under the sun." He thought it was just like any other audit, and after they got the necessary information, "it'll go away like the rest of them."

However, after a meeting with his lawyer, he came to understand that this time was different.

"I went down there and the government basically just gave us kind of a BAFO – best and final offer," he said. "We have 48 hours. He said this is their bullying technique, kind of the poker game here. And then, basically what they said was, OK, you as an individual can plead guilty and, just for clarification, you can plead to one count of giving a fraudulent statement to crop insurance. If you don't do that as an individual, Steve A. McBee, in turn, we're going to charge one of my teammates, one of my co-workers, with 27 federal indictments in 48 hours."

He called what they did a "bullying technique," saying both he and his teammates "had nothing to do with it." He said, "When I looked at them charging some of my fellow co-workers," he couldn't let them take the blame, adding that as the owner of the company, "I made the decision the buck stops with me," so he took the responsibility.

McBee was sentenced to two years at the Federal Prison Camp in Yankton, South Dakota, and during a sentencing hearing on Oct. 16, was also ordered to an additional two years of supervised release once he completes his prison sentence. He will also have to pay $4,022,124 in restitution to the USDA Risk Management Agency.

"I wanna make absolute, with absolute clarity, that people understand, there's no money missing," he said. "When you farm like over 10,000 acres, which we farmed 44,000 acres, three states, in 2020, 923 different fields, they do a post-planting audit, a pre-harvest, and a post-harvest audit. They know what grain we have. They've been all over every field."

"They found a plant date that was half wrong. We were there on May 20. We planted half the field. We didn't go back till like June 19," he added. "And they basically said, your entire crop insurance is null and void because of a half wrong plant date. I mean, I'm like, this can't be real. That's day-to-day common business."

McBee went on to call the case against him a "trophy prosecution," adding that the business has been greatly impacted by the two-year prison sentence, explaining he's lost over $20 million in loans. "I had to pay all them off, had to sell a bunch of land. I mean it goes on and on," he said.

In addition to the monetary loss, McBee said his reputation has also been "destroyed," with people now thinking he earned all his money by defrauding the government, and not through "33 years of working seven days a week."

"We didn't make money farming. We broke even some years, and farming is very difficult to make money and, I like challenges and I love farming. It's, I think it's in my DNA," he said. "Literally 75 people lost their job. We downsized drastically, and I still have 300 employees at my other businesses. It caused problems at my other businesses, well, everywhere. Everywhere you bank with, because when they charge you with a felony, I mean, then the banks get involved, as you would know from personal guarantees."

When it comes to his family, however, the reality star said they "have never been closer." He said he knows he "raised four lions, not four sheep," and isn't worried about his sons, adding they have a strong work ethic. 

Despite everything he is going through, McBee maintains he will "never let somebody make me a victim" and once his sentence is over, he "will come out stronger and more ready to go than ever."

"Steve McBee holds the door open for every young and old person. My kids are always like, 'Dad, don't pick up hitchhikers.' I stop and change tires on the side of the highway. That's who Steve McBee is. I know who I am," he said. "I'm not stabbing somebody at a gas pump after I've been arrested 100 times and let back out on the streets. But I'm the one going to prison. Life ain't fair sometimes, for no reason at all. I told the boys that, and I'm going to buck up, but I want my story heard because other farmers need to know they can get you any time they want."

In terms of preparing for prison, McBee said he has "tried to get everything in line with the businesses" for his sons and the managers.

Well, now they'll get the opportunity to make those decisions, so I think they're they're nervous, but they'll be fine so I've tried to prepare everything."

Prior to going to prison, he will also take time to celebrate all the holidays and birthdays he will miss while away.

The whole process will be shown on the next season of "McBee Dynasty: Real American Cowboys," with McBee saying his family always wants to be "transparent" with their viewers.

"One thing that we said when we were making the show with Bravo and NBC Universal was that we want to keep it real," he said. "We feel like too many of the shows, the drama they kind of tried to create it and whatever, so we want to be very transparent and open with our lives if we think that people can read through the BS, and they know what's real and what's not. And so yeah, we're gonna allow them."

"That was a family decision," he added. "They asked, and they were very respectful if they could film that. And we kind of all talked about it collectively, as a group, and decided that it's happening regardless. It's part of our lives."

Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had "full reign access" to telecommunications data.

A former FBI official claims that it's likely every American has been impacted by a Chinese-state-sponsored cyberattack.

International law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and National Security Agency, issued a joint advisory in September warning the public that CCP-sponsored actors are "targeting" many aspects of American lives, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks.

The cyberattack wasn't limited to the U.S. and targeted many countries around the globe, according to the advisory. According to the international agencies, the three Chinese companies believed to be behind Salt Typhoon work for China's intelligence services, which include units in the People's Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security. 

Through the information gathered during the cyberattacks, the Chinese intelligence services can "identify and track their targets' communications and movements around the world."

Cynthia Kaiser, a former high-ranking official in the FBI's cyber division, told the New York Times it's hard to envision a scenario where any American wasn't impacted by the hack.

"I can't imagine any American was spared given the breadth of the campaign," she said.

Those directly impacted by the cyberattack include senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures whose communications were accessed, according to the FBI.

Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had unprecedented access to phone calls being placed by Americans.

"They had full rein access," Nicoletti, said. "So, you know, your grandmother calling you to remind you to pick up groceries was not a targeted person and they're gonna listen into that call. But Trump, Vance, Kamala Harris, and dozens of other U.S. government officials were specifically targeted."

Nicoletti said the Salt Typhoon hackers "established a foothold and exfiltrated data for five years," which is "almost unprecedented."

Yet the cybersecurity expert says his greatest concern is not what Salt Typhoon may target in the future, but whether the group remains embedded inside companies and agencies that still haven't discovered the intrusion.

"My biggest concern is they're still in various organizations and undetected," he said. "So the thing that I worry about is not the next time that these guys hack somebody, it's what they're doing currently and who they're in."

When discussing the cyberattack in December 2024, then-deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said the hackers worked to identify the owners of various devices, then spy on phone calls and text messages if they were "government targets of interest."

            Food stamp recipients are now receiving their November benefits, but a growing swath of enrollees may soon lose their vital food assistance completely.
    


            At the same time as the government shutdown disrupted the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, states began implementing an expansion of the program's work requirements as mandated in the Republicans' “big, beautiful bill,” which was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer.
    


            Under the GOP package, more food stamp enrollees will have to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month or they will only be able to receive benefits for three months out of every three years.
    


            The expanded work requirements will result in 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps benefits in an average month over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. This includes 300,000 families with children.
    


            Recipients who don't meet the requirement will likely start losing their benefits in March, but the timing will depend on where they live and when they must recertify their eligibility for food stamps.
    


            Republicans have long wanted to beef up SNAP's existing work requirement, which used to apply to beneficiaries ages 18 to 49 who did not have disabilities or dependent children. The GOP increased the age threshold to 54 as part of the 2023 debt ceiling agreement.
    


            The GOP spending bill further broadened the work requirement to include recipients through age 64 and parents of children ages 14 through 17. Veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth are now also subject to the mandate.
    


            Plus, the legislation made it harder for states to seek waivers during poor economic conditions. Previously, states could obtain waivers in areas they identify as having a lack of sufficient jobs. Now, only areas with unemployment rates over 10% qualify.
    


            A federal judge in Rhode Island has temporarily barred the US Department of Agriculture from terminating existing waivers before their expiration dates, but the agency has yet to release guidance on the decision, said Chloe Green, assistant director of policy at the American Public Human Services Association.
    


            Asked about the case, the USDA said it is approving waivers “within its statutory authority under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, on an individual basis.”
    


            Overall, roughly double the number of SNAP recipients will be subject to the mandate, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
    


            The rollout of the expanded work requirements, however, has been chaotic, which was exacerbated by the record-long government shutdown, states officials and experts say.
    


            “There is both a tremendous amount of confusion and, strangely, a wide array of differences across states and how they are implementing it,” Bauer said.
    


            The SNAP work requirement provisions were among the few GOP agenda bill measures that did not have a set implementation date. In the fall, the US Department of Agriculture published guidance that said the new rules took effect on July 4, when the bill was signed into law, but effectively gave states until November 1 to stand up their programs.
    


            Then, earlier this month, the USDA said that states should not count November when calculating whether enrollees are meeting their work requirements because of the shutdown-spurred benefit disruptions.
    


            Most states set November 1 as their implementation date, though some started earlier, Green said. But other states say their systems may not be ready to track the expanded requirement until the spring, even though that could put them at risk for being penalized by the USDA.
    


            “One worry we have is that when you make systems changes this fast, there's a risk for unintended impacts somewhere else in the system,” she said, noting that such updates usually take 12 to 18 months to do properly.
    


            States are particularly sensitive to making payment mistakes now because another provision of the Republican agenda bill requires that they shoulder a larger share of the program's administrative costs if they have high error rates.
    


            Beneficiaries who may be newly subject to the work requirements need to be notified and screened to make sure they don't qualify for other exemptions, such as having physical or mental limitations.
    


            “A lot of people who are calling in are worried that now they're being assigned work requirements without them even knowing,” Green said. “That should not happen.”
    


            Many states are starting the three-month clock when residents first apply for food stamps or when they file their recertification forms, which generally happens every six to 12 months depending on the state and entails an interview. But some states are checking all their enrollees at once, without waiting for their recertification dates.
    


            Connecticut has found it “very challenging” to implement the expanded work requirements, said Dan Giacomi, director of program oversight and grants administration at the state's Department of Social Services. An estimated 36,000 residents — or 10% of the state's SNAP enrollees — could be at risk of losing their benefits in coming months because of the law's changes.
    


            “You can't just flip a switch in your eligibility system and have it do all of these new categories or new processes you have,” he said.
    


            To ensure it is complying with the Republican agenda bill the state has had to implement temporary workarounds — which involve case workers manually inputting whether recipients are newly subject to the requirement — while it races to update its technology. Giacomi is also concerned about these cases being integrated properly into the system once it is updated, as well as any payment errors that may result in penalties for the state.
    


            Another reason for the delay is that the state had to wait for guidance from the USDA so staffers knew how to handle all scenarios, he said. Though it still has several outstanding questions, it has enough information to get started.
    


            States often want to wait for clear USDA guidance so they don't take steps that the agency might later say don't comply with the regulations, said Ed Bolen, director of state SNAP strategies for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
    


            In Pennsylvania, the timetable began even earlier because its economic waivers, which covered many counties and localities, expired in September. The commonwealth took “substantial steps” to connect with all the SNAP recipients in these areas to determine if they could qualify for another exemption from the work requirements, Hoa Pham, a deputy secretary in the Department of Human Services, said. If they don't qualify, they could start losing their benefits as soon as January 1 unless they meet the work mandate.
    


            Pennsylvania has several ways of verifying recipients' income, including state and federal data and a pilot program in which enrollees allow a third-party platform to pull and report their payroll information. But these sources don't necessarily cover all the work that recipients perform so they may also have to submit pay stubs.
    


            Prior to the GOP agenda bill, fewer than 25,000 of Pennsylvania's roughly 1 million SNAP enrollees were subject to the work requirement rules that applied to those ages 18 to 54. The legislation expanded that number to just under 248,000 people.
    


            The department projects that a total of 144,000 recipients could lose their benefits over the next year when they renew their eligibility.
    


            States are also racing to inform SNAP beneficiaries who may now be subject to the work requirements to make sure they meet the mandate or file for exemptions.
    


            Connecticut is sending text messages, mailing notices and meeting with community groups. It has also set up an online questionnaire that will direct those potentially affected to the next steps they have to take. Pennsylvania has launched a website — with a video and a screener — to explain the changes to residents.
    


            Still, Pham is worried that some people who would continue to qualify could lose their benefits because of the paperwork.
    


            “It is all too easy for someone to miss an action step, and for that reason alone, that opens up the risk for people to lose their SNAP eligibility — for just missing an administrative process, and not because they are not otherwise eligible,” she said.

ISTANBUL (AP) — The Turkish government has condemned Ukrainian drone attacks on two Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers in the Black Sea.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Oncu Keceli said the attacks on the Kairos and Virat vessels happened inside Turkey's exclusive economic zone and “have posed serious risks to navigation, life, property and environmental safety in the region.”

In a social media post late Saturday, Keceli added that Turkey is carrying out talks with “the relevant parties” to prevent the spread of the war in Ukraine across the Black Sea and to protect Turkey's economic interests.

Ukraine has said it used naval drones to hit the tankers in quick succession off Turkey's Black Sea coast late Friday afternoon. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe.

The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have previously largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea.

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins ‘Fox News Live' to break down President Donald Trump's warning that Venezuelan airspace is now closed as his cartel crackdown intensifies.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a sharp warning Saturday about President Donald Trump's posture toward Venezuela, accusing him of edging the U.S. "closer and closer to another costly foreign war" without congressional approval.

In a blistering statement, Schumer criticized Trump's recent escalation toward Venezuela and argued that the president had upended the Constitution.

"President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war," Schumer stated. "Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war — not the President — and Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela."

The minority leader cautioned the president to avoid entering into another overseas conflict, writing that "Americans are tired of endless foreign wars that cost the lives of countless American service members and drain precious resources."

"This is not an America First policy," he added.

Schumer called for bipartisan pushback, urging his colleagues in Congress to "come together to return the power to declare war back to the people."

The New York Democrat's comments came after Trump wrote on Truth Social that Venezuela's airspace should be considered "closed in its entirety."

"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY," he wrote.

That post came a week after the Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of a "worsening security situation" in the area.

While speaking to U.S. service members on Thanksgiving, Trump said the U.S. will "very soon" begin stopping suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers "by land."

"In recent weeks, you've been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many," Trump said. "Of course, there aren't too many coming in by sea anymore. Have you probably noticed that?"

The president added that drug traffickers kill "hundreds of thousands of people a year" in the U.S. from the "poisons" they bring in.

Trump has not dismissed the idea of sending American troops into Venezuela, stating on Nov. 17 that he hasn't eliminated the possibility.

Asked whether he ruled out troop deployments, Trump responded, "No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything."

On Friday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea.

"As we've said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,'" Hegseth wrote on X. "The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization."

Hegseth's statement followed reports from multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post and CNN, that claimed the U.S. military ordered a second strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean on Sept. 2 after the initial attack left two survivors.

"As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland," Hegseth added in his post.

House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., issued a joint statement Saturday reiterating that the committee is "committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense's military operations in the Caribbean."

"We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question," the lawmakers wrote.

NEW YORK (AP) — Cat Murphy, a college student, has wanted to be a journalist since she was 11. Many of her friends don't understand why.

When they engage with the news — if they do — they hear a cacophony of voices. They don't know who to believe. Reporters are biased. They make mistakes. Besides, why would you hitch your future to a dying industry?

“There is a lot of commentary — ‘Oh, good for you. Look what you're walking into. You're going to be screaming into the void. You're going to be useless,'” said Murphy, a 21-year-old graduate student at the University of Maryland's journalism school.

She is undeterred. And it's also why she's not surprised by the findings of a study this fall that documented negative attitudes toward the news media among 13- to 18-year-old Americans. The press rarely fares well in surveys of adults, but it's sobering to see the same disdain among people whose opinions about the world are still forming.

Asked by the News Literacy Project for one word to describe today's news media, 84% of teens responded with something negative — “biased,” “crazy,” “boring,” “fake, ”bad,” “depressing,” “confusing,” “scary.”

More than half of the teens surveyed believe journalists regularly engage in unethical behaviors like making up details or quotes in stories, paying sources, taking visual images out of context or doing favors for advertisers. Less than a third believe reporters correct their errors, confirm facts before reporting them, gather information from multiple sources or cover stories in the public interest — practices ingrained in the DNA of reputable journalists.




To some degree, teens reflect the attitudes they're exposed to, particularly when the most prominent politician of their age has made “fake news” a mantra. Experts say few teens follow news regularly or learn in school about the purpose of journalism.

Journalists don't help themselves with mistakes or ethical lapses that make headlines. Opinionated reporters or commentators in an era of political division make readers wonder what to believe.

“Some of this (attitude) is earned, but much of it is based on misperception,” said Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design for the Washington-based News Literacy Project.

There are ways to turn things around, but it will take work.

Many of Lily Ogburn's classmates get their information from social media. Their parents didn't watch or read news reports as they grew up, so they didn't pick up the habit, said Ogburn, a senior at Northwestern University's journalism school.

Ogburn is the former editor-in-chief at the well-regarded Daily Northwestern student newspaper. The newspaper's 2023 reports on alleged hazing and racism within the school's football program led to the ouster of its coach. Still, she found some students don't understand the newspaper's role; they believe it exists to protect people in power rather than hold them accountable.

She frequently had to explain what she did to classmates. “There's a lot of mistrust toward journalists,” she said. But it has firmed her resolve to stick with the profession.

“I want to be a journalist that people trust,” Ogburn said, “and I want to report news that makes people believe and trust in the media.”

The news industry's financial troubles over the past two decades have hollowed out newsrooms and left fewer journalists on duty. Along with not seeing much legitimate journalism, young people frequently don't experience it through popular culture — unlike a previous generation, which learned in detail how Washington Post reporters Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein exposed the Watergate scandal in the Academy Award-winning movie “All the President's Men.”

When the News Literacy Project asked, two-thirds of teens couldn't think of anything when asked what movies or TV shows come to mind when they think about journalism. Those who had answers most frequently cited the “Spider-Man” franchise or the movie “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.” Neither portrayal was particularly flattering. 

Upon retiring as editor of Newsday, Howard Schneider helped develop the State University of New York system's first School of Journalism. But instead of teaching future writers, editors or producers, he became drawn to teaching non-journalists about being news consumers.

Now the executive director of SUNY Stony Brook's Center for News Literacy, Schneider wasn't surprised about any of the recent survey's findings, either.

“The negativity, the feeling that news is biased, is just a reflection of how their parents feel,” Schneider said. “The more exposed to news, legitimate news, the more their attitudes turn positive.”

He has developed news literacy programs for school districts. “Students will say, ‘I get my news from YouTube,'” he said. “I say, ‘No, you don't,'” and explains where the news originates and how to be discerning about what they see.

That's one of the lessons that 16-year-old Brianne Boyack has taken from her course in news literacy at Brighton High School in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. She had little trust in news going in, but has learned the importance of double-checking sources when she sees something interesting and seeking outlets she's found reliable.

Her classmate, Rhett MacFarlane, applied what he learned in class to investigate when a friend told him the Louvre was robbed in Paris.

“I've learned that there is definitely fact-checking (in journalism),” MacFarlane, also 16, told The Associated Press. “You guys are professionals and you have to tell the truth or you'd be fired. I thought you guys just did whatever you wanted and chose what to say about a topic.”

Still, news literacy programs in schools are relatively rare. Schools already have a lot of subjects to cover to prepare students for the future. And, remember, journalists don't have the best reputations. It can be hard for educators to stick their necks out for them.

“There's an inertia here,” Schneider said, “and this is an urgent issue.”

At the University of Maryland, Murphy said she didn't think there was an inherent hatred toward journalists among her fellow students. “They don't have any experience reading journalism,” she said.

That's where she sees the journalism industry needing to make more of an effort. One of the things she finds most frustrating about her chosen field is a resistance to change, particularly an unwillingness or inability to make meaningful use of social media.

“There's very little movement in the direction of going to where people are, as opposed to expecting them to come to where you are,” Murphy said. “The only way to turn it around is going to be to switch to doing things that captivate people today, as opposed to captivating people 20 years ago.”

            A mass shooting at a child's birthday party inside a banquet hall in Stockton, California, left at least four people dead, 11 others wounded, and the suspected shooter remains at large, officials said.
    


            The violence in Stockton adds to a growing list of American communities whose everyday spaces – schools, shopping centers, bars and office buildings – have experienced gun violence.
    


            Children and adults were among those shot, according to Heather Brent, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office. Officials did not immediately release the conditions of those taken to area hospitals.
    


            “Early indications suggest this may have been a targeted incident,” Brent said at a news conference. “This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited,” she said.
    


            Those killed were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21, Brent said Sunday. Authorities have not released the names of the victims.
    


            The shooting occurred just before 6 p.m. in the northern part of the city, according to the sheriff's office. The banquet hall, which shares a parking lot with several businesses, including a Dairy Queen, was hosting a family celebration that investigators were told was a birthday party for a young child with 100 to 150 people in attendance, Brent said. Stockton is about 40 miles south of Sacramento.

            The suspected shooter fled and remains at large, Brent said. Officials are urging the public for help with information as detectives work to determine a possible motive. “Investigators are exploring all possibilities,” Brent said.
    


             The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation.
    


            “My heart goes out to the families of those killed, the injured, and the survivors,” said former Rep. Gabby Giffords, herself a survivor of gun violence and founder of the gun violence prevention organization GIFFORDS.
    


            “While we await for more information on the shooting, what is painfully obvious is that we need our federal leaders to act to stop gun violence.”
    


            There have been at least 380 mass shootings in the US so far this year – defined as when at least four people are shot, not including the shooter – according to the Gun Violence Archive.
    


            In January, a shooting at Martin's Super Market in Elkhart, Indiana, left two people dead and two police officers injured. In August, a man walked into the lobby of a Park Avenue skyscraper in New York City, killed a police officer, then opened fire on other innocent strangers. The next month in Colorado, a shooting at Evergreen High School left two students critically wounded after a fellow student allegedly opened fire during their third week of classes.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the shooting, according to his office. Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi said in a statement that the governor has “offered the full support of the state of California” to assist the community.
    


            “Tonight our city is facing a heartbreaking and painful situation,” Fugazi wrote. “Please keep the victims, their loved ones, and our first responders in your prayers.”

Police have launched an intensive manhunt for the at-large gunman who opened fire at a Stockton family gathering, killing four people and wounding ten others.

Four people were killed and 10 were wounded in a mass shooting in Stockton, California, Saturday evening, according to officials.

Deputies responded shortly before 6 p.m. to a report of a shooting near the 1900 block of Lucile Avenue.

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said at a news conference that children and adults were shot.

Early indications "suggest this may have been a targeted incident," a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said.

The suspect remains at-large, according to the sheriff's office.

"We are doing everything possible to bring the individual that's responsible for this to justice," San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas said.

Detectives continue to work on determining a possible motive.

The shooting happened during a family gathering inside a banquet hall.

Multiple people were taken to hospitals, although their conditions are unclear.

The incident remains under investigation, with the FBI also probing the shooting.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the situation, and the governor's Office of Emergency Services is coordinating with local law enforcement.

"Our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this senseless violence," the sheriff's office said.

Stockton Vice Mayor Jason Lee said: "I am devastated and angry to learn about the mass shooting at a child's birthday party. An ice cream shop should never be a place where families fear for their lives."

President Donald Trump says in video message the alleged shooter of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., entered the United States from Afghanistan in 2021 and asks for Americans to pray for the victims.

Before the West Virginia Mountaineers football team took on the No. 5 Texas Tech Red Raiders Saturday afternoon in Morgantown, the crowd shared a moment of silence for the two West Virginia National Guard soldiers shot in Washington, D.C., Wednesday.

The public address announcer asked the crowd for silence as it came together to honor 24-year-old U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe from Martinsburg and 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom from Webster Springs. Their pictures were shown on the scoreboard during the moment of silence.

The two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House during their deployment in D.C. Spc. Beckstrom died from her injuries, while Staff Sgt. Wolfe remains in critical condition.

The suspected shooter is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national.

The shooting happened in broad daylight, and eyewitness video has emerged showing the shooter, believed to be Lakanwal, wearing dark clothing, turning a corner with a revolver in hand while Guardsmen scramble for cover.

One of the Guardsmen was seen around a corner down a street and returned fire. Metro Police say other National Guardsmen heard the shots about three blocks away from the White House and were able to detain Lakanwal after he had been shot.

The shooter fired off 10 to 15 rounds with a .357 revolver, according to federal charging documents cited by Reuters.

Lakanwal had entered the United States in September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden administration's Afghan evacuation and resettlement program. Prosecutors say he traveled across the country shortly before the attack and had no prior criminal record.

Lakanwal faces charges of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the Department of Justice intends to seek the death penalty.

Beckstrom and Wolfe were among members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to the D.C. area to tackle crime in the city in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., told "FOX & Friends Weekend" Saturday that Wolfe is "hanging on," adding his family is calling for prayer. 

"Andrew is fighting for his life right now, and his family and all of his friends, they're trying to harvest as many prayers as possible from all across the country, all across the globe, to help him recover," West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey told "Fox & Friends Weekend" Saturday.

"West Virginia cares very deeply about its guard. And there's just a proud tradition of West Virginians who step up from military service. So, when something like this happens, it's really a gut punch to the communities."

As for the Mountaineers' game, they weren't competitive against one of the best teams in the country. The Red Raiders beat them, 49-0, to move to 11-1 on the year. West Virginia finished its season 4-8.

Police confirmed multiple arrests Saturday after hundreds of anti-ICE agitators were caught on video throwing trash cans and debris at officers near a government building in New York City.

The incident happened during an ongoing crackdown on illegal immigrants in Chinatown, which has spurred protests in the area for more than a month.

Officers responded to Centre and Howard streets, near the U.S. General Service Administration building in Lower Manhattan, just before noon on a report of disorderly protesters, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) told Fox News Digital.

When police arrived, they found people blocking the street and exits at different locations, the NYPD said.

Video footage showed rioters pushing large potted plants in front of ICE vehicles, throwing trash at officers and screaming obscenities.

They were also spotted hurling trash cans and recycling bins and pushing barricades against officers.

Police said the protesters were told multiple times to disperse but did not comply.

Multiple people were taken into custody, according to the NYPD. The total number of arrests has not yet been released.

ICE Public Affairs Assistant Director Emily Covington told Fox News that the protest was coordinated on social media, and organizers called agitators to ICE's location in New York City.

"Individuals dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers including by blocking the parking garage," Covington wrote in a statement. "When individuals broadcast the location of ICE, they are putting a target on the backs of officers."

She added ICE officers are facing a 1,150% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats as they make lawful arrests of criminal illegal immigrants.

"We are grateful for the NYPD officers that responded to these violent agitators and stopped the lawlessness that ensued," Covington wrote. "We will never apologize for enforcing the law and removing criminal illegal aliens including murderers, pedophiles, rapists, gang members, and terrorists from our communities. We won't let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

President Donald Trump‘s statement that the airspace over Venezuela is “closed” has resulted in the suspension of deportation flights from the United States, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said.

Trump issued a warning to pilots on Saturday morning that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela is now “closed in its entirety.” The surprising announcement was met with condemnation from the Venezuela government, which called it an “illegal” and “immoral act of aggression” in a statement that included an appeal to the United Nations as well as a vow to respond “with all the strength granted by international law.”

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela strongly repudiates the public message disseminated today on social media by the President of the United States,” the statement said. “The Bolivarian Government warns that Venezuela will not accept orders, threats, or interference from any foreign power. No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of national airspace.”

Venezuela also revealed a consequence of Trump's statement — the immediate suspension of deportation flights to Venezuela, a key part of the U.S. president's immigration agenda.

“Through this action, the United States government has unilaterally suspended the Venezuelan migrant flights that were being carried out regularly and weekly as part of the repatriation of Venezuelans through the Plan Vuelta a la Patria (Return to the Homeland Plan),” it added.

The deportation flights were a rare instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Venezuela at the beginning of Trump's second term.

TRUMP SAYS VENEZUELAN AIRSPACE NOW ‘CLOSED'

Those already fragile relations have significantly deteriorated as Trump wages a drug war on the South American country, which has so far been limited to strikes on small alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Southern Pacific.

Those military operations may be expanding, with the airspace announcement signaling strikes on targets inside Venezuela could be imminent.

Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.

As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.

Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:

Before your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.

Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.

Before asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: "You matter more than the morning rush."

This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.

Integrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.

These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.

Even in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.

Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.

Before diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: "How's your heart this morning?" or "What's one thing you're looking forward to today?"

These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.

A morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.

Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.

Make mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.

This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 

Children live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.

When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child's natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.

Instead of rushing out with a quick "Let's go," pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.

Then add a "connection bridge," or something to look forward to later: "I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight," or "Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning."

Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.

Norway's $2 trillion wealth fund said on Sunday it would vote for a shareholder proposal at the upcoming Microsoft annual general meeting requiring for a report on the risks of operating in countries with significant human rights concerns.

Microsoft management had recommended shareholders voted against the motion.

The fund also said it would vote against the re-appointment of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the board, as well as against his pay package.

The fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in the company as of June 30, according to fund data, making it the fund's second-largest equity holding overall, after Nvidia.

It is Microsoft's eighth-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Investors in the U.S. tech company will decide whether to ratify the proposed motions at the AGM on Dec. 5.

China's factory activity edged higher in November but remained stuck in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, while services weakened as the boost from earlier holidays faded, according to official data released Sunday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.2, up 0.2 points from October, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The figures were in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.

The non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 49.5, down 0.6 points from October, while the composite PMI output index eased to 49.7, indicating a slight pullback in both manufacturing and services activities.

Supply and demand in manufacturing improved modestly, said Huo Lihui, chief statistician at the bureau's Service Industry Survey Center, with the production index reaching the 50 threshold and new orders rising to 49.2.

High-tech manufacturing stayed in expansion for a tenth straight month at 50.1, even as equipment manufacturing and consumer goods producers slipped below 50. Energy-intensive industries posted a mild rebound to 48.4, up 1.1 percentage points from October.

Business activity for small enterprises recorded a significant rebound. The PMI for small enterprises jumped 2 percentage points to 49.1, its highest in nearly six months, while medium-sized firms edged up to 48.9. Large manufacturers weakened, falling to 49.3.

Market confidence showed a slight uptick. The index measuring expectations for production and operations rose to 53.1. Industries including non-ferrous metal smelting and aerospace-related equipment reported particularly strong sentiment, with readings above 57.

Non-manufacturing activity, covering construction and services, softened, weighed down by services. Huo attributed the decline partly to the fading impact of earlier holiday-driven spending. 

China's Golden Week holiday, which typically lifts travel and consumer spending before activity normalizes in the following months, ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year.

Service-sector activity fell to 49.5,  down 0.6 percentage points from October, though pockets of strength remained: railway transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting and satellite transmission, and financial services all posted readings above 55.

Real estate and residential services continued to lag below the 50 mark, underscoring persistent weakness in property-related activity. Construction activity improved to 49.6, aided by stronger expectations for near-term growth, with that sector's sentiment index climbing to 57.9.

The non-manufacturing new orders index slipped to 45.7, reflecting softer demand. Input prices rose to 50.4, and service-sector sales prices, while still below 50, narrowed their decline.

Manufacturing employment ticked up slightly to 48.4, while non-manufacturing employment rose marginally to 45.3. Supplier delivery times for factories improved to 50.1.

China surveys roughly 3,200 manufacturers and 4,300 non-manufacturing firms for the monthly PMI readings, which are seasonally adjusted and considered a leading indicator for economic momentum.

China's manufacturing activity has contracted since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump launched new tariffs that squeezed producers.

Industrial profits fell 5.5% in October, the sharpest drop since June, reversing the strong gains seen in late summer. Earnings for the first ten months at major industrial firms rose 1.9%, slowing from the January–September pace.

The broader Chinese economy has cooled as growth slipped to 4.8% in the third quarter.

Trade tensions with the U.S. spiked in October as Washington threatened new 100% tariffs before both sides reached a late-month deal in South Korea. The agreement cut U.S. fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% from 20%, paused Beijing's rare-earth controls for a year and reopened China's purchases of American soybeans and other farm goods.

Despite the truce, demand at home remains soft. A drawn-out property slump and weak labor conditions are weighing on consumer spending. Policymakers have signaled a longer-term push to lift consumption and tech self-reliance but have avoided major new stimulus as the economy remains on track to meet its 5% growth target.

And just like that... December is upon us. 

It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets.

So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year? 

Fidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. 

It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a "good place" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. 

The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December. 

But there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, "fear of missing out." The central bank warned of "sharp correlated price adjustments" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks. 

Crypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the "halving" schedule, which happens every four years and "programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain."

Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end

Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.

ByAJ Dhaliwal,

Contributor.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has taken an important step toward bringing blockchain activity into the regulated banking system. In Interpretive Letter 1186, the agency confirmed that national banks may hold small amounts of crypto-assets, not for trading or speculation, but to pay blockchain network fees (“gas fees”) tied to otherwise permissible activities. The OCC also made clear that banks may hold limited tokens to test digital-asset platforms before launching them.

It's a narrow clarification on paper, but it resolves a practical bottleneck that has held back tokenization, digital-asset custody, and blockchain-based settlement for years.

Every blockchain requires users to pay a fee, in the network's own token, to validate or record a transaction. This is foundational to how distributed ledger networks function and protect themselves. But banks were in a bind: without the authority to hold native tokens, they had to ask customers to supply them, purchase small amounts before every transaction, or route activity through a fee provider. Each of these workarounds created timing delays, pricing uncertainty, and counterparty risk.

The OCC acknowledged these operational drawbacks directly, noting that reliance on intermediaries “can add costs and significant risks.” The new letter removes that friction. Banks may now hold only the amounts “reasonably necessary” to cover anticipated network-fee needs, and such holdings must remain de minimis relative to capital.

The OCC framed this authority as an extension of longstanding incidental bank powers and not a departure from them. Under 12 C.F.R. § 7.1000(d)(1), an activity is permissible if it helps deliver bank services, improves efficiency, or avoids waste. Paying mandatory network fees satisfies all of these criteria.

The letter situates this clarification within the OCC's broader digital-asset framework, including previous guidance on crypto custody, stablecoin reserves, and the use of distributed ledgers for payments. It effectively removes a final operational constraint that prevented banks from implementing activities the OCC already deemed permissible.

The OCC also addressed an issue that has quietly slowed bank development of digital-asset platforms: the inability to test systems using native tokens. Banks cannot responsibly deploy custody, settlement, or wallet infrastructure without validating transfers, controls, cybersecurity safeguards, and compliance workflows. Requiring third parties to provide tokens for testing introduces cost and risk, and in practice discourages thorough testing. The letter confirms that banks may hold the small amount of crypto-assets required to test systems safely.

This finding was supported by the requesting bank's detailed risk and compliance program, which emphasized controls across cybersecurity, illicit finance, liquidity, cryptographic protections, and operating procedures.

In addition to issuing the interpretive letter, the OCC published information demonstrating how similar requests have been evaluated, providing much-needed transparency into a process that had historically been opaque. This gives institutions clearer insight into supervisory expectations and signals a more open regulatory posture toward blockchain activity.

Although IL 1186 does not authorize investment activity or speculative crypto holdings, it finally gives banks and the fintechs that partner with them a practical way to operate directly on blockchain networks.

For banks, the impact is substantial:

Fintechs also see meaningful benefits:

Interpretive Letter 1186 moves blockchain activity inside the traditional banking perimeter in a practical, incremental way. The OCC even noted that banks may hold crypto-assets for other permissible purposes, such as foreclosing on crypto collateral or hedging certain customer-driven derivative exposures, suggesting that additional clarifications may follow.

For now, banks and fintechs finally have the green light to build on-chain products without operational workarounds. The conversation has moved past whether blockchain has a place in banking and now centers on how quickly, and compliantly, institutions can roll it out.

Every crypto cycle starts with a quiet phase, the moment before attention builds, before social media buzz, and before prices move out of reach. That moment is here for Milk Mocha ($HUGS), a project positioned as the best presale crypto for those who recognize early potential.

Now live in Stage 1, $HUGS combines emotional branding, staking rewards, NFTs, and charitable giving into a single, community-driven project. The question isn't about when it will rise, but whether you'll already hold a position when it happens.

Stage 1 of the $HUGS presale is that rare calm before the growth phase begins. At just $0.0002 per token, this is the lowest possible entry price before weekly price hikes take effect. The presale has already surpassed $30K in early support. History shows that early stages often define future winners, and this setup directly rewards early conviction.

Each stage in this best presale crypto introduces rising token prices, burns leftover supply, and includes leaderboard rewards for top buyers. This deflationary model not only builds scarcity but also encourages steady competition within the community. The earlier participants act, the greater the reward potential. Once Stage 2 launches, prices rise, and that early 1000x potential starts to narrow for those who wait too long.

Most meme coins rely on jokes and viral trends. Milk Mocha ($HUGS) is different. It's backed by one of the internet's most loved bear duos, known globally for spreading kindness and joy through millions of followers. The project converts that emotional reach into a working on-chain ecosystem.

This isn't just another trend-driven token; it's a fandom-powered asset. Holders gain access to staking at 60% APY, limited NFTs, and future metaverse games, while also contributing to a charity pool controlled by the community. That mix of heart and utility positions $HUGS as one of the best presale crypto options for 2025. While others chase short-term hype, $HUGS builds lasting emotional and functional value, blending community warmth with structured growth potential.

Most tokens create hype through speculation, but $HUGS builds FOMO through purpose. Holders can stake their tokens at a fixed 60% APY, receive daily returns, and even auto-compound to grow faster. At the same time, staking lowers the active supply, helping to strengthen long-term token stability.

Inside the Milk Mocha ecosystem, both the NFT and mini-game systems drive active demand. NFTs, available only through $HUGS purchases, give access to exclusive digital items, merch discounts, and metaverse benefits. The mini-games use $HUGS as the main currency, where players spend tokens to play, and part of those tokens are burned to maintain a deflationary model. This steady loop of earning, using, and burning keeps $HUGS moving while maintaining scarcity, making it one of the most talked-about options among the best presale crypto projects this year.

While many meme coins only focus on quick gains, Milk Mocha Token ($HUGS) brings deeper meaning through its Charity Pool and HugVotes DAO. These features let holders vote on which global causes to support, such as clean water, food security, and education programs. Each donation is recorded on-chain, allowing full transparency and aligning the project with values of kindness and care.

This blend of finance and emotion makes $HUGS stand out in a market filled with speculation. It links purpose with growth, building both community and long-term potential. With its unique mix of charity and governance, it is emerging as one of the best presale crypto projects combining real-world impact and smart tokenomics.

Crypto often rewards those who act before the crowd. Right now, Milk Mocha's $HUGS token sits at that early point where emotional appeal meets financial design. Stage 1 is still open at $0.0002, offering one of the most appealing entry levels of 2025. The project brings together 60% APY staking, NFT collectibles, mini-games, and a transparent charity pool, creating a well-balanced ecosystem of purpose and growth.

Many overlook emotional IP-based projects until their value skyrockets. This time, it might be different. $HUGS shows that love, humor, and loyalty can translate into digital worth, making it one of the best presale crypto stories shaping up for 2025. This could be the right moment to understand how emotion and blockchain are starting to merge into something much bigger.

China's central bank has repeated its stance that digital assets hold no legal status in the country, issuing one of its toughest warnings since the 2021 ban on trading and mining. Following a meeting involving thirteen government agencies, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said it will continue to clamp down on all forms of digital asset activity and highlighted renewed concerns about speculative trading.

“Virtual currencies do not have the same legal status as fiat currencies, lack legal tender status, and should not and cannot be used as currency in the market,” the PBoC stated. The bank added that it would “severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities,” signaling that authorities are monitoring what they described as a “resurfacing” of digital asset speculation.

Officials said the nationwide ban enacted in September 2021 had “rectified the chaos in the virtual currency market” and produced “significant results,” but warned that new forms of trading and cross-border activity continue to appear through informal channels.

Stablecoins received the strongest criticism in the PBoC's statement. Officials said they fail to meet anti-money-laundering and customer-identification rules, pointing to concerns around fraudulent fundraising, illegal cross-border transfers and underground payments.

The central bank called them a threat to financial security, arguing that their structure and circulation make enforcement difficult. This mirrors previous concerns raised by senior Chinese policymakers, including a warning from former PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan earlier this year. In a closed-door seminar, Zhou said: “Be wary of the risk of stablecoins being overused for asset speculation, as a deviation in direction could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system.”

Although China bans crypto trading and mining on the mainland, stablecoin usage through offshore platforms has persisted. Authorities appear focused on limiting these channels, especially where payments or asset transfers bypass capital-control rules.

The regulatory split between mainland China and Hong Kong remains one of the most closely watched developments in the region. While Beijing continues to enforce its nationwide ban, Hong Kong has pursued a licensing regime for exchanges and stablecoin issuers. Its model has drawn global firms and has been viewed as a controlled testing ground for digital-asset regulation.

However, Beijing has recently tightened supervision over Hong Kong's more open framework. In September, mainland authorities told several major brokerages to pause real-world asset tokenization projects. In October, officials moved to stop some Chinese tech companies from issuing their own stablecoins in the city, according to earlier reports.

The PBoC's latest comments suggest that any digital-asset activity connected to mainland firms or users—even through Hong Kong—will face added pressure.

While China keeps private digital assets outside the formal financial system, the government continues to expand the digital yuan project. More than 225 million personal wallets have been opened since the pilot began, and trials now include public-sector payments, transport networks and retail integrations.

The contrast is deliberate: private crypto is restricted, but state-backed digital currency is promoted as the sanctioned alternative for digital payments and programmable money. Friday's message reinforces that distinction and points to a regulatory approach where the digital yuan fills the space private tokens are not permitted to occupy.

China's stance leaves little room for change in the near term. Authorities show no sign of easing the ban, and stablecoins are now described in security terms rather than consumer-risk or market-risk language. Any remaining crypto activity routed through offshore platforms or intermediaries is likely to come under closer examination.

The most immediate impact falls on firms trying to operate between Hong Kong's regulatory framework and mainland expectations. Beijing's signals suggest that even legally licensed activity in Hong Kong may face constraints if it involves Chinese users, Chinese companies or cross-border token flows.

As other global jurisdictions experiment with regulated stablecoin frameworks, China continues to draw a firm line: private digital assets stay outside the financial system, while the digital yuan advances within it.

If this widely touted growth driver peters out, it could spell big trouble.

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchains are likely to be one of the crypto sector's biggest growth drivers over the next five years or so. As more of those assets are managed or traded on blockchains, more value touches the networks in question, which supports the prices of their native tokens.

But recently, the giant bucket of real-world assets that use blockchains mostly as a glorified record-keeping system has started to shrink, even as the smaller bucket of assets that actually live and move on-chain is now barely inching forward after a big growth spurt over the last 12 months. The implications of this shift are significant for the chains most exposed to the RWA segment, specifically Ethereum (ETH +1.38%), Solana (SOL +2.09%), and XRP (XRP +0.05%).

It's worth being a bit more cautious about buying them than before. Here's what you need to know.

Tokenization is the process of representing ownership of an asset as a crypto token on a blockchain, so that transfers and updates can be handled by the chain's rules instead of a pile of spreadsheets and databases. As an example, think of a tokenized U.S. Treasury bill or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) share. The token on the blockchain stands in for the physical piece of paper you could get from the bank or your broker if you asked for it, but the economic rights conferred by controlling the asset are the same whether they're represented as a physical item or as a digital entity.

In practice, there are two very different flavors of tokenized RWAs, and, as the entire field is still emerging, the nomenclature to describe them isn't entirely standardized just yet. With "distributed" assets, the token itself is meant to move around blockchain networks, plug into smart contracts, and be held directly in crypto wallets or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. With a distributed tokenized real-world asset, you could potentially do something like sell your car by transferring the token representing its ownership to someone else in exchange for cryptocurrency.

The other type is "represented" assets, which are tokenized assets where the blockchain is mostly used as a record-keeping system under the hood rather than as a way of moving the asset's value around. With represented assets, the assets themselves are still locked in a traditional custody stack that needs to be activated to actually transfer them or modify who owns them.

The problem is that the sum of represented RWA value across all networks is about $390.9 billion, down by roughly 2% in the last 30 days. Distributed RWA value is far smaller, at around $17.8 billion, and is also down by about 1% over the same span. For a segment that was one of 2025's favorite narratives, watching hundreds of billions of dollars in value parked in RWAs edge lower isn't great.

Ethereum is still the biggest home for tokenized assets by value, with distributed RWAs totaling $11.4 billion, down 8.3% from 30 days ago, and with another $272.8 million counted as represented RWAs, excluding its vast pool of stablecoins. While its RWA holder count climbed 13.7% in the same period, the sharp decline in distributed value is problematic because it means value is leaving the chain.

Solana, in contrast, has about $807.8 million in RWA value and it is all in the distributed category, with no represented value at all.  What's more, Solana's RWA pool grew by 14.4% in the last 30 days, so even as there's general weakness in the strength of inflows across the crypto sector, the network seems to be bucking the trend and continuing to grow its base of tokenized capital, which is a positive sign.

On the XRP Ledger (XRPL), there are about $394.6 million of RWAs, with roughly 34% distributed and 66% represented. And both of those categories are still growing, with on-chain distributed asset value climbing by 6.1% and represented value rising by 7.6%.

So it looks like Ethereum is the most likely to experience capital outflows due to the crypto sector's RWA growth leveling off. That means investors should probably be the most cautious about buying it if this trend continues or intensifies. And, if sector-level RWA outflows really start to pick up, be aware that neither Solana nor XRP will escape unscathed.

Even with the current outflows, investors should treat RWAs as one source of upside out of many others in play for these three coins. The cooling in RWAs is just a nudge to be more disciplined in evaluating trends affecting assets you're thinking of buying, so be sure to pay close attention before taking the plunge.

South Africans will not see a digital version of the rand for everyday use anytime soon, as the South African Reserve Bank has decided there is no strong case right now for launching a retail central bank digital currency. In a new position paper released this week, the central bank says while the tech works and could fit with rules, other fixes to the payment system should come first. This choice shows a careful step in a world where digital money is becoming more common, but cash still plays a big part in daily life here.

The paper, put out on 26 November 2025 along with a background note, looks at how a retail CBDC could act like a digital banknote for people to pay shops or each other. The SARB's view comes after years of tests and talks, and it points to bigger plans for a wholesale CBDC aimed at banks and markets. As the country deals with tough money issues like high costs and uneven access to banking, this update gives a clear path forward for digital changes without rushing into big shifts.

A retail CBDC is basically a digital banknote, set in the national money unit, that folks can use to pay businesses, shops, or one another. It is different from a wholesale CBDC, which is for deals between banks to settle trades in money markets. At its heart, a retail CBDC tries to copy normal cash but in digital shape, the SARB explains.

The study zeroed in on if this digital cash could add to physical notes, especially as payments go more online and money inclusion stays a problem. The SARB ran research and trials to see if it is doable and fits with rules and goals. They found it is technically possible and could be set up to match what the country needs.

But the paper stresses that cash is still key in South Africa. About 16% of adults have no bank account, and many rely on notes and coins because of things like poor networks, power cuts, high fees, and shops that set minimums for card swipes. Cash gives a sense of control and acts as a safety net when times are hard, keeping trust in the money system.

The SARB's research and tests showed a retail CBDC is doable and could line up with rules and aims. “The SARB's research and experimentation found that a retail CBDC is technically feasible and could be implemented in a way that aligns with regulatory and policy objectives,” the bank states. Yet, the check did not show a big need right now for this tool.

Instead, the bank says to keep pushing plans like the Payment Ecosystem Modernisation Programme and letting non-banks join the national payment system. “However, the analysis does not reveal a strong immediate need for such an instrument. Instead, the SARB concluded that ongoing initiatives such as the Payment Ecosystem Modernisation Programme and expanding non-bank participation in the national payment system should remain the priority in the short- to medium-term,” it adds.

These steps aim to make payments better without a new digital currency. For example, things like growing PayShap's use, linking different money stores, letting non-banks issue e-money, setting QR code standards, and starting an open banking setup are seen as key. The SARB thinks these will help more people use digital payments and cut gaps in access.

Proof shows big growth in digital payments in South Africa, driven by banks, fintechs, and public efforts. “From the research and analysis conducted as part of this study, there is evidence of significant growth in the adoption and use of digital payments in South Africa. This has been driven by innovative solutions introduced by commercial banks, fintechs and the efforts of the SARB and other public sector agencies and partners,” the bank notes. It expects more South Africans to switch to digital as these get better.Still, cash holds strong for some groups due to barriers like spotty infrastructure and costs. 

“Notwithstanding the progress made, evidence also shows that physical cash continues to play a significant role in South Africa, particularly for certain segments of the population. This prevailing cash reliance is due to barriers such as infrastructure availability, costs of digital payments and network and power issues,” the SARB says.

Looking ahead, the SARB sees a possible need for a retail CBDC to keep public access to central bank money, which is vital in a digital world. It could also open doors to improve payments and spark new money ideas in South Africa. “In the longer-term, there may be a need for a retail CBDC to safeguard public access to central bank money − a public good that remains essential in a digital economy; and unlock opportunities to complement and enhance the existing payments landscape while supporting broader financial innovation in South Africa,” the paper states.

Central bank money is top-quality, cutting risks and making payments smooth. Being able to swap private money for safe public money builds trust and stops money troubles. “Central bank money plays a crucial role in the financial system for two primary reasons: it represents the highest quality of money, reducing risk and enhancing payment system efficiency, and its accessibility through convertibility with commercial bank money fosters trade efficiency and mitigates financial instability in a dual money system,” the SARB explains.

Keeping a mix of central and private money is key for best trade. “Balancing access to both central bank and commercial bank money is essential for maximising trade efficiency,” it adds. The bank warns not to see this as saying no to a retail CBDC forever. “The conclusion of the study should not be interpreted as a view that South Africa should not implement a retail CBDC in future,” it stresses.

A surprising wave of crypto activity is coming from an unexpected source: real estate. The Trump Organization, in partnership with a Saudi developer, has unveiled plans for a luxury resort in the Maldives. They plan to tokenize it. Investors could buy digital shares tied to this resort, blending high-end hospitality with blockchain finance.

As tokenized real estate gains attention, many are asking: Which is the best altcoin to buy now that stands to benefit the most? Two very different but powerful contenders emerge: Tapzi (TAPZI), a new gaming-crypto presale, and Solana (SOL), a leading smart-contract blockchain and one of the top altcoins to invest in by its large market cap.

This guide explores both, compares their strengths, and argues why Tapzi (TAPZI) may offer a rare blend of growth and adoption given this moment.

The Trump Organization is partnering with Dar Global, a Saudi-backed developer, to build an 80-villa luxury resort in the Maldives, close to the capital, Malé. What makes this project especially interesting is that they're planning to tokenize ownership. Through blockchain, investors will be able to buy digital tokens that represent fractional shares of the resort; essentially, real estate divided into tradable units.

This isn't just a gimmick. The idea signals a serious shift: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is evolving, and large brands like Trump are leaning in. It's a signal that tokenized investing could become more mainstream, and that could ripple through the altcoin space.

Tapzi (TAPZI) is a skill-to-earn gaming platform built around competitive mini-games. Players stake TAPZI tokens to compete in games like chess, tic-tac-toe, or rock-paper-scissors. The winners earn real rewards, and TAPZI fuels the entire system.



Presale Details:

Tokenomics & Utility:

The best altcoin to invest in today, Tapzi (TAPZI), is designed for long-term engagement. The team has built a non-inflationary staking model. Staking rewards aren't just printed out; they are backed by actual gameplay demand. Players must use TAPZI to enter tournaments, which creates consistent, utility-driven demand.

Roadmap & Market Audience:

Tapzi plans to launch a mobile app, developer SDKs, and global tournaments. Early adopters of this best crypto presale will be gamers, guilds, and competitive players. Because mobile gaming is massive worldwide, Tapzi has a large potential audience.

If real-world tokenization brings more mainstream capital into crypto, that could flow into presales like Tapzi, and early buyers may benefit massively.

Solana (SOL) is one of the most well-known Layer-1 blockchains in crypto. It's fast, scalable, and has gained real traction with developers, DeFi projects, and Web3 games alike.

Strengths & Adoption:

Why Solana Might Ride the Tokenization Wave:

As real-world assets like the Trump Maldives resort get tokenized, blockchains that power those tokenized assets could see rising demand. Solana has the scalability and low cost to support large-scale tokenized real estate, RWA platforms, and high-volume on-chain activity.



Risks & Challenges:

Despite being a high-growth altcoin, Solana has faced network outages and competition from other layer-1s. Moreover, while tokenization is powerful, it will only benefit if RWA platforms choose Solana. Adoption is not guaranteed, and regulatory risks still linger.

Use-Case Fit:

Growth Potential:

Token Demand Dynamics:

Impact of Trump Resort Tokenization:

In summary, if you want big upside and early-stage growth, Tapzi may be the best altcoin to invest in. If you want infrastructure exposure and reliability, Solana remains a powerful long-term bet.

When a major real estate brand tokenizes property, it validates blockchain's utility beyond speculative coins. For crypto native projects, this sends a message: tokenized real-world assets are not a niche but a part of the future. Investors may grow more comfortable allocating capital to new, early-stage tokens if they see real-world financialization happening on-chain.

Enter presale projects like Tapzi, which may benefit from this growing legitimacy. As tokenization becomes more accepted, investors will likely search for high-upside altcoins, especially ones with utility, community, and real use cases. Tapzi may not be a real estate token, but its presale could attract a new wave of crypto users mobilized by trust in on-chain asset innovation.

If you're sold on Tapzi, here's how to get in now:

To stay safe, always verify you're on the real Tapzi website. Never share your seed phrase. Use official community channels to verify links.

No. The tokenization pertains to real estate shares, not TAPZI. The resort's token isn't TAPZI, so you cannot use TAPZI to invest in the resort project directly.

Tapzi expects a listing after the presale and liquidity setup. The presale documentation suggests the listing price may be around $0.01.

There's no strict public cap per user mentioned, but presale allocation is limited. About 20% of the total supply is reserved for presale.

Solana is more mature and battle-tested. Tapzi is a high-risk, high-reward presale. Choose based on risk appetite and investment horizon.

Tokenized real estate has risks: regulation, construction delays, or liquidity issues. That could hurt investor confidence in RWA projects, but not necessarily across unrelated projects like Tapzi or Solana.

The Trump Maldives resort is more than a headline. It's a signal that tokenized real estate is coming, and that real-world assets may shift on-chain. In this context, Tapzi (TAPZI) represents a vibrant, high-upside entry into the world of Web3 gaming, while Solana offers infrastructure exposure for builders and developers.

If you believe that blockchain will power both real estate and play, then Tapzi stands out as the best altcoin to buy now for long term. Combine that with Solana for technical robustness, and you've got a balanced approach to the tokenization era.

Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) companies have been making headlines in recent weeks, and often for the wrong reasons.

A sharp decline in crypto markets and over 40% slump (as of Nov. 27) in the share price of the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, Strategy (MSTR), this year, has led some to question the sustainability of these companies.

Strategy's steep underperformance relative to bitcoin (down about 2% this year) in recent months may be due to looming index-inclusion risk rather than crypto-market dynamics, according to Wall Street bank JPMorgan. However, the downturn in the share price of MSTR and other bitcoin DATs still raises the question: Is the bitcoin digital asset treasury model broken? 

According to Elliot Chun, managing partner at investment bank Architect Partners, it's the opposite. 

"This is the most exciting period for BTC DATs yet because in real time, we are seeing and will see which DATs will be able to successfully maneuver and communicate through this first 'macro' price move lower," Chun said in an interview with CoinDesk.

"We are still so early, as an industry, we haven't even properly categorized the DAT category yet, so it's impossible to say if the model is broken," he added.

Chun breaks the bitcoin DAT landscape into four broad groups now unfolding in real time. 

“Pure play" DATs which direct nearly all corporate resources toward maximizing a bitcoin-denominated outcome, often BTC per share. “Producing" DATs that actually generate bitcoin through operations like mining. “Hybrid" DATs that treat the crypto as a primary pillar but still run non-BTC initiatives, and “participating" DATs that simply hold the digital asset on their balance sheet and leverage it as a capital markets tool. 

As these categories experiment publicly, failures are inevitable, but according to Chun, that's standard for any emerging corporate or capital-markets model.

What all bitcoin DATs must ultimately solve, Chun notes, is revenue: how to generate yield or cash flow, whether denominated in BTC or otherwise. And not all will make it. 

He expects that within five years, half of today's pure play, producing and hybrid DATs will disappear through failure, delisting, mergers or acquisitions. 

About 35% will survive without outperforming, 10% will beat major market indices like the S&P 500, and the top 5% could challenge the Magnificent Seven's decade-long run, returning more than 700% between 2025 and 2034, Chun said.

Can these companies withstand a true downturn? It depends on how one defines 'severe.' If the recent pullback counts, Chun expects most DATs to make it through. The real test will be deeper macro stress, where operational clarity, treasury discipline and a credible plan will separate survivors from targets.

So what comes next for this industry? Just like any other industry that rises in breakneck speed during a bull run and starts to crumble during a downturn, it's consolidation.

The firms blending TradFi discipline with bitcoin-native understanding will craft messages that resonate with investors and position themselves to raise and deploy capital effectively. And those that can't, will be acquired, often by other DATs, Chun said.

Over the longer term, he expects the strongest performers to become acquisition targets for the world's largest public companies as the bitcoin price marches toward $1 million and corporate treasuries increasingly view BTC as a strategic, rather than speculative, asset.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto-keen Russians are spending millions of dollars on domestic financial products based on BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds.

That's according to the country's central bank, which, according to the Russian outlet RBC, says that the worth of individual investments in cryptocurrency futures contract funds on the Moscow Exchange, the MOEX, currently totals over $27 million.

The majority of investors are “building small portfolios” of shares in the funds worth up to $6,430, the bank said. But the largest contributions are “made by a few larger-scale investors, whose open positions are worth more than [$1.3 million],” it added.

Considering the funds launched as recently as mid-July, the data points to growing crypto adoption rates in Russia, as investors look for alternatives to international markets.

The bank said it was unconcerned by the development. “Total private investments in Russian financial instruments related to [cryptocurrencies] amount to approximately [$48 million],” the bank said. “This does not pose any systemic risk to the Russian economy.”

The Moscow Exchange launched its first futures contracts, based on share prices of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, in early June.

MOEX followed up with a similar product based on the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF in July.

The central bank also noted, in its quarterly financial stability report, that the volume of Russia-linked trade on overseas crypto exchanges has fallen in recent months.

This drop will come as a surprise to some, with other statistics from Russia pointing to a rise in adoption rates.

At the end of September, it said, the majority of Russian citizens' crypto on overseas crypto exchanges was held in Bitcoin.

The bank thinks Russian citizens collectively hold $7.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, as well as almost $2 billion worth of Ethereum and altcoins worth $2.7 billion.

The central bank compiles its data using a tool named Transparent Blockchain, developed in part by Rosfinmonitoring, the Russian anti-money laundering agency.

The government says Transparent Blockchain lets it analyse the volume of inflows and outflows of funds from Russian citizens' wallets to some of the largest centralized crypto exchanges in the world.

The bank said that it monitored transactions at Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bybit, Gate, HTX, KuCoin, Mexc, OKX, Poloniex, and “several other exchanges popular with Russians.”

However, the bank conceded that there may have been a growth in the number of Russians using decentralised exchanges in recent months. And it said that this may explain the sharp drop in centralized exchanges' Russian user numbers.

So old and crusty are concerns that Tether is either not being upfront about the reserves backing its USDT stablecoin or faces imminent threat of being undercapitalized, that the crypto industry has developed its own two-word dismissive response: "Tether FUD."

Through soaring bull markets, the most brutal of bear markets, the comings and going of charlatans like Sam Bankman-Fried, Alex Mashinsky, and dozens of others, Tether's USDT has continued to grow and function as designed — pegged to the U.S. dollar and available for redemption at any time. Alongside, Tether has become one of the globe's most profitable companies, earning more than $10 billion through the first nine months of 2025, similar levels to those of Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

The current bear market (and stop saying "zoom out," it's a bear market), though, has some in traditional finance sharpening their nails yet again.

During the sleepy session the day before Americans celebrated Thanksgiving, S&P Global slashed the rating on Tether's USDT from 4 to 5, the weakest level on its stablecoin stability scale (yes, the agency whose ratings shenanigans helped enable the global financial crisis has a stablecoin stability scale).

Behind the downgrade were usual concerns about the opacity of Tether's reporting combined with something somewhat new: bitcoin now compromises more than 5% of the reserves backing USDT — thus continued declines in BTC's price could lead to potential undercollateralization.

"We wear your loathing with pride," said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, shortly after the S&P move. Taking note of the well-trodden previous failures of ratings agency models, Ardoino said, "the traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system ... Tether instead built the first overcapitalized company in the financial industry, with no toxic reserves." 

Tether, he concluded, "is living proof that the traditional financial system is so broken that it's becoming feared by the emperors with no clothes."

Possibly attempting to be helpful or maybe just trying to flame, well-known angel investor Jason Calacanis took to X over the weekend to offer his advice. 

"Tether has a lot left to clean up, but they're getting close," said Calacanis. He urged Tether to 1) sell all of its bitcoin, 2) own only U.S. treasuries, and 3) get not just one, but two audits done by American firms.

The Calacanis post drew a fast and fiery response from bitcoiners, with the general reaction being the absurdity of a stablecoin/bitcoin company swapping its relatively small holdings of BTC for government paper. Several drew attention to Calacanis' panicky request for a bailout of all bank deposits as Silicon Valley Bank was failing in March 2023, in part thanks to a plunge in value of U.S. Treasuries it was holding.

Fair enough. But even if Tether holds onto its bitcoin, what about a traditional audit? On that subject, Calacanis was later joined by popular financial blogger Quoth the Raven, a longtime gold bug who began coming around to bitcoin in 2024.

"I've been in this game long enough to know that when a company refuses to furnish a full, independent audit, it's never because things are pristine and they just forgot to schedule one," wrote QTR. "I've found only ever one reason an outfit digs in its heels and won't submit to an audit when everyone requests one. And it's not a good reason."

"Markets have a long, bloody track record of chewing up the naïve," he continued. "[An audit is] the bare f---ing minimum anyone should demand from an entity issuing tens of billions in synthetic dollars that underpin entire markets."

For anyone who still thinks about security as guards, fences, and simple alarms, 2025 is a good year to update the mental image. Security now mixes cameras, code, algorithms, and sensors in ways that sound almost like science fiction.​

From small businesses to big companies, protection means watching doors and networks at the same time. Artificial intelligence, biometrics, blockchain, IoT, and even quantum computing are joining forces to keep people, data, and spaces safer.​

Artificial intelligence is becoming the brain behind many security systems. It can look at hours of video or millions of data points much faster than any human and find patterns that feel “odd” or risky.​

In physical security, AI helps smart cameras spot unusual movements or behaviors and send alerts quickly. In digital security, it reviews network traffic, looks for strange connections, and blocks threats in almost real time.​

The key advantage is that AI learns from past incidents. With each attack or suspicious event, models improve, which makes future detection more accurate and reduces the number of false alarms.​

Biometric security, which uses unique traits such fingerprints or faces, has quietly moved from spy movies to daily life. Many phones already unlock with a fingerprint or a face scan instead of a PIN.​

In companies, biometrics is replacing old access cards that can be lost or shared. Employees may enter offices with facial recognition, voice checks, or retina scans, which link access directly to the person, not a plastic badge.​

Online services are also adding biometrics to their login process. Instead of only typing a password, users confirm identity with their finger or face, creating a simple but much stronger protection for banking and other sensitive accounts.​

Blockchain, or chain of blocks, is a technology that stores information in linked records that are hard to change. Once data is written, it becomes extremely difficult to alter without leaving a clear trace.​

This property is useful for security because it helps guarantee that records, contracts, or transaction histories have not been secretly modified. It adds a layer of trust in digital environments where cheating can be hard to see.​

In cybersecurity, blockchain can support secure identity systems, protect logs from tampering, and power “smart contracts” that run automatically only when all conditions are met, reducing the need for middlemen.​

The Internet of Things connects everyday devices to the internet. Cameras, alarms, motion sensors, thermostats, and even lights now talk to each other and to central platforms that watch entire buildings or even whole neighborhoods.​

This connectivity helps security teams see everything from one dashboard. For example, a single app can show camera feeds, door status, and alarm events, and even trigger responses based on predefined rules.​

However, every connected gadget is also a small door that hackers might try to open. If a device has weak passwords or old software, it can become an easy entry point into larger systems.​

Because of this, IoT security needs strong defaults, regular updates, and careful network design. Otherwise, a smart camera meant to protect a building could turn into a risk instead.​

Quantum computing uses the rules of quantum physics to process information in new ways. While still early, it is expected to solve certain problems, including some types of encryption, much faster than normal computers.​

This creates both a promise and a challenge. On one side, quantum tech could enable almost unbreakable encryption for very sensitive data. On the other, it could eventually break many of today's common algorithms.​

Because of this, researchers are already working on “post‑quantum” cryptography. The idea is to design new methods that will stay safe even when quantum computers become powerful enough to threaten older systems.​

Modern security is no longer a one‑layer shield.

Speculative activities in virtual currencies have resurfaced, PBOC statement warns after multi-department regulatory meeting

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) held a coordination meeting on virtual currency regulation on Friday with a coalition of top regulatory and law enforcement agencies, according to a statement released by the central bank on Saturday.

“Business activities related to virtual currencies constitute illegal financial activities,” the statement said.

“Stablecoins are a form of virtual currency, and currently cannot effectively meet requirements for customer identification and anti-money-laundering,” it added, warning that they posed risks of being exploited for illegal purposes such as fundraising fraud and unauthorised cross-border fund transfers.

The meeting included officials from 12 other departments, including the Ministry of Public Security, Central Financial Commission, Ministry of Justice and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It noted that speculative activities in virtual currencies had recently resurfaced.

According to the PBOC statement, the authorities emphasised that these currencies did not have the same legal status as fiat currency and “should not and cannot” be used in market circulation, while vowing to quash related illicit activities.

Oops, something went wrong

In Africa crypto news this week, the Ghana Gold Board is pushing for blockchain implementation in tracking global gold movements.

Meanwhile, in South Africa, the South African Reserve Bank has warned of the stability risk from the country's crypto sector.

Across the border, the University of Namibia has rolled out a novel master's degree in blockchain technology.

Here's a more detailed look at these stories:

The Ghana Gold Board is pushing for blockchain technology usage in tracking gold shipments. This proposal comes even as gold prices continue to break records and demand remains high globally.

Ghana Gold Board CEO Samuel Gyamfi spoke at a high-level Precious Metals Conference in Dubai on the importance of tracking global gold movements. He notes that gold is a valuable resource and cannot be allowed to become a haven for illegal activities.

“Gold is a resource for global economic stability and transformation. It cannot be allowed to become a haven for drug lords, armed actors, corrupt politicians, human traffickers and criminal networks.”

Mineral traceability remains a key concern for law enforcement globally. The worries about illegal mining, the use of child labor in mines, and related crimes inform the need to trace minerals from mines to the markets.

Integrating any of the major blockchains introduces decentralization and immutability, which the Board believes can aid in proper mineral tracing.

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has released its second Financial Stability Report of 2025, which identifies digital assets and stablecoins as new financial risks in the country.

By the end of Q2 2025, SARB said they were over 7.8M crypto holders in the country, HODLing some of the next tokens to explode.

Even so, the central bank is wary of the billions held by these exchanges and the borderless nature of the sector.

South Africa has exchange controls that govern traditional banking institutions, but do not affect crypto movements.

The acknowledgement by the industry poses a systemic risk, mostly because it is outside the purview of existing regulations.

This discrepancy presents a reason for the central bank and the legislature to enact common-sense crypto regulations.

In the education sector, the University of Namibia (UNAM) has launched the continent's first master's degree program in blockchain technology.

UNAM aims to become a research and development hub on the continent.

They will partner with the African Blockchain Institute on this initiative. This announcement is the culmination of over two years of work by the institution's IT department to integrate emerging technologies into its curriculum.

The program combines academic rigor and practical application in the leading aspects of the blockchain industry.

Applications are now open through the university's online academic portal. The first cohort of students is expected to chart new horizons in advanced blockchain studies.

Earlier, UNAM partnered with the Africa Blockchain Institute in organizing a public lecture on blockchain innovation.

Animoca Brands, co-founded by Yat Siu, is advocating for an investment strategy that prioritizes a diverse portfolio of altcoins over solely Bitcoin. Siu believes that the collective performance of altcoins will surpass that of Bitcoin, capturing a larger share of economic activities in the crypto space. This theory is not new; historically, altcoins have surged when Bitcoin's dominance decreases. Siu likens Bitcoin's function in crypto to gold's in traditional finance—valuable, but not the sole player in the game.

The argument for altcoins is rooted in their potential for innovation and the ability to capitalize on emerging trends. Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions, for instance, have significantly outpaced Bitcoin, with Ethereum outperforming it by 72% since April 2025. The driving force? Institutional backing and the growth of decentralized applications.

Allocating a portion of investment into altcoins—around 20-30%—while keeping Bitcoin central could yield better risk-adjusted returns. The approach utilizes dollar-cost averaging and AI tools to navigate market fluctuations, making it more palatable for SMEs that prefer lower risk profiles.

The regions ripe for investment appear to be Ethereum, Layer 2 solutions, and select high-utility altcoins. Projects with real-world applications and those tied to artificial intelligence seem to represent the next phase of growth. Animoca Brands has already invested in over 600 projects across gaming, DeFi, and blockchain infrastructure, suggesting that they are hedging their bets on a diverse range of upcoming projects.

Regulatory red tape poses a significant challenge for fintech startups in Europe. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has established strict compliance measures that can stifle altcoin adoption. For example, a minimum capital requirement of €350,000 and stringent anti-money laundering regulations could limit smaller firms' capabilities.

The licensing timeline can stretch from 6 to 12 months, delaying the launch of any altcoin-related services and potentially leaving smaller outfits at a disadvantage against traditional banks, which may have greater resources for compliance.

A balanced investment strategy is recommended. SMEs should consider diversifying a portion of their portfolio into altcoins while keeping Bitcoin as a significant holding. Regular rebalancing and extensive research into altcoin projects are essential for risk management. Targeting altcoins with genuine use cases and transparent roadmaps could yield better outcomes.

Understanding market cycles is also crucial. Investing in altcoins during periods of diminishing Bitcoin dominance could yield substantial gains.

Animoca Brands emphasizes a diversified investment strategy and the need for institutional engagement, suggesting that a broad approach could prove more beneficial. The planned Nasdaq listing via a reverse merger with Currenc Group may provide access to global capital and institutional investors.

As the market evolves, companies like Animoca could serve as indicators for future altcoin investments. Their focus on integrating Web3 with traditional finance and tokenizing real-world assets suggests a recognition of the necessity for varied revenue streams and use cases within sustainable Web3 infrastructure.

In summary, as the cryptocurrency market moves towards structured investment themes, understanding altcoins and the regulatory landscape will be vital for SMEs. A diversified investment strategy, coupled with an awareness of market trends, may help businesses seize the opportunities that lie ahead in altcoin investment.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) has become one of 2025's wildest stories on Wall Street: a former bitcoin miner that morphed into a massive Ethereum treasury vehicle, briefly rocketed 3,000% in a week, attracted billionaire backers – and then crashed more than 80% from its summer peak. [1]

As of the close on Friday, November 28, 2025, BMNR stock changed hands at $33.12, up around 4% on the day, after yet another burst of Ethereum buying and a flurry of November headlines that included record earnings, the company's first dividend, and a new CEO. TS2 Tech

This article summarizes the key developments in BitMine Immersion Technologies stock as of November 30, 2025, and explains why the name is now central to the debate over so‑called “digital-asset treasury” companies. It is for information only and does not constitute investment advice.

BitMine remains one of the most actively traded and volatile crypto‑linked equities in the U.S.

A weekend wrap‑up from TechStock² notes that despite Friday's bounce, BMNR shares are still down about 46% over the last 30 days, even after a gain of more than 300% over the past year. TS2 Tech

Put simply, BMNR has traded less like a typical tech stock and more like a leveraged options bet on Ethereum, with wide intraday swings and rapid shifts in sentiment whenever crypto markets move.

BitMine's current profile is the result of a dramatic pivot in 2025.

By August, BitMine had already become one of the world's largest disclosed corporate holders of ether. An August analysis from Investopedia highlighted that the company held over 833,000 ETH at that point and openly aimed to acquire up to 5% of the entire ETH supply – a goal management branded the “Alchemy of 5%.” [6]

Since then, the numbers have grown far larger.

The most important data point for BMNR today is what sits behind the ticker on BitMine's balance sheet.

In a November 24 press release, the company reported that as of the evening of November 23 it held: [7]

In total, BitMine's self‑described “crypto + cash + ‘moonshots'” holdings amounted to roughly $11.2 billion. Management estimates that 3.63 million ETH represents about 3% of the Ethereum network's circulating supply, making BitMine the largest Ethereum treasury holder in the world and the second‑largest corporate crypto treasury overall, behind only Strategy's bitcoin stash. [8]

CoinDesk's coverage of the same announcement underscores how aggressive the buying has been: BitMine acquired 69,822 ETH (≈$195 million) in just one week, even as crypto prices and its own share price were falling. [9]

A subsequent on‑chain‑driven report from CoinGape adds that on November 28 BitMine purchased a further 14,618 ETH (≈$44.3 million) via a BitGo wallet. The site estimates BitMine now holds around 3.6 million ETH and pegs the firm's enterprise value near $12.2 billion versus crypto holdings of about $11.2 billion, implying a market‑to‑NAV multiple (mNAV) of roughly 1.08. [10]

The takeaway: BMNR functions less like a traditional operating business and more like a publicly‑traded Ethereum mega‑treasury with modest operating revenue attached.

Despite the brutal drawdown in the stock, BitMine's headline earnings numbers for fiscal 2025 (year ended August 31, 2025) were striking.

In a November 21 earnings release, the company reported: [11]

Data from StockAnalysis confirm those figures and show a trailing price‑to‑earnings ratio near 2.5x at recent prices – an unusually low multiple that mainly reflects the way unrealized gains and losses on the crypto portfolio flow through the income statement. [12]

Most of BitMine's reported earnings are mark‑to‑market swings in digital assets, not recurring cash flows from operations. That distinction is critical for investors trying to compare BMNR with more conventional tech or financial stocks.

Alongside earnings, BitMine declared its first annual dividend, a move it has promoted heavily in investor communications.

According to the earnings release and subsequent dividend notices: [13]

Management describes BitMine as the first large‑cap crypto company to declare an annual dividend, presenting the move as a signal of commitment to shareholder value even amid extreme volatility. [14]

In dollar terms, the yield is negligible at current prices, but for a sector dominated by growth‑and‑speculation narratives, the optics of a dividend‑paying Ethereum treasury vehicle are unusual and potentially important for attracting certain institutional investors.

To move beyond mere balance‑sheet speculation, BitMine is planning to monetize its ETH holdings via staking.

The company's 2025 earnings release introduced MAVAN – the “Made‑in‑America Validator Network” – a dedicated Ethereum staking infrastructure platform scheduled to launch in Q1 2026. [15]

Key points from BitMine's disclosures:

If fully implemented, MAVAN could transform BMNR from a pure mark‑to‑market proxy into a yield‑generating Ethereum platform, though the eventual impact on cash flows will depend on:

Amid the financial fireworks, BitMine has also undergone a leadership overhaul.

On November 14, 2025, the company announced that Chi Tsang had been appointed Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board, succeeding long‑time CEO Jonathan Bates. [18]

The same announcement added three independent directors: [19]

A profile on IQ.wiki and coverage by CoinDesk emphasize Tsang's background in traditional finance and venture capital: over 20 years of experience at firms including HSBC and Lehman Brothers, founder of venture fund m1720, and a venture capital lecturer at Fordham's Gabelli School of Business. [20]

The market reaction, however, was muted to negative. Coindesk and other outlets reported that BMNR traded lower on the day of the announcement amid a broader crypto sell‑off, highlighting how sentiment‑driven the stock remains. [21]

BitMine's aggressive Ethereum accumulation has required substantial external capital.

A September 22, 2025 SEC filing shows the company priced a $365.24 million registered direct offering at $70 per share, selling about 5.22 million shares alongside 10.4 million warrants with a strike price of $87.50. The offering price represented a 14% premium to the stock's prior close, and management indicated the proceeds would be used primarily to acquire more ETH. [22]

While raising equity at a premium is superficially shareholder‑friendly, the overall strategy has still been highly dilutive over the course of 2025, as multiple offerings increased the share count while the stock later fell far below those issue prices.

Analysts cited in a late‑November CCN deep‑dive argue that this “issue equity to buy crypto” model works only as long as the stock trades at a meaningful premium to the value of its underlying assets; once that premium collapses, new issuance erodes existing shareholder value and can contribute to severe drawdowns. [23]

The volatility in BMNR is not just about daily swings; it's about the shape of the entire 2025 arc.

By late November, though, the mood had reversed.

CCN estimates that BMNR has fallen roughly 81% from its peak, even as BitMine continued buying ETH and amassed roughly 3.63 million tokens (about 3% of supply). The article cites several factors behind the under‑performance versus ETH itself: [26]

CoinDesk's treasury update echoes this, noting that BMNR shares are down more than 80% from their July peak and that many digital‑asset treasuries now trade at or below the value of their underlying holdings. [27]

BitMine is part of a broader group of companies now referred to as digital‑asset treasury (DAT) firms – public companies that hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets and effectively trade as proxies for those tokens.

A late‑November Reuters report highlights that at least 15 bitcoin‑treasury companies are now trading below the net asset value of the tokens they hold, as crypto prices fell and risk appetite waned. [28]

The Financial Times has also described a broader “crypto treasury reckoning”, noting that the total market capitalization of such firms has plunged as some have been forced to sell tokens to fund share buybacks or service debt, reversing earlier accumulation strategies. [29]

BitMine is one of the few DATs still aggressively increasing its holdings instead of selling, which amplifies both the upside potential if ETH recovers and the downside risk if the digital‑asset bear market persists. [30]

Analyst coverage of BMNR is still relatively thin given its size, but it has grown rapidly in recent months.

Data aggregated by StockAnalysis and MarketBeat indicate that: [31]

At the same time, third‑party valuation platforms disagree on whether BMNR trades at a premium or discount to NAV, depending on how they treat unrealized losses, warrants, and non‑ETH assets. Some show the stock below book value, while others suggest it sits above their modelled fair value, reflecting just how polarizing the name has become. TS2 Tech+2Investing.com India+2

BMNR's volatility is being amplified by the rapid growth of derivative products linked to the stock.

According to StockAnalysis and associated press releases: [32]

These instruments don't change BitMine's fundamentals, but they do increase trading velocity and can magnify flows into and out of the stock around news or macro events, further contributing to its reputation as a high‑beta trading vehicle rather than a stable long‑term compounder.

Given the sheer complexity of BMNR's story, investors following the stock into December 2025 are paying attention to a few core themes:

BMNR remains tightly correlated with ETH, often moving more than the underlying coin on big up or down days. [33]

BitMine's strategy is explicitly to keep buying ETH, targeting 5% of total supply. [34]

Investors will be watching whether:

Each route has different implications for dilution and risk.

If MAVAN launches on time in Q1 2026 and successfully stakes a meaningful portion of BitMine's ETH at competitive yields, BMNR could start to look less like a one‑way bet on price and more like a yield‑plus‑upside vehicle. [35]

The key unknowns:

The entire DAT sector sits at the intersection of crypto regulation, interest‑rate expectations and ETF flows.

Recent coverage from Reuters and others notes that risk appetite in crypto has been dented by concerns over expensive tech valuations and uncertainty about U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, contributing to sharp drawdowns in bitcoin, ether and DAT shares. [36]

Any new rules affecting corporate crypto holdings, staking, or token accounting could materially change BMNR's risk‑reward profile.

As of November 30, 2025, BitMine Immersion Technologies stock sits at the crossroads of multiple powerful narratives:

For bullish Ethereum investors, BMNR offers a high‑octane, equity‑market way to gain exposure to ETH plus potential staking yield – but with added layers of corporate, financing and sentiment risk. For skeptics, it exemplifies the dangers of leveraged single‑asset strategies in a still‑maturing asset class.

Brazil's central bank just tightened the screws on cryptocurrency trading with new regulations that could reshape how millions of Latin Americans use digital assets—particularly stablecoins that have become a popular workaround for traditional banking systems.

The long-awaited rules, announced on Nov. 11, will extend existing anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regulations to virtual-asset service providers starting in February. For a country where crypto adoption has exploded in recent years, this is the most significant regulatory shift since Brazil approved its cryptocurrency legal framework in 2022.

The timing isn't coincidental. Brazilian Central Bank Governor Gabriel Galipolo has raised concerns about the growing use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar—that are often associated with illicit activity

“New rules will reduce the scope for scams, fraud, and the use of virtual asset markets for money laundering,” central bank Director of Regulation Gilneu Vivan said at a press conference, Reuters reported.

Here's what makes stablecoins particularly tricky from a regulatory standpoint: they're less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making them more useful for payments than investments. Many users have gravitated toward them specifically to bypass more heavily supervised and taxed traditional payment systems—which is exactly what policymakers want to prevent.

The updated regulations will treat stablecoin transactions similarly to traditional currency exchanges. Buying, selling or swapping virtual assets tied to government-issued currencies will fall under foreign exchange rules, according to Reuters. Cross-border payments using digital assets—including card purchases and other electronic payment methods—will receive the same regulatory treatment.

This isn't just semantic hairsplitting. By reclassifying these transactions as foreign exchange operations, Brazil's central bank is bringing them under the same regulatory umbrella as traditional currency exchanges—complete with customer protection requirements, transparency standards, and compliance obligations.

The new framework will require virtual-asset service providers to meet standards around corporate oversight, security protocols, internal monitoring systems, and mandatory disclosures to regulators, according to Reuters. Authorization processes will now cover foreign-exchange and securities brokers, distributors, and virtual-asset service providers.

Brazil's moves matter beyond its borders. As Latin America's largest economy, regulatory decisions made in Brasilia often influence policy discussions throughout the region. The country held four public consultations before finalizing these rules, suggesting authorities were trying to strike a balance between innovation and oversight.

The central bank's statement emphasized that the framework includes customer protection requirements and transparency standards that previously didn't apply to virtual-asset service providers. For legitimate crypto users, these protections could actually increase confidence in the ecosystem by weeding out bad actors.

But for those who turned to stablecoins specifically to avoid traditional banking oversight, February marks the end of that regulatory arbitrage. The new rules are a clear signal that Brazilian authorities view unregulated crypto activity as a systemic risk worth addressing—even if it means slowing down an industry that has seen explosive growth.

The question now is whether other Latin American countries follow Brazil's lead in closing what has become a significant regulatory gap in the global financial system.

A color e-reader is a delight. Your digital bookshelf on a device like the Kindle Colorsoft becomes almost as colorful as the ones you have at home, and browsing through a sea of new titles on the shop side becomes much more engaging than a sea of black-and-white. It's a great purchase if you read any books that might have illustrations on the pages, or if you like color highlights.

Amazon finally came out with color Kindles starting last year, but with the close-to-$300 price tag, we weren't as impressed as we should have been. But right now, during Black Friday, you can get the colorful Kindle Colorsoft for almost as cheap as the black-and-white Kindle Paperwhite. While there are a ton of Kindle deals you can shop right now, this is easily the biggest one not to miss.

Amazon (Colorsoft Signature Edition)

Amazon (Colorsoft)

There are two versions of the Colorsoft: The base model that came out this summer, and the Signature model that came out last year. Both are on sale right now. Both also did well in our tests (though the Signature is the one that had issues with yellow bars appearing on the bottom of the devices last year) and are mostly similar, but have a few key differences. The Signature Edition has an auto-adjusting warm light, while the basic Colorsoft has a warm light you can manually adjust. You'll get twice as much storage on the Signature, too, with 32 GB over 16 GB, and the Signature can be wirelessly charged.

Other than those three features, though, both have the same 7-inch screen and resolution of 300 pixels-per-inch (or ppi) for black-and-white content and 150 ppi for color. They're both waterproof, too. My only complaint is that the Dark Mode no longer turns menu pages dark, and doesn't work on downloaded content like AZW3 documents (which are a special ebook style formatted specifically for Kindles).

Overall, it's a great e-reader, just pricey, especially since you aren't getting things like page-turner buttons or the ability to double as a digital notebook like you can with Kobo's colorful e-readers. If you're a Kindle enthusiast, though, this is truly the best time to buy.

U.S. chipmaker set to expand Hiroshima site with heavy support from Tokyo.

Micron is preparing a major expansion of its Hiroshima operations to build a dedicated high-bandwidth memory (HBM) facility, according to a report by Nikkei Asia. The report says the company intends to invest 1.5 trillion yen — US$9.6 billion — in a new plant on its existing site, with construction scheduled to begin in May next year. Shipments would follow around 2028. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is expected to contribute up to 500 billion yen in subsidies to support the project, though neither Micron nor METI has confirmed the report.

HBM has arguably become the most constrained component in the AI supply chain, giving the project some real weight in terms of government subsidies. SK hynix currently leads the market and has committed most of its HBM, DRAM and NAND output to Nvidia through 2026. Samsung is working to catch up with its 12-layer HBM3E stacks, while Micron has pushed hard to grow its own presence through HBM3E supply deals with Nvidia and AMD. TrendForce data shows Micron moving toward roughly a quarter of the HBM market with 20% of shipments as production increases; a dedicated Hiroshima expansion could shift that balance further once it comes online.

Japan has been aggressive in courting this kind of investment, offering substantial government incentives to foreign chipmakers as part of a wider effort to rebuild domestic semiconductor capacity. TSMC's Kumamoto fabs and the state-backed Rapidus project are already part of this strategy.

Micron itself has been a significant beneficiary. Last year, Micron announced plans to introduce EUV-based DRAM production on the same Hiroshima campus, investing 500 billion yen of its own cash and supported by nearly 200 billion yen in subsidies. The first LPDDR5X memory devices produced on its 1γ process at this facility then began sampling in May of this year.

The scale of the planned plant aligns with expectations for the next generation of AI accelerators. Nvidia and AMD are both shifting towards HBM4 and HBM4E, both of which require tighter process control and higher layer counts. Capacity has been thin throughout the current GPU cycle, with long lead times and allocation limits driven by the mismatch between demand and available wafer starts. If Micron's new plant reaches volume production in 2028, it will arrive just as those next-generation GPUs are.

For Micron, Hiroshima offers political and financial stability at a moment when both geopolitics and the market cause increasing uncertainty, and Tokyo's willingness to fund a third of the project removes some of the risk from a multiyear build. The long runway to 2028 also gives Micron a clear path to expand its role

Another day, another broken Windows update. Thankfully, this one is only affecting Insiders.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has admitted that the non-security preview update KB5064081 has an issue that will make it a bit harder to log into your computer using your password. According to Microsoft Support, one of the known issues in this update is that the “Password icon might be missing or invisible in the lock screen sign-in options.” While the button might have disappeared, you can still sign in with a password by clicking on the empty space where the button should be, and the password field will appear.

This isn't a critical security or performance issue, especially as it only impacts the Windows user interface. Furthermore, it's part of a preview update, meaning users in the preview channel should be the only ones affected. It's nonetheless annoying to those users, especially if you forgot your PIN for Windows Hello and you now can't quite figure out how to type in your password. Microsoft said that it's already “working to resolve this issue and will provide information when it's available.”

Windows Updates are meant to fix security issues, bugs, and release new features, but if you're tinkering with a complicated operating system such as Windows 11, you're bound to break something else if you aren't careful. In fact, Microsoft released an emergency patch last month after an update prevented users from using the keyboard and mouse when in the Windows Recovery Environment.

In the same month, the company also broke the Media Creation Tool just a day before Windows 10 end-of-life, which might prevent some users from updating their system to Windows 11. Even other companies need to deal with Windows Updates shenanigans. For example, Nvidia released an emergency driver update in the latter part of November after a Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2 update significantly reduced performance in some games. This hotfix resulted in 50% performance increase for affected titles, giving many frustrated gamers a reason to rejoice.

Thankfully, Microsoft has several Windows Insider channels where most bugs are caught before they're rolled out to the average user. These should catch most of the biggest bugs that Microsoft's engineering and programming teams might have missed, but even then, a few issues sometimes slip through the cracks and get a wider release.

Our favorite overall artificial Christmas tree was the easy favorite of the interior designers who helped us test and review them. One assembler called it “the Hermès of Christmas trees” and it had both a beautiful look to the evergreen branches and bright built-in LED lights. The branches are easy to hang ornaments on thanks to the slight upward slope, and a mix of needle types give it a great texture. It's a great investment tree that's on sale.

Flocked trees are covered in artificial snow to give it that extra Christmas-y look, and our favorite flocked design is this tree from King of Christmas. Out of the trees we tested, this tree really nailed the fresh snow look, which is hard to do artificially. The branches are nice and thick, but it is a little harder to hang ornaments around the flocking.

Out of all the trees we tested, not only is this the cheapest one we liked, but it was rated easiest artificial Christmas tree to fluff thanks to its pliable branches. The easy fluff makes it look much fuller and more natural than trees that aren't easy to do that with, and makes this cheaper tree look high end. There's a wrapped pole in the middle that adds to the realistic look.

These lights are the star of my garage this holiday season and one of my favorite sets I've tested for my smart Christmas lights guide. After sitting in storage for a year, these lights easily reconnected to my app and Wi-Fi with no problem, and it was easy to take a quick photo with the app to re-map the lights with my current setup. I love the range of designs you can find or create in the Twinkly app, and it was easy to set a timer so that they'll turn on and off at the right time.

These are my all-around best pick for smart Christmas lights. You can put them on your house, your walls, your tree, your balcony railing, whatever you like! Then use the app and your camera to map the lights and start creating the designs you want for it. Like the Strings above, there's plenty of designs you can choose from or create in the app, and easy controls all around.

We've been testing tons of outdoor permanent lights this holiday season, and this set from Eufy is one of the standouts. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck found the app easy to navigate for choosing colors and schedules for her lights, and loved the wide offering of holiday presets to take advantage of. There's an AI feature to make customized light shows, and the Eufy S4 lights work with the Matter protocol, so it can sync with Apple, Google, and Alexa's smart home ecosystems.

If the sales aren't getting the permanent outdoor lights cheap enough for you, then you'll be thrilled to see our budget set is on sale for a similar price you'd get regular smart lights for. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar is happy with these lights on his home, but he does warn that there's annoying in-app AI you have to get around to get access to regular controls. Once you click past it, these lights are easy to control and customize like you would any set of smart lights.

Keep an eye on the model and waterproofing; while the 150-foot version has an IP65 rating for the lights and an IP67 for the power adapter, the 50-foot and 100-foot models have an IP65 rating for the light kits but no weatherproofing for the power adapter, so it needs to be in an enclosed outlet. If you're using an outdoor outlet with no protection from the weather, then upgrade to the 150-foot size.

making an exception for such a heuristic is, in all cases, wrong since it will always be abused.The actual answer is: Defender needs a PUP category.

Amazon keeps the deals coming all weekend long, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday and it turns the shopping event into a marathon of discounts in every category. The DJI Mini 4K has become the best-selling drone at this event and for good reason: it has a lot of professional features in a frame that weighs less than 250 grams which means it doesn't need to be registered with the FAA in the US.

Amazon has two different packages: The standard package is available to everyone for $239 instead of $299 and the Combo version is only available to Prime members for $309 instead of $389. The Combo comes with a second battery that doubles the flight time to 62 minutes as well as extra propellers and a carrying case. If you plan to fly more than just on weekends, this is the better option.

DJI designed the Mini 4K to weigh less than 249 grams which is the weight at which most countries require pilots to register with aviation authorities and it makes it easier for recreational pilots to fly. This weight limit made engineers make smart decisions that let them put real 4K UHD recording capability into a drone that you can fold up and put in your jacket pocket.

The three-axis mechanical gimbal keeps the camera steady on all three axes of movement. This means that wind gusts and sudden changes in direction won't make the footage shaky and unusable, which happens with cheaper drones that have electronic stabilization. When you watch your footage, you'll see this mechanical advantage: smooth cinematic pans and tracking shots look professional instead of like someone running with a handheld camera.

The 1/2.6-inch CMOS sensor records 4K video at 30 frames per second with enough detail that you can crop and reframe it in post-production without losing quality. This resolution is important if you want to share content on modern screens or keep your options open for editing. The camera can also take 12-megapixel stills in JPEG or RAW format which lets photographers control exposure and color grading that automated JPEG processing takes away.

Under perfect conditions, OcuSync 4 transmission technology can keep a stable video feed up to 10 kilometers away with little interference. However, in the real world, the range is usually between 4 and 6 kilometers depending on obstacles and radio interference. You can fly beyond your line of sight for dramatic establishing shots or follow subjects over large areas without worrying about losing connection because of this longer range. The 1080p live feed to your phone shows in real time with little delay so it's easy to frame shots and get around obstacles even when the drone is just a dot in the sky.

With the standard package, the battery lasts for 31 minutes on a single charge which means that you can fly for about 25 minutes, taking into account the time it takes to take off, land, and reposition. The Combo package comes with two batteries so you can switch out a dead one and keep flying without having to wait hours for it to charge.

Auto Return to Home turns on automatically when the battery gets too low or the signal connection is lost: It uses GPS coordinates to find its way back to the launch point and land safely. This feature has saved a lot of drones from crashing into trees or getting lost in forests when pilots lose their way or run into problems they weren't expecting. The wind resistance can handle gusts of up to 10.7 meters per second (about 24 mph) so you can use the Mini 4K outside in normal weather instead of only on perfectly calm days, which don't happen very often in real life.

The standard package, which costs $239 instead of $299, is a good deal for people who only fly once in a while and don't mind shorter sessions. The Combo package, which is going for $309 instead of $389, is the best choice for people who plan to use it often. For just $70 more, Prime members get the second battery, extra props, and carrying case.

Thomas Müller knows exactly what it is like to face Lionel Messi with a trophy at stake — and he knows what it takes to win in those moments, too.

The 2025 MLS Cup final — Messi and Inter Miami vs. Müller and the Vancouver Whitecaps — is going to draw a few comparisons from a personnel standpoint to the 2014 World Cup final and 2010 World Cup quarterfinal matches between Argentina and Germany.

Germany, with Müller, won both times. Messi played in those matches for Argentina, as did Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano. They'll all meet again on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, with Müller surely knowing that facing Messi doesn't automatically mean a loss.

"It's not about Messi against Thomas Müller," he told reporters after Vancouver's 3-1 win over San Diego in the Western Conference final on Saturday night. "It's Miami against the Whitecaps."

Then he added, "Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group."

What Messi thinks of the matchup — he has gone head-to-head with Müller 10 times in various competitions, and his side has won only three of those — is a bit of mystery and likely may stay that way. Inter Miami rarely makes Messi available for interviews.

This much, however, is known: Messi came to Inter Miami midway through 2023 with the goal of winning an MLS Cup, something that seemed far-fetched at the time considering when he joined the club it was at the bottom of the league. A win on Saturday would fulfill his quest and would cap a season when Messi also won MLS' Golden Boot as the top scorer — plus, more than likely, a second consecutive league MVP award.

"Even though he's the best in history ... it's unfair to believe that he's going to win every game," Mascherano said after Inter Miami's 5-1 romp past New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final on Saturday night. "Everybody has raised their level."

The MLS final comes as part of a huge week for soccer in North America. The FIFA World Cup draw for next year's men's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is on Friday in Washington along with the initial awarding of that organization's peace prize. MLS, if past form holds, seems likely to announce its MVP award winner this week. 

It's not like either Messi or Müller needs a win on Saturday to get some sort of validation. Their résumés and legacies were secured long ago: Both are World Cup winners, Champions League winners and Club World Cup winners.

But like Messi, Müller came to MLS — he joined Vancouver four months ago — seeking a title in that league to add to the list. The chance has arrived.

"I enjoy watching him," Müller said in an on-field interview for Apple TV following Vancouver's win Saturday night. "I have the feeling Miami's a very strong team. We saw them beating New York in quite a really strong manner. It's a big final. I wished for this final. And here we go. I think it's great for everyone."

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Thomas Müller knows exactly what it is like to face Lionel Messi with a trophy at stake.

And he knows what it takes to win in those moments, too.

The 2025 MLS Cup final — Messi and Inter Miami vs. Müller and the Vancouver Whitecaps — is going to draw a few comparisons from a personnel standpoint to the 2014 World Cup final and 2010 World Cup quarterfinal matches between Argentina and Germany.

Germany, with Müller, won both times. Messi played in those matches for Argentina, as did Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano. They'll all meet again on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, with Müller surely knowing that facing Messi doesn't automatically mean a loss.

Then he added, “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group.”

What Messi thinks of the matchup — he's gone head to head with Müller 10 times in various competitions, and his side has won only three of those — is a bit of mystery and likely may stay that way. Inter Miami rarely makes Messi available for interviews.

“Even though he's the best in history ... it's unfair to believe that he's going to win every game,” Mascherano said after Inter Miami's 5-1 romp past New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final on Saturday night. “Everybody has raised their level.”

The MLS final comes as part of a huge week for soccer in North America.

The FIFA World Cup draw for next year's men's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is on Friday in Washington along with the initial awarding of that organization's peace prize that many expect the group to award to President Donald Trump. (“On the 5th of December, you will see,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said a few weeks ago when asked if Trump would win the award.) MLS, if past form holds, seems likely to announce its MVP award winner this week. And college soccer is nearing its championship rounds; the men's Division I quarterfinals are this coming weekend along with the start of the women's Division I College Cup.

It's not like either Messi or Müller needs a win on Saturday to complete some sort of validation. Their resumes and legacies were secured long ago: Both are World Cup winners, both are Champions League winners, both are Club World Cup winners.

But like Messi, Müller came to MLS — he joined Vancouver four months ago — seeking a title in that league to add to the list. The chance has arrived.

“I enjoy watching him," Müller said in an on-field interview for Apple TV following Vancouver's win Saturday night. “I have the feeling Miami's a very strong team. We saw them beating New York in quite a really strong manner. It's a big final. I wished for this final. And here we go. I think it's great for everyone.”

Mohamed Salah was left on the bench as much-maligned summer signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz helped Liverpool to a vital three points in Sunday's 2-0 win over West Ham. The Swedish forward scored his first Premier League goal for the club since his big-money switch to Anfield this summer, while the German provided the heartbeat for the Liverpool attack.

Reflective of their respective sluggish starts to the Premier League campaign, West Ham and Liverpool failed to set the London Stadium alight from the off. The hosts, set up by Nuno Espirito Santo to absorb pressure and attack on the break, were pinned back by the Reds who were unable to press home their dominance on the ball in the first half. Alphonse Areola did well to produce a fine stop from an Isak spectacular and cut out a dangerous Joe Gomez cross, but was otherwise untroubled by a blunt Reds attack in the opening exchanges.

Wirtz had impressed in the first half and looked most likely to make a difference for the Reds in the second period. On the hour mark, the German jinked to his left and, with the outside of his boot, threaded the ball through a compact Hammers defence to Cody Gakpo, who cut back to Isak to fire first-time into the bottom left corner.

The Reds continued to keep hold of the ball and stifle any West Ham attacks, and despite only holding onto a one-goal advantage, the Reds never looked like forfeiting maximum points, and did not even have to bring on Salah to strengthen their grip on the game. A ridiculous red card from Lucas Paqueta only snuffed out the chance of a possible Hammers recovery, before Gakpo fired home from a Gomez cross in the 92nd minute to seal a vital victory.

GOAL rates Liverpool's players from the London Stadium...

Alisson Becker (6/10):

The Brazilian had little to do, but will be pleased with his clean sheet.

Joe Gomez (7/10):

The England defender, playing on the right of the defence, had a strong performance and offered a real threat going forwards.

Ibrahima Konate (6/10):

A much-needed uneventful day for the Frenchman who bounced back from recent struggles to hold firm.

Virgil van Dijk (6/10):

A dominant presence in both boxes, the Dutchman helped lead the defence in the closing stages.

Milos Kerkez (6/10):

Still not quite at the level he showed at Bournemouth last season, but the left-back was solid for the Reds.

Ryan Gravenberch (7/10):

An understated, but impressive performance at the base of the Liverpool midfield as the visitors dominated.

Alexis Mac Allister (7/10):

Helped the Reds take the majority of possession and provided composure in the middle of the park.

Dominik Szoboszlai (7/10):

We have become accustomed to Szoboszlai's relentless running and he was everywhere in east London. A great help for Gomez down the right-flank too.

Florian Wirtz (8/10):

Arguably the German's best performance in a Liverpool shirt so far, he played a crucial role in the Reds opener.

Cody Gakpo (8/10):

Worked tirelessly for Slot's side and provided the all-important assist for Isak, before sealing the win late on.

Alexander Isak (7/10):

After some wayward finishing in the first-half, the Swede finally ended his 381-minute goal drought with a fine finish.

Hugo Ekitike(5/10):

Replaced Isak, but did not offer too much of a threat.

Curtis Jones (6/10):

Had demanded his team-mates raise their levels earlier in the week and they responded. A late cameo appearance in midfield.

Andy Robertson (N/A):

A late substitute to see out the win.

Arne Slot (6/10):

His decision to leave Salah on the bench proved successful and the Dutchman will be delighted with three points.

Iran has announced they will boycott the event in Washington next month due to the U.S. denying visas to several members of its delegation, but will not withdraw from the World Cup itself, at this time. The U.S. has long-standing, strict visa restrictions on citizens from certain countries, including Iran, for claimed political and security reasons. 

The Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI) spokesman, Amir-Mahdi Alavi, stated the officials faced "visa obstacles that go beyond sports considerations". The U.S. granted only four visas, including one for the head coach, but notably denied the application for FFIRI President Mehdi Taj for the ceremony at the Kennedy Center on December 5th. Iran views the decision as a non-sporting, political decision and has informed FIFA, urging the governing body to intervene. 

The incident has raised speculation that the travel ban could potentially impact Iran's participation in the actual tournament to be held in America, Canada and Mexico, but officials have not confirmed a World Cup boycott at this stage. The issue highlights broader diplomatic tensions, as the U.S. previously announced potential visa exemptions for athletes and support staff for major sports events, though their application to the draw was unclear.  

Following the announcement, Taj said: "We are evaluating our options, which will depend on timing and circumstances. We remain in close communication with the Iranian foreign ministry and other authorities, and we will take the necessary decision at the appropriate time. The current position of the Iran Football Federation executive committee is that no one will attend the event unless all visas are issued. It appears to us that the matter has become politicised. We informed the FIFA president, Mr. Infantino, that they have taken a political stance and the situation is completely politicised. We believe that FIFA should take a stand against such behaviour." 

Iran have consistently navigated the challenging Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualification process to secure berths in the last four consecutive FIFA World Cups: 2014, 2018, 2022, and the upcoming 2026 tournament, making seven appearances in total at the tournament in the competition's history. 

For the 2014 World Cup, they topped their final qualification group with a decisive win against South Korea. They achieved back-to-back appearances for 2018 by dominating their group undefeated, without conceding a goal in the final two rounds. Qualification for 2022 saw them again finish atop their group as the first Asian team to secure a spot with a win over Iraq. Most recently, they secured their place for the 2026 World Cup with a draw against Uzbekistan during the third round of the qualifiers in March 2025, marking an unprecedented fourth consecutive appearance through consistent top-tier performance relative to the quality in their confederation. 

There's no suggestion Iran will boycott the tournament, but if the visa issue remains unresolved and they do pull out, FIFA will have a decision to make on who they replace them with. FIFA regulations state that if an association withdraws or is excluded from the competition, the Organising Committee "shall decide on the matter at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed necessary". If they pull out before the main tournament draw FIFA would be more likely to invite a replacement team to fill the spot in the final tournament to avoid an unbalanced group. This replacement would likely be the best-ranked non-qualifying team, potentially from the AFC. If they withdraw after this point the spot at the tournament would most likely remain empty and opponents awarded victory by forfeit.

Manchester United came from behind to secure victory over Crystal Palace as Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount emerged as match-winners for Ruben Amorim's side in a 2-1 win on Sunday. Palace led in the first half through a Jean-Philippe Mateta penalty, but the Red Devils came out for the second period a different side, and Zirkzee fired home before Mount struck the winner from the edge of the box to complete the turnaround.

United could have taken an early lead within the first minute, as Dean Henderson made a double save at the feet of Casemiro from point-blank range following a long throw-in. The Brazilian would soon come close to scoring again, too, when he glanced a header wide from a Bruno Fernandes delivery.

That would be as close as United came in the first half, as Palace soon took a strange-hold on proceedings. A defensive mix-up involving Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro saw Mateta run through on goal, only to drag the ball wide, while Senne Lammens saved from Daichi Kamada and Yoro blocked well from Yeremy Pino. But the French defender's naive challenge on fellow countryman Mateta allowed the Eagles striker to give his side the lead from the penalty spot, though it took him two attempts due to a double touch.

With seconds of first-half stoppage time remaining, De Ligt slipped and was bailed out by a last-ditch Luke Shaw block with Eddie Nketiah bearing down on goal, and that would prove to be a turning point in the game.

The Red Devils came out for the second half with purpose and captain Fernandes would be at the centre of all of it, assisting goals for both Zirkzee and Mount from free-kicks. The two finishes were outstanding, as Zirkzee swivelled to fire home from the tightest of angles before Mount struck from the edge of the box to complete the turnaround.

Palace rallied late on, but United defended strongly to see out an outstanding away victory.

GOAL rates United's players from Selhurst Park...

Senne Lammens (6/10):

Beaten twice by Mateta from the spot but made a couple of important first-half saves to keep United in the game. 

Leny Yoro (5/10):

Made a brilliant block from Pino to deny a certain goal, but ruined his own good work with a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty just minutes later. Taken off by Amorim moments after the equaliser, and looked visibly distressed with his own performance on the bench.

Matthijs de Ligt (5/10):

Looked far from on his game, particularly during the first half. Mateta had the beating of him way too easily, while his errors presented chances to both the France striker and Nketiah. Defended more resolutely after the break.

Luke Shaw (7/10):

Made a great block from Nketiah, though he should not have had the chance. Defended strongly, and a yellow card was the only blot on his display.

Amad Diallo (6/10):

Did not get forward as much as he would have liked, but the Ivorian continues to be a key cog in Amorim's side and works tirelessly despite his unfamiliarity with the wing-back role.

Casemiro (6/10):

Was afforded two big chances and should have got his name on the scoresheet with the game goalless. Struggled to prevent Palace dictating play in the first half but, like many team-mates, improved in the second. 

Bruno Fernandes (7/10):

United's goals were all about the finishes, but it was no surprise to see the captain laying on the opportunities. He impacted the outcome of the game and worked hard for his side at both ends of the pitch to see out the victory.

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

The Portuguese's long throw caused havoc within the first minute, and he did his primary job well of keeping Munoz quiet in a solid display.

Bryan Mbeumo (6/10):

Was not the match-winner on this occasion but always looks a threat. Could have scored on a couple of occasions, only to be foiled by Henderson in goal.

Joshua Zirkzee (7/10):

Was quiet in the first half but his equalising goal was outstanding. Taking the ball on his chest, the Dutchman volleyed home from the angle to get his side back in the game.

Mason Mount (7/10):

Stepped up when it mattered in the game's defining moment. Profiting from Fernandes' quick free-kick, Mount fired the ball through a non-existent Palace wall and into the bottom corner of the net.

Noussair Mazraoui (6/10):

Replaced Yoro and defended stoutly with the exception of a moment of madness, where he smashed the ball at Zirkzee and almost saw the ball bounce into the net.

Lisandro Martinez (N/A):

Came on in the final 10 minutes to return from a long ACL injury lay-off, and helped see out the victory.

Kobbie Mainoo (N/A):

The 20-year-old made a cameo in stoppage time as United secured the win.

Patrick Dorgu (N/A):

Came on alongside Mainoo.

Ruben Amorim (7/10):

His team were a different side after half-time and showed character to turn things around. His decision to start Zirkzee and Mount certainly paid off, as the pair made a rare start and were instrumental to victory.

The Mexican government has presented its strategy to turn this summer's World Cup soccer tournament into an engine to strengthen trade, sports, tourism, and culture in the country where most of the games will be hosted. The Mexico 2026 Social World Cup project includes cultural events like soccer matches between robots, a public transit plan, and a new app where fans can sell securely sell any tickets they can't use.

During a conference last week, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the intention is “to leave a sporting legacy in our country that goes beyond the competition itself.”

“[In this World Cup] the eyes of the world will be here,” Sheinbaum said, “and what they will see is a great country with an enormous cultural heritage. They will see that we are building a nation that is fairer, freer, and more democratic.”

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held in Mexico, the United States and Canada next June and July. The proposal for the Social World Cup project includes more than 177 parties and 5,000 activities related to the event, as well as 74 tournaments and soccer cups aimed at students, workers, and the general public. It will also include close to 1,500 actions within the Vive Saludable program (which promotes healthy lifestyles) and the rehabilitation of 4,200 public sports fields and spaces.

The plan also aims to break three Guinness World Records: the “Largest Soccer Shirt Human Image,” the “Largest Soccer Class,” and the “Largest Soccer Mural.” A robotics world cup will also be organized in which autonomous robots, programmed and designed by national and international high school and undergraduate students, will participate. The call for the latter competition was opened on November 28, and all matches will be broadcast in the Mexican venues in real time.

Claudia Sheinbaum, President of Mexico, during the presentation of the "Mexico 2026 Social World Cup" plan, a federal initiative that sets the guidelines to host the next FIFA World Cup.

Among the actions presented is the creation of the “Conoce México” app; the name is Spanish for “Get to Know Mexico.” The app was developed jointly by the the country's Agency for Digital Transformation and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Tourism. According to the authorities, it will have an intuitive and accessible interface that will allow fans, both local and foreign, to consult updated information on matches, venues, routes, services, and cultural activities.

The application will have three main sections. First is a tourism section, where users can find information on World Cup venues, alternative events, cultural events in different locations, as well as gastronomic and ecotourism recommendations. An interactive tourist atlas will list more than 260 fan routes, points of interest and thematic roads.

There's a dedication section for 2026 World Cup tournament, including details about the stadiums and game schedules, as well as real time results and standings.

Finally, a Services section will provide information on transportation, connectivity, special tours, and mobility routes.

The application will be available in English and Spanish to cater to the approximately 5.5 million domestic and foreign visitors that Mexico expects to receive during the World Cup. Although there is still no definite date for its launch, it is expected to be ready in the next few months.

At the same press event, Iván Escalante, head of Mexico's Federal Consumer Protection Agency, or Profeco, announced that an agreement has been reached with FIFA to enable a ticket sales platform that will operate in Spanish and will display prices in Mexican pesos, in accordance with national legislation.

The official explained that, in addition, and in collaboration with the international organization, work is being done on a “ticket relocation system.” (In other words, there will be official resale of tickets.) This tool will allow those who cannot use their tickets for a World Cup match to sell them safely and at appropriate prices.

The objective is to avoid informal resale. “This platform will allow fans who are no longer going to use their tickets to make them available to someone else at fair prices,” said Escalante, who did not provide details on the progress of the project or its date of operation.

Profeco's plan has four key directives: The prevention and monitoring of misleading advertising; dissuasion through informative campaigns and surveillance operations; protection through attention modules in airports, stations, tourist centers, and stadiums; and the launching of assistance tools such. One example of that last point is the platform “Who's Who in the World Cup,” where fans can consult and compare prices of products and services in order to facilitate informed purchases.

This FIFA World Cup will be historic. For the first time in more than 90 years, the tournament will have three host countries. 48 national teams will participate—16 more than in any edition since 1998—and 104 matches will be played, which implies an extension of around 10 match days and 40 additional matches compared to previous tournaments.

In this context, the event represents a considerable opportunity to boost tourism and trade in Mexico. (The United States presented its own initiative that will give toruist visa processing priority to fans with tickets.) However, some studies warn that the championship could generate a significant environmental impact, in addition to increasing pressure on essential services such as water and electricity. These aspects were not directly addressed in the strategy laid out by Sheinbaum's government, at least for now.

Iran have qualified for a seventh World Cup

Iran say they plan to boycott Friday's 2026 World Cup draw in the United States because of the limited number of visas for their delegation.

According to the Tehran Times, the US has issued four visas to Iran's delegation, but they do not include one for Mehdi Taj, the president of the country's football federation.

Taj said he had spoken to Fifa president Gianni Infantino about the issue.

"We are evaluating our options, which will depend on timing and circumstances," Taj said in an interview with Iranian television on Thursday.

"We remain in close communication with the Iranian foreign ministry and other authorities, and we will take the necessary decision at the appropriate time.

"The current position of the Iran Football Federation executive committee is that no one will attend the event unless all visas are issued."

The draw is scheduled to take place in Washington DC on Friday, 5 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

US will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders 

Iran have qualified for their seventh World Cup finals and fourth in succession.

The US, which is co-hosting the 2026 tournament along with Canada and Mexico,  has long-standing strict visa restrictions on Iranians for political and security reasons.

In June, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from 12 countries from entering America, citing an effort to manage security threats.

Iran is among the countries affected by the ban, although the executive order is supposed to exempt athletes and coaching staff travelling for the World Cup and 2028 Olympics.

"It appears to us that the matter has become politicised," said Taj. "We informed the Fifa president, Mr. Infantino, that they have taken a political stance and the situation is completely politicised. 

"We believe that Fifa should take a stand against such behaviour."

Cole Palmer has missed recent national team call-ups due to a persistent groin injury and a fractured toe, hampering his involvement in England's 2026 World Cup planning. And there's more bad news for the Chelsea star as his absence from the official 2026 England calendar has caused some media speculation, with some fans worrying it is a "major hint" he could miss the World Cup. 

The 2026 England calendar will be a popular stocking filler for many excited young football fans this Christmas, but they certainly won't feature on anyone's present list in the Palmer household. The players included features the likes of Morgan Gibbs-White, Eberechi Eze, Morgan Rogers, and there's even a space for Jack Grealish. But The Blues' star forward and the man who scored the Three Lions' sole goal in the Euro 2024 final against Spain doesn't make the cut. 

The England store website says: "Celebrate the England National Team every day of the year with this 2026 Calendar. Featuring vibrant imagery and key dates, it's the perfect way to keep track of important events while showing your support."

However, sources from the FA have suggested that players were largely selected for the calendar based on appearances during the 2024/25 season for production deadlines, a campaign during which Palmer struggled with injury issues and limited playing time under manager Thomas Tuchel.

Palmer has had to sit out a number of matches recently with a variety of injuries, but the most recent injury to his toe has caused real intrigue, particularly regarding how it occurred. And team-mate Marc Cucurella has hinted it may have happened while playing popular football computer game FIFA. 

He told reporters on Monday: "To be fair, I don't believe it. It is true that these things can sometimes happen. I have had this a couple of times but I'm stronger than them, so I don't feel anything. It's a big upset for us because he's getting closer to playing with us, to train with us, and then now he needs to rest. But this is part of life, a part of footballers' lives, we have personal lives, and we have these kinds of problems, so hopefully he can recover fast." 

When asked what he was doing, Cucurella replied: "I don't know. He's running because I think he lost a FIFA game or something like this, I think!"

It has been a rollercoaster week for Palmer and the injury updates which have come from Blues boss Enzo Maresca. Midweek, Palmer was still recovering in a protective boot, by Friday he was in contention for the crunch London derby clash with Arsenal. 

Ahead of the game with Barcelona, Maresca said: "Yes, Cole is wearing a (protective) boot. We don't know when he will be back but for sure it will be soon. He's already on the pitch, he's already touching the ball, and the feeling (for him) is good. At the moment, we are only looking at tomorrow's game. It's a Champions League game against Barcelona, that is our focus, and then we will look ahead to Arsenal. I don't think he will be available for these two games, but he is doing well." 

But during his Friday press conference, he confirmed Palmer is ready to face the Gunners. Speaking to reporters, he said: "He is available for both (to start and to play). (His return will elevate the squad) A lot. As you said, he's probably our best player. We are happy he is back. We need to give him time to make sure he's 100 per cent fit. He has done fantastically in the past, and there is no doubt he will do fantastically in the future."

League leaders Arsenal visit Chelsea on Sunday with both teams in excellent form and the midfield clash featuring Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo will be key. A win for the Blues will move them to three points behind their north London rivals, but their recent record against Arteta's side is poor, having won just one of the last 11 Premier League encounters.

Out of almost nowhere, Chelsea have emerged as Arsenal's closest challengers for the Premier League title this season as the London rivals prepare to lock horns at Stamford Bridge this weekend - but is this another false dawn? After all, Enzo Maresca's side found themselves in a similar position midway through 2024-25 only to fall away dramatically in the second half of the campaign. Ahead of Sunday's showdown, though, there is reason to believe the Blues could have staying power this time around.

After grinding out wins against Wolves and Burnley, following the customary defeat of Tottenham on the road, Chelsea have - somehow - risen to second in the Premier League table ahead of hosting Mikel Arteta's early-season champions-elect, albeit they are still six points behind their cross-capital foes.

Serious doubts, though, remain over their ability to stay the course for the long-term - which are justified given the Blues haven't mounted a sustained title challenge since they last lifted the trophy nine seasons ago, and the backdrop of the club's tumultuous recent history since the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital takeover three years ago.

It's not long since Chelsea were in a similar position, either; around this time last season they surged into second place behind eventual league winners Liverpool, before failing miserably to deal with the packed festive schedule and sliding back down the standings amid a winter of discontent.

This time, though, things feel slightly different, with Maresca's side showing the kind of mettle and big-game aptitude that suggests they could have staying power for the season. However, the visit of the Arsenal juggernaut will be the ultimate test of their credentials at the top of the table.

Chelsea's start to the season was inauspicious as they picked up just two wins from six league games, leading many to believe that another top-four finish would be the best that they could hope for. Since the start of October, though, there has been a shift.

The sensational late victory over Arne Slot's toiling champions has proven to be the catalyst for a run of eight victories in 10 matches in all competitions, with the alarming home defeat to high-flying Sunderland late last month proving to be an anomaly in what could prove to be a defining period in the west Londoners' campaign.

Having dropped points in clashes they were expected to win earlier in the season against Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton, the Blues have defeated Nottingham Forest, Wolves and Burnley with relative ease, as well as notching another victory over Spurs in north London in one of the most one-sided 1-0 wins you're likely to see.

Of course, Chelsea's young squad reached the latest significant milestone in its progression in the Champions League in midweek, as they utterly dominated the 10 men of Barcelona at Stamford Bridge in a mightily impressive 3-0 thumping that sets them up very nicely for Sunday's top-of-the-table showdown.

For Maresca, this developing winning habit is vital to his side's chances of success: "Last year, we were playing in the Conference League, and I said many times that for me personally, if you want to build a winning mentality, there is only one way: winning games. Because otherwise, if you don't win games, it's difficult to convince the players, 'guys, we are building a winning mentality'," the Italian tactician said after Tuesday night's dismantling for the Catalan giants.

"But when we don't win, it's difficult. So the only way in any competition, Conference League, Champions League this season, Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, is to win games. It's the only way to build the winning mentality. And I think the Conference League and the Club World Cup last season helped a lot.

"And now we are trying to do exactly the same. For sure, the players are better players in this moment compared to last season, because we spent more time together."

In downing the mighty Barca by exploiting their recklessly high line, Maresca served up another timely reminder of his tactical acumen, but what has been even more impressive of late is his ability to utilise his whole squad without results and performances suffering.

No Premier League manager has made more changes to their starting XIs than the Italian so far in 2025-26, with the five he made for the Barcelona game from his team that eased past Burnley taking his tally for the season to a remarkable 102, and it's only November.

While he has a core of guaranteed starters in bigger games, Maresca has been able to lean on the likes of Tosin Adarabioyo, Andrey Santos, Jamie Gittens, fit-again Liam Delap and academy graduates Josh Acheampong and Tyrique George in lower-stakes situations - either from the start or as substitutes.

They have handled remarkably well without the talismanic Cole Palmer, too, who has made just four appearances this season due to a groin issue and subsequent broken toe. He has, though, been passed fit to play on Sunday. Meanwhile, defensive midfielders Romeo Lavia and Dario Essugo - whose imminent returns will strengthen the group again - have also been sidelined, as well as long-term absentee Levi Colwill.

That ability to rotate, and doing so successfully, could well prove to be vital for Chelsea as they fight on four fronts over the notoriously hectic winter period. If they require a two-legged play-off to reach the Champions League last 16 and make progress in the domestic cup competitions, then they face a brutal schedule of as many as 32 games in the next four months.

There will, of course, still be question marks over whether Chelsea have the staying power to go the distance and truly challenge Arsenal - who look ominously capable of becoming runaway leaders - all the way until the final day of the campaign, especially given the young group's lack of experience in that department.

If we zoom out, the Blues are only one point better off than at the same stage last season, and they have certainly benefitted from unrecognisable champions Liverpool and, to a lesser extent, disjointed Manchester City underperforming considerably to this point.

As we've touched upon, their title challenge completely unravelled over the winter period last term before they managed to steady the ship in time to secure a top-four finish on the final day. Even when they were second, Maresca was consistent in his messaging that his team were 'not ready' for a title challenge, although that led some to question whether he had manifested their downturn in form with his pessimistic outlook.

It will be very interesting to see how Chelsea contend with the relentless nature of the schedule this time around, but there is a sense that things are different one year on in terms of cohesiveness, togetherness and strength in depth - something the manager has recognised, albeit he maintains it is too early to predict what they are capable of.

Speaking in his press conference ahead of welcoming the Gunners, Maresca insisted it would still be premature to judge his side, but admitted things have changed: "I think it's too early in any case. If we win, if we don't win, I think it's too early. We are still, end of November, we are still five, six months to go. I think it's very important when we're going to be in February, March, where we are, and from there we decide and we see if we can achieve something important.

"The mindset and mood in this moment, for us, is very good. We are doing quite well in the Premier League and the Champions League. We are evolving and growing. This is the best feeling for us.

"For sure, it's different compared to one year ago because we spent one more year together. Then again, we are at the end of November so it is very early. It's important to be where we are now in March/April and then we will see."

The meeting with the seemingly unstoppable Arsenal, who steamrollered Europe's other form team Bayern Munich in midweek, will be the ultimate litmus test of how far Chelsea have progressed, and a barometer of just how far they can go this season. Few fans would have given them a chance of victory a matter of weeks ago, but now it feels like a game that's very hard to call, with the mood around the club far more buoyant.

That is thanks in no small part to Maresca's side demonstrating the strides they have made by rediscovering their ability to challenge and win in the biggest games, having beaten Liverpool, Spurs and Barcelona in 2025-26, while they boast further victories over Paris Saint-Germain, the Reds and Tottenham this calendar year.

"These players, in 16/17/18 months together, they showed many times that they can beat teams," Maresca said. "In the Premier League last year I think we had some good moments where we were able to beat teams. Then PSG, the Club World Cup final. This season, I don't know, against Liverpool or Barcelona. We compete always. Sometimes we are able to win, sometimes we are not able to win. But it's important that we compete against any team."

On Sunday, Chelsea's young squad will need to call on all the experience they've gleaned from those encounters if they are to stop Arsenal in their tracks and prove to their rivals and their doubters that they can be the team to push the Gunners all the way this season.

U.S. international Brian White sent a timely reminder of his quality, powering the Vancouver Whitecaps to their first MLS Cup final with a first-half brace. His early impact guided a commanding 3-1 win over San Diego FC, a match effectively settled before halftime as Jesper Sørensen's side overwhelmed Mikey Varas' team and added an own goal via Pablo Sisniega.

Vancouver struck first through White, who finished from close range on the right side of the box after a pass from Andrés Cubas. Moments later, the lead doubled via a Pablo Sisniega own goal, and before halftime White struck again - a low, composed finish inside the left post assisted by Ali Ahmed - making it 3-0.

In the second half, Mexico international Hirving Lozano pulled one back for San Diego with a right-footed curler from outside the box after an assist from Anders Dreyer. But any hopes of a late push disappeared when Sisniega was shown a red card in the 79th minute.



Thomas Muller started and played 60 minutes but was largely quiet, finishing with zero shots and 82 percent passing.

Vancouver will now face Lionel Messi's Inter Miami next Saturday in a highly anticipated showdown between two clubs making their first appearance in MLS Cup. San Diego, an expansion side in their inaugural season, can hold their heads high after a run to the Western Conference finals - an impressive debut year.

Brian White was the clear standout, striking twice in the first half to send Vancouver to the MLS Cup final. The USMNT forward now has 18 goals this season, reinforcing his status as one of Sørensen's key players. He heads into next weekend's final in top form as the Whitecaps look to pull off an upset against Messi and Inter Miami.

Mikey Varas will face criticism for choosing not to start Hirving ‘Chucky' Lozano in San Diego's most important match of the season. The Mexican star didn't enter until the team trailed 3-0, though he scored their lone goal after coming on.

The tactical approach also fell short. Playing at home, San Diego were outplayed and effectively eliminated within the first half - a disappointing ending to an otherwise historic inaugural season.

≡ FIFA WORLD CUP 2026 ≡

The latest tussle concerning the 2026 FIFA World Cup came Friday when Iran, one of the qualified countries, said it would not attend the 5 December Final Draw in Washington, D.C., as three of its football federation officials were denied visas to enter the U.S.

Iran federation spokesman Amir Mehdi Alavi told the English-language Tehran Times:

“We have informed FIFA that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw.”

Four officials obtained visas: head coach Amir Ghalenoei, executive director Mehdi Kharati, international relations director Omid Jamali and Alavi. Federation president Mehdi Taj and two others had their applications denied.

The Trump Administration has tightened entry controls considerably via an Executive Order in June, with Iran on a list of 19 countries with restricted entry; exceptions were noted in the Order for:

“any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

Iran and Haiti are the two World Cup qualifiers impacted by the order.

Nevertheless, the Final Draw will go on next Friday and who plays where will be determined; it will be fascinating to see if Iran and/or Haiti end up placed in groups which play most or all of their matches in Canada or Mexico.

¶

Is this important? As the Iranian noted, this is “unrelated to sport” and all about the long-standing animosity with the U.S. since the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979. So, no.

It is a complete side show to the FIFA World Cup itself, which will expand to 48 teams and 104 matches in 2026 from 32 teams and 64 matches in 2022. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino (SUI) has said that six billion people around the world; global population estimates are at about 8.2 billion. For the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, he said five billion people would watch some part of the tournament, with the FIFA follow-up audience review listing 4.792 billion “intended to reflect the total number of people who engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 in any manner, extending beyond TV reach and audience measurement.”

So, a lot of people will have heard something about the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and the Trump Administration has made its success a priority, establishing a White House Task Force. And this is an important proof-of-concept for FIFA, which is organizing the tournament itself – no in-country organizing committees any more – out of its offices in Coral Gables, Florida. FIFA has even talked about expanding its organizing efforts outside of football, assuming its 2026 experiment is successful.

That will depend on three things, which above all else will make the 2026 FIFA World Cup a success. They are basic and obvious, but these are the things that count:

● (1) The teams and accompanying officials need to be able to travel, train and compete without undue difficulties.

This is obvious, but in a charged environment like the World Cup and especially in the U.S., this is not to be taken for granted. The security apparatus will be enormous and beyond threats from outsiders, have we forgotten already the Canadian women's drone-spying scandal that surfaced at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games?

● (2) Spectators need to be able to get their purchased tickets and be able to get in and out of the stadia to watch the matches safely.

Again, totally obvious. But for the 2024 Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium outside of Miami, Florida, an after-action report stated that “20,000 to 30,000 patrons had a plan to arrive early, park off site, then crash the entry gates with overwhelming numbers was not gathered and shared by any intelligence source. Had this information been known, our plan would have been modified for this contingency.”

But the stadium, police and security staff were not ready and the kickoff between Colombia and Argentina was delayed for 82 minutes while the situation was brought under some level of control. Fifty-four people were ejected and 26 people were arrested; the same stadium will host seven World Cup matches.

No doubt Hard Rock Stadium will be heavily secured; but there are a record 16 stadia involved in this World Cup. The enormous attention paid to the tournament make it an attractive target for political protests of all kinds (no, Israel did not qualify).

● (3) The broadcast of the matches, on all platforms, has to work perfectly.

This is the least likely of the three core competencies for the tournament to be affected, since all of the venues regularly host major events that are televised and the infrastructure in all (most?) are hardened against difficulties.

While trouble in a stadium directly affects the people attending, trouble with broadcasts will impact millions of viewers worldwide. Here, FIFA has help from its production team but also its broadcast partners, especially those who work in the 2026 stadiums on a continuous basis. In the U.S., FOX has the broadcast rights.

Taking care of those three things will almost guarantee a successful tournament for FIFA and although obvious, are not assured.

A wild card for the entire tournament, which will run for more than a month – 11 June to 19 July – would be civil unrest, possibly tied to 2026 state or local primary elections which will take place during the World Cup period (New York is the only state with a World Cup venue – in New Jersey – an election primary during the World Cup itself.

Fan festivals, which FIFA is very proud of, are less secure than the stadia and could be a target, mostly under the control of the local host committees rather than FIFA itself. And those host cities know it.

And, will there be other conflicts, international, political or cultural, which pop up during the tournament? There's no “Olympic Truce” for FIFA and the Trump Administration is not going to be taking five weeks off.

All the other elements aren't that important, because if the teams can play, the fans can see and people can watch the matches, the World Cup will be great. Because, in the end, the players and teams always are.

After more than two years of waiting, Lionel Messi finally has a chance to lift MLS Cup. The Argentine superstar guided Inter Miami to their first-ever trip to the championship game, sealing a 5-1 win over NYCFC in the Eastern Conference final. And he'll have another countryman to thank: Tadeo Allende, whose first-half brace set the tone for Javier Mascherano's side.

It wasn't Messi's most prolific performance - but it didn't have to be. His teammates did the heavy lifting, especially Allende, who tied the MLS postseason record for goals with a hat trick.

NYCFC opened the contest at Chase Stadium just as they have throughout the postseason: compact, taking away space, and looking to counter. It worked for the first 10 minutes, before the Herons' attack finally sparked. Messi created a clear-cut chance from a set piece, finding Jordi Alba at the back post, only for USMNT goalkeeper Matt Freese to block the header. Four minutes later, the breakthrough came.

Allende received a perfectly weighted pass in the box and made no mistake with a diagonal finish to put Miami up 1-0. Eight minutes after that, he was back again. Alba spotted Allende charging toward goal from 25 yards out and lofted a gorgeous long ball over the top, which the striker headed home. Inter Miami looked to be cruising, but NYCFC hit back in the 37th minute as lax defending allowed Justin Haak to nod in a set-piece header.

Miami turned ruthless after the break. Mateo Silvetti finally came alive following a quiet first half, coolly slotting home off a Messi assist - the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's lone goal contribution of the night. Alba followed with an outrageous backheel to set up Telasco Segovia, and Allende added his third to restore Miami's four-goal cushion and put the game out of reach.

The win ensures Inter Miami will host MLS Cup against the Western Conference finalists, the Vancouver Whitecaps. 

GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Chase Stadium....

Rocco Rios Novo (5/10):

A shaky performance from the 23-year-old, who couldn't do much with the first goal he conceded, but almost gave away Miami's advantage in the second half. He is very lucky NYCFC couldn't take advantage of a giveaway from Inter Miami's goalkeeper. He also made some ill-timed runs off his line. Did make an incredible save on Julian Fernandez, which prevented a game-tying opportunity in the 67th minute. 

Jordi Alba (9/10):

Typical Alba performance, excellent in his assist to Allende in the first half, but left spaces open at times for NYCFC to exploit. Delivered one of the best assists of the season with his behind-the-back delivery to Segovia. 

Noah Allen (6/10):

Allen always puts a shit on the back end, but doesn't offer much going forward. Had a then-game high five defensive contributions before being pulled off due to his yellow card for Yannick Bright.

Sergio Busquets (6/10):

The legendary midfielder was put in the backline for his ability to distribute from the center back position, which he did. Yet, his lack of mobility, especially laterally, gave NYCFC a weakness to exploit. 

Maxi Falcon (6/10):

Solid but not spectacular. Typical showing from the center back. 

Marcelo Weigandt (6/10):

Wasn't the worst game from the fullback, and he actually offered some positive glimpses in the first half. Yet, once Hannes Wolf came on, the 25-year-old couldn't handle NYCFC's Austrian winger and was quickly replaced by Ian Fray in the second half. 

Baltasar Rodríguez (6/10):

NYCFC kept the match compact, and as a result, the young midfielder didn't have much space to operate in. Quiet night overall. 

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

Miami's big summer signing contributed on both sides of the ball, helping the Herons push forward and also helping his club win back possession with X recoveries. 

Mateo Silvetti (8/10):

Withdrawn from his typical winger/forward spot, the 19-year-old played in a No. 10 spot and was less effective in the first half than he had been in previous weeks. Yet, he effectively booked Miami's trip to the finals with his goal in the second half. 

Lionel Messi (7/10):

This wasn't Messi's best outing, with NYCFC swarming him on nearly every touch. But after the postseason he's had — and with the performances his teammates delivered on Saturday - it didn't really matter.

Tadeo Allende (10/10):Who needs Neymar or Luis Suárez when you have Allende? Jokes aside, the unheralded Argentine - quietly brought in on loan from Celta Vigo - has turned into one of Inter Miami's smartest pickups. And he showed it again when his team needed him most. In a tense, grinding match, it was the 26-year-old's clinical edge in front of goal that finally brought calm and confidence to Mascherano's side. Almost had a hat trick, but his header sailed wide. 

Telasco Segovia (7/10):

Took full advantage of Alba's outrageous backheel, applying a composed finish to cap Miami's second-half surge.

Yannick Bright (6/10):

A steady, if unspectacular, outing from the Italian midfielder, who helped Miami manage the game and close out the win.

Ian Fray (6/10):

Provided stability at right-back after coming on, especially with Hannes Wolf growing dangerous on the flanks.

Luis Suárez (5/10):

Replaced Silvetti but struggled to match Miami's uptempo rhythm, never quite finding his footing in the flow of the match.

Javier Mascherano (8/10):

Mascherano has fully settled into his postseason groove. Once again, he showed he's unafraid to make bold calls - from benching Suárez to trusting his young emerging players - and his tactical flexibility was central to Miami's dominance in the Conference Final. His fingerprints are all over this MLS Cup run.

Novak Djokovic is plenty familiar with lifting trophies. The Serbian superstar has earned 101 tour-level singles crowns during his illustrious career.

But on Saturday at the Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix Sprint Race, Djokovic was the one handing trophies to others. The 38-year-old presented hardware to winner Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Lando Norris.

Djokovic has gotten to know plenty of F1 drivers over the years. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings had a nice chat with Russell two years ago in Monte-Carlo, spoke with the Briton last year at Wimbledon and enjoyed a conversation with Norris in Qatar one year ago. Piastri appreciated his moment with Djokovic Saturday, posting a photo of them on his Instagram Stories.

Djokovic also crossed paths with members of legendary band Metallica, taking a photo with Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo. Ulrich's father, Torben Ulrich, was a professional tennis player who in singles made the fourth round at three of the four majors.

Just when you thought 2025 couldn't get any better for Lorenzo Musetti: On Saturday, he and longtime partner Veronica Confalonieri welcomed their second son, Leandro, to the world."Love is multiplied," wrote the world No. 8 in introducing the new family of four on Instagram. The couple announced Confalonieri's second pregnancy in May, and their new addition joins their first son, Ludovico, who was born last March.The birth announcement was met warmly by Musetti's tennis family, with sweet comments left by his fellow Italians Lucia Bronzetti, Sara Errani, Jasmine Paolini and Martina Trevisan, as well as Marta Kostyuk and Holger Rune.

Last year, Musetti confessed that Ludovico's birth helped him mature as a player and person. The change in perspective that came with first-time fatherhood led to a breakout season where he reached the Wimbledon semifinals, and won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics.Read more: Family Guy: Lorenzo Musetti is taking his responsibility as a dad to heart"The birth of my son gave me a lot of responsibility on the Lorenzo player, not just of the figure of the father," he told TENNIS.com at the end of 2024.

Even if I think I have to do more, that will bring me probably even more results."But after a 2025 season that saw him continue to rise—he broke into the ATP Top 10 for the first time and qualified for his first year-end ATP Finals—will the addition of Leandro spur the 23-year-old on to even greater things in 2026?

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

Just 12 points separates Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in the title battle after the Red Bull driver's win in Qatar.

Max Verstappen claimed a crucial victory in the Qatar Grand Prix from Oscar Piastri, with the title battle set to go down to the final round as championship leader Lando Norris could only finish fourth.

Verstappen's unlikely win was courtesy of McLaren's alternative strategy which came as a consequence of an early Safety Car intervention and an enforced 25-lap maximum stint length on all Pirelli tyre sets.

The Red Bull driver jumped Norris on the run to the first turn from P3 on the grid and shadowed poleman Piastri in the opening laps before a clash between Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly at Turn 1 several laps later turned the race on its head.

While all drivers pitted for the first of two mandatory pit stops in the 57-lap race, both Piastri and Norris remained out on track, which ultimately put them behind Verstappen in the final order.

Piastri was able to comfortably rejoin in a net-P2 after his final pit stop having shown strong pace out front all race, but Norris was unable to clear the chasing Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli after his pit stop.

The Drivers' Championship leader passed Antonelli on the penultimate lap as the Mercedes driver ran wide, and means a 22-point margin ahead of the race has been reduced to just 12 points from Verstappen with Piastri 16 adrift ahead of the final race.

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season for Williams, having jumped Antonelli through the opening pit stop phase, while Antonelli ensured Mercedes moved closer to P2 in the Constructors' Championship with P5.

Behind Antonelli, Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls was on course for P6 before a left-front puncture three laps from the end, which promoted George Russell, the Mercedes driver having lost three positions on the opening lap.

The top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso, via a full 360-degree spin for the Aston Martin driver, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull).

Alex Albon (Williams) was P11 from Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine).

Esteban Ocon finished P15 as the Haas driver was handed a five-second penalty for a false start, finishing ahead of Gasly. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end.

Ollie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly.

As the lights went out Norris from P2 suffered the slightly worse start amongst the title challengers, allowing Verstappen to move ahead before the long-right of Turn 1 and slot in behind Piastri, who comfortably held the lead from pole.

The Australian had already broken DRS range by the end of the opening lap and put his head down as the gaps between the leading runners began to expand almost immediately, with following proving extremely difficult through the high-speed corners.

Further back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners.

Gasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre.

The German had passed Leclerc into Turn 1 in the opening laps and tried the outside line with Gasly shortly after, but the Sauber driver was left in the gravel on the exit with his right-rear tyre hanging off.

The left-front of the Alpine had made contact with the Sauber, the stewards investigating but taking no further action as Gasly resumed.

The incident brought out the Safety Car just inside the window which would allow drivers to run the remaining 50 laps with just the need for one more pit stop, with a 25-lap limit imposed for all sets of tyres by Pirelli.

Critically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders.

Ocon had also initially stayed out but was handed a five-second penalty for a false start and entered the pit lane after the majority of the field and rejoined at the back.

Racing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10.

The McLarens began to lap more than 1s a lap faster than the rest of the field, all of whom would be required to stop on Lap 32 to make the end on a two-stop strategy.

In turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6.

Norris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris.

Piastri soon caught the back of Antonelli and immediately dived up the inside at Turn 1 on the start of Lap 30, but Norris was unable to pass Antonelli at the same spot two laps later.

The McLarens found themselves back at the front as the the majority of the field made the pit lane a hive of activity on Lap 32, with Verstappen rejoining in P3 on the hard tyre but only 7.6 behind Piastri.

Norris ran wide at the high-speed right of Turn 14, running over the kerb and nearly spinning, asking his team over the radio to check for damage as he began to fall into the clutches of Verstappen.

Piastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind.

Piastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44.

Rejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead.

With Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi.

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6.

The top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points.

The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees.

"This was an incredible race for us," said Verstappen. "We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car. That was smart. Of course, I'm super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end. Incredible.

"I think [the pace] was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where it was a little bit tough. We still won the race and that was the most important thing."

F1 will travel straight to Abu Dhabi for the final race of the season from December 5-7 where the 2025 Drivers' title will be decided. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action from the Yas Marina Circuit.

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

Leonardo Fornaroli sealed the 2025 Formula 2 title, matching the likes of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto in becoming a back-to-back Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion.

Victor Martins put in a superb performance to win this weekend's Feature Race in Qatar, leading home Leonardo Fornaroli in second place, a result that saw the Italian become the 2025 Formula 2 Champion.

Fornaroli started from pole but a slow getaway allowed Martins to take the lead heading into Turn 1, an advantage the ART Grand Prix driver would not relinquish.

The Williams Driver Academy member did not have it all his own way though, as he was forced to hold off Fornaroli's charge in the closing stages. However, Martins did just enough to take a first win of the season.

With results going in his favour, Fornaroli's second place saw the Invicta Racing driver follow in the footsteps of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto by becoming a back-to-back Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion.

Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne finished in third, beating Campos Racing's Arvid Lindblad to the final spot on the podium.

Sebastián Montoya was fifth for PREMA Racing, ahead of MP Motorsport's Richard Verschoor and Campos debutant Nikola Tsolov.

Roman Stanek was eighth for Invicta, ahead of the charging Hitech TGR pairing of Dino Beganovic and Luke Browning in ninth and 10th respectively.

That takes us to Abu Dhabi for the final round and while the Drivers' Championship has been decided, the battle for the Teams' title between Invicta Racing, Hitech TGR and Campos Racing looks set to go down to the wire.

Russell confident Mercedes can clinch P2 in the Constructors' battle in Abu Dhabi

Tsunoda ready to help Verstappen ‘as much as possible' in Abu Dhabi title fight

Oscar Piastri continued his superb run of form in Qatar as he claimed pole position to set the stage for a crucial Grand Prix.

In what could be an important moment for the championship, Oscar Piastri snatched pole position for the Qatar Grand Prix from Lando Norris, with fellow title contender Max Verstappen settling for third place.

A tense ending to Qualifying saw Norris abort his final attempt, allowing Piastri to charge to the top spot with a rapid time of 1m 19.387s, just over a tenth clear of his team mate. With Verstappen just behind, Norris' challenge of winning the race to secure the Drivers' Championship has been made that little bit harder.

Outside of the top three, the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli took P4 and P5 respectively, beating two impressive laps from Isack Hadjar and Carlos Sainz.

The Spaniard was involved in one of two unusual incidents that happened in quick succession during Q3 – Charles Leclerc suffered a massive spin, and Sainz was sent onto the track with a sticker on his right-rear tyre, which fell off onto the circuit. The session was temporarily halted to recover the debris, giving the drivers a brief pause before their final laps.

Leclerc's spin was just one part of a frustrating Qualifying for Ferrari as Lewis Hamilton was once again knocked out in P18, the same position he claimed in Friday's Sprint Qualifying.

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri continued his momentum from Sprint Qualifying as he took a strong victory over George Russell and Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri stormed to a commanding victory in the Qatar Sprint, comprehensively beating George Russell and the second McLaren of Lando Norris in the 19-lap event.

Piastri led the field away confidently from pole position and came under little threat, with the exception of the tyre performance dropping off in the later laps, while the lead Mercedes kept Norris at bay to maintain second place.

The third title contender Max Verstappen could only improve from sixth to fourth as he continued to experience a frustrating issue with porpoising, while Kimi Antonelli initially took fifth place after Yuki Tsunoda was handed a time penalty for exceeding track limits.

However, Antonelli was also dealt a five-second penalty after the chequered flag, dropping the Mercedes rookie back to sixth and leaving Tsunoda with four points. Alonso and Carlos Sainz rounded out the points-paying positions in a Sprint dictated by tyre management and staying cleanly on the track.

Sprint results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS QATAR GRAND PRIX 2025

There was just one hour of practice on offer on Friday, increasing the pressure to put together a perfect lap in Sprint Qualifying to dictate the order for the 19-lap event. Piastri stormed to pole position on his final attempt, putting him in the best position to claim the maximum eight points for a win.

The Australian edged out the lead Mercedes of Russell by just 0.032s, while an error saw Norris find the gravel at the final corner, dropping him out of contention for the top spot. Alonso was an impressive fourth for Aston Martin, with Tsunoda taking P5, unexpectedly outqualifying his Red Bull team mate Verstappen.

The Dutchman typically excels in Sprint Qualifying, having secured 10 pole positions in this format, but he settled for sixth on the grid on this occasion.

It was an even trickier day for Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton, whose performance was summarised by his 10-word response in the post-session interview as he was knocked out of SQ1 in P18. As a result, the team elected to make changes to the car overnight under parc ferme conditions, leaving him to start from the pit lane – Lance Stroll, Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto found themselves in the same situation.

As the other 16 contenders lined up on the grid and the tyre blankets were removed, it was revealed that the medium compound was the tyre of choice for the majority, with a mix of used and fresh for the frontrunners.

The lights went out at the Lusail International Circuit and Piastri got the launch he needed to charge away from Russell, who immediately had to defend against Norris as they headed down to Turn 1. Just behind, Alonso lost out the most as he was passed by both Red Bulls, with Verstappen improving to P4 within what was a dream couple of corners for him.

It was a less than ideal opening lap for Charles Leclerc, who went wide at Turn 2 and dropped from ninth to 13th, landing him in a midfield DRS train. Things didn't look much better for his team mate Hamilton, who was still lingering in P18 after failing to improve on his pit lane start.

As Piastri sped up the road, establishing a gap of over a second on the first few laps, Verstappen unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Norris for third place before reporting that “the bouncing is still very bad” – he struggled with porpoising throughout Friday's running and it was evident that the problem had not been fully resolved.

As he continued relaying issues with both the radio quality and the car “jumping”, a chunk of Carlos Sainz's Williams was thrown onto the circuit while he was running in P8, but with Isack Hadjar 1.7s behind, he could afford to manage the damage.

Back at the front of the field, Piastri appeared to be in a league of his own having extended his lead to two seconds over Russell by Lap 11. The Mercedes driver was warned that tyre degradation could begin to come into play, but the top three were in little danger of changing order.

There was more action outside of the points-paying positions as Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson battled with Leclerc, veering off track while trying to pass the Ferrari. He quickly gave the position back and was not the only one finding difficulty staying within track limits – Tsunoda was revealed to be under investigation for going over the white line too many times, and he was subsequently handed a five-second time penalty.

That proved to be good news for Kimi Antonelli, who improved to P6 when Alonso drifted wide at the final corner and looked to gain another position from the Red Bull driver's penalty if he could stay within the track limits himself.

However, the Italian youngster ended up being handed a time penalty for identical reasons to Tsunoda, ultimately leaving him in sixth place. He nevertheless had a much better Sprint than the Ferrari pair, who scored zero points as Leclerc and Hamilton crossed the line in P13 and P17 respectively.

Others who failed to score were Hadjar in P9 and Alex Albon in P10, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman, meaning that Kick Sauber is still the only team without a point from a Sprint this season.

Lawson was 14th ahead of Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg, with the remaining pit lane starters treating the session as a testing event and pitting for fresh tyres at various stages.

"I mean it's been a good weekend so far," said Piastri. "I think everything went smoothly in the Sprint. I'm happy with how it's been so far, just need to keep it rolling."

Following the Sprint, the drivers will return to the track for Qualifying for the Qatar Grand Prix at 1800 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

	Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph is many credits removed from her once-nascent career — which began with breakout roles in Dolemite Is My Name and continued with Hulu‘s Only Murders in the Building — but there's one early project she keeps revisiting alongside co-star Zoë Kravitz: High Fidelity.


	When asked if she would ever want the series to return after its abrupt cancellation, Randolph told Rolling Stone: “Absolutely. We all feel the same way. Zoë and I talk about it all the time, like, ‘How can we figure this out?' Give it back to the people, but really give it back to us, because we just really love it.”

	She continued, noting the difficulty of revitalizing a project: “But it's a really tricky one, because you're trying to recapture lightning in a bottle. Sometimes you have to just let things be what it is organically and trust in the process to find the next thing.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2020 series offered a modernized, gender-swapped take on the John Cusack romantic comedy classic (starring Kravitz's mother, actress Lisa Bonet, and itself based on Nick Hornby's 1995 novel); it centers on Robyn “Rob” Brooks (Kravitz), a young music-obsessed record store owner in Brooklyn, as she reflects on the ups and downs of her previous failed relationships. Randolph starred as Cherise, an employee at Championship Vinyl and one of Rob's closest friends. 


	Though critic and audience reviews were overwhelmingly positive, the series was canceled on Hulu after one season. To make matters worse, the finale ended on a cliffhanger of sorts, with Rob choosing to be Jake Lacy's Clyde after being torn between him and Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Toward the closing moments of the show, Clyde said he believes there's only a dismal “9%” chance the relationship rekindling will work.


	Kravitz has often discussed her disappointment with the conclusion of the series, telling Elle earlier this year, “That's where I really learned about producing and editing and writing, and man, I'm sad. I keep on going back to Hulu and trying to get them to re-up it, but they won't. They're not interested.”

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

The great Nina Hoss doesn't need to work herself up into crying onstage or onscreen if the moment is right and she's really feeling it.

 










Earlier this year, in spring 2025, the Berlin Silver Bear-winning actress (2007's “Yella”) starred onstage at St. Ann's Warehouse in Dumbo, New York City, as melancholy matriarch Lyubov Ranevskaya in Benedict Andrews' “The Cherry Orchard,” an adaptation of the Anton Chekhov classic. Seated two rows from the theater-in-the-round-style stage at St. Ann's, I observed Hoss actually weeping during a key emotional scene.

In her latest exquisite performance in a long career of them already, as Eileen Lovborg in writer/director Nia DaCosta's gender-swapped Henrik Ibsen adaptation “Hedda,” Hoss also lathers herself up into gamut-spanning stages of emotional distress. Whether wasted out of her mind after Hedda Gabler (Tessa Thompson) coaxes Hoss' imperious literature professor off the wagon, or a sobbing, heaving wreck of herself when the pages of her latest book go missing at a 1950s mansion party. It's another extraordinary, unmannered, and deeply felt performance from one of Europe's best working actors.

“It's slightly weird to talk about that because, in a way, I don't even think of [how to make myself cry]. When I put myself in this situation, in this moment, that's just what happens,” said Hoss, who will receive this year's Spotlight Award at the 2026 winter IndieWire Honors ceremony on Thursday, December 4. “I don't have another part of my brain going on to push me into creating tears, like a technique. Some [actors] can, when they go, ‘OK, I can cry like this,' I could potentially. But I don't see it as a competition in ‘can I cry on the spot or not?' I need the situation that the character's in to put myself into that moment, and then that's what happens. That happened every show [of ‘The Cherry Orchard'] because I find it genuinely sad in that moment.”

 










Hoss, who starred as Cate Blanchett's watchful partner in “TÁR” and on TV's “Homeland” for three seasons, is best known for her alchemical collaborations with director Christian Petzold across six films: There was “Yella,” but also “Barbara,” “Phoenix,” and more, though Hoss has not worked with the director since 2014's devastating post-World War II drama “Phoenix,” where she played a Hitchcockian Auschwitz survivor whose husband does not recognize her after facial reconstructive surgery. And the story of how Petzold discovered Hoss for his 2001 film “Something to Remind Me” is Hitchcockian in itself, much the way Hitch discovered Tippi Hedren in a TV commercial for diet soda.

This was after Hoss broke out in the 1996 period drama “A Girl Called Rosemary.”

“I was aware… that I could be put into a certain kind of drawer when I did my first big role, which was huge in Germany. Eight million people saw it, and that was the part of a prostitute, a woman who really existed,” Hoss said. “It was a criminal story, and I looked a bit like Marilyn Monroe, so you could think, ‘Oh, my God, she's the new sex-bomb blonde thing.' Luckily enough, you have to go on talk shows to promote the film. Obviously, I said things that didn't sound too dumb, and that's why Christian Petzold saw one of these talk shows and said, ‘Oh, she's completely different from what I thought she would be.' We met, and we worked on six films together after that. That hindered me [from] falling into that kind of trap, or having to work myself out of that perception [as a sex symbol].”

 










“Then it was over with being a sex bomb — when I started working with Christian,” Hoss laughed. “There was one headline that I actually thought was amazing. It was like, ‘The pin-up girl for intellectuals.'”

In “Hedda,” Hoss plays a role originally written for a man, flipped for the first time here into a bisexual woman who Thompson's disaffected and devious social climber once loved. Hoss had previously spent six years onstage in a German repertory theater production of “Hedda Gabler” in various roles, including as Hedda herself. “She's a destructive person, but she's not a psychopath,” Hoss said of Hedda.

“We have this repertoire system, which means I'm part of the ensemble, which I was for like 25 years,” Hoss said. “I played different characters each night. So I played Medea the evening before I play a comedy. After that, then I play Hedda, then I play Emilia Galotti. Sometimes, I had six plays running at the same time. That's how the repertoire system is in Germany. You get to revisit Hedda, sometimes after having a break of two weeks, or sometimes even a month. It's still fresh and new and vulnerable because you try to remember the text, and at the same time, you want to push yourself and find something new. Then, you grow older with the character … and there's always one moment [where] there's something that could be better. All of a sudden, it clicks, because you had an experience, and you say, ‘Oh, that's why she said that' or ‘I need to change that.' You have little revelations because you spend so much time with the character.”

 










Hoss shot “Hedda” in early 2024 in the United Kingdom, where she said playing Ibsen's Ejlert part as the female Eileen was “easy for me, in a way, because just by the fact that she's a woman, it made it so much more dangerous for Hedda, and I think that's what I was always looking for. While playing Hedda, I thought it would be so interesting — and I was never quite sure — it comes with the play that Ibsen wrote that these two men that Hedda is framed with [including her husband George] are not really on her level. Here with Eileen, there is someone on her level, and they meet eye to eye, and all of a sudden, Hedda is in danger because there is someone who really knows her, and knows how manipulative she is, and finds that exciting but is also aware of what she's capable of doing.”

Hoss ultimately had to confront her feelings about Ejlert circa her days on the stage by stepping into his very shoes for this gorgeously sinuous film: “That came somehow with just being a woman at the time because it's still [Ibsen's] text. I'm saying a man's words. There was no discrepancy. The fight is the same. Because of the patriarchal structure Eileen is under, that makes it so much more of an existential struggle for her than it is for Ejlert. That was just phenomenal to explore and work on.”

 










Something I always like to ask actors who play characters in various states of inebriation: What's the secret to playing a good, old-fashioned sloppy drunk? By the end of “Hedda,” Eileen is properly sauced despite showing up to her former protégé's party newly sober. Shooting out of order, Hoss had to teeter quite literally between different registers of sobriety and not.

“That was the main thing I always [asked] Nia, ‘So where am I now? What state am I in? How drunk is she?' At a certain point, I also thought there are some moments, like when you go into water, that sober you. If you have this existential moment that she knows she probably lost her manuscript, after that, you're not that drunk anymore. It's as if it flushes all the alcohol out of your system. These were the things I had to be very precise with, and then you just have to rein it in. It's such fun playing drunk, but it's not very interesting to watch,” she laughed. “It's always more interesting to see someone struggling, trying to keep it together, because that's what drunks do. They pretend they're not drunk.”

Hoss' character in “Tár” — Lydia's (Blanchett) partner but also the first violinist of the Berlin symphony — is more emotionally restricted and always watching. In “Hedda,” Hoss gets to unleash emotionally, though onscreen breakdowns never take a piece out of her the way they might other actors.

 










“I'm good at switching off because, at the end of the day, I experience it in this moment. I just try to live it in that moment, and then when it's over, it's over,” Hoss said. “You have to hold it at a certain energy level because you know you probably have to do it several times. So I know I can't relax, but I don't stay in it because I'm not living it then. Once the scene is over, I have a little break, and then I go back in, but I don't carry it. It's not intervening in my life.”

But, Hoss said, it depends what you're working on. “If it's continuously dark, like when I did ‘Medea,' that puts you into a slightly depressive mode. To motivate what she's doing, and what she's going through, to put her in that moment, is so dark and heavy that it's hard [not to] get into a bad mood about the world and life, everything, relationships. It does trickle into your life, the material you work on. But when we talk about Eileen, I go full in, and then I have to go out to regain some energy again. If I would stay in it the whole time, I would be completely depleted.”

The most potent moment in “Hedda,” for Hoss and the audience, is the scene in which Eileen arrives at Hedda's party, with Thompson affixed, Spike Lee-style, on a floating dolly as she's drawn amorously toward her former lover. Eileen stands there, domineeringly, in a position of power and seduction.

 










“I had no idea up until that moment, even though we had rehearsed. Tessa had always just walked up to me, which I found quite strong, also. So I thought, OK, that's what we're doing. Nia didn't talk to me about that,” Hoss said. “When I came down to the room and saw Tessa being strapped on this dolly, I said, ‘What are we doing? What's happening?' But then it just made so much sense, and I felt very appreciative that, in a way, my character and therefore also me, the actress inhabiting this character, gets this huge present of an entrance like that. I can't act that as the others have to do. This moment is there, where time stands still.”

”Hedda” is now streaming on Prime Video.

	Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco may not (yet) have a Saturday Night Live hosting stint under his belt, but he does have something arguably just as coveted — a bona fide impression. The comic, who is known for his physical comedy style and exaggerated speech, reacted to Marcello Hernandez‘s recent parody of him, calling the eponymous sketch flattering. 


	In a preview clip of his upcoming appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show Dec. 2, Maniscalco said, “He did a great job. I was very flattered that they did that. He actually called me on Thursday before the show, said, ‘Do you want to come in and do a cameo at the end of it?' I couldn't do it because I was performing in Palm Springs, but I thought this kid did a fantastic job.”

	The Bookie actor noted the impersonation was “absolutely all in love.” Though he has never hosted the show, Maniscalco joked Barrymore could help him out as a member of the Five-Timers Club (the actress has hosted six times). “I'm here today to kind of petition — and maybe you could help me,” he said. “You're taking all the spots!”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Maniscalco gave similar comments to Complex in an interview tied to the release of his latest Hulu special, It Ain't Right.


	“The first thing I noticed: Do they think I'm that gray? I thought the gray hair was a little excessive,” he said.


	The comic, who is among the top-grossing in the world, praised Hernandez for really going for it in terms of the physicality of his performance, saying he “really got a kick out of” his “over enunciation on the physical humor.”

	











	He continued, “That was my favorite part: the whole step over, jump over. And I actually talked to Marcello via text, and I said, ‘Man I wish I could jump like that.'”


	Maniscalco explained that he's “gotten more traction on this video than any video I've ever been in. If we could just have people keep imitating me, I think it'll be fine,” joking that “the problem is if I'm in it.” 


	In the viral SNL sketch, which debuted Nov. 15, host Glen Powell's bachelor party is thrown into disarray when he invites an old pal to join the rest of the boys, warning his friends that the acquaintance is none other than world-famous standup Maniscalco. 


	“You gotta be kidding me,” Maniscalco commented on his initial repost of the skit shortly after its release.


SNL is currently on its holiday hiatus, returning for a three-week run in December beginning this Saturday.

SUNDAY AM: It's a great Thanksgiving of second-best records for Disney with Zootopia 2 and that's nothing to complain about: The sequel posted the second highest grossing Saturday over Thanksgiving stretch of $35.8M, which is fueling the second-highest 5-day opening ever for the holiday of $156M. That's also the second best opening ever for a Walt Disney Animation title. This is after the second-highest Wednesday, Thursday and Black Friday in recent days — all these records are filing behind last year's Moana 2 (5-day of $225.4M).


	Exclaimed Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman this morning, “The incredible response to Zootopia 2 reflects both its worldwide appeal and the remarkable work of our filmmakers and cast. It's a proud moment for Disney Animation and all of us at Disney, not to mention a great way to start the holiday season.”

	











	Andrew Cripps, head of Disney Global Distribution, pointed out that Zootopia 2‘s success also “benefitted from the pent-up demand for animated movies from audiences.” There's been few this past year, at least few that have worked. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Box Office state firm EntTelligence counted 12 million admissions for Zootopia 2 over 5-days. Moana 2 clocked 17.5M last year. The average ticket price was $14.42 while the average premium large format ticket price for the sequel was $18. 


	The conservative 5-day forecast on Zootopia 2 was $125M. There is room for upside with the sequel apt to gross $3M more than what we're seeing currently. Interesting to note that the daily gross cadence for Zootopia 2 is very similar to Moana 2‘s on a percentile basis, i.e. Thanksgiving was down 50% from opening day Wednesday/previews, Black Friday was +96% over Thanksgiving, Saturday dipped -7% from Black Friday with Sunday being calculated at a -37% decline off yesterday (Note Moana 2 eased -31% on its first Sunday off Saturday). 


	Early industry estimates for the five-day weekend for all films is factored around $297M (that includes $4.25M from Netflix's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery), which among Thanksgiving 5-day hauls is third behind last year's all-time record of $424.9M, and 2018's $315.6M (that's when Disney Animation sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet led with $84.7M). We'll see what Comscore reports. 

	











	Disney arrived to this massive weekend with 11 promo partners who delivered over $215 million in media value that generated 3.7 billion-plus impressions and a retail footprint that spanned 100k+ locations. That promo campaign value outstrips that of Moana 2‘s $100M and Inside Out 2‘s. Zootopia 2‘s partners included:


	The trailer drop on May 20 timed to the release of Lilo & Stitch indicated anticipation was there for Zootopia 2 with 130M views in first 24 hours and the final trailer on Sept 29 pulling in 74M views in its first day. 


	One of the cute exhibitor tie-ins entailed an immersive experience for the sequel at AMC Century City in LA with “The Moovies,” a floor-to-ceiling wrap with parody posters (Devil Wears Preyda 2, The Incredibulls 3, Toy Ssstory 5). Also getting a makeover for the movie was Disney's own El Capitan in Hollywood renamed the “El Hopitan”. There were also12-foot bus displays at AMC Americana/Kips Bay; and touring statues across 12 theaters.


	AMC Dine-In in Disney Springs in Florida did $346K through EOD yesterday, the highest grossing location in the nation. Repeating the stat here: 21% came from premium large format and Imax (4% from Imax, 17% from PLFs with 12% from 3D). 


	Evident that the movie played “everywhere” can be seen in the EntTelligence breakdown: 38% of the foot traffic were in markets that ranged in population size from 1M to over 2.5M (high urban) versus 62% of admissions which were in cities of 500K or less. Rural and high rural areas (1K-500K) pulled in 36% admissions. Big matinee play, of course, with 60% of the audience watching Zootopia 2 before 5PM yesterday. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good is filing a second weekend of $62.8M (-57%), and a 5-day of $93M for a running cume of $270.4M. 


	5. Running Man (Par) 2,749 (-297) theaters, Wed $840K Thu $980K Fri $1.4M Sat $1.45M Sun $850K 3-day $3.7M (-35%), 5-day $5.5M, Total $34.2M/ Wk 3


	6. Eternity (A24) 1,348 theaters, Wed $1.45M (includes previews), Thu $616K Fri $1.1M Sat $1.2M Sun $826K 3 day $3.16M, 5 day $5.2M/Wk 1The Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner and Miles Teller romcom which cost around $15M before P&A is being comped to A24's Priscilla which did $5M over 3 days at a similar number of theaters. An expansion is expected. Priscilla, which was a dreamy bio-drama, grossed just under $21M at the domestic B.O. 


	7. Wake Up Dead Man (Netflix) 600 theaters, Wed $600K, Thu $400K Fri $600K Sat $400K 5-day $4.25M/Wk 1Dailies are for only those theaters reporting. Sources tell us the 5-day is $4M. More on that later. 8. Rental Family (Sea) 1,925 theaters, Wednesday $400K, Thu $575K Fri $800K Sat $800K Sun $500K 3-day $2.1M (-36%), 5-day $3M, Total $7.39M/Wk 2

	











	9. Hamnet (Foc) 119 theaters Wed $310K, Thu $160K Fri $310K Sat $350K Sun $220K 3-day $880K, 5-day $1.35M/5-day per theater $11,3K (third best of the weekend behind Zootopia 2‘s $39K per theater and Wicked 2‘s $22,6K theater average/Wk 1


	10. Sisu: Road to Revenge (Sony) 2,222 theaters Wed $200K, Thu $205K Fri $290K Sat $310K Sun 3-day $810K (-66%), 5-day $1.2M, Total $4.1M/Wk 2


SATURDAY AM, updated with new data: Consumers didn't just go to stores yesterday, they went to the movies, too, shelling out $38.5M to see Disney's Zootopia 2, the second best Black Friday at the box office after last year's Moana 2 ($54.3M), as well as Universal's Wicked: For Good which did $26M. For the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande sequel that's it's fourth highest grossing day after its opening weekend sequence of Friday ($69.1M), Saturday ($43.4M) and Sunday ($34.4M).


	And talk about walk-up business for Zootopia 2: Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak shows a massive 61% of the audience purchasing their tickets same day. The 5-day forecast on Zootopia 2 now surges to $152M-$156M (don't be surprised if it hits $160M), which as we always said is right behind Moana 2‘s ($225.4M) all-time 5-day Thanksgiving opening record. 3-day is between $98M-$99M on the Jason Bateman-Ginnifer Goodwin voiced movie. Note, it took the first Zootopia 12 days to hit $154M domestic, and it's taking the sequel only five days to do so. The first Zootopia in early March 2016 opened to $75M U.S./Canada, and finaled at $341.2M domestic, and $1 billion worldwide (that's with $39M from Russia and $236M from China). 


Wicked: For Good‘s 5-day ratchets up as well to a second weekend of $63.3M (-57%) and 5-day of $93.5M for a running cume of $270.9M by EOD tomorrow. 


	Back to Zootopia 2, next to Moana 2, it's more of a four-quad movie with women under 25 at 34%, women over 25 at 26%, and both men under and over 25 at 20% apiece. Since opening on Wednesday, definite recommend has shot up from 65% to 73% yesterday. Women over 25 are giving the movie its best definite recommend at a massive 82%. Yes, as expected with a massive hit like this, infrequent moviegoers, are the bulk of the ticket buyers here at 56%. Broken out on PostTrak that's 33% who go to the cinema every other month or so and 23% who attend the multiplex a few times a year or less. For theatrical to survive in a M&A studio collapsing-hungry world — it's on the industry's shoulders to convert this crowd into being more faithful. 


	Imax and PLFs still driving 21% of the sequel's business with ticket sales the strongest in South Central and the West. Right now, the AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (FL) is the pic's highest grossing multiplex at close to $270K. 


	Netflix's limited release of Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which is in around 600 sites, is now up to $4M+ over 5 days. The previous installment, Glass Onion, had a robust play over Thanksgiving: $9.4M 3-day, $13.2M 5-day at 696 sites for a very good 5-day theater average of $19K. Again, the top 3 circuits aren't playing Knives Out 3, which is weird. That said, we hear there are several hundred sell-out shows, and the movie will continue to play beyond Thanksgiving week and even possibly through its Dec. 12 streaming date. The top 3 circuits opted to prioritize Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good over the holiday stretch. Even though there's no big P&A on Knives Out 3, there's great word of mouth from both critics and audiences with 95% and 96%, respectively, on Rotten Tomatoes.


	Black Friday for the top 20 movies pulled in $75M, which was as we said about -30% off from last year's $108M boosted by not just Moana 2 and Wicked, but, hello, a R-rated male skewing movie in Gladiator II. Meanwhile, early consumer sales stats for the day aren't as gloomy as previously forecasted: Adobe Analytics reports that home-shoppers spent $11.8 billion online, +9% from a year ago. Meanwhile, Salesforce says that shoppers shelled out $18 billion on Black Friday purchases, +3% from Black Friday 2024, with luxury apparel and accessories the leading purchases. 

	











	Saturday AM estimates reflect Friday theater counts: 


FRIDAY AM: Disney's Zootopia 2 had a better Thanksgiving than expected with close to $20M. Rivals were seeing around $17.7M yesterday morning. Quite easily, that's the second-best Thanksgiving haul for any movie behind last year's Moana 2 at $27.7M. Confidence is rising that the 5-day on the Jared Bush and Byron Howard co-directed animated movie is well north of $140M, perhaps beyond $150M, however, that boils down today. That's a situation for all titles whether they overindex. 


	As we told you, Black Friday is one of the busiest moviegoing days of the year in addition to shopping. This Black Friday is expected to mint around $76M at the domestic box office, -29% from last year's $108M. Exhibition can be grateful that people are going to the movies as a recent Deloitte survey says that consumers plan to spend an average of $622 between Nov. 27 and Dec. 1, which is down -4% from a year ago. Last Black Friday, Moana 2 boomed +95% over Thanksgiving for a $54.7M haul. Zootopia 2 is expected to be around $34M, which is still robust. 


	Exclaims social media monitor firm RelishMix about the word of mouth on Zootopia 2, “Convo runs positive for Zootopia 2 as the comment stream glows like a fan-run marquee, with excitement bursting from every corner. Enthusiastic callouts celebrate, ‘the wait is finally ending, as seen in the only Disney movie I'm very excited to see because I've waited nine years for a sequel and YES!' Fans compare Jason Bateman's energy to the original Zootopia by cheering, ‘I love Ginnifer Goodwin and I love her as Judy Hopps.' Even the marketing gets applause with, ‘The edits are the best way to promote the sequel paired with another great look and can't wait to see Zootopia 2.'”


	Reach on social media for Zootopia 2 across X, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube before opening was 518 million followers, which is above Kung Fu Panda 4‘s 353 million, but below Minions: Rise of Gru‘s 668 million. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good had a $12.5M Thanksgiving, -25% off Wicked‘s $16.7M Turkey Day a year ago. Outlook for part 2 of the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande movie is still a second weekend of $61M (-59%) and 5-day of $91M. Running cume of $268.4M by Sunday will be pacing +2% ahead of Wicked over ten days. Also, a stat we left out last weekend about Wicked 2 is that its 1.33 billion followers on social media ranks as 6th for any movie franchise behind Avengers: Endgame (2.47 billion), Avengers: Infinity War (2.09 billion), Fast 8 (1.96B), Despicable Me 3 (1.6B), and Black Adam (1.38B). 




THURSDAY AM: Disney's Zootopia 2 caged up $39.5M yesterday including previews, just as we told you, with the sequel still on course for an $88M-$90M 3-day, $140M 5-day. No surprise, part two has an A CinemaScore just like the first one with a Rotten Tomatoes audience score that's slightly higher than the first, 95% to 92%. By the way that's the second best Wednesday before Thanksgiving after last year's Moana 2 had a first day/Tuesday previews of $57.9M.  

	











	Among all Disney Animation titles, Zootopia 2‘s Wednesday/previews ranks as the third best for the label after Moana 2 and Frozen 2 ($42.2M).


	Audience diagnostics day one for Zootopia 2 is a very good 65% definite recommend, 87% positive with adults and 80% positive with kids under 12 (The first movie in 2016 was enormous with 90% positive and 87% definite recommend for general audience, and kids under 12 with a 91% positive). Zootopia 2 skewed 52% women yesterday with the 18-24 demo seeing the biggest turnout at close to a third and 18-34 at 56%. Latino and Hispanic moviegoers led yesterday with 37%, followed by 25% Caucasian, 20% Black, and 13% Asian American, and 5% Native American/other. 


	Yesterday's money came from 21% PLF and Imax screens (4% Imax, 17% from a non-IMAX PLF and 12% coming from 3D screens). Zootopia is playing throughout North America, but best in South Central and West (the East is the softest, we hear). Disney's El Capitan in Hollywood was the leading single-location gross at $128K on Wednesday. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good posted the $17M we were seeing, and is eyeing $61M over 3-days and $91M over 5 days. The promo machine for Wicked 2 won't let up: Cynthia Erivo opened the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade days after losing her voice with “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone. And Jeff Goldblum is on social singing “Popular” with Anthony Gargiula and Jonathan Tilkin barbershop-style:


	Ticket sales for all movies today, Thanksgiving, are expected to be down some -40% before jumping on Black Friday by +95%. Black Friday last year, thanks to Moana 2, Wicked and Gladiator II, grossed $108M. 


	The top 20 films minted $63M yesterday, and while great, it's -30% off from the same Thanksgiving Eve a year when Moana 2 led all titles to a $90M-plus take. 

	











	Let's not forget that this holiday stretch has Netflix's Rian Johnson threequel Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery at around 600 theaters. Though similar to the 696 theaters that Glass Onion: Knives Out played over Thanksgiving week 2022, Wake Up Dead Man doesn't have the major circuits AMC, Regal and Cinemark that Glass Onion did (I hear the top chains opted not play the movie despite a 24-day theatrical window). So, don't expect the $15M and beefy weekly $21K theater average that title posted. Rough estimates as Netflix doesn't report figures are $600K for Wednesday, 3-day of $2M, and 5-day of $3M. We won't rank in the chart until we have a better sense of numbers. Johnson, who sold the Knives Out sequels to Netflix during Covid for $400M as Deadline first told you, took to social recently to express his upset over the lack of theaters playing Knives Out 3. “I'm as frustrated as you that it's not everywhere, but new theaters will be added so keep checking — and also, if you're inclined, it wouldn't hurt to contact the manager of your local theater and (politely!) ask them if it's coming,” wrote Johnson to a fan on social. Frankly, not a good look for Netflix on a major film with a 2x Oscar nominated filmmaker, in the wake of the theatrical success on Kpop Demon Hunters, and with the mixed message that they're not into theatrical; yet will be if they purchase Warner Bros. Studios. Wake Up Dead Man drops on Netflix on Dec. 12. The movie is 95% certified fresh with critics, and 96% with audiences. The first movie, distributed by Liosngate, was a big Thanksgiving 2019 hit for the studio posted a $41M 5-day start, $165.3M domestic B.O., $312.8M global take and an $83M profit. 


	4. Predator: Badlands (Dis) 2,750 theaters, Wed $900K, 3-day $3.8M (-42%), 5-day $5.4M/Total $83.8M/Wk 4


	4. Eternity (A24) 1,348 theaters, Wed $1.45M (includes previews), 3 day $3.2M, 5 day $5.4M/Wk 1The Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller, Callum Turner movie is 90% on Rotten Tomatoes with audiences and 84% positive on PostTrak with a good 54% definite recommend. The comp here on a wide basis is Priscilla ($5M 3-day) and there is expected expansion after this weekend. The movie is leaning 57% female, with a third coming from 25-34 (biggest demo) and 51% 18-34. Diversity demos are 59% Caucasian, 16% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Asian American, and 6% Black. The afterlife romcom is playing best in the West with AMC Grove in LA the top grossing location yesterday with $10K.


	6. Running Man (Par) 3,046 theaters, Wed $830K 3-day $3.7M (-35%), 5-day $5.3M, Total $34M/ Wk 3


	7. Rental Family (Sea) 1,925 theaters, Wednesday $400K, 3-day $1.7M, 5-day $2.4M (-27%), Total $6.7M/Wk 2


	8. Hamnet (Foc) 119 theaters Wed $330K, 3-day $910K, 5-day $1.4M/5-day per theater $11,7K/Wk 1If these numbers hold, that's the third best theater average of the weekend after Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good, and damn, that's really good. The great word has been out on this Chloe Zhao Shakespeare period movie since its fall film festival premiere with 88% certified fresh with Rotten Tomatoes critics. The AMC in Lincoln Square in NYC pulled in $40K yesterday, and the next highest gross was LA's Grove with $12k>  


	9. Sisu: Road to Revenge (Sony) 2,222 theaters Wed $200K, 3-day $930K (-61%), 5-day $1.3M, Total $4.2M/Wk 2

	











	10. Regretting You (Par) 1,004 theaters, Wed $138K, 3-day $624K (-60%) 5-day $892K, Total $48.7M/Wk 6




UPDATED, Wednesday afternoon: Disney will continue to own nine of the top 10 Thanksgiving five-day box office openings as Zootopia 2 is set to do around $140 million from its Wednesday to Sunday at 4,000 theaters.


	Always take the projection this far out with a grain of salt as a lot comes down to Black Friday and Saturday. Already, with an estimated $39M Wednesday, including yesterday's $10.2M previews, Zooptopia 2 owns the second-best Wednesday opening for Thanksgiving after last year's Moana 2 ($57.8M). The Friday-Sunday for the animated sequel with the voices of Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin is pegged between $88M-$90M+.


	Remember, business eases on Thanksgiving but picks up in the evening, with Black Friday one of the year's highest-grossing box office days.


	Disney has premium large format screens for Zootopia 2, but they're sharing Imax with Universal's Wicked: For Good which gets those auditoriums for evening showtimes.


	Here's how part 2 of Wicked is shaping up next to its predecessor: Wednesday right now is figured at $17M (versus last year's $20.3M) at 4,115 locations. Wicked‘s Thanksgiving take last year dipped 17% from Wednesday for $16.7M. The three-day on the Jon M. Chu-directed part II is at $60.2M (-59%) at 4,115 sites, with a five-day of $90M and a running total by Sunday of $267.4M. Wicked‘s second weekend was $81.1M (-28%), with a five-day of $118.2M.


	Lionsgate's Now You See Me: Now You Don't at 3,138 theaters is eyeing around $1.5M in its second Wednesday for a third weekend of $6.4M (-28%), a five-day of $9.25M and a running cume of $48.7M by Sunday.


	Disney/20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands at 2,750 theaters is eyeing a third Wednesday of $855,000, a fourth weekend of $3.9M (-40%), a five-day of $5.65M and a running cume of $84M. That will easily make Predator: Badlands the highest-grossing installment of the 38-year-old franchise at the domestic box office, overtaking 2004's Alien vs. Predator which finaled at $80.2M.


	Paramount's Running Man at 3,046 sites is doing $910K today, $4.1M in weekend 3 (-28%), for a five-day of $5.88M and a running cume of $34.5M.


	A24's Eternity at 1,348 locations is seeing around $400K today, $2M over three days and north of $3M for for days. The afterlife rom-com starring Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller and Callum Turner is 76% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.


WEDNESDAY AM: After a barren harvest at the fall box office, exhibitors have a lot to be thankful for as Disney's Zootopia 2 and Universal's Wicked: For Good finally are delivering the goods this holiday season.


Zootopia 2 started previews at 2 p.m. Tuesday that delivered $10.2M. This is the second-highest preview start for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film ever, only behind Moana 2 ($13.8M Tuesday) and ahead of Frozen II ($8.5M Thursday). It's also the second-highest Tuesday preview for a Disney Thanksgiving opening title.

The domestic outlook for Zootopia 2 is $125M over five days. Many believe there's room for upside, but if it lands at that projection, it will be the second-best 5-day opener over the domestic Thanksgiving holiday after Moana 2. Global start on the movie directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard is north of $270M. The sequel to the Oscar-winning animated movie stands at 93% certified fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes, a few notches below the 98% of the 2016 title.


	Meanwhile, Universal's first Tuesday of Wicked: For Good saw $15.75M, which is the second-best Tuesday of 2025 so far after Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman, which did $17.1M. In addition, Wicked: For Good charted the fourth-best Tuesday in November after Frozen 2 ($20.7M, Nov. 26, 2019), Wicked ($16.6M, Nov. 26, 2024) and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ($15.9M, Nov. 26, 2013). Running cume for Wicked: For Good is $177.5M, 22% ahead of Wicked‘s five-day running cume/previews.

	Last year's trio of Moana 2, Wicked and Paramount's Gladiator II fueled a record Thanksgiving 5-day of $424.9M. Despite the top-heavy success of Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good this weekend, what's glaringly missing at this year's Turkey Day box office is a movie for guys a la 2024's R-rated Gladiator II. Last Tuesday at this time had an extra $6.6M from the Ridley Scott-directed sequel. The Running Man isn't cutting it, with the movie delivering around $980K yesterday for a cume of $28.7M. The top 20 titles on Tuesday (not counting Zootopia 2 previews) generated $21.7M, -25% from a year ago Tuesday's tally of $29M.

WICKED: FOR GOOD taking a much bigger hit in its second/Thanksgiving weekend than the first one. Will it still be around by the end of December?

W2 is a great film.  It also has Dorothy and the classic characters so it has a punch that a lot of people will like.  Strong legs.

As you don't see Dorothy's face and they are barely in it anyway that's a bit of a stretch.

Not even close

Queue the netflix bots to tell us this is actually a flop and everyone should stay home and give up on theatrical.

Didn't you know that every movie has a 100 million dollar marketing budget and 50 million dollars of secret reshoots? You can learn alot from Dedline comments.

We saw it Thanksgiving and it was awesome. The kiddos in the theater were captivated and we (72 year olds) were amazed by the animation and sophistication of the writing.

W2 has no chance of eclipsing W1 in US

A part two movie that relies on seeing part one is always going to be limited in its potential. There wasn't any way around that, unfortunately.

On the plus side, NBC did show Wicked recently, and it's been available for streaming, so there are a few million who will have skipped W1 in theaters but be open to W2. The real question is how many of them will go to the theater versus waiting for streaming. It's still going to be quite lucrative for streaming.

Didn't help that act II of the play was a snooze compared to act I

Dune: Part Two says hello.

If only any of the two new songs were in the same league as the unforgettable “Defying Gravity” and “Popular.”

“Popular” was so memorable, it's hard to top an earworm like that. W1 was truly a phenomenal soundtrack.

The 2025 Hallmark Christmas Experience in Kansas City is off to a rip-roaring start, with fans from across the country descending on Hallmark's national headquarters for the first of four weekends featuring events with Hallmark Channel stars, creative classes, a holiday market and more.

The featured stars during the first weekend include Andrew Walker, Benjamin Ayres, Paul Campbell, B.J. Britt, Kimberley Sustad, Tyler Hynes, Rhiannon Fish, Robert Buckley, and Jessy Schram. “Finding Mr. Christmas” host Jonathan Bennett also flew in to host several onstage events, including a Hallmark version of “The Dating Game” on November 29. But thanks to several stars' hilarious and suggestive comments, plus voice-disguising software on the stars' microphones, the mock game show went off the rails quickly.

For the Hallmark Dating Game, fans from the audience were chosen to participate, asking questions of the three hunks or leading ladies on the other side of a partition on stage. Just like with the classic game show, the goal was to decide which anonymous suitor the contestant would like to date, based on the “eligible” bachelors' or bachelorettes' answers. 

Bennett cutely clarified that no one would actually be winning a date with one of the stars but, rather, a selfie with them — which is as good as gold at a jam-packed event like this. Hallmark disguised the stars' voices to help keep them anonymous, and that turned into a hysterical part of their participation. 

Campbell, who stars in “Christmas at the Catnip Cafe” on November 30, didn't know his voice was disguised at first. As seen in the video above, he crumpled into laughter when he realized the high-pitched voice was his own. 

Next, when “A Christmas Angel Match” star Ayres tried out his microphone, he hilariously (and correctly) assessed that he sounded like a “serial killer.” Finally, Hynes gave his mic a try and had everyone laughing by only answering in Spanish. With those as the three choices for the fan to choose from, Campbell laughed, “There are no winners here today!” 

The hilarity did not end there; all three rounds of the game show were filled with ridiculous, side-splitting moments, including the video above. During the first round, the fan asked Contestant #2, which was Ayres, what animal he'd choose as his sidekick if he were a superhero. 

Ayres started out by saying, “If? Not if,” and it made him, Campbell, and Hynes laugh. With the voice distortion on the mic, Ayres' laugh sounded like a quintessential cartoon nemesis, and threw back his head with a guttural, mischievous laugh. As he leaned into it, the guys joined in. 

We're pretty sure no one had on their Hallmark Christmas Experience bingo card that Walker and Britt would be the ones to bring so much spice to the Dating Game! First, Walker had to be jokingly hauled off the stage multiple times by Hynes and Campbell, his “Three Wise Men” trilogy co-stars, for his suggestive comments and singing. 

During his round of the Hallmark Dating Game alongside Britt and Buckley, Walker had the same deep-voiced, sinister-sounding microphone that Ayres had used previously. And for whatever reason, it put him in the mood to repeatedly and inexplicably sing Exile's 1978 song “Kiss You All Over,” slowly crooning the lyrics, “I want to kiss you all over, till the night closes in.” 

Walker also grabbed Britt's high-pitched mic at one point to sing the song. It sounded just as creepy, prompting Campbell and Hynes to run out onstage to remove him, which sent the crowd into fits of laughter. 

But Walker's most egregious offense, which also got him yanked offstage by Hynes and Campbell, was his answer about what baked good he's most like. As seen in the video above, he was in trouble from the moment he hilariously suggested he was most like a “pudding cake.” 

It's not every day you hear hundreds of Hallmark fans shouting to someone, “Take it off! Take it off!” But that's exactly what happened when Britt answered what his superhero costume would look like and whether it would have any “special features.” 

When Britt stood up and pretended he was going to take off his clothes, the crowd gasped, squealed, and then started shouting, “Take it off! Take if off!” 

When Britt sat back down, he declared, “I'm more of a skin guy,” drawing surprised laughs from the crowd. When he raised his eyebrows and flashed his big grin, he simply asked, “Special features?” Worried the innuendo would be too spicy for Hallmark, Campbell and Hynes ran onto the stage to whisk him away. 

Hallmark leading ladies Taylor Cole, Rhiannon Fish, and Jessy Schram had their own funny segment, taking questions from a male fan on the other side of the partition. Cole pretended to be a whiny mean girl and declared she wasn't ever interested in dating the guy after he selected Schram as his “date.” 

After another full day of fun on November 30, the Hallmark Christmas Experience has three weekends left in Kansas City, with a different cast of stars attending each.

I Love these Guys & Gals. I just Love everything about the Hallmark Stars. None Better.

This was great!  Those video clips are so funny!

Britney Spears shared a cryptic post about “suffering” and “darkness” amid growing concerns about the singer's well-being.

Late Saturday night, the “Toxic” songstress took to Instagram to share a video of herself dancing in a leopard print bodysuit and black heels set to the tune of Adele's “Send My Love (To Your New Lover).”

“Haven't found my party dress for this year 👗… Reflecting is good for the soul… Sometimes when hard things happen, good things come from it and we learn,” she captioned the post.

“I learned that a real note of expression with emotion speaks volumes for us all!! Call it childish, silly, annoying… We grow up to become women but do you dare keep the most sensitive part of the soul and allow it to rebel… the child within must speak in the most vulnerable of times,” Spears, 43, penned.

“Sadness and darkness survive to make an understanding of losing someone and of the hurt and pain… Sometimes through suffering and ugliness and sacrifice, extremely rare and beautiful things can be manifested and shared that can touch another person so they understand they are not alone… and yet the woman in me will make sure I find my destination.”

The “Crossroads” actress ended her lengthy caption by switching gears to talk about how much food she indulged in during Thanksgiving. 

“PS I can't even look at food after this Thanksgiving… I cheated I was so bad… but it felt so damn good… forgive me father,” she wrote.

Spears' latest dancing video comes nearly two weeks after she was spotted leaving a wine bar with a champagne flute in hand, then getting into her car and speeding off.

At the time, the “Gimme More” hitmaker's team insisted to the Daily Mail that the pop star was not drinking any alcohol during the rare outing.

After the photos went viral, Spears took to Instagram to blast the paparazzi, calling them “incredibly mean” for always taking “the worst photos” of her.

The Grammy winner also said she “can't go anywhere” without being harassed. “It's so offensive,” she added.

In September, Page Six exclusively reported that Spears had been refusing help from people as fears about her mental health and living conditions continued to grow.

“She has people like staff, security guards, assistants, no real friends,” an insider told us.

One source told us that though Spears “has moments of clarity and moments where it feels like a roller coaster,” she is “still the sweetest, kindest person.”

They added: “We're always concerned about Britney and her well-being and making sure if she's OK. The question is, ‘How do we help her?'”

The “Oops!…I Did It Again” singer's friends are also reportedly worried that Spears is residing in a “messy mansion” covered in dog poop.

“Her house is a mess. She doesn't clean up after the dogs, she doesn't have someone there cleaning every day, and she just isn't functioning like an adult would function,” a source told the Daily Mail.

In November 2021, Spears famously broke free of her 13-year legal conservatorship.

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw may be behind some of the year's most striking imagery, but the innovator who combined 65mm IMAX and Super Panavision 70 to create the gorgeous, ambitious large-format photography of “Sinners” never envisioned a career in filmmaking. In high school, she was interested in photography and made short films with her friends, but never considered them a serious pursuit. When she decided to attend Loyola Marymount University, her intention was to study art history. But even though she went to college with no plans to enter the film industry, the seeds had been planted years before.

“I'm from Northern California, and I was raised by a single mom,” Arkapaw said. “She would always take me to movies or watch movies at home. In the back of my mind, she played a big role in giving me a love for movies and going to the theater.” 

 










What turned her adolescent interest in movies into a lifelong passion and ambition was a film course Arkapaw took at LMU to fulfill a curriculum requirement. She wrote a paper on two black-and-white masterpieces: “Raging Bull,” which Michael Chapman shot for Martin Scorsese, and “Broadway Danny Rose,” one of many landmark collaborations between Gordon Willis and Woody Allen.  

“It blew my mind open, being in this class talking about how films were shot and what it meant,” Arkapaw said. “I wanted to know who was making these images.” When Arkapaw started researching cinematographers, she was disappointed by the dearth of women in the profession. But she found a few role models, like Ellen Kuras, who shot 2001's “Blow,” and that was enough to inspire her to dive headfirst into studying and immersing herself in the world of cinematography. “I was hooked,” she said.  

After graduating from LMU and spending a few years working in the corporate world, she decided to commit once and for all to pursuing a career in cinematography. Even though it meant trading steady employment for student loans and an uncertain future, when she was accepted into the AFI Conservatory's cinematography program, Arkapaw left the idea of a life working at a desk behind. 

 










At AFI, Arkapaw got the opportunity to shoot her first feature film when classmate Rafael Palacio Illingworth wrote, directed, and starred in “Macho,” a microbudget dramedy that Arkapaw photographed between her first and second years. “We shot on 35mm and it won an award at Raindance,” Arkapaw said, referring to the U.K. film festival. “That allowed me to become a DP before I graduated.” After graduation, Arkapaw shot another low-budget indie, “Guadalupe the Virgin,” and then she got the call that would lead to one of her most satisfying creative partnerships.

“A classmate of mine at AFI was going to shoot [Gia Coppola's] ‘Palo Alto,' and he was unavailable one day and asked me if I could fill in,” Arkapaw said. “Gia was shooting some stuff on a 7D to show [James] Franco — little vignettes with her friends.” 

When Arkapaw came on board to photograph the feature, in some ways it felt like starting from scratch — even with two features and several shorts already under her belt. “ It felt like my first film because I found a director that I really had a deep connection with. We shared a similar visual language and aesthetic and taste in a lot of things: fashion, food, music,” Arkapaw said, adding that working on a small set, filled with friends, deepened the experience. “It felt very powerful, like I was part of a group and could finally say something with a camera.”

 










Arkapaw and Coppola became fast friends and began an ongoing collaboration that would lead to last year's acclaimed “The Last Showgirl,” which earned star Pamela Anderson her first Golden Globe and SAG nominations.

Another filmmaker Arkapaw quickly found a common language with was “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler, whom she had initially hoped to work with on the 2015 “Rocky” spinoff, “Creed.” “I'm really good friends with [cinematographer] Bradford Young, and it was Bradford who told Ryan about me when he was looking for a DP for ‘Creed,'” Arkapaw said. “When he brought my name up to the studio, I only had ‘Palo Alto' as a credit, and it wasn't enough for the studio to move forward with me. Unfortunately, we were like ships passing in the night.”

Luckily, by the time Coogler needed a director of photography to come on board 2022's “Wakanda Forever,” Arkapaw had amassed several substantial credits, including work on the Marvel TV series “Loki.” The success of that series put Arkapaw at the top of not only Coogler's list but also the studio's, and after her first Zoom call with Coogler, she knew she had met another filmmaking soulmate.

“It felt like we were long lost cousins,” Arkapaw said. “It just felt right, like I was meant to meet him and meant to be a part of that group.” Coogler had already assembled most of his team from people he'd worked with on previous movies, with Arkapaw and the assistant director being the only two new additions. But the cinematographer immediately felt at home. “It's a daunting thing to come in on the second movie when the first one had such a tight-knit family, but I felt really supported,” she said.

 










Because “Wakanda Forever” had such a long shoot — around an entire year — Coogler said at the time that Arkapaw was the DP he had worked the most with, even though they had only made one movie together. After “Wakanda Forever,” Coogler and Arkapaw stayed in touch, and the cinematographer began to get hints about their next collaboration. “I knew that he was writing something personal, and that it was a period piece, and that he wanted to shoot it on 16mm,” Arkapaw said.

That project turned out to be “Sinners,” a film that would utilize Arkapaw's greatest strengths: her impeccable eye, along with her talent for marrying images to music, as seen in her music videos for SZA, Rihanna, the Jonas Brothers, and more. When Arkapaw read Coogler's ambitious script, she was immediately excited by the range of possibilities and challenges, from mixing genres as disparate as horror movies and musicals to shooting Michael B. Jordan as two distinct characters.

“The first time I read it all the way through, I was blown away,” Arkapaw said. She immediately began talking with Coogler about influences ranging from Paul Thomas Anderson's “There Will Be Blood” to John Carpenter's “The Thing,” but her primary inspiration came from a book of photographs by Eudora Welty. “It was a book of black-and-white photos Ryan told me about from the 1930s. I looked at it and knew exactly what he was after visually, and in terms of mood and tone,” she said.

 










Initially, Coogler planned to return to the 16mm format he had enjoyed working with on “Fruitvale Station,” and Arkapaw was equally excited, given her positive experience with 16mm on “The Last Showgirl.” Early conversations with the film's visual effects supervisor, however, made Arkapaw realize that the compositing required for Jordan's twinning shots would be compromised by the smaller gauge format, so the decision was made to go with 35mm. That's when the studio approached Coogler about shooting large format — resulting in the final 65mm IMAX extravaganza.

“It opened his mind up, and he called me immediately,” Arkapaw said. Coogler floated the extremely wide Ultra Panavision 70 process that Quentin Tarantino used for “The Hateful Eight” — and which had been used on spectacles like “Ben-Hur” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” So she began looking at 65mm dailies from a variety of processes and films, running scenes from Tarantino's 2015 Western, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Tenet,” and others at FotoKem. She then went out to the desert to shoot a series of tests with multiple lenses, cameras, and formats, including 35mm.

Eventually, both the cinematographer and director agreed that the clear choice was to shoot “Sinners” alternating between 65mm IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 — a bold decision given that IMAX boasts one of the tallest possible aspect ratios at 1.43:1, while Ultra Panavision 70 is the widest at 2.76:1. 

 










This made Arkapaw, who once struggled to find female role models, the first woman to shoot on both IMAX film and in Ultra Panavision. (She's also the only cinematographer to shoot with IMAX Ektachrome film stock, which was created by Kodak especially for “Sinners.”) But Arkapaw was convinced that it was the right decision, which was confirmed when she and Coogler shot more test footage and cut it together to see how the alternating, disparate aspect ratios would work. “I immediately thought it was a great idea,” she said, describing the effect as “beautiful.” “It didn't cross my mind that it wouldn't work,” she said.

The approach enabled Arkapaw to achieve a combination of period accuracy and visceral immediacy that was further enhanced by her careful selection of anamorphic lenses. Many of these were engineered specifically for “Sinners” by Panavision lens genius Dan Sasaki, though Arkapaw also “grabbed some other lenses, like the lenses from ‘2001: A Space Odyssey.'” “I gravitate toward older glass generally,” she said. “When you're working with this format that's very resolute, they pair nicely, as far as having age and texture to the image, because you want it to look like the 1930s.”

Given the audacious blend of genres and complex thematic layering, the critical and commercial success of “Sinners” was hardly a given, but Arkapaw did have a sense she was working on something unique during production. “It happened even in the tests,” she said. “We did a hair and makeup test, and just seeing Michael in those hats and walking on set — the power of his face — you just got so excited. There were so many moments on set early on where I would look at Ryan, and it would be unspoken: ‘Wow, this is really special.'”

 










The kind of inspiration she felt while working on “Sinners” is what Arkapaw always aspires to — and what makes her more and more excited about her work as a cinematographer. “All you want as a photographer is to be inspired every time you look through the lens,” she said, “and it was happening constantly on this film for me.”

Arkapaw may not have to wait too long to feel that way again, since she already has another project planned with Coogler and his team: a highly anticipated reboot of “The X-Files.” “I'm excited because I know we're going to be brave, and I'm going to be with people I like to be around, and they're going to protect me and let me exercise creativity at the highest level,” she said. “That happens to some people once in a lifetime, but I get to make more projects with this group. I'm very fortunate.”

“The Bold and the Beautiful” star Lisa Yamada is living her life to the fullest following her exit as Luna Nozawa.

Yamada, who first debuted as the notorious villain in September 2023, has been keeping fans updated on her recent adventures, and needless to say, she's having a blast.

Last week, Yamada wrapped up her stint on “The Bold and the Beautiful” as the baddie Luna, or so it seems. The lunatic was run down by a car as she was making her epic escape.

And it turns out the one who finally brought about Luna's downfall was none other than one of her former victims, art teacher Ms. Dylan.

Shortly after her character was killed off, Yamada took to Instagram to reflect on her time on the show.

“So many tears shed, blood spilled, friendships formed, and memories made on @boldandbeautifulcbs,” Yamada captioned the post she shared on November 21. “What a ride it's been! Hope you enjoyed the adventures <3 #LUNAtic4ever.”

Yamada isn't wasting time sulking over Luna's death. “The Bold and the Beautiful” star is out and about, making the most of her time away from the long-running CBS soap.

In another Instagram post, Yamada shared a glimpse of her fun moments since leaving the show.

“Lucky me,” Yamada captioned a carousel of photos from her recent outing.

One photo showed Yamada having a blast at a bar, while another captured her enjoying a meal at the famous Nobu restaurant.

In other photos, Yamada could be seen smoking a cigarette and lounging on a car hood. She even posed with her real-life bestie and “The Bold and the Beautiful” co-star Christian Weissmann.

The Daytime Emmy-winning actress also appeared to have crossed paths with Kris Jenner, sharing a photo of the momager on Instagram.

Meanwhile, some fans are still not over Luna's unexpected exit on “The Bold and the Beautiful.”

One fan wrote, “Will you ever come back as Luna? It's boring without you.”

Another commented, “Please bring Luna back from the dead! You are extremely missed already!”

A fan shared, “With you gone on ‘B&B,' it's become a boring mess. You added all the spice!”

Someone suggested, “If you don't return as Luna, then please play a new character on ‘Y&R'.”

Let Luna stay dead. Sheila is enough!

"I think that's a hard line for me now," the Paramore frontwoman said.

Hayley Williams is drawing a firm boundary ahead of her 2026 solo tour. The Paramore frontwoman, who recently announced an expanded run of dates due to high demand, said she intends her shows to be explicitly inclusive spaces — and made clear that anyone who holds discriminatory views should not expect to feel comfortable attending.

	In a new interview with Clash, Williams said she wants the tour to be a place where every fan can “feel welcome to the party,” but added that this commitment also requires her to take a public stance about who she does not want in the room.

	“I don't want racists around, and I don't want sexist people around, and I don't want people there who think that trans people are a burden,” she said. “I think that's a hard line for me now.”


	Williams explained that she hopes anyone holding those beliefs will “walk in the door and realise that the gang's all here, all banded together around something positive,” adding: “All are welcome if you believe all should be welcome… If you don't believe that, you're not welcome.”




	Her upcoming tour — which supports her latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — The North American leg kicks off on March 28 in Atlanta and willl include stops in Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Oakland, Los Angeles, and more, before she hits the UK and Europe in June next year.


	Williams has long used her platform to advocate for equality, particularly in her home state of Tennessee. Last year, after declining an official state honor, she criticised the actions of the state's Republican leadership, calling out what she described as “blatant racism” and encouraging young people to vote with equality in mind.


	The singer has also spoken openly about the sexism she has faced throughout her career. In 2022, she said she avoided playing guitar on stage because of the likelihood of derisive comments, and in 2023 she addressed online backlash after postponing Paramore shows due to illness, calling out “internet bros” and clarifying that most rock bands would not co-sign that behaviour.

“This Feels Unaccountably Ludicrous,” Anne Eickelberg wrote in her diary in April 1995. “Torrential Flood of Ugly Losers.” “Thwarting Forever Ubiquitous Lameness.” “Tit Fuck Uranus Lengthwise.” “Turds, Farts, and Uber-Logs.” “Tour Flunkies Under Live.”

Eickelberg was proposing variations on the initials of her own unwieldy band name: Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, the kind of name that arrives as a lark and settles in as an albatross. Seven months before, they had released Strangers From the Universe, an album that opens with a punk-surrealist ode to an enviable tortoise and closes with a folk-surrealist ballad about the end of humanity as we know it. The music between may be best summarized in the fragmentary style the band itself often put to brilliant and frustrating use.

Surrealism is a part of it. Pranks. Noise. Free improvisation. More interest in structure and sweetness than you might think at first, when all you notice are the smash cuts from one strange musical scene to the next. Soundtracks to imaginary pulp films, or religious rituals. Five singers, three guitars, bass, drums, banjo, mandolin, Optigan, taking turns or all going at once. Aching beauty, childhood regression, grotesque desire. Sort of like a lullaby that carries you into a nightmare from which you awake laughing. This was Thinking Fellers Union Local 282's idea of a commercial record.

The last of Eickelberg's proposed alternate names had to do with the band's particular circumstances in April 1995. They were getting ready to hit the road and open for—to be Tour Flunkies Under—Live. Yes, Live, the quartet of musical goatees then in the process of sending the magnificently dour single “Lightning Crashes” to the top of the Billboard rock charts. Humorless, messianic, bald, successful, they were everything Thinking Fellers were not. The Fellers' accounts of the disastrous arena shows that followed are like scenes out of Heironymous Bosch: basketballs hurled from the audience whizzing past their heads, a fan in the front row who “nearly broke his middle finger off giving me the finger so hard,” a conspicuous recurrence of the word hatred. For Eickelberg, the experience was educational. “It answered a lot of questions for us, too,” she later said in an interview with Perfect Sound Forever, “because it made it so clear that there was just no fucking way that we ever gonna get bigger than we were.”

Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, in this musically astounding and commercially disappointing stretch of mid-to-late life, was Eickelberg on bass; Mark Davies, Brian Hageman, and Hugh Swarts on guitars; and Jay Paget on drums. Everyone sang, contributed to songwriting, and played instruments other than their primary one. (An earlier album's liner notes simply credit all five with “instruments.”) The four string-playing Fellers had grown up in Iowa and moved to the Bay Area in the mid-'80s, where they soon linked up with original drummer Paul Bergmann and commenced living the dream of bohemian band life, with all five members shacking up together and practicing in the same Oakland house. A detailed timeline of the band's existence on their official website gives a window on their habits around this period: “drinking generic burgundy, listening to two big band radio stations at the same time, and writing songs.”

Rent was cheap and the music industry's brief but intense fascination with “alternative rock” made an actual career for a band as strange as this one seem worth pursuing. They'd even opened for Nirvana once, a month after Nevermind came out. It's hard to imagine their particular sensibility—driven by mind-meld improvisation and arcane inside jokes, so intensely collaborative as to render individual authorship nearly moot—emerging without this period of cohabitation and the economic conditions that enabled it. They must have spent so much time practicing, bouncing ideas, fucking around, hanging out.

By the time of Strangers From the Universe, they were four albums and three EPs deep and seriously considering quitting. The last two full-lengths had come out on Matador, a label whose combination of curatorial boldness and distribution muscle made it perhaps the ideal home for them, but their signing hadn't translated to big sales or reliable crowds. Eickelberg and Hageman's extensive tour diaries, archived on the band's website, are wryly candid catalogs of the thrills and indignities of life on the road. “The dread that we won't get our guarantee, that we'll be hog-tied or kicked out,” Eickelberg wrote at one particularly empty and dispiriting show in Buffalo. “And, of course, there's the hideous certain prospect of playing for 45 minutes to the bartender…[and] the more basic underlying anger at having to pay dues for ever & ever unto infinity.”

After touring relentlessly for several years, they took a yearlong hiatus in 1993. They'd stopped living together and moved into a new San Francisco practice space full of junkies and squatters. The situation was dire, but something about it inspired them to keep going, to take a big swing and see if they could make a real living in music after all. “We did sporadic things during that time, but we were kind of trying to take a break from each other,” Davies said of Strangers From the Universe's gestation. “And then at the end of that period we basically said, ‘Let's try to push it more instead of giving up.'” On your first listen to Strangers From the Universe, you might wonder: What the fuck were they thinking? This was going to be their commercial break? It's true that the quotient of songs to noise experiments was a bit higher than on previous albums, but the songs themselves are more open-ended, further abstracting the influence of post-punk and no wave into a dream zone where anything at all might happen. And though the mix was cleaner than it had ever been, it only served to reveal Thinking Fellers' inexorable weirdness in sparkling new detail.

They sometimes sound like they're under the impression that they must invent a whole new way of playing together with each song they write. It's the kind of radical naivete you might encounter in Zen Buddhism or the comedown from a powerful psychedelic trip. Who says a mandolin isn't a percussion instrument? Why can't a few staccato blasts of guitar noise serve as a song's hook? Can we both play bass on this one? “February,” with its intricately gnarled figurations of banjo and furious electric guitar, might serve as the basis of an entire subgenre if anyone else could be bothered to pick up the baton, progressive punk for the acid hoedown scene. It's not just the unusual instruments, it's the way they all tangle and spar, at cross purposes one moment and in tandem the next. Paget plays drums like the caffeinated offspring of Can's Jaki Liebezeit, finding deep pockets in a groove that might otherwise sound like so much clattering. Eickelberg's bass bounces and weaves, offering elaborate countermelodies and emphatic punctuations. “Everything's the same, it's just more of the same,” goes the barked chorus, an account of depression that could also serve as an indictment of other bands' complacency.

With “Guillotine,” a tapestry of chiming strings and stoned group chanting, they were nearly to the point of inventing Animal Collective, a band of Feller fanatics so devoted they once convinced their heroes to reunite for a few shows. The song's crisscrossing arpeggios start out pleasantly dreamy but slide here and there into foreboding dissonance. There are no drums. The whole thing feels like it might float away if not for a knotty descending riff that shows up every once in a while to keep things tethered to the ground. At some point, so gradually that you hardly notice it happening, the dissonance takes over. The tether slips, childlike voices chatter insanely at the margins. Without ever losing its sense of hazy reverie, the song becomes genuinely frightening, a good high gone bad.

“Guillotine” first appeared in truncated instrumental form under the name “Firing Squad” on The Funeral Pudding, the 1994 EP that immediately preceded Strangers From the Universe. It was one of the brief and stubbornly abstract bits of improvisation that recur on every Thinking Fellers album, running amidst the more developed songs like a babbling river of the subconscious. Fans affectionately call these pieces “Feller filler.” “Bomber Pilot WWII,” the third track on Strangers, is a typical example: some lonesome guitar ambience accompanied by crunchy low-end sounds of uncertain origin, all drifting nowhere in particular for about a minute before cutting out.

Feller filler occupies a complicated place in the Thinking Fellers canon. On one hand, you could skip it all without missing much. On the other, its persistence across their catalog, even on an ostensibly listener-friendly album like this one, suggests it was a crucial element of the band's self-conception about which they were not willing to compromise. They wrote many of their songs through collective improvisation, and they often jammed onstage; Feller filler both lays bare the inner workings of their process and serves as a gauntlet for any would-be fans who can't hang. They were practically begging Live's crowd to throw basketballs.

Thinking Fellers' surreal humor and penchant for undercutting their own ambition can obscure the fact that they were top-notch musicians. They would expend enormous energy on what might seem like jokes, like a note-perfect three-guitar arrangement of the orchestral theme song to a 1950s variety show, performed live on the Strangers From the Universe tour. The individual members had little if any formal training on their instruments; you get the sense that they learned to play by playing together, honing their group sensibility over what must have been countless hours of rehearsal. Like their shaggy San Francisco forebears in the Grateful Dead, by living together and playing constantly, they all found instrumental voices that were perfect for this particular band, even if they weren't necessarily the kind of professional-grade virtuosos who would thrive in any context they encountered. Rarely is anyone playing lead in a traditional sense—there's simply too much going on—but if you focus on any particular instrumental part, you'll often find a marvel of intricacy. Their songwriting is less a matter of chords and a melody than the architectural arrangement of these gleaming and misshapen riffs, laid at seemingly impossible angles of mutual support, like pillars in an Escher drawing.

The album's crowning achievement is “Cup of Dreams,” a nearly seven-minute agglomeration of childlike synth melodies, spy-movie basslines, mechanized piano runs, and dream-pop guitar hooks that stands as one of the most beguiling creations in all of '90s indie rock. It feels a bit like one of those Paul McCartney medley-songs that involve stitching together the best parts of six different abandoned compositions, one refrain after another. For Thinking Fellers, the equivalent of “If I ever get out of here…” is someone moaning through distortion so thick you can only make out half the words over rainfall sound effects and a keyboard coming in from the next room. And yet—it's fucking beautiful. Beautiful in some fleeting subconscious way, like a memory of an old friend you can only keep on the surface of your mind for a half-second at a time. You can almost imagine the version of Thinking Fellers that did make it big, with legions of freaks pulling out their lighters and singing incoherently along.

There are lots of silly lyrics on Strangers From the Universe: gooey sex jokes, outlandish creatures, bathetic nosedives from the romantic to the juvenile. “My Pal the Tortoise,” the opener, might be cloyingly whimsical if its series of questions and answers about its shell-dwelling hero weren't so funny and oddly poetic. (“What does he file at the hall of records?/A proclamation of tortoise intent.”) But even in its more antic moments, the album is often preoccupied with endings and what comes after them. In “Socket,” martial snare rolls and bee-sting guitar lines soundtrack a story about a childhood near-death experience, followed by a lifelong sense that something went irreversibly wrong in that moment of survival. “Hundreds of Years,” alternately frenzied and sedate, contrasts the petty concerns of people with the peace of trees that will long outlast us. The few intelligible lyrics on “Cup of Dreams” speak of a cleansing flood that will “drown our mouths,” “make our heads explode,” and “wash out our dirty minds.”

“The Operation” is a musically triumphant and lyrically nightmarish account of a surgery that seems to kill its patient. In keeping with the album's prevailing tone, death is experienced not as tragedy but transcendent release. The Fellers deliver the crucial lines in drunken-chorus mode over glorious guitar grind and cartoonishly massive drum fills, the raggedness of their delivery belying the delicate polyphony of the vocal arrangement: “Graceful became my hands, they fluttered away from me/Graceful became my heart as it pumped apart from me/Graceful became my tongue, rhyme and meter running away.”

When writing Strangers From the Universe, “We weren't thinking of going anywhere,” Hageman said. “We were thinking about ending.” Needless to say, the vision of giant clubs filled with adoring freaks didn't come to pass. For Davies, Strangers and the tour that followed represented “a pinnacle of sorts” for the band. Not everyone seems to have felt that way at the time. “This lifestyle and this pursuit seem more and more meaningless to me,” Eickelberg wrote in her tour diary in November '94, at the end of an entry about getting sick without health insurance. “I feel silly, being in a band and touring and hanging out in ugly, boring rock clubs (at my age.) When I look at us I think we are ridiculous sometimes.” “Half of the time on this tour I've thought—I've strongly believed—that we are fooling ourselves and shouldn't be in this business (at OUR ages),” she wrote soon after. Two months after the album came out, Thinking Fellers' final push at making an honest living in indie rock was beginning to sputter.

The entire quixotic notion of alternative rock as a commercial prospect was sputtering, too. Kurt Cobain had died the previous April, but the rock charts were still peppered with bands that had credible ties to the underground. Within a year, Live's Throwing Copper would become the biggest rock album in America, helping to usher in the “post-grunge” era, when the majors stopped pretending to care about ingenuity and focused instead on signing increasingly faded carbon copies of Pearl Jam. The symbolism of Thinking Fellers' opening slot on the Live's 1995 tour is almost too perfect: The freaks get chased offstage and the professionals take over.

Thinking Fellers toured for another year, parted with Matador, made another album, 1996's equally dazzling I Hope It Lands, and stepped back from the band as a career pursuit. They still played the occasional show and labored sporadically for years on their 2001 swan song, whose very title, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, is enough to signal the retreat of whatever aspirations to rock stardom they once held. It's more elegiac than you might expect from the name: “91 Dodge Van,” titled after their old tour chariot, opens with autumnal guitars and Eickelberg sighing the lines “Looking back over our days, I know we've won/Sometimes it feels like that's erased by moving on.” It also has a song called “Boob Feeler.”

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. There's still one song on Strangers From the Universe to discuss, one final daydream before real life sets in. It's called “Noble Experiment,” it closes the album, and it's the only Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 song you'll ever hear played around a campfire or performed by the sorts of indie rock stars the Fellers never became. The words were written by Davies and delivered by Eickelberg, with the other Fellers joining in harmony as the verses go by. “If the sadness of life makes you tired,” it begins, “and the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day.”

“Noble Experiment,” a waltz-time lullaby for humanity's extinction, brings Strangers From the Universe's fixation on finality into clear focus, just as the album itself winds down. The Fellers receive this fate with characteristic jubilation: an opportunity to leave cruel routine behind and be reborn as sparrows chattering in the treetops or weeds busting up through old sidewalks. It would be disingenuous to suggest that Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 experienced a similarly transformative rebirth after calling it a day, that the band received the kind of widespread recognition in death that had eluded it in life. They're not Pavement, or even Duster. There have been well-received reissues—the 2022 pressing of Strangers From the Universe sold out quickly—but they remain a band for the freaks. Still, the records live on, like the trees in “Hundreds of Years” that outlast the squabbling people, monuments to possibility yet unexplored. Or like the heart in “The Operation,” still pumping even as the body passes away.

	Though Rian Johnson has noted there's no performer he counts as a “white whale” for his budding Benoit Blanc/Knives Out universe, there is one seasoned actress he'd love to work with.


	“There are so many great actors I'd like to work with,” the Academy Award nominee told our sister publication IndieWire recently. “But, yes, if you're reading this, Meryl Streep, I feel like you'd slot into a murder mystery very well.”


	When told that the Big Little Lies alumna finally appeared on the 50th season of Saturday Night Live, Johnson added, “If Lorne [Michaels] can do it, then, goddamn, so can we.”

	While Streep's resume speaks for itself (an understatement, to be sure), it should be noted that she's already made her mark in the comedic murder-mystery genre via Hulu's Only Murders in the Building, which wrapped the airing of its fifth season last month. (Next up, Streep will reprise her iconic role from The Devil Wears Prada, portraying the fierce editor-in-chief of a glossy, Miranda Priestly, in the film's 2026 sequel.)

	Elsewhere in the interview, Johnson emphasized his love for making the Knives Out films, which first kicked off with the phenomenon of the first Ana de Armas vehicle released in 2019. 


	“I love working with actors so much,” he said. “There are so many actors I haven't worked with I want to work with. And that's one of the real treats of making these movies is you get to experience new actors and these big casts. At the same time, I'd be lying if I didn't say: one of the great things about doing these movies is I get to know these actors so, when I'm writing original stuff now, that are not these movies, of course I have everyone in mind for it.”

	











Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is the third installment in the tonally sprawling film series, featuring a stacked cast in Josh Brolin, Josh O'Connor, Kerry Washington, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, Andrew Scott, Glenn Close and Thomas Haden Church. This go around, Blanc (Daniel Craig) descends on an upstate New York town to solve the murder of a domineering and hate-spewing monsignor (Brolin). 


	The Gothic and darkly satirical film, which bowed in certain theaters before the Thanksgiving holiday, will release on Netflix Dec. 12. The box office take so far has been upward of $4 million, with great word of mouth from critics and audiences alike.

“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen,” the Oscar nominee said in a recent interview. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Josh Brolin says his character in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was not inspired by Donald Trump, whom he recalls as a former friend and “genius” in “marketing.”


	In a Saturday interview with The Independent, the Oscar nominee said his portrayal of Monsignor Wicks in the latest Knives Out film was not based on the president. “I could make something up and say it was rooted in a kind of Trumpian greed,” he noted, adding that after “Wicks garners a sense of power, then there are no boundaries.”




	The topic prompted Brolin to touch on his former friendship with the president, further addressing speculation of Trump running for a third term, which he predicted is “just not going to happen.”

	“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen. And if it does, then I'll deal with that moment,” Brolin said. “But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”


	The two met after Brolin starred in Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, which the president was supposed to make a cameo in. Of Trump's business ventures, the actor argued that “there is no greater genius than him in marketing — he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it.” 


	“And that's why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him,” he added. “I think it's much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”

	Academy and Tony Award-winning actress Judi Dench detailed the realities of her eye condition, which has led to a loss of sight and her stepping back from the stage and screen.


	“No, you don't [see me on camera], because I can't see anymore,” she told an ITV News reporter in a recent joint interview with longtime collaborator and friend Ian McKellen, with whom she starred in Macbeth in 1979.


	When McKellen joked that they could see her, the veteran star responded, “Yes, and I can see your outline and I know you so well, in your Macbeth scarf. But I can't recognize anybody now.”

	The Notes on a Scandal star continued, “I can't see the television, I can't see to read.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The X-Men alum then jokingly asked Dench if she ever goes up to “total strangers [to] say, ‘Lovely to see you again,'” to which she laughed and answered, “Sometimes!”


	Dench, who has led a storied career from her memorable appearance in Shakespeare in Love to her formidable portrayal as M in Daniel Craig's run as James Bond, has been open about her diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, a degenerative eye condition that affects the central part of the retina and results in central vision distortion or loss, since 2012.


	She hinted at her retirement last year, and the year prior, said, “It's difficult for me if I have any length of a part. I haven't yet found a way. Because I have so many friends who will teach me the script. But I have a photographic memory.” 


	Her most recent credits include a cameo in the 2022 Apple TV+ Christmas musical comedy Spirited, starring Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds. ITV noted that the Belfast star also appeared in a recent holiday-themed advert in the U.K. She and McKellen are currently backing an initiative to revitalize the William Shakespeare curriculum taught at English schools, using rehearsals as teaching tools to invigorate understanding of the Bard.

There are injections that slow the advancement of macular degeneration.  Check with an opthalmologist.

She should try Preservision Areds 2. My father used to get shots in the eye for macular degeneration. 7 years later, his eye sight has improved so much he no longer has to wear prescription glasses. He had a total 3 shots then no longer needed them.

I have had macular degeneration since 2004. Luckily it hasn't advanced as fast as Judi's. But it's coming. There is no cure, no treatment

Have had several aging relatives lose their sight to Macular including my father who even had a hard time trying to eat finally.
It is sad it can't t be fixed at least some
She is an amazing actress and person.

I was hoping there would be some medical advances to help her from losing all her sight but she must be out of options. She is just amazing.

The "Sneakernight" singer shared a selfie from her hospital bed.

Vanessa Hudgens and husband Cole Tucker have welcomed their second child together.


	The High School Musical alum — and singer behind pop songs including 2008's “Sneakernight” and 2006's “Come Back to Me” — announced her newborn's birth on Saturday (Nov. 29) with a photo of herself hooked up to monitors in a hospital bed. In the snapshot, Hudgens appears to be holding hands with Tucker, a former professional baseball player who most recently played for the Los Angeles Angels before retiring in May.


	“Well…. I did it,” Hudgens captioned her Instagram post. “Had another baby!!! What a wild ride labor is. Big shout out to all the moms. It's truly incredible what our bodies can do.”

	The singer/actress publicly shared the news of her pregnancy in July, when she debuted her baby bump on social media through a maternity photo shoot with Tucker.  Since then, she's shared other fun glimpses at life while expecting, including pictures of herself dressed up as Mother Earth — painting her belly as Earth — for Halloween, and vacation photos from attending a September wedding in Italy.


	The couple welcomed their first child together last year, in July 2024, and have since kept personal details private. 




	Last year Hudgens, aka “Goldfish,” was also crowned the winner of season 11 of The Masked Singer.


	Hudgens leads the upcoming '60s thriller Quiet Storm, the directorial debut of Anthony Thorne, who also co-stars (as does Mira Sorvino). As of July, production had wrapped. No post-production news has been released; Deadline last reported the film was being presented and executive produced by Nick Cassavetes. Hudgens portrays romance novelist Abby Lynche, who “finds herself confined during 1969's Hurricane Camille, confronting personal revelations amid social upheaval and women's liberation while the storm rages outside.”

Back in March, we reported that Amazon was embarking on a project that was going to be a bad idea that was going to make a lot of people mad, i.e., using artificial intelligence to generate dubbed voice tracks for anime series. Now, lo and behold, a whole bunch of people are exactly as mad as predicted, as the tech giant rolled out a new English dub of beloved anime series Banana Fish this month, completely generated by AI.

Originally published in manga form starting in 1985, Banana Fish was both controversial and influential at the time for several aspects of its story of a noble gangster investigating a crime ring using the titular drug to control people's minds: Its violence, yes, but also its sexuality, whether that meant more explicit material happening in the criminal underworld, or the implied-so-hard-it's-one-shade-short-of-canon relationship between main character Ash Lynx and his friend Eiji Okumura. The series was given an anime adaptation in 2018, produced by Japanese studio MAPPA, and syndicated internationally by Amazon. Although it released with English subtitles, the series never got an English voice track—until this week, when AI-generated Spanish and English versions of the show's dialogue were offered as “beta” features for Prime Video viewers.

The response to the news has included a lot of very strongly negative reactions, for a lot of very strongly obvious reasons: Animation fans take their dubs and subs extremely serious regardless, and having voice actors be put out of work while a mega-giant foists off a product that can't hope to match the richness of a fully voiced set of performances is an extra twist of the digital knife. Per CBR, at least one voice actor who's worked on a number of big-name projects for Amazon in the past—Daman Mills, whose credits include Rebuild Of Evangelion, Dragon Ball Super, and One Piece—has stated on social media that he won't work for the company again if they keep the AI-generated dub up. (Meanwhile, we popped up the show's first episode for a minute just to make sure we weren't talking out of our asses on the quality of the resulting dub, and woof, is that some hideously lifeless robot talking. If the goal here was to completely drain a vibrant, fascinating show of all life in the most piss-the-fans-off-way possible, that's definitely one way to pull it off.)

Josh Brolin reflected on his previous friendship with Donald Trump — back when the POTUS was a real estate mogul based in New York City. Calling him a “genius” in marketing, the Oscar-nominated Milk actor said he knew a “different guy” than the figure the GOP leader cuts today.


	In a sprawling interview with The Independent promoting Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, Brolin said he didn't base his character, the megalomaniacal Monsignor Wicks who leads a local church, off of the president.


	“I could make something up and say it was rooted in a kind of Trumpian greed,” he noted.

	Of his past acquaintanceship, he said, “I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying forever, it's just not going to happen. And if it does, then I'll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”


	He continued, discussing the Trump Hotel: “I'm sure there was a lot of corruption involved,” he remarked, adding that he found “interesting” the idea of building a high-rise “in the middle of a cesspool city during the late '70s … now it's power unmitigated, it's unregulated.”


	The No Country for Old Men alum concluded: “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it. And that's why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him. I think it's much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”

	











	Brolin has been forthcoming about having been friends with Trump, whom he first met after filming Oliver Stone's Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps in 2010. While speaking with journalist Graham Bensinger last year, the Weapons star described that initial dinner — which also featured Stone, co-star Shia LaBeouf and First Lady-to-be Melania Trump — as leading to the “weirdest fucking moment” in which the tycoon ignored his three separate asks to tour the upstairs of his Manhattan apartment. 


	In later years, during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2016, Brolin emphasized he “was” buddies with Trump, echoing current sentiments by characterizing the reality star-turned-politician as having “singlehandedly turned around the economy of Manhattan. I found that very fascinating. I think he's an interesting guy.”


	And, in 2020, Brolin shared an Instagram missive — in which he described himself as a “conservative Democrat” — speaking out against Trump ahead of that year's presidential election, saying, “I refuse to believe that Donald Trump is our core version of American masculinity.”

A grifter ripping off other people, squandering their money and reaping the benefit. He did it in with his daddy's money in real estate, going bankrupt multiple times in the process. Trump University, Trump Steaks, the XFL, Trump Casino. The only thing saving him was Mark Burnett making him a gameshow host. His biggest swindle was getting elected President where he and his crooked family have been filling their pockets since.

All valid points. I really liked Josh until  reading this. What a let down.

Buddies? Did he ever hang with Epstein?

A successful CON-MAN.

“Conservative Democrat” just feels like a Hollywood euphemism for Republican.

I wouldn't brag about being buddies with an animal like Trump but that's just me.

Yes – Brolin is a DINO – Democrat in name only.

Brolin is on point. If Trump were to fade into thin air tomorrow, Americans would have nothing to do with themselves. There is a hole in the American experiment that that man fills like a hand fills a glove.
How anyone thought that the Wild West was an aspirational concept is a case in point. The USA was built on the premise of maximum freedom for minimum responsibility. What did they think was going to happen?

The Army's favorite psychological operation soldiers want you. The Army's 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne), the same group that put out the eerie recruitment video “Ghosts in the Machine” last year, released a new installment on social media this month. And it wants the viewer to know what psychological warfare is. 

See for yourself:

If it seems ominous, that's the point. This is the unit's idea of a recruitment video. The 4th Psychological Operations Group, based out of Fort Bragg, is focused on Military Information Support Operations (MISO), better known as psychological operations, or PSYOP. 

The unit has been putting out striking, montage-filled recruiting ads in recent years. A Department of Defense's Inspector General report last year found that the Army did not have enough PSYOP soldiers in its ranks to help fight an information war against peers such as Russia or China.

As with past recruitment videos, the new one touches on great counterintelligence ploys, Patton's “Ghost Army” from World War II, with video showing the inflatable decoy tanks used for it. “There is another force applied in combat that we generally don't think of as a weapon of war. That weapon is words. Words are weapons,” the voiceover intones. 

Along with old films of subterfuge and surrendering enemy armies, there's plenty of modern video, including drone footage of an eerie masked soldier waving. The unit once again brings in ghost imagery — drawing from Fleischer Studio's iconic ghosts from their Koko the Clown cartoons — but also works in quite a bit of obviously computer-generated imagery that looks just slightly off. The effect is an unsettling montage of footage where there's always something being toyed with. Maybe that's intentional, given the unit's entire mission and methodology. 

In fact, the whole final sections of the ad before “Join PSYOP” is a barrage of subliminal images, with quick frames showing Koko the Clown, snarling ghosts dressed up like modern soldiers, Internet memes including Pepe the Frog and more. “Anything we touch is a weapon,” a subtitle says near the end. 

Last year, after “Ghosts in the Machine” came out, a PSYOP reservist pointed out that the video is more a recruitment piece than an actual example of a psychological operation. This new one fits that same mold, although the imagery is rife with nods to subversion, subliminal messaging and other tools that are useful to psyops. 

The Army has been putting additional resources and attention towards information warfare, including standing up new units meant to counter digital campaigns from adversaries and conduct wider public affairs battles against disinformation, but the 4th Psychological Operations Group, set up more than five decades ago, is a hardened veteran of the information war.

The phone rang. I answered it. 

“Psychics-R-Us. This is Taliesin,” I said into the receiver. “How can I help you?” 

“This is Dwayne,” the man said. “I need to get rid of a curse.” 

“A curse?” I said, trying to buy a little time. I had no idea how to respond, but my minutes were down, and I needed to think of something. 

“Yeah,” Dwayne said, “this lady, she put a curse on me, and I gotta get rid of it.” 

I recalled reading a science magazine article about curses. 

“Research shows curses only work on people who believe in them,” I told him. “Don't believe in it, and everything'll be fine.” 

There was a long silence. 

“Yeah,” Dwayne said, sounding unconvinced, “I just need to know how to get rid of this curse, man.” 

***

It's true. I once worked for a psychic hotline in the late '80s. I'm not a psychic (I knew you were wondering), but that didn't matter. 

It was a paying job that didn't require me to expend any physical effort. I was tired of kitchen work. On my feet for eight hours, low pay, driving home late smelling like bleach and garlic. It sucked. I was done. 

I wrote for the college arts paper for a short time. That was much better than filling five-gallon buckets with sliced onions. I needed another job like that one, and my only other marketable skill was reading tarot cards. 

I remember being in bookstores as a kid and seeing the signs for the “occult” section. Something about that word always interested me, and I liked to look at the artwork in the books. The decks of tarot cards reminded me of Dungeons & Dragons. 

When I was older, the mother of a friend gave me a reading. Some of what she said made sense to me, and the whole thing appealed to the fantasy- and comic book-reading part of my brain. I was surprised to find that people said my readings were accurate. 

I didn't learn until later in life that this can be attributed to a psychological phenomenon called the Barnum effect. Vague language, which can apply to anybody, seems tailored to us when we are told that it is. There's a viral video that shows people reading and agreeing with astrology descriptions that they were told were for their sign but which were actually for a different one. They still found the descriptions accurate. 

As a 19-year-old, I didn't know about any of this. All I knew was that Psychics-R-Us was hiring. My friend Dave got a job there, and he said it paid well. The people who I'd been giving readings to for free said they found them helpful. I didn't see a problem with it. 

***

I put Dwayne on hold. 

I turned to Glenda, a more experienced psychic who sat next to me in The Golden Obelisk Room. It was an ordinary room in an office building with acoustic ceiling tile and fluorescent lights. There was a large poster on the door of a golden obelisk, though, covered in hieroglyphics. All the rooms had half-assed themes like this. 

“Do you know how to get rid of a curse?” I asked. 

“No,” she said. “I'd ask Oswyn.” 

That made sense. If there was anyone who'd know how to get rid of a curse, it would be our resident druid. 

I headed to The Sage Garden Room to find him. 

***

Psychics-R-Us was an information service. Information service phone numbers arrived in the U.S. in the 1980s. Phone companies billed their customers on behalf of the information service providers and kept a cut of the charges. Those customers were legally protected from losing phone service over nonpayment for these services if they otherwise paid their phone bills in a timely manner. 

I felt pretty good about this. No matter what, I wasn't the cause of anyone going broke. It seemed harmless. 

To get the job, I had to pass an audition by demonstrating my ability to talk to people convincingly about their problems. I gave an in-person reading to a Psychics-R-Us employee while the manager, Cassandra, observed. 

I failed the first audition. My lack of experience giving readings to strangers showed, and my performance wasn't credible. Cassandra told me to practice and return in a couple of weeks. 

I took her advice, and the second time I passed. I gave a reading to Sarah, another psychic who worked there, and we talked about her love life. It was the kind of conversation I'd have with any of my friends. I didn't think it was such a big deal, but that didn't stop Cassandra from fawning over me. 

She told me how blown away she was by the psychic abilities I had at such a young age. She couldn't imagine how powerful I'd become as I got older. I was going to be of great service to all the callers out there who needed my guidance and wisdom, most of whom wanted to know, “Does he love me?” 

Turns out “most” was a bit of an exaggeration. Most of the calls, by far, were lotto calls. 

Psychics-R-Us's ads portrayed lotto winners getting their winning numbers from psychics like me. The cost of the call was $4 per minute, but the first five minutes were free. Our goal was to convert free lotto calls into full-length readings. 

We were offered tips to maximize call times. “Sit in silence for a few moments with the caller to tune into their energy,” for example. We were also told to try cobbling together a reading by drawing tarot cards for the lotto numbers. 

Psychics-R-Us did its best to preempt any development of remorse by playing to our vanity. This meant lots of assurances that we were “incredibly powerful psychics” helping people in need. 

Cassandra held weekly meetings with us to go over our numbers. She emphasized there was a reason why those particular callers reached our phones. We needed to explore that psychic connection, to help solve the real problem driving them to call. 

Most callers just wanted numbers and would disconnect before five minutes passed, no matter what. But there were some who wanted to talk. In a country without universal health care, a psychic was the closest thing many of these callers had to a therapist. 

Callers with serious problems were directed elsewhere. Abused women were directed to women's shelters in their area. Suicidal people were directed to hotlines. There were binders in every room with these numbers. Fortunately, these calls were rare. 

Some of the calls could even be fun. 

One guy called because he was a professional who liked to smoke pot, and he wanted someone to tell him that was OK. I was happy to take 12 minutes to oblige. 

The funniest call I had was the elderly woman who called on a busy Sunday morning. 

“Are you really a psychic?” she demanded. 

I affirmed that I was. 

“Then I denounce you, and I denounce what you do, in Jesus's name,” she declaimed. 

“Ma'am, thank you,” I said, feigning contrition. “It really means a lot to hear that from you. I think my co-worker needs to hear this, too.” 

“Put him on,” she said. We got her to spend 20 minutes denouncing several of us in the room. 

We were expected to humor the callers provided they weren't pulling pranks, like the young woman who called wanting to know about her boyfriend. 

“I see the Death card,” I said, drawing from the deck. “Things may be going well now, but there could be an abrupt change soon.” 

“Well, you're wrong, 'cause I'm doing him right now!” she crowed as she hung up on me. 

Cassandra overheard my end of that call and asked me what happened. When I told her, she insisted I let her clean my aura. I tried to refuse, but she was implacable. 

She led me to her office. Long sheets of blue and aqua rayon draped the room, tucked under the ceiling tiles. A tabletop water fountain burbled. She had me stand in the center of the room, arms outstretched, eyes closed. I peeked from behind squinted eyelids. 

Cassandra vigorously pantomimed a wiping motion with her hands, a few inches from my body, breathing deeply, exerting great effort. I tried to stifle my laughter. After a few seconds of this, she said I could open my eyes. Beaming, she told me my aura was clean. She sent me back to the phones. 

***

Oswyn was finishing a call. I waited. 

A large man in his late 40s, he had a red beard, a round face and wore his jeans tucked into knee-high moccasins. His desk was decorated with dreamcatchers and wolf drawings. He had encyclopedic occult knowledge. He hung up the phone and turned to me. “What's up,” he asked. 

“I have a caller wanting to get rid of a curse,” I said. “Can you help him?” 

“Of course!” he exclaimed, bolting out of his chair. Oswyn was always happy to show off. I filled him in on the few details I had as he followed me back to my phone. 

***

The office park where Psychics-R-Us was located had seen better days. It was wedged between two interstate highways near a corridor of auto body shops and fast-food restaurants. The buildings needed paint jobs, and the parking lot needed repaving. 

Somehow I hadn't noticed on my audition days what a dump it was, but now I was an employee and nervous time was over. I arrived for my first day of work and the new hire orientation. I was sent to a conference room where the other newbies had gathered. I bought some Sun Chips from the vending machine. 

There were six of us scattered around the room munching our snacks in silence. Cassandra entered and stood in front of the whiteboard with a serious expression on her face. 

“Before we start,” she said, “there's something you all need to know. This office park is in the center of an incredibly powerful psychic vortex.” Her eyes widened and she scanned the room, making sure we had internalized the gravity of her statement. The sound of crunching had stopped. 

“If it's 50 miles an hour out there,” she said, pointing toward one of the highways, “it's 150 miles an hour in here!” Her spiel seemed absurd to me, but when I looked around the room, everyone looked to be taking it seriously. 

“At the end of your shift,” she said, “take time to pause and center yourselves before leaving. After all, you don't want to be going 150 miles an hour when everyone else is going 50!” 

“We also suggest,” she said, “that you keep something in your car to help you stay grounded. Corn is a really grounding influence, so it's a good idea to just keep a bag of corn chips in your car.” 

Someone raised their hand. 

“Go ahead,” Cassandra said. 

“What about corn muffins. Do you think those would work?” 

“Oh, definitely,” Cassandra replied. “Corn of any kind is really effective.” 

***

Oswyn picked up the phone. 

“Hi, Dwayne. This is Oswyn,” he said. “Tell me about this curse.” 

Oswyn listened solemnly, slowly nodding along. After a few moments, he responded. 

“Here's what I want you to do,” he said. “Light a candle, put it in front of a mirror facing your front door ...” 

Oswyn had it under control. I went outside for a smoke. 

***

Cassandra took a trip to Egypt. Before departing, she went around the office soliciting orders for mystical scarabs. As a child, I loved looking at pictures of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Given the prices Cassandra quoted, I expected these to be elaborate amulets made from turquoise and copper. 

When she returned, she went around the office to deliver everyone's scarabs, fishing them out of a brown paper lunch bag. They were about 1/2-inch long, fashioned from clay and resembled pinkie toes, lumpy with poorly applied pottery glaze. But very powerful spiritual energy! You could just feel it! That was the word around the office, anyway. 

It was a new-agey scene, and Dave and I never quite fit in. We were a pair of smart-asses, and the earnestness of our co-workers paired with the cynicism of the call-lengthening strategies gave us a case of cognitive dissonance. 

Though most of the people working there were true believers, there were some who seemed to understand that things were not quite what they seemed. The ones who worked there the longest got their start at Psychics-R-Us's sister business, a phone sex line. They had no illusions about what the job was. 

One of them, Millicent, came by The Golden Obelisk Room on one of my first nights of work. She stood in the doorway, introduced herself and asked me what my sign was. She was wearing stretch pants and a tank top, sipping from a Big Gulp. I detected a whiff of her armpits. I meekly answered, and then she asked me to guess hers. 

“Cancer?” I said. 

“No,” she said, “Sagittarius, but I'm as horny as a Cancer.” She rubbed her crotch against the door frame, leering at me. Fortunately, the phone rang, interrupting the moment. I was never so grateful to have to do my job making up lotto numbers. 

What a thing to be paid to do. 

They say that free-market capitalism is the most effective system at allocating resources, yet here I was being paid decent money to make up lotto numbers for callers who were so broke that gambling seemed like their only way out of poverty. 

When I read books on how to give tarot readings, much of the guidance was about the importance of the human connection and making a good-faith effort to connect with the questioner. This job turned all that on its head, and I didn't fully come to grips with what that meant until I worked at an in-person psychic fair. 

The fair was organized by one of my co-workers, Florence, a grandmotherly septuagenarian, and her husband, Bill. He cut quite a figure in the drab community center where the fair was held. He looked as though he stepped out of a Dickens novel, wearing a feather in his trilby, a bow tie and a woolen waistcoat. He walked with the aid of a crystal-topped black cane. 

Bill told me that he and Florence met in England, where they were carnies. His English accent and courtly presentation gave him the air of a gentleman, but something about the look in his eyes made me feel as if he was sizing me up to spot my weaknesses. I spoke to him as little as possible, assuming that pickpocketing was just one of the many dark arts he had mastered. 

Bill worked the room, identifying marks and bringing them to Florence, who effortlessly separated them from their money with a smile. 

That day was a sobering experience and was the beginning of the end of my time at Psychics-R-Us. I only talked to one person at the fair, a very nice man who seemed to have some kind of cognitive impairment. I did my best to make him feel good, and he left the table grateful and happy, but when it was over I felt like I needed a shower. Talking to disembodied voices on the phone is one thing ― sitting across the table from someone giving you $20 of what little money they have is another. 

The job became a lot less amusing to me, and I started having trouble keeping my minutes up. Whether it was guilt or boredom, I couldn't say. 

I started volunteering for nightshifts when the call volume was low. I was often by myself in The Golden Obelisk Room, lying on the floor with the lights turned off, zoning out to Music for Airports. I told people I was meditating. More than once I was jolted awake by someone coming in to see why I wasn't answering my phone. 

I was eventually fired. I didn't even last a year.

Oswyn came outside to let me know he had finished up with Dwayne. 

“I gave him some stuff to try,” he said. “Curses can be tricky.” 

“I tried telling him curses weren't real,” I said, snuffing out my beedi. 

“Unless you believe in them,” he said. 

I thanked him for his help as we walked back into the office. On returning to my desk, I saw the call with Dwayne went 25 minutes. Not bad, I thought. It'll definitely bump up my minutes for the week.

When humans manage to cut enough emissions and eventually reduce global temperatures, new research shows the Southern Ocean could kick warming back into gear.

Consider your morning cup of coffee. Your kettle's heating element — or flame on a stove — warms up water that you infuse with beans and pour into a mug. Maybe you get busy and the cup of joe sits there for a while, releasing its heat into the atmosphere of the room, until it reaches equilibrium with the indoor temperature. In other words: It got cold.

Now consider that the expansive Southern Ocean, which wraps around Antarctica, could one day do much the same thing. Since the Industrial Revolution kicked off, humans have dialed up the kettle to its max, adding extraordinary amounts of heat into the atmosphere, more than 90 percent of which has been absorbed by the sea. (It's also taken up a quarter of our CO2 emissions.) Under climate change, the Southern Ocean has been storing warmth which, like your morning jolt, can't stay there forever, and will someday return to the atmosphere.

New modeling suggests that this "burp" of heat — the scientists called it that, by the way — could be abrupt. In a scenario where humanity eventually reduces its greenhouse gas emissions and then goes "net negative," finding ways to remove those planet-warming pollutants from the atmosphere, global temperatures fall. But suddenly the Southern Ocean belches its accumulated heat, leading to a rate of planetary warming similar to what humanity is causing right now. And the thermal burping would continue for at least a century.

Put another way: According to this modeling, at least, humans figure out a way to reverse climate change, only to see the Southern Ocean essentially restart it. While there would be nothing our descendants could do to stop this — since the warming would be driven by already stored heat — the calculations are yet another urgent call to reduce that pollution as quickly and dramatically as possible.

This sudden eructation is not a sure thing, however — it's the prediction of a model. But it's a step toward understanding how the planet could respond as humans continue to manipulate the climate, both warming and cooling it. "The question is: How will the climate system, and specifically the ocean, react to scenarios where we remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and when we have a net global cooling effect?" said Svenja Frey, an oceanography PhD student at Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and coauthor of the paper.

The Southern Ocean may encircle the frozen continent of Antarctica, but it's very effective at storing heat: It alone holds around 80 percent of the warmth that's taken up by all the oceans. Some of this comes from currents that transport relatively toasty waters south, but also lots of upwelling in the Southern Ocean brings cold water to the surface to be warmed up.

The skies above the Southern Ocean are also somewhat less reflective than elsewhere around the globe. Cargo ships and industries in the Northern Hemisphere spew air pollution in the form of aerosols, which themselves bounce solar energy back into the cosmos and help brighten clouds, which reflect still more. That cooling phenomenon has vied, in a sense, with the warming that's come from the burning of fossil fuels. "That competition hasn't been as prevalent over the Southern Hemisphere, because it's this slightly more pristine atmosphere," said Ric Williams, an ocean and climate scientist at the University of Liverpool, who studies the Southern Ocean but wasn't involved in the paper.

In the scenario the researchers modeled, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 increases by 1 percent every year until the total amount is double what the planet had before the Industrial Revolution. Then negative emissions technologies reduce the carbon concentration by 0.1 percent annually. (The study didn't look a specific techniques, but one option is direct air capture of CO2, though this remains expensive and limited in scale.) In response, the atmosphere, land, and oceans cool.

But something starts brewing in the Southern Ocean. Its surface becomes colder, but also saltier due to the formation of new sea ice: When sea water freezes, it rejects its salt, which is then absorbed into the surrounding waters and makes the surface layer heavier. "At the same time, we have these warm, deeper waters," Frey said. "At some point, the water column becomes unstable, and that's when we have the deep convection event."

In other words, a burp. It's just one way that our planet's extraordinarily complex and intertwining systems might respond to rising and falling emissions in the centuries ahead. "There's very large uncertainty in the Earth system response to net-negative emissions — we don't understand that very well," said Simon Fraser University climate scientist Kirsten Zickfeld, who studies these dynamics but wasn't involved in the new paper. "We may well encounter surprises along the way, as this paper shows."

To be clear, in this scenario, removing atmospheric carbon significantly reduces global temperatures, even factoring in the burp. And the faster we move away from fossil fuels, the less CO2 we'll have to remove down the line. "Doing negative emissions and reducing our carbon load in the atmosphere is a good thing," Williams said. "I would just add that, rather than do negative emissions, it's better not to do the positive emissions in the first place."

Filming is now underway at the atmospheric Woodchester Park Mansion for the BBC's upcoming supernatural comedy The Reluctant Vampire, a fresh and playful adaptation of the beloved books by British comedy icon Eric Morecambe.

Woodchester Park Mansion is the perfect location for this spooky comedy, which is set in a timeless English village, where everything is picturesque, everything, that is, except for the vampires living in the castle on the hill who come out at night for a little drink of the locals.

The series is packed with a raft of stellar actors, including Stroud-based Charlie Cooper, BAFTA winner Lenny Rush, Joe Wilkinson, who recently featured in Celebrity Traitors, Billy Bailey and stand-up comedian Ross Noble.

The show follows Val, the “Reluctant Vampire”, who by day explores with fascination his newly discovered human side with the help of village girl Gertie (Ellie May Sheridan), but can never let his secret be known to the locals. Yet by night there's a coffin-load of expectations from his tradition obsessed vampire dad, Victor, (Tom Davis) his suspicious brother, Vernon, (Gabriel Nagy) and his doting mum Valeeta (Sian Clifford) who is the only one in the family who knows his true self. Val must navigate both worlds without letting his cover be staked.

Lenny Rush says: “How lucky am I to bring to life something from the mind of comedy legend Eric Morecambe? I just love Rob and Neil's interpretation, so many jokes and brilliant ideas. The flying might be a stretch but I'm game for anything!”

Jon Petrie, Director of Comedy, BBC says: “‘The Reluctant Vampire' is exactly the kind of distinctive comedy we're passionate about at the BBC. Rob and Neil Gibbons have brilliantly adapted Eric Morecambe's work into a sharp, character-driven sitcom that delivers both big laughs and genuine emotion. With the incredibly talented Lenny Rush in the lead role, we're confident this will become one of the standout comedies of the year.”

Astronomers using data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) have revealed that the initial "breakout" phase of a supernova is elongated, not perfectly spherical.

What it is: An artist's impression of the supernova explosion SN 2024ggi

Where it is: 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

When it was shared: Nov. 12, 2025

On April 10, 2024, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected first light from an explosion of a massive star with roughly 12 to 15 times the sun's mass. Just 26 hours later, astronomers pointed the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile at the supernova, as this early and brief window provided a rare opportunity to study the initial phase of a star's death.

The stunning image is an artist's interpretation, showcasing the supernova explosion as revealed by the VLT data. Thanks to some quick observations, astronomers were able to detect the explosion's shape during its earliest moments — a phase that would not have been seen if observed just one day later.

Known as SN 2024ggi, this supernova explosion took place in the galaxy NGC 3621, which is located approximately 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra. An image captured by the VLT on April 11, 2024 shows the location of this explosion within the galaxy.

A massive star maintains its near-perfect spherical shape due to a delicate balance between the inward pull of its own gravity, and the outward force of the nuclear fusion-powered radiation generated at its center. When this balance is lost, the star dies — gravity finally overpowers the pressure holding its core up, causing it to collapse under its own weight.

This collapse pulls all the outer layers inward. These outer layers then rebound and create a powerful shock wave that rips the star apart. Once the shock breaks through the star's surface, it releases a lot of energy, increasing the supernova's brightness dramatically. But how that shock forms and travels outward has long been one of the most debated fundamental questions.

There is a short-lived window, after the explosion has occurred but before it starts to interact with its surroundings, during which astronomers can catch a glimpse of its initial "breakout" shape. Using spectropolarimetry — a technique that sorts light by its wavelengths and reveals the direction in which the light waves vibrate — scientists with the VLT captured this shape for the first time.

Data from the VLT's FORS2 instrument, the only facility in the Southern Hemisphere that is capable of making such a measurement, showed that the first light from the exploding star wasn't emitted in all directions equally. Instead, the initial shock was stretched along one axis, like an olive — meaning the explosion wasn't perfectly spherical.

As the blast expanded, its light began to reveal the supernova's interaction with the gas surrounding the star. Around day 10, the hydrogen-rich outer layers of the star became visible, and these layers were found to be aligned with the same axis as the first-day shock. This means the core explosion had a stable, directional shape from the very beginning, suggesting an underlying mechanism that drives a consistent orientation.

Study of the unprecedented view has ruled out some of the current supernova models while supporting others, and provides new details about the catastrophic deaths of massive stars.

The study was published Nov. 12 in the journal Science Advances.
