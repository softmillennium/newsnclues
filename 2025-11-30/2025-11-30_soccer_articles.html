                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Müller knows exactly what it is like to face Lionel Messi with a trophy at stake — and he knows what it takes to win in those moments, too. The 2025 MLS Cup final — Messi and Inter Miami vs. Müller and the Vancouver Whitecaps — is going to draw a few comparisons from a personnel standpoint to the 2014 World Cup final and 2010 World Cup quarterfinal matches between Argentina and Germany. Messi played in those matches for Argentina, as did Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano. They'll all meet again on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, with Müller surely knowing that facing Messi doesn't automatically mean a loss. "It's not about Messi against Thomas Müller," he told reporters after Vancouver's 3-1 win over San Diego in the Western Conference final on Saturday night. Then he added, "Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group." What Messi thinks of the matchup — he has gone head-to-head with Müller 10 times in various competitions, and his side has won only three of those — is a bit of mystery and likely may stay that way. Inter Miami rarely makes Messi available for interviews. A win on Saturday would fulfill his quest and would cap a season when Messi also won MLS' Golden Boot as the top scorer — plus, more than likely, a second consecutive league MVP award. "Even though he's the best in history ... it's unfair to believe that he's going to win every game," Mascherano said after Inter Miami's 5-1 romp past New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final on Saturday night. The MLS final comes as part of a huge week for soccer in North America. The FIFA World Cup draw for next year's men's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is on Friday in Washington along with the initial awarding of that organization's peace prize. MLS, if past form holds, seems likely to announce its MVP award winner this week. It's not like either Messi or Müller needs a win on Saturday to get some sort of validation. "I enjoy watching him," Müller said in an on-field interview for Apple TV following Vancouver's win Saturday night. "I have the feeling Miami's a very strong team. We saw them beating New York in quite a really strong manner. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mohamed Salah was left on the bench as much-maligned summer signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz helped Liverpool to a vital three points in Sunday's 2-0 win over West Ham. Reflective of their respective sluggish starts to the Premier League campaign, West Ham and Liverpool failed to set the London Stadium alight from the off. Alphonse Areola did well to produce a fine stop from an Isak spectacular and cut out a dangerous Joe Gomez cross, but was otherwise untroubled by a blunt Reds attack in the opening exchanges. The Reds continued to keep hold of the ball and stifle any West Ham attacks, and despite only holding onto a one-goal advantage, the Reds never looked like forfeiting maximum points, and did not even have to bring on Salah to strengthen their grip on the game. GOAL rates Liverpool's players from the London Stadium... The Brazilian had little to do, but will be pleased with his clean sheet. A much-needed uneventful day for the Frenchman who bounced back from recent struggles to hold firm. We have become accustomed to Szoboszlai's relentless running and he was everywhere in east London. A great help for Gomez down the right-flank too. Arguably the German's best performance in a Liverpool shirt so far, he played a crucial role in the Reds opener. Worked tirelessly for Slot's side and provided the all-important assist for Isak, before sealing the win late on. After some wayward finishing in the first-half, the Swede finally ended his 381-minute goal drought with a fine finish. Replaced Isak, but did not offer too much of a threat. Had demanded his team-mates raise their levels earlier in the week and they responded. A late substitute to see out the win. His decision to leave Salah on the bench proved successful and the Dutchman will be delighted with three points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran has announced they will boycott the event in Washington next month due to the U.S. denying visas to several members of its delegation, but will not withdraw from the World Cup itself, at this time. The U.S. has long-standing, strict visa restrictions on citizens from certain countries, including Iran, for claimed political and security reasons. Iran views the decision as a non-sporting, political decision and has informed FIFA, urging the governing body to intervene. The incident has raised speculation that the travel ban could potentially impact Iran's participation in the actual tournament to be held in America, Canada and Mexico, but officials have not confirmed a World Cup boycott at this stage. Following the announcement, Taj said: "We are evaluating our options, which will depend on timing and circumstances. It appears to us that the matter has become politicised. We believe that FIFA should take a stand against such behaviour." For the 2014 World Cup, they topped their final qualification group with a decisive win against South Korea. They achieved back-to-back appearances for 2018 by dominating their group undefeated, without conceding a goal in the final two rounds. Qualification for 2022 saw them again finish atop their group as the first Asian team to secure a spot with a win over Iraq. There's no suggestion Iran will boycott the tournament, but if the visa issue remains unresolved and they do pull out, FIFA will have a decision to make on who they replace them with. FIFA regulations state that if an association withdraws or is excluded from the competition, the Organising Committee "shall decide on the matter at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed necessary". If they pull out before the main tournament draw FIFA would be more likely to invite a replacement team to fill the spot in the final tournament to avoid an unbalanced group. If they withdraw after this point the spot at the tournament would most likely remain empty and opponents awarded victory by forfeit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United came from behind to secure victory over Crystal Palace as Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount emerged as match-winners for Ruben Amorim's side in a 2-1 win on Sunday. United could have taken an early lead within the first minute, as Dean Henderson made a double save at the feet of Casemiro from point-blank range following a long throw-in. The Brazilian would soon come close to scoring again, too, when he glanced a header wide from a Bruno Fernandes delivery. A defensive mix-up involving Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro saw Mateta run through on goal, only to drag the ball wide, while Senne Lammens saved from Daichi Kamada and Yoro blocked well from Yeremy Pino. With seconds of first-half stoppage time remaining, De Ligt slipped and was bailed out by a last-ditch Luke Shaw block with Eddie Nketiah bearing down on goal, and that would prove to be a turning point in the game. The Red Devils came out for the second half with purpose and captain Fernandes would be at the centre of all of it, assisting goals for both Zirkzee and Mount from free-kicks. Palace rallied late on, but United defended strongly to see out an outstanding away victory. Beaten twice by Mateta from the spot but made a couple of important first-half saves to keep United in the game. Taken off by Amorim moments after the equaliser, and looked visibly distressed with his own performance on the bench. Looked far from on his game, particularly during the first half. Mateta had the beating of him way too easily, while his errors presented chances to both the France striker and Nketiah. Made a great block from Nketiah, though he should not have had the chance. Defended strongly, and a yellow card was the only blot on his display. Did not get forward as much as he would have liked, but the Ivorian continues to be a key cog in Amorim's side and works tirelessly despite his unfamiliarity with the wing-back role. Struggled to prevent Palace dictating play in the first half but, like many team-mates, improved in the second. The Portuguese's long throw caused havoc within the first minute, and he did his primary job well of keeping Munoz quiet in a solid display. Was not the match-winner on this occasion but always looks a threat. Could have scored on a couple of occasions, only to be foiled by Henderson in goal. Stepped up when it mattered in the game's defining moment. Came on in the final 10 minutes to return from a long ACL injury lay-off, and helped see out the victory. His team were a different side after half-time and showed character to turn things around. His decision to start Zirkzee and Mount certainly paid off, as the pair made a rare start and were instrumental to victory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Mexican government has presented its strategy to turn this summer's World Cup soccer tournament into an engine to strengthen trade, sports, tourism, and culture in the country where most of the games will be hosted. The Mexico 2026 Social World Cup project includes cultural events like soccer matches between robots, a public transit plan, and a new app where fans can sell securely sell any tickets they can't use. During a conference last week, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the intention is “to leave a sporting legacy in our country that goes beyond the competition itself.” “[In this World Cup] the eyes of the world will be here,” Sheinbaum said, “and what they will see is a great country with an enormous cultural heritage. It will also include close to 1,500 actions within the Vive Saludable program (which promotes healthy lifestyles) and the rehabilitation of 4,200 public sports fields and spaces. The plan also aims to break three Guinness World Records: the “Largest Soccer Shirt Human Image,” the “Largest Soccer Class,” and the “Largest Soccer Mural.” A robotics world cup will also be organized in which autonomous robots, programmed and designed by national and international high school and undergraduate students, will participate. First is a tourism section, where users can find information on World Cup venues, alternative events, cultural events in different locations, as well as gastronomic and ecotourism recommendations. An interactive tourist atlas will list more than 260 fan routes, points of interest and thematic roads. There's a dedication section for 2026 World Cup tournament, including details about the stadiums and game schedules, as well as real time results and standings. Finally, a Services section will provide information on transportation, connectivity, special tours, and mobility routes. At the same press event, Iván Escalante, head of Mexico's Federal Consumer Protection Agency, or Profeco, announced that an agreement has been reached with FIFA to enable a ticket sales platform that will operate in Spanish and will display prices in Mexican pesos, in accordance with national legislation. This tool will allow those who cannot use their tickets for a World Cup match to sell them safely and at appropriate prices. “This platform will allow fans who are no longer going to use their tickets to make them available to someone else at fair prices,” said Escalante, who did not provide details on the progress of the project or its date of operation. One example of that last point is the platform “Who's Who in the World Cup,” where fans can consult and compare prices of products and services in order to facilitate informed purchases. 48 national teams will participate—16 more than in any edition since 1998—and 104 matches will be played, which implies an extension of around 10 match days and 40 additional matches compared to previous tournaments. (The United States presented its own initiative that will give toruist visa processing priority to fans with tickets.) However, some studies warn that the championship could generate a significant environmental impact, in addition to increasing pressure on essential services such as water and electricity. These aspects were not directly addressed in the strategy laid out by Sheinbaum's government, at least for now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran say they plan to boycott Friday's 2026 World Cup draw in the United States because of the limited number of visas for their delegation. Taj said he had spoken to Fifa president Gianni Infantino about the issue. The draw is scheduled to take place in Washington DC on Friday, 5 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). US will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders Iran have qualified for their seventh World Cup finals and fourth in succession. The US, which is co-hosting the 2026 tournament along with Canada and Mexico,  has long-standing strict visa restrictions on Iranians for political and security reasons. In June, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from 12 countries from entering America, citing an effort to manage security threats. "It appears to us that the matter has become politicised," said Taj. "We believe that Fifa should take a stand against such behaviour."

Iran federation spokesman Amir Mehdi Alavi told the English-language Tehran Times: Four officials obtained visas: head coach Amir Ghalenoei, executive director Mehdi Kharati, international relations director Omid Jamali and Alavi. Federation president Mehdi Taj and two others had their applications denied. The Trump Administration has tightened entry controls considerably via an Executive Order in June, with Iran on a list of 19 countries with restricted entry; exceptions were noted in the Order for: “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.” Nevertheless, the Final Draw will go on next Friday and who plays where will be determined; it will be fascinating to see if Iran and/or Haiti end up placed in groups which play most or all of their matches in Canada or Mexico. It is a complete side show to the FIFA World Cup itself, which will expand to 48 teams and 104 matches in 2026 from 32 teams and 64 matches in 2022. FIFA President Gianni Infantino (SUI) has said that six billion people around the world; global population estimates are at about 8.2 billion. For the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, he said five billion people would watch some part of the tournament, with the FIFA follow-up audience review listing 4.792 billion “intended to reflect the total number of people who engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 in any manner, extending beyond TV reach and audience measurement.” And this is an important proof-of-concept for FIFA, which is organizing the tournament itself – no in-country organizing committees any more – out of its offices in Coral Gables, Florida. This is obvious, but in a charged environment like the World Cup and especially in the U.S., this is not to be taken for granted. But for the 2024 Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium outside of Miami, Florida, an after-action report stated that “20,000 to 30,000 patrons had a plan to arrive early, park off site, then crash the entry gates with overwhelming numbers was not gathered and shared by any intelligence source. But the stadium, police and security staff were not ready and the kickoff between Colombia and Argentina was delayed for 82 minutes while the situation was brought under some level of control. No doubt Hard Rock Stadium will be heavily secured; but there are a record 16 stadia involved in this World Cup. The enormous attention paid to the tournament make it an attractive target for political protests of all kinds (no, Israel did not qualify). While trouble in a stadium directly affects the people attending, trouble with broadcasts will impact millions of viewers worldwide. Here, FIFA has help from its production team but also its broadcast partners, especially those who work in the 2026 stadiums on a continuous basis. Taking care of those three things will almost guarantee a successful tournament for FIFA and although obvious, are not assured. A wild card for the entire tournament, which will run for more than a month – 11 June to 19 July – would be civil unrest, possibly tied to 2026 state or local primary elections which will take place during the World Cup period (New York is the only state with a World Cup venue – in New Jersey – an election primary during the World Cup itself. Fan festivals, which FIFA is very proud of, are less secure than the stadia and could be a target, mostly under the control of the local host committees rather than FIFA itself. And, will there be other conflicts, international, political or cultural, which pop up during the tournament? There's no “Olympic Truce” for FIFA and the Trump Administration is not going to be taking five weeks off. ★ Sign up a friend to receive the TSX Recap by clicking here. ★ Please consider a donation here to keep this site going.
