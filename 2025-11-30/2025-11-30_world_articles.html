                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president favours Nasry ‘Tito' Asfura of rightwing National party, as polls show three candidates are neck-and-neck Hondurans have begun voting in an election held amid threats by Donald Trump to cut aid to the country if his preferred candidate loses. Polls show three candidates neck-and-neck in the race to succeed President Xiomara Castro, whose husband, Manuel Zelaya, also led the country before being toppled in a 2009 coup. Trump's favourite is 67-year-old Nasry “Tito” Asfura of the rightwing National party. Polls opened at 7.00 am (1300 GMT) for 10 hours of voting, with the first results expected on Sunday. Trump has conditioned continued US support for one of Latin America's poorest countries on Asfura winning. “If he [Asfura] doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad,” he wrote on Friday on his Truth Social platform, echoing threats he made in support of the Argentine president Javier Milei's party in that country's recent midterms. Hernandez was convicted of turning Honduras into a “narco-state” while president between 2014 and 2022. Some Hondurans have welcomed Trump's interventionism, saying they hope it might mean Honduran migrants will be allowed to remain in the US. Nearly 30,000 Honduran people have been deported from the US since Trump returned to office in January. Moncada has held ministerial portfolios under both Zelaya and Castro. Asfura was a building entrepreneur before being elected mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, where he served two terms. Pre-emptive accusations of election fraud, made both by the ruling party and opposition, have sown mistrust in the vote and sparked fears of post-election unrest. “I have no ties [with Hernandez] … the party is not responsible for his personal actions,” he told AFP on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President William Lai's (賴清德) historic announcement on Wednesday, Nov. 26, of a supplemental defense budget valued in excess of US$40 billion is a testament to the seriousness with which Taiwan is responding to the relentless expansionist ambitions of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), the Chinese Communist Party and its People's Liberation Army (PLA). Lai is responding to the threat posed to Taiwan sovereignty along with US President Donald Trump's insistence that American partners in good standing must take on more responsibility for their own defense. The supplemental defense budget will be broken into three main parts. The first and largest piece will be several Foreign Military Sales or FMS programs that are government-to-government transactions. Second, the budget will contain several Direct Commercial Sales or DCS programs. Where FMS is not a priority, DCS is utilized to expedite the delivery of equipment while placing increased pressure on price; it's cheaper and faster. This is the direction more defense transactions can go as Taiwan builds out its domestic defense industrial base and becomes further embedded in American and European supply chains. The third set of programs are intended for Taiwan's domestic defense industrial base. Taiwan's contract manufacturers are the best in the world and employing their manufacturing expertise to produce large quantities of needed items, particularly UAS, is crucial for Taiwan's defense. As Cathy Fang at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET) recently noted when discussing the utility of UAS, “quantity has its own quality”. It is imperative that Taiwan significantly expand its procurement of UAS capabilities; however, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates, the pace of innovation means you cannot over-procure, because the battlefield is changing so rapidly. Most UAS capabilities must be bought in tranches every two or three years, so the military and other agencies can constantly assess their needs and adjust procurement over time. Lai, in his recent column in The Washington Post, stated, “This landmark package will not only fund significant new arms acquisitions from the US, but also vastly enhance Taiwan's asymmetric capabilities.” Since 2020, the US has narrowed its security assistance to Taiwan to include only so-called asymmetric capabilities. Please note, the term asymmetric is highly subjective, resulting in different interpretations. With Taiwan it mostly means procuring large quantities of munitions and mobile equipment to complicate the planning and execution of a D-Day-style attack on Taiwan's main island. While this has the benefit of pushing off any PLA timeline regarding this scenario, it leaves Taiwan under-supported in dealing with quarantine, gray zone and blockade domains. It is no surprise that we now see China expanding its pressure on everyday challenges such as gray zone incursions. Additionally, it is essential that Taiwan's political parties find a path forward to assess and pass the government's regular annual budget. A special supplemental budget is a useful mechanism to surge spending; however, it is the regular year-on-year defense budget that provides sustained resources for all the military's needs. Both must pass in the coming several months for Taiwan's security to be enhanced. The Chinese have chosen to pick an early fight with Japan's new prime minister Sanae Takaichi when she noted in parliamentary question time, “If there are battleships and the use of force [in the Taiwan Strait], no matter how you think about it, there is a possibility that it becomes a survival-threatening situation [for Japan].” China has rapidly escalated its rhetoric against Japan, threatened its leader with assassination, pursued some modest and frankly inconsequential economic actions while flooding the international media with claims of Japanese neo-militarism. The latter assertion is simply preposterous given China's recent militaristic behavior. Like the United States, the Japanese have long pursued a policy of ambiguity over what military involvement in a Chinese attack on Taiwan would entail . We have seen multilateral and bilateral declarations include the demand for “peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.” China naturally objects given its contention that this is a domestic matter, but it is the only belligerent threatening peace. Yes, three instances were walked back by his staff, but the boundaries around acceptable clarity of global interest in Taiwan's future is expanding and clarifying. Takaichi's statements along with her government's consideration of deployment of Type 03 Chu-SAM missiles on Yonaguni Island, in response to constant PLA harassment of Japanese sovereignty, is the correct way to push back on Chinese threats and elevated tensions. Conversely, in the United Kingdom constant violations of British sovereignty by Chinese intelligence services are met with appeasement as the government moves toward approving China's mega-embassy designed for a single purpose: to undermine UK sovereignty. An utterly discredited approach where Mr. Starmer's government self-censors sovereignty for marginal economic gain. The US spent two decades plus pursuing this approach, and it was a disaster; only China wins. Trump's insistence that partners and allies do more for their own defense is well-established. Lai's recent commitments place Taiwan's defense ambitions concurrently in line with the United States, Japan, Australia and other partner nations who are expanding their military capabilities to deter China's destabilizing military modernization — the largest expansion of hostile combat power, by any country, since the end of World War II. Trump, Lai and Takaichi should receive global support for their leadership. The city does not define itself as a “Japanese” place, but it does not anchor its identity in anything that would oppose Japan, such as revanchism — a barbaric ideology that has only ever generated suffering — or national pride. The residents of Kaohsiung are too pragmatic for that. Urban prosperity does not always begin with industrial parks or investment briefings — sometimes, it begins overnight, when the heartbeats of 170,000 people land in a stadium, shaking the ground like an invisible wave of urban renewal. Instead, it felt like a massive body that had just woken up — the MRT's blood flow sped up, the night markets' sense of smell remained active until 4am and the shopping districts swelled as if injected with oxygen. Asked how the US could help Taiwan deter or defeat a Chinese attack, Dahmer said: “The US strategy of denial complements Taiwan's plans for layered defense by providing combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines, to provide a strong local defense that is difficult and painful to dislodge while bolstering allied confidence in our resolve.” For the US to provide “combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines,” it would be necessary for Washington to implement an assertive forward I recently watched a panel discussion on Taiwan Talks in which the host rightly asked a critical question: Why is the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) spearheading a robust global movement to reject China's ongoing distortion of UN Resolution 2758? While the discussion offered some context, a more penetrating analysis and urgent development was missed. The IPAC action is not merely a political gesture; it is an essential legal and diplomatic countermeasure to China's escalating and fundamentally baseless campaign to manufacture a claim over Taiwan through the deliberate misinterpretation of a 1971 UN resolution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated. Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the Washington-backed peace plan aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, at Witkoff's private gold club in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami. After nearly two hours of talks, Witkoff emerged from the meeting room telling reporters that he evaluated the talks as "positive," without elaborating further. "We are working to secure real peace for Ukraine and reliable, long-term security guarantees. " Talking to reporters ahead of the meeting, Rubio said the end goal is to secure a peace deal "that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity." The talks come as Ukraine is grappling with one of the most explosive political crises in recent years, with President Volodymyr Zelensky's top advisor, Andriy Yermak, resigning amid a major corruption investigation. Yermak, Zelensky's long-term ally and regarded as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine's history, was expected to lead the negotiations before announcing his resignation on Nov. 28. Ukrainian negotiators also include Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia, Ambassador Olha Stefanishyna, Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov, and Deputy Head of Military Intelligence Vadym Skibitskyi. Ukraine and the U.S. have not fully disclosed the revised peace agreement reached in Geneva, which is said to have eased some of the harshest conditions imposed on Kyiv, with some issues still to be ironed out in subsequent talks. An unnamed U.S. official told Axios that the White House aims to resolve two key outstanding issues with Ukraine: territory and security guarantees. Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House. The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have been promoting a "peace through business" approach to diplomacy for months, hoping to entice Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for helping Russia's economy emerge from isolation. The Ukrainian president also held a phone calls with world leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb — who maintains a friendly relationship with Trump. "We discussed the situation in diplomacy and share a common view on the key issues," Zelensky wrote on social media following his talks with von der Leyen. Just hours before the talks began, Zelensky announced Ukraine is synchronizing its sanctions regime with Washington's sanctions targeting Russia's Lukoil and Rosneft energy giants. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers leaked calls showing U.S.-Russia coordination on a controversial peace plan and reports on backlash to Reese Witherspoon's Moscow-set novel. Nawrocki and Orban were set to meet a day after the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Hungary. HUR and Ukrainian partisans orchestrated two explosions at a site where Chechen fighters fighting for Russia sold stolen diesel, the military intelligence agency claimed. Markarova's advisory role will cover topics such as the "business climate, enhancing our state's financial resilience, attracting investment, and planning reconstruction together with our strategic partners," Zelensky said. While Ukraine will share its experience and innovations, Norway will provide a "strong production base, as well as research and development cooperation with leading Norwegian institutions," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles from occupied Crimea. The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions. A Russian drone attack killed a man and injured 19 people in the town of Vyshhorod in Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 30, local authorities reported. Ukrainian officials will meet with Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Florida on Nov. 30. Zelensky said a final agreement could be ready "in the coming days." Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, resigned from parliament after being accused of helping lure 17 South African men to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine, her party announced on Nov. 29.

And we'll enjoy that,” said striker Brian White. “But the ultimate goal is to win an MLS Cup. And we know how hard that will be in Miami.” The ‘Caps finished the regular season second in the West with an 18-7-9 record and eliminated FC Dallas and Los Angeles FC before taking on San Diego in Saturday's conference final. Ahmed set up another striker in the second minute of first-half injury time, slicing a ball across the six-yard box to White, who chested it in for his second goal of the night. Vancouver took a 3-0 cushion into the locker room. San Diego made a trio of changes out of the half in a bid to spark its offence, including bringing Mexican forward Hirving Lozano on for Corey Baird. San Diego's bid for a comeback took a hit in the 79th minute when Sisniega was sent off after coming up out of the penalty area to challenge attacking midfielder Ryan Gauld. Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Ryan Gauld (25) and defender Édier Ocampo (18) hold up the trophy after winning the MLS Western Conference final soccer match against San Diego FC.Denis Poroy/The Associated Press “I think it was a great game from the players.” The victory marks Vancouver's first MLS conference title. “We know that there's one more step to go. And that's a really good feeling, to be with them.” Vancouver has already faced Miami twice this year, taking a pair of wins to advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final, where the 'Caps ultimately fell to LIGA MX side Cruz Azul. Next week's battle at Chase Stadium will feature a matchup of global superstars. Miami has Messi, while Vancouver's Muller is a German soccer legend. “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me because we are such a good group.” And I try to keep on dancing,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINSK, November 30. Minsk seeks to ensure security in Eastern Europe and is ready to build dialogue with NATO countries, said Valery Revenko, head of the Belarusian Defense Ministry's Department for International Military Cooperation and the defense chief's defense cooperation assistant. "We have accredited a number of NATO member states in Belarus. The number currently stands at ten. We are ready to explain Belarus' positions to them and we are also ready to listen to their positions to reach a consensus in order to ensure security in our region," he told VoyenTV. According to Revenko, there are many issues between Belarus and the West, including NATO members. "The West sought to make Belarus follow its interests and narratives; it wanted to isolate Belarus and inflict certain economic, political and moral damage on the country," the official noted. "We clearly don't agree with that. We pursue our own policy, aimed at ensuring good-neighborliness and security in the Eastern European region, which runs counter to the West's views. This entire situation has affected our relations with Western countries, including European Union and NATO nations," Revenko stressed, adding that Minsk still maintained contact with Western countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner meet Kyiv delegation, after another weekend of deadly Russian attacks in Ukraine Ukrainian negotiators are meeting with US officials in Florida to thrash out details of Washington's proposed framework to end Russia's war in Ukraine, as Kyiv faces pressure on military and political fronts. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, are sitting down with a Ukrainian delegation on Sunday before planned US talks this week in Moscow with Vladimir Putin. Diplomats focused on revisions to a proposed 28-point plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticised as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine. But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity,” Rubio said in brief remarks. “This is not just about peace deals,” he added as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach. Umerov responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for US efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has previously claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for US assistance during the war. At least six people were killed and dozens wounded across Ukraine over the weekend. A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by naval drones on two oil tankers off Turkey's Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. The talks will focus on details of a draft framework to end the war, more than three years after Russian forces launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy, and Witkoff. It called on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato. Washington's original proposal – drafted without input from Ukraine's European allies – would have involved Kyiv's withdrawal from its eastern Donetsk region and the US's de facto recognition of Donetsk, Crimea and Luhansk as Russian. During negotiations last weekend in Switzerland – led by Rubio and Ukrainian negotiators – the plan was revised substantially. They say there can be no recognition of land seized by Russia militarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on. Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, was forced to resign on Friday after his flat was searched by anti-corruption officials investigating a kickback scheme. Russia is making incremental gains on the frontline and Ukrainian cities suffer hours of blackouts every day due to a rolling bombardment of its power grid. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is to meet Zelenskyy in Paris on Monday. “Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of reconstituting the Soviet empire by first subjugating Ukraine,” the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, told La Tribune Dimanche. Barrot said: “Vladimir Putin must accept the ceasefire or accept exposing Russia to new sanctions that will exhaust its economy, as well as intensified European support for Ukraine.” Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heavy rainfall has unleashed widespread flooding and landslides across Asia, killing more than 700 people with hundreds still missing. Sri Lanka was struck by a separate storm from which heavy rains are now approaching India's southern coast. Indonesian rescue teams are struggling to reach the hardest-hit areas of Sumatra, where Cyclone Senyar caused catastrophic landslides and flooding. Video footage shows helicopters delivering supplies to the island, renowned for lush rainforests, active volcanoes and a critically endangered orangutan population. “During the flood, everything was gone,” a resident of Bireuen, in Sumatra's northernmost province Aceh, told Reuters. Rescuers have been trying to reach residents stranded by the floodwaters since Tuesday when monsoon rains caused rivers to overflow in North Sumatra province. Local media footage shows people using rubber boats to evacuate those trapped. “The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,” police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said, according to AP. Across the strait, at least 162 people have died due to the extreme weather in southern Thailand, government spokesperson Siripong Angkasakulkiat told Reuters on Saturday. Some 3.5 million people have been affected, with authorities airlifting patients and flying critical supplies, including oxygen tanks, to submerged communities, the outlet said. Amphorn Kaeophengkro and her family of eight had no time to escape when floodwaters swept into their home in Hat Yai city last Saturday. Instead, they rushed to the second floor as water levels swelled, eventually spending 48 hours perched atop a table, washing machine and on a window frame. “We weren't thinking about anything else except surviving,” the 44-year-old told Reuters by candlelight, as her family began to clean their dwelling after the water had receded. Global demand for rare earths is wreaking havoc on one of Asia's mightiest river systems Hat Yai city was Thailand's hardest-hit region, recording the type of heavy rain the occurs once-in-300-years, bringing floodwaters more than eight feet high on Tuesday and cutting off access to a maternity ward holding 30 newborn babies, staff and officials said. It is not yet clear when power will be restored to the area where agencies have provided evacuations, medical support and essential supplies. The city is part of Thailand's Songkhla region, where the government declared an emergency on Tuesday due to severe flooding, an official said on X. Ten tourists, from Australia, Britain, China, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa, were rescued in Songkhla province on Friday, the Ministry of Tourism told CNN. Water levels have almost completely receded, with only some areas remaining flooded,” a spokesperson said. More than half a million people felt the wrath of Cyclone Ditwah, which triggered mud slides and flooding on Friday, Reuters said. Mallika Kumari was among more than 78,000 people moved to relief centers, mostly set up in schools, after her home was quickly submerged, according to the news agency. We just rushed out of the house without anything,” Kumari told reporters. I've brought a few garbage bags to collect their clothes.” In the rush, Kumari left behind her cat, which was later picked up by a navy boat and brought to dry land. More than 1.4 million evacuated as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines Some 191 people remain missing in Sri Lanka and most homes in low-lying areas near the capital, Colombo, are under water and without power, authorities told Reuters. At the Dalugala Thakiya Mosque, volunteers prepared rice parcels with chicken and dhal curry for flood victims. “We are getting more requests for food because people who work daily jobs cannot find work and are running low on savings,” meal organizer Risham Ahmed told Reuters. “They are worried about how to piece their lives back together.” Around 34,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, but Gon Qasim and her husband were less fortunate, stranded in a field in northern Perlis state last weekend when rising floodwaters cut off their escape. The elderly couple were eventually rescued by one of their children and brought to an evacuation center in the state capital of Kangar, where hundreds of families sheltered in tents provided by the national disaster management agency, Reuters reported. When I was out, there was nowhere to stay but the field,” the 73-year-old Gon said told its reporters, recalling her ordeal in an interview on Wednesday. Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change, scientists have warned. Also in the region this month, the Philippines endured two deadly typhoons – Kalmaegi and Fung-wong – in a week, which killed hundreds of people and forced more than 1.4 million to evacuate. This summer, the region also saw temperatures reach unprecedented levels, with little respite from merciless heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite earlier speculation that military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov might join the delegation, Ukrainska Pravda's sources reported that Budanov remained in Kyiv, with HUR to be represented at the talks by his deputy, Vadym Skibitskyi. The talks will build off the recent negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European representatives worked to revise the original 28-point proposal — a plan that initially demanded sweeping concessions from Kyiv in line with Moscow's maximalist demands. The revised version reportedly aligns more closely with Ukraine's position, but a new framework has not been finalized. Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House. The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have for months been promoting a "peace through business" approach to diplomacy, hoping to tempt Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for bringing Russia's economy out of isolation. Ukraine's peace negotiations have also been disrupted by political turmoil at home: Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's top aide and lead negotiator, resigned on Nov. 28 amid a major corruption investigation. Russia, meanwhile, has shown little interest in declaring a ceasefire or negotiating peace under the revised Geneva terms. Putin on Nov. 27 demanded that Ukrainian troops withdraw from their current positions as a condition for a ceasefire and said that negotiating with the Ukrainian leadership was "pointless."

Nawrocki and Orban were set to meet a day after the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Hungary. HUR and Ukrainian partisans orchestrated two explosions at a site where Chechen fighters fighting for Russia sold stolen diesel, the military intelligence agency claimed. Markarova's advisory role will cover topics such as the "business climate, enhancing our state's financial resilience, attracting investment, and planning reconstruction together with our strategic partners," Zelensky said. While Ukraine will share its experience and innovations, Norway will provide a "strong production base, as well as research and development cooperation with leading Norwegian institutions," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles from occupied Crimea. The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions. A Russian drone attack killed a man and injured 19 people in the town of Vyshhorod in Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 30, local authorities reported. Ukrainian officials will meet with Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Florida on Nov. 30. Zelensky said a final agreement could be ready "in the coming days." Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, resigned from parliament after being accused of helping lure 17 South African men to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine, her party announced on Nov. 29.

ROSTOV-ON-DON, November 30. /TASS/. As many as 128 apartment buildings have been left without heating in Russia's southern Rostov Region after a Ukrainian drone attack on a boiler house, regional Governor Yury Slyusar said.

"A boiler house that provides heating to 128 apartment buildings, two hospitals, four schools and six kindergartens was damaged in the town of Gukovo. Its personnel were evacuated; heating was suspended," he wrote on Telegram.

Repairs will begin after bomb disposal engineers examine the facility.

Novoshakhtinsk, as well as the Chertkovsky and Myasnikovsky districts, also came under attack, the governor added. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 16 drones were intercepted and destroyed over the Rostov Region last night. There were no immediate reports of casualties.</p>

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said a total of 14 people were shot, four of whom were confirmed dead, just before 6pm local time in Stockton, which sits approximately 80 miles east of San Francisco. The shooting took place at a banquet hall where a family had gathered to celebrate, local media reported. The suspected shooter is still at large, police told local media. This is when families come together to celebrate, share memories, give each other love. Unfortunately tonight, heaven is a little bigger with the children and adults who did not make it,” Ms Fugazi said during a press conference on Saturday night. Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.” Ms Fugazi said she had spoken on the phone with Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, and that he had offered additional support to city officials and law enforcement. “Violence touched my life as a young person, and seeing our own children, parents and neighbours go through this shakes me deeply. This is our community,” Mr Lee said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article contains images and descriptions that some readers may find distsurbing. Simply known as numbers 177 and 178, their identities remain a mystery. They are among 240 human skeletal remains, including children and babies, uncovered at this mass gravesite in Chemmani in Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna district. Numbered white cards placed alongside the bones mark how many skeletons have been found since digging began in May of this year, reviving decades-old allegations of wartime atrocities and cover-ups. But it is difficult to bury the past entirely. “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.” Atrocities were committed by both sides, according to the United Nations, which estimates up to 100,000 people were killed in the conflict, with thousands of others forcibly disappeared. Sixteen years after the war ended, families of the victims and missing are still fighting for justice and accountability. “One day the truth will come,” said V S Niranjan, a lawyer representing relatives of people who went missing in Jaffna. Just a stone's throw from a main road, the Chemmani gravesite is one of more than 20 mass graves identified in Sri Lanka. Chemmani first gained international attention in 1998 when Sri Lankan soldier former Lance Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse, who was on trial for the rape and murder of schoolgirl Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, confessed that hundreds of Tamils had been buried there after the Sri Lankan army retook Jaffna. “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings.” For decades, the mass grave remained hidden until construction workers clearing land in the grounds of a Hindu cemetery in February unearthed human skeletal remains. Their discovery prompted a court-ordered forensic excavation of the site in May and June, which initially uncovered 19 skeletons. Since then, the bones of hundreds more people have been found. The bodies were buried in a disordered way, heaped together in shallow graves of 1.5-2 feet, according to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, an independent national body that investigates violations of fundamental rights. Tamils, who have lived in the north and east of Sri Lanka for thousands of years, are primarily followers of Hinduism, with a significant Christian minority population, but the commission determined that the fact the bodies were buried naked rules out customary Hindu burials. “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings,” it said. Equipped with fine tools, shovels and hammers, they meticulously separated earth and rock from bone, often using their gloved hands to sweep away the dirt. A tiny spine and rib cage can be made out – the remains of what investigators believe was a baby. Investigators in September appealed to the Jaffna court for a greater area to be mapped and excavated as ground radar suggests additional human remains could be buried there. But by the end of November, work had not restarted. Amnesty International estimated as many as 100,000 people were “forcibly disappeared” – the secret arrest, imprisonment or abduction of a person with the blessing of state organizations, or rebel groups – in Sri Lanka during the war, and the United Nations Human Rights Office has laid most of the blame on Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups. Speaking at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances in Geneva on September 29, Nanayakkara said the Sri Lankan government “believed in securing justice for the victims and finding truth and closure, in line with its commitment with human rights and fundamental freedoms.” Mothers and widows are leading the charge in Sri Lanka demanding answers. Previous investigations into other gravesites were not successful in identifying victims, did not lead to prosecutions, or were halted due to lack of funds or political will. Clutching photos of their missing relatives, hundreds of residents marched in the stifling heat from Jaffna to the Chemmani gravesite on August 30, calling for independent international oversight of the investigation because they don't trust the local justice system to give them answers. Elangkothai, who helped to organize the protest, held a photo of her daughter, son-in-law and her three young grandchildren, who she hasn't seen in more than 16 years. Back at her house in Jaffna, she recounted their last months together. Like many others living in the north and east of Sri Lanka during the war, intense fighting had forced Elangkothai's family to flee their home. They ended up in Vavuniya, a strategically important district for the Sri Lankan army as a gateway to the largely Tamil-controlled northeast. In late 2008, Elangkothai's daughter gave birth to her third child – another grandchild for Elangkothai and her husband to dote on. Elangkothai later learned through family friends that her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren were herded onto a military bus, along with other residents, and taken away by Sri Lankan army soldiers. Her youngest grandchild was just 7 months old at the time. Despite filing multiple affidavits and appeals to the government, Elangkothai still does not know what happened to her family. Was it being born a Tamil?” she said. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk laid flowers at a vigil demanding justice near the Chemmani mass grave in June. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office last year, has promised to restore trust, investigate crimes and bring justice to victims' families. The government said it would establish a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate wartime abuses in Sri Lanka, and an independent public prosecutor's office. Those calls for an international investigation appeared to have been shut down in September when Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that accountability would be handled “through credible domestic processes” as “external action will only serve to create divisions.” Over the years, successive Sri Lankan governments have established various state-run commissions of inquiry and investigative bodies, but they have had little success in bringing perpetrators to account. Families of victims, human rights defenders and international bodies such as the UN have criticized the commissions for a lack of transparency, for being ineffective and ultimately unfit for delivering accountability. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was established in 2017 with an explicit mandate to establish the fate of missing persons. It has records of more than 23,000 cases, but has traced just 23 people, a Sri Lankan delegation told the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances on September 29. CNN has reached out to the OMP for comment. The Sri Lankan delegation told the UN committee that “Sri Lanka had a long-standing practice of investigating complaints of disappearances” and “all investigations of mass graves were carried out with judicial oversight in accordance with legal standards.” The government was “working on addressing” challenges within the OMP, had allocated additional funding to the body and hoped to “achieve positive results through its investigations and gain public trust,” it added. She and her husband saved hard to build their dream home but it sat between an army camp and the Jaffna hospital, and as the war intensified around them, they were forced to abandon it, she told CNN. Her husband did some work for the army as a translator – Nirmalanathan thought it would offer them some protection. But one day in 1990, he didn't return from the army base. As a lone woman with two young children in tow, she said she feared for her life and that of her sons. Soldiers would say her husband was working and fine. Her two boys grew up without a father and carried the trauma of war. She applied for passports for her sons to move away from Sri Lanka – to join the huge exodus of Tamils who fled to Europe, India, Canada and elsewhere during the war. “Many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope.” The morning that her eldest son's passport arrived, he was taken on a motorbike by soldiers. She has had no word from him since. Nirmalanathan said she faces harassment from the authorities for her protests. She believes it's an intimidation tactic to stop her galvanizing other family members. United Nations observers noted in a report released in August “continued patterns of surveillance, intimidation and harassment of families of the disappeared, community leaders, civil society actors, especially those working on accountability for enforced disappearances and other conflict-related crimes.” Speaking in Geneva in September at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, a Sri Lankan government representative accused freelance Tamil journalist Kumanan Kanapathipillai, one of the authors of this CNN report, of “terrorist activities and financial crime.” Kanapathipillai had previously been brought in for questioning by counter-terrorism police following his reporting on the Chemmani mass graves. The Committee to Protect Journalists and several other press advocate groups called on the government to end its “harassment” of Kanapathipillai. The country's Foreign Minister Herath said the government “will not hesitate to take action on any alleged harassment or intimidation.” The discovery of the Chemmani gravesite reopened old wounds but also gave many mothers like Nirmalanathan hope that some answers may finally come. “Today there is a reason why the relatives come and sob. After all these years they strongly believe that (their loved ones) will come home… many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope,” she said. “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”</p>
