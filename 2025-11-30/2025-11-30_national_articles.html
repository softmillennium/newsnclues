                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Red Bull driver Max Verstappen of the Netherlands celebrates after winning the Qatar Formula One Grand Prix, in Lusail, Qatar, Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025. LUSAIL, Qatar (AP) — Max Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix on Sunday to send a tense Formula 1 title fight into the season's final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Championship leader Lando Norris would have clinched his first F1 title with a win but finished in fourth place, with his McLaren teammate and title rival Oscar Piastri placing second. All three title contenders have won seven races this season. Verstappen is aiming for a fifth straight F1 title, with Piastri and Norris chasing their first. “That's a very lovely race,” Verstappen said on team radio after his 70th career win. But having entered the Qatar GP weekend with a 24-point lead over both his rivals, Norris is now 12 points ahead of Verstappen and 16 clear of Piastri, who dropped to third overall. I don't know any words,” a dejected-sounding Piastri said. “It is a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.” Piastri started on pole position ahead of Norris, with Verstappen starting from third. A strategy error cost McLaren after an early safety car prompted a flurry of tire changes, but both McLarens stayed out on track when Verstappen and the others came in. “Clearly we didn't get it right tonight,” Piastri said. “I think in hindsight, it is pretty obvious what we would have done. I am sure we will discuss it as a team.” “This was an incredible race for us, we made the right call as a team to box under that safety car and yeah that was smart,” Verstappen said. The safety car came out after Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sent spinning off the track on Lap 7 after being clipped by Alpine driver Pierre Gasly. The decision to stay out on track was questioned over team radio by Norris, in a race where drivers had to take two mandatory pit stops over the 57 laps — a measure imposed on safety grounds due to a high risk of tire degradation at the Lusail International Circuit. Piastri chatted to McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown moments before getting into his car. Former England soccer star David Beckham watched the race from the McLaren motorhome, flanked by his former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville. Because drivers were restricted to a maximum of 25 laps on the Pirelli tires at this race, those who already pitted had to change again on Lap 32. McLaren pitted Piastri on Lap 43 and Norris soon after, but when Norris came back out on Lap 45 he was fifth with Antonelli and Sainz barring his way. Desert battles seem to suit Verstappen, who clinched a third straight win in Qatar and has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. Norris may take hope from the fact he won there last year. But the McLarens head to Abu Dhabi with a hard-charging Verstappen looking to repeat history by clinching a championship in the last race at Abu Dhabi, having done so when he overtook Hamilton on the final lap after a controversial finish in 2021. “It's possible now but we will see,” said Verstappen, who had written off his chances earlier this season. “I don't really worry about it too much.”</p>

A snowplow sets out in Lowville, New York, on Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025. In Wisconsin, utility crews worked to restore power to thousands of people while the airport in Des Moines, Iowa, reopened by midday on the critical travel day after a Delta Connection flight landing from Detroit slid off an icy runway. Hundreds of churches in western Michigan told worshippers to stay home or watch services online. Over 250 flights into and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had been canceled by about 1 p.m. while over 900 had been delayed, according to the tracking site FlightAware. In Wisconsin, We Energies reported more than 6,000 power outages, with more than half in Milwaukee and South Milwaukee. Mark Paladino said on Facebook that he was shoveling snow Sunday when his apartment complex lost power in Fredonia. Others said power lines were sagging under heavy, wet snow. Elsewhere in Iowa, gusty winds Sunday were blowing snow back onto roads, extending hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. “We did have areas of Iowa and Illinois that saw over one foot of snow,” including 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Fort Dodge, Iowa, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison. He said snow in the Great Lakes region was tapering off, but a new storm was heading to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with up to a foot of snow by Tuesday. “It's going to be the first snowfall of the season for many of these areas, and it's going to be rather significant,” Orrison said. “The good news is that it does not look like the major cities at this point are going to be looking at any significant snowfall.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Ukraine talks: Top Trump administration officials are meeting now with a delegation from Kyiv in Florida. Key sticking points remain despite a mounting US effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with a team from Washington expected to visit Moscow later this week. • Military buildup: President Donald Trump is also maintaining his pressure campaign against Venezuela, which the administration says is aimed at cutting off the flow of drugs from South America. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have expressed alarm about Trump's use of the military in the region as he threatens potential land strikes in Venezuela. • Immigration crackdown: Trump is doubling down on aggressive anti-immigration policies after last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC. Republican Rep. Don Bacon says modifications to the US-proposed plan for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appear to have made it more mindful of Kyiv's interests than the original draft. “I do think that agreement has shifted a little more back toward the middle,” Bacon said today on ABC's “This Week.” The comments come as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner hold talks with Ukrainian officials in the Miami area. While a delegation from Kyiv meets with Trump administration officials in Florida, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been checking in with other allies today, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “These are important days, and much can change,” Zelensky said in a social media post about his call with Rutte. The Ukrainian leader also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen today. It also matters that Ursula is paying close attention to the need to strengthen our resilience amid Russia's constant strikes on our infrastructure and the energy sector,” Zelensky said. Moscow launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight Friday into Saturday, killing at least three people and leaving large parts of Kyiv without power, according to Zelensky. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine thinks more senators will join his attempts to limit President Donald Trump's war powers in Central and South America if the president follows through on his threat of military action against Venezuela. Kaine said he would force another vote on the legislation “immediately” should there be US military action in Venezuela. He said “the circumstances have changed” in terms of gathering support for that motion, citing a report that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on one of the vessels earlier this year after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. Asked about a reported classified memo that outlines expanded authorities for operations inside Venezuela, Bondi declined to elaborate. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended President Donald Trump's threat to “permanently pause” migration from some countries to the US, saying the administration's approach is rooted in concerns about national security and vetting failures. “These Third World countries don't have stable governments,” Noem said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “Third World countries,” a term used by some to refer to developing nations, has repeatedly been used by Trump as part of his anti-immigration rhetoric. Asked for details, US Citizenship and Immigration Services pointed CNN to 19 countries “of concern” listed in a June presidential proclamation, including Afghanistan. More from Noem: The DHS secretary argued on NBC that instability in developing nations — and what she described as the inability of those countries to aid in vetting migrants — has created unacceptable risks. Noem said the Trump administration is also reviewing asylum cases and will deport people with pending claims if it's necessary. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has kicked off another round of high-level talks with Ukrainian officials today aimed not only at ending the war, but “creating a pathway forward that leaves Ukraine sovereign, independent, and prosperous,” he told reporters. “This is about ending a war in a way that creates a mechanism and a way forward that will allow (Ukraine) to be independent and sovereign, never have another war again, and create tremendous prosperity for its people, not just rebuild the country, but enter an era of extraordinary economic progress in the country,” Rubio said, noting the country has “tremendous economic potential.” Top Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov told reporters there had been “great progress” and thanked the US negotiating team. It is the first since Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead Ukrainian negotiator, resigned. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar rebuked President Donald Trump for a Truth Social post on Thanksgiving that accused Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of entering the United States illegally and mocked her hijab. Tim Walz using a slur that demeans people with disabilities. “These words shouldn't even be repeated by anyone, much less a president of the United States,” Klobuchar told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” For his part, Walz called attacks by Trump a “badge of honor” this morning in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press,” though he said that as a former educator, he worries about the impact of the president's language on kids. “We have fought three decades to get this out of our schools. The suspect, who was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national. Noem said investigators believe he was radicalized within his local community in Bellingham, Washington, though she did not provide any details on what that may have entailed. “We do believe it was in his home community and state,” Noem said. He was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration after applying in 2024, multiple law enforcement officials have told CNN. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called President Donald Trump's warning that “seditious” activity is punishable by death — prompted by a video the senator participated in urging service members not to follow illegal orders — “obviously ridiculous.” Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds published the video reminding members of the military of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting the furious response from Trump and a military review by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth should be fired, Kelly told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” this morning. Asked by Bash if he has been contacted by the FBI, which has also launched a probe, Kelly said he's received communication that amounts more to “intimidation,” with a request to come in for an interview but no point of contact. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly says he would not have carried out a reported follow-up strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean had he been given the order. “It seems to,” Kelly, who served in the Navy for 25 years, told CNN's Dana Bash this morning when asked if that second strike constitutes a war crime. “If what has been reported is accurate, I've got serious concerns about anybody in that, you know, chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said on “State of the Union.” Pressed on if he would have carried out the order to execute a second strike, Kelly responded, “No, no,” adding, “and I'm a guy who — I have sunk two ships.” More context: Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers published a video recently reminding service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting a furious response from President Donald Trump and an FBI investigation. The second strike reporting also comes as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While President Donald Trump's team has heralded “tremendous progress” toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of the negotiations told CNN last week that substantial gaps remain even between the delegations from Washington and Kyiv. Putin has shown little signal he's ready to offer concessions on those fronts, saying the war will only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.” That leaves glaring sticking points when a US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Putin later this week, regardless of what happens during today's meetings between the US and Ukraine in Florida. President Donald Trump will return to the White House later today after spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. His arrival at the White House, along with first lady Melania Trump, is expected around 5:50 p.m. There have been no shortage of developments on the politics front, however. How we got here: Today's meetings mark the latest step in a flurry of diplomacy that kicked off this month after a plan put forward by Trump triggered alarm in Kyiv, as the original draft heavily favored Russia. Ukraine is hoping to build on developments from subsequent meetings in Geneva, where Kyiv and its European allies put forward a counter-proposal. A US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. Meanwhile: The talks come after Ukraine said its underwater drones struck two tankers belonging to Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Friday and Saturday. Russia launched its largest barrage of drones and missiles in a month across Ukraine, killing at least three people overnight Friday into Saturday, according to Zelensky. He issued a broad directive on social media yesterday, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. Officially, Trump says he is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts. And the US president designated Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization, a move administration officials argue will give the US expanded military options. Some key context on Trump's latest comment: The US can't close another country's airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration did issue a warning last week to major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for South American flights. In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week, President Donald Trump has argued he has a mandate to toughen immigration enforcement even further. Since taking office, he's overseen removal flights, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in major US cities, and an executive order suspending the refugee program, though some in the administration have been frustrated over lagging immigration arrests. Trump vowed a crackdown to expel them and “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.” • All asylum decisions halted: The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a halt on asylum application decisions, saying it's to ensure that migrants are vetted and screened “to the maximum degree possible.” • Green cards under review: The US immigration service also announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern,” including Afghanistan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netanyahu comments on request for pardon during his ongoing corruption trial People on the streets of Jerusalem reacted on Sunday to news that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked the president for a pardon during his ongoing corruption trial. TEL AVIV (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation. But it immediately triggered denunciations from opponents, who said a pardon would weaken democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he's above the rule of law. Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He hasn't been convicted of anything. His request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Trump also sent a letter to President Isaac Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.” He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead. But the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents: a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. “It's impossible,” said Emi Palmor, former director-general of the Justice Ministry. “You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,” she said. In rare cases, the system could pardon Netanyahu. Experts say the president has broad discretion to grant one, and oversight is limited. However, “as a rule, the president reviews a pardon request only after all legal proceedings have ended. In 2008, as opposition leader, Netanyahu called on then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down as he faced a growing corruption scandal. At the time, Netanyahu said that a prime minister “up to his neck” in scandal did not have a mandate to lead the country, and there was a risk that Olmert would make decisions that served his personal interests and not those of the nation. Olmert resigned even before he was indicted that year and would later serve 16 months in prison. Netanyahu has struck a different, defiant tone since his own legal problems began. He has portrayed himself as the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy trying to oust him from office. Shortly after forming his current government in late 2022, Netanyahu launched a plan to overhaul Israel's justice system. Netanyahu presented the plan as a much-needed reform. But his opponents accused him of trying to weaken the justice system, damaging the country's system of checks and balances and having a conflict of interest at a time when he was on trial. The plan triggered large street protests against the government, and critics have said the deep divisions sent a message of weakness to Israel's enemies that encouraged Hamas to launch its 2023 attacks. Netanyahu's request also sparked backlash on Sunday, with an immediate response from the opposition and advocacy groups urging the president not to give in to his request. “You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel said that granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offenses of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law. But some Israelis expressed support for Netanyahu's request. Josef Federman contributed to this report from Jerusalem.</p>

(AP) — Auburn hired South Florida's Alex Golesh as its next coach on Sunday, counting on him to revitalize an offense that has ranked in the bottom half of the Southeastern Conference each of the last six years. The 41-year-old Golesh, who was born in Russia and moved to the United State at age 7, is signing a six-year contract that averages more than $7 million annually to replace Hugh Freeze. Freeze was fired in early November after failing to fix Auburn's offensive issues in three seasons on the Plains. Freeze lost 12 of his last 15 SEC games. “He has produced wins and record-setting results throughout his entire career, including over the last three seasons at USF,” Auburn athletic director John Cohen said. “Alex is known nationally for his player development prowess, ability to shape creative and explosive offenses, and his relentless approach to building winning programs. “In our conversations, he showed the determination and edge that this program demands of its head coach.” Golesh becomes Auburn's fourth football coach in seven seasons. Together, the school will end up paying $52.5 million in buyout fees. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. The Tigers owe Freeze $15.8 million, with no mitigation, from a six-year, $39 million deal he signed to replace Harsin in 2022. The last five losses included more offensive woes. His Bulls upset Boise State and Florida — both ranked — in September and lost road games at Memphis and Navy by three points each to miss out on the American Conference championship game and a potential berth in the College Football Playoff. He previously worked as Josh Heupel's offensive coordinator at UCF (2020) and Tennessee (2021-22) before taking over at USF, and he implements an up-tempo style that can be taxing on defenses. His offenses have consistently been among the nation's most productive and highest scoring, averaging more than 35 points and 450 yards during his time with the Bulls. USF ranks in the top 25 of 20 national statistical categories, including 11 offensive, seven defensive and two special teams statistics. “Auburn Football is one of the proudest, most tradition-rich programs in all of college football and my family and I could not be more excited to join the Auburn Family,” Golesh said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Employees with Minnesota DHS thanked the New York Times for its reporting. Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression, and did his best to discredit fraud reports,” Minnesota DHS employees wrote on X on Saturday. “This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz. Agency leaders appointed by Tim Walz willfully disregarded rules and laws to keep fraud reports quiet – even to the extent of threatening families of whistleblowers,” the post added. Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression,… https://t.co/cEtbnuKmgn According to the agency, there are many who should be “held responsible for their role” in the scheme but haven't faced consequences, naming DHS temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi, former DHS Commissioner Jodi Harpstead, DHS compliance officer Jess Geil, Assistant Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services Natasha Merz, and former DHS Assistant Commissioner for Homelessness Eric Grumdahl. “Fundamentally, Tim Walz is dishonest, lacks ethics and integrity, has poor leadership abilities, and has never taken any accountability for his role in fraud,” the employees wrote. “Fact is, Minnesota never had a surplus, we had been given federal ARPA funds that were conflated as surplus money otherwise, we'd be in a deficit. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump ended the temporary protected status for Somali residents in Minnesota. While Walz was quick to respond to Trump name-calling him in a Truth Social post this week that was unrelated to the fraud, Walz has not commented publicly on the matter as it circulated in media reports for over a week. The Washington Examiner has reached out to Walz for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo XIV touched down in Lebanon's capital Beirut on Sunday with the hope of being a “messenger of peace” as he began a three-day visit to the nation at the heart of a Middle East battered by recent conflicts, just days after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut. Standing below a message that read “Blessed Are The Peacemakers” at the presidential palace in Baabda, Leo urged people to remain in Lebanon amid an “exodus of young people and families seeking a future elsewhere” due to “uncertainty, violence, poverty and many other threats.” “We must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable,” he said in his address to the country's authorities and civil society. Peace knows “no fear in the face of apparent defeat” and is not “daunted by disappointment,” Leo said. Leo's visit will offer support to Lebanon's sizeable Christian minority, which has ancient roots in the country. The pontiff is due to meet political leaders and young people, take part in an inter-religious gathering and celebrate mass on the Beirut waterfront as part of the second leg of his first foreign trip since his election in May. More spectators gathered inside palace grounds in the hopes of spotting the pope, donning plastic raincoats under a gray sky. Leo's calls for dialogue and unity come at a time of heightened tensions in the region and days after the Israeli strike last week on southern Beirut. The strike, which targeted Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai, killed five people and injured 28, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Moments before arriving in Beirut, Leo told reporters aboard the papal plane that he had come to Lebanon and Turkey – the first port of call on his international trip – as a “messenger” to “promote peace throughout the region.” “We seek with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help to draw close to a solution with justice for all,” Leo said in the first in-flight press conference of his papacy. There, he is expected to pray at the tomb of Charbel Makhlouf, a monk known for bringing people of different faiths together. Earlier this week, while condemning the use of religion for justifying “war,” Leo urged Catholics to mobilize their faith and unify others “regardless of ethnicity, nationality, religion or personal perspectives.” “We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism,” Leo reflected. Leo's trip comes at a tense time, one year after an uneasy truce was established between Israel and Hezbollah through US mediation. The last papal visit to Lebanon took place in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? One of humanity's biggest achievements may be slipping away. Thanksgiving is traditionally a good time to start counting your blessings. Between 1990 and today, the number of people living in extreme poverty — meaning on the equivalent of $3 or less per day in US purchasing power — fell from 2.3 billion to around 800 million, even as the global population nearly doubled. To put it another way, each day over the past 35 years, an average of 115,000 people escaped from extreme poverty. While Roser projects that the number of people in extreme poverty will decline by about 40 million over the next five years, he writes that “after 2030, the number of extremely poor people is expected to increase.” And it wouldn't be because the tools that worked for decades mysteriously stopped working. The last few decades of astonishing global progress were propelled above all by growth. In the 1990s and 2000s, hundreds of millions of people in China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and other rapidly developing countries rose above the extreme poverty line because their economies were growing at extraordinary speed. And because most of the planet's poorest people lived in these countries at that time, they were able to experience explosive gains in income, infrastructure, education, and health. Today, however, the majority of people living in extreme poverty are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and in fragile and conflict-affected states — places where economic growth has been weak, volatile, or nonexistent for decades. This means the remaining pockets of extreme poverty are concentrated in places where our usual engines of progress barely turn over at all. Madagascar — where my Vox colleague Benji Jones just returned from — is Roser's example of a country stuck in this trap: GDP per capita today is roughly what it was in the 1950s, even as its population has grown by 700 percent. More children are born into extreme poverty, and the total number of people living in deprivation stays flat or rises. Layer on conflict and the situation becomes even more intractable. When drought, flooding, or crop failure hits a region where people already live one bad break away from destitution, millions can fall back below the poverty line overnight. Roser acknowledges that his projections are not prophecy. Change the growth pattern — through better governance, fewer conflicts, more investment, cheap clean energy, or even dramatically expanded migration opportunities — and the projections change with them. Keeping this progress going will be harder, but we shouldn't mistake “harder” for “hopeless.” The gains of the last 35 years might feel like a miracle, but they were the result of specific choices, investments, and reforms that helped billions of people build better lives. If we can do that, the age of progress against extreme poverty doesn't have to end. If we can't, then this past Thanksgiving might be one of the last moments when we can look at the global numbers and confidently call them a blessing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Augusta Medical Group cited the health care provisions in President Donald Trump's signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for closing the rural clinics in Churchville and two other locations. “I've called around trying to find a replacement, a new doctor, and for just a well-being appointment, the soonest is the end of January,” said Teresa Leach, 56, in an interview while sipping her coffee at the MTN. Mystic shop just a few feet from the shuttered clinic. Leach, who has asthma, said she voted for Trump last year. Democrats are hoping to make health care a defining issue nationally in next year's midterms. Trump carried Augusta County, which includes Churchville, by nearly 50 points in 2024. Jena Crisler, a physician, ran to represent the area in the Virginia House of Delegates and lost this month to the Republican incumbent by more than 40 points even in a Democratic statewide sweep. A woman sitting in the same coffee shop whispered under her breath that she supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. Rural health care is always precarious, she says, and the clinic closure was especially a blow for her husband. Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, primarily by instituting work requirements and more eligibility checks. Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural Ground Game, a group focused on driving up Democratic participation in rural areas, says Democrats will continue highlighting the significance of accessible health care through town hall-style events and canvassing, trying to win back credibility and trust in rural America. “I think people have an interest in having real conversations about what's going on with their lives, and there's really nothing that can replace that person to person at your doorstep conversation,” Thorne said. Crisler knew she faced long odds when she took on incumbent Delegate Chris Runion in the state's 35th district. She suggests her race was less about the outcome and more about the need for Democrats to show up everywhere instead of simply surrendering communities where they're outnumbered. “I think they are very concerned, and they're going to be even more when it starts hitting them personally,” said Crisler of the clinic closures. CNN has reached out to US Rep. Ben Cline, a Republican who represents the area in Washington and voted for the Trump policy bill. Pediatrician Mark Downey defeated incumbent Republican Chad Green in the state's 69th district, which includes Newport News, York, James City and Gloucester counties. In an interview with CNN, he said it's important Democrats continue to run on health care even if the message does not immediately resonate with voters. People's minds don't change right away, but when they start seeing loss of access, loss of services, eventually there's going to be a situation where it's not going to be as convenient for them or more of a hardship for them,” said Downey, who had made two previous unsuccessful tries for the state legislature. Irene Holmes, 59, moved to Churchville three years ago. Beset with a host of medical challenges from liver issues to high blood pressure, she relied on and valued the town clinic. On politics, she tends to “keep her mouth shut” to avoid getting into it with her neighbors. But when asked if Trump was to blame for the clinic closure, Holmes said, “Absolutely.” “What he's done is destroying rural areas,” said Holmes. Mystic coffeehouse, shop owner Dane Buse suggests now is the time for rural communities to get creative. “To lose the clinic is the same as losing a grocery store or a local provider,” Buse said. “Maybe that would fit the bill for us,” Buse said.</p>

The reality star called the case against him a "trophy prosecution," making it clear there is no money missing. Steve McBee Sr. is preparing to begin his two-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme involving crop insurance. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, the 52-year-old reality star shared how he reacted to learning he would be going to prison, saying, "It was a sobering moment." He explained that when he first heard about the investigation, he "really wasn't overly concerned," because, as a business owner for more than 33 years, he had "gone through every audit under the sun." He thought it was just like any other audit, and after they got the necessary information, "it'll go away like the rest of them." However, after a meeting with his lawyer, he came to understand that this time was different. Steve McBee Sr. said he wasn't initially concerned with the investigation that led to his two-year prison sentence. "I went down there and the government basically just gave us kind of a BAFO – best and final offer," he said. He said this is their bullying technique, kind of the poker game here. And then, basically what they said was, OK, you as an individual can plead guilty and, just for clarification, you can plead to one count of giving a fraudulent statement to crop insurance. If you don't do that as an individual, Steve A. McBee, in turn, we're going to charge one of my teammates, one of my co-workers, with 27 federal indictments in 48 hours." He called what they did a "bullying technique," saying both he and his teammates "had nothing to do with it." McBee was sentenced to two years at the Federal Prison Camp in Yankton, South Dakota, and during a sentencing hearing on Oct. 16, was also ordered to an additional two years of supervised release once he completes his prison sentence. McBee makes it clear there is no money missing. "I wanna make absolute, with absolute clarity, that people understand, there's no money missing," he said. "When you farm like over 10,000 acres, which we farmed 44,000 acres, three states, in 2020, 923 different fields, they do a post-planting audit, a pre-harvest, and a post-harvest audit. "They found a plant date that was half wrong. We didn't go back till like June 19," he added. "And they basically said, your entire crop insurance is null and void because of a half wrong plant date. McBee went on to call the case against him a "trophy prosecution," adding that the business has been greatly impacted by the two-year prison sentence, explaining he's lost over $20 million in loans. In addition to the monetary loss, McBee said his reputation has also been "destroyed," with people now thinking he earned all his money by defrauding the government, and not through "33 years of working seven days a week." We downsized drastically, and I still have 300 employees at my other businesses. It caused problems at my other businesses, well, everywhere. Everywhere you bank with, because when they charge you with a felony, I mean, then the banks get involved, as you would know from personal guarantees." When it comes to his family, however, the reality star said they "have never been closer." He said he knows he "raised four lions, not four sheep," and isn't worried about his sons, adding they have a strong work ethic. Despite everything he is going through, McBee maintains he will "never let somebody make me a victim" and once his sentence is over, he "will come out stronger and more ready to go than ever." "Steve McBee holds the door open for every young and old person. My kids are always like, 'Dad, don't pick up hitchhikers.' "I'm not stabbing somebody at a gas pump after I've been arrested 100 times and let back out on the streets. But I'm the one going to prison. Life ain't fair sometimes, for no reason at all. I told the boys that, and I'm going to buck up, but I want my story heard because other farmers need to know they can get you any time they want." McBee says his sons are ready to take over the business while he is in prison. In terms of preparing for prison, McBee said he has "tried to get everything in line with the businesses" for his sons and the managers. He tries to look on the bright side of the situation, saying this is an opportunity for his managers "to step up, prove that they can do this." "People don't call me and say, 'Hey, Steve just wanted to let you know everything's great today,' they call me with the crisis," he said. Cameras will be following the family as McBee surrenders himself. The whole process will be shown on the next season of "McBee Dynasty: Real American Cowboys," with McBee saying his family always wants to be "transparent" with their viewers. "One thing that we said when we were making the show with Bravo and NBC Universal was that we want to keep it real," he said. "We feel like too many of the shows, the drama they kind of tried to create it and whatever, so we want to be very transparent and open with our lives if we think that people can read through the BS, and they know what's real and what's not. And so yeah, we're gonna allow them." "That was a family decision," he added. And we kind of all talked about it collectively, as a group, and decided that it's happening regardless.

Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had "full reign access" to telecommunications data. A former FBI official claims that it's likely every American has been impacted by a Chinese-state-sponsored cyberattack. International law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and National Security Agency, issued a joint advisory in September warning the public that CCP-sponsored actors are "targeting" many aspects of American lives, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks. According to the international agencies, the three Chinese companies believed to be behind Salt Typhoon work for China's intelligence services, which include units in the People's Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security. Cynthia Kaiser, a former high-ranking official in the FBI's cyber division, told the New York Times it's hard to envision a scenario where any American wasn't impacted by the hack. Those directly impacted by the cyberattack include senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures whose communications were accessed, according to the FBI. Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had unprecedented access to phone calls being placed by Americans. "They had full rein access," Nicoletti, said. "So, you know, your grandmother calling you to remind you to pick up groceries was not a targeted person and they're gonna listen into that call. But Trump, Vance, Kamala Harris, and dozens of other U.S. government officials were specifically targeted." Nicoletti said the Salt Typhoon hackers "established a foothold and exfiltrated data for five years," which is "almost unprecedented." Chinese military personnel head to a field to participate in the Golden Dragon military exercise in Svay Chok village, north of Phnom Penh Cambodia, May 16, 2024. "My biggest concern is they're still in various organizations and undetected," he said. "So the thing that I worry about is not the next time that these guys hack somebody, it's what they're doing currently and who they're in." When discussing the cyberattack in December 2024, then-deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said the hackers worked to identify the owners of various devices, then spy on phone calls and text messages if they were "government targets of interest."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food stamp recipients are now receiving their November benefits, but a growing swath of enrollees may soon lose their vital food assistance completely. Under the GOP package, more food stamp enrollees will have to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month or they will only be able to receive benefits for three months out of every three years. The expanded work requirements will result in 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps benefits in an average month over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Recipients who don't meet the requirement will likely start losing their benefits in March, but the timing will depend on where they live and when they must recertify their eligibility for food stamps. The GOP spending bill further broadened the work requirement to include recipients through age 64 and parents of children ages 14 through 17. Veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth are now also subject to the mandate. Plus, the legislation made it harder for states to seek waivers during poor economic conditions. Previously, states could obtain waivers in areas they identify as having a lack of sufficient jobs. Now, only areas with unemployment rates over 10% qualify. A federal judge in Rhode Island has temporarily barred the US Department of Agriculture from terminating existing waivers before their expiration dates, but the agency has yet to release guidance on the decision, said Chloe Green, assistant director of policy at the American Public Human Services Association. “There is both a tremendous amount of confusion and, strangely, a wide array of differences across states and how they are implementing it,” Bauer said. The SNAP work requirement provisions were among the few GOP agenda bill measures that did not have a set implementation date. Then, earlier this month, the USDA said that states should not count November when calculating whether enrollees are meeting their work requirements because of the shutdown-spurred benefit disruptions. Most states set November 1 as their implementation date, though some started earlier, Green said. But other states say their systems may not be ready to track the expanded requirement until the spring, even though that could put them at risk for being penalized by the USDA. “One worry we have is that when you make systems changes this fast, there's a risk for unintended impacts somewhere else in the system,” she said, noting that such updates usually take 12 to 18 months to do properly. States are particularly sensitive to making payment mistakes now because another provision of the Republican agenda bill requires that they shoulder a larger share of the program's administrative costs if they have high error rates. Beneficiaries who may be newly subject to the work requirements need to be notified and screened to make sure they don't qualify for other exemptions, such as having physical or mental limitations. “A lot of people who are calling in are worried that now they're being assigned work requirements without them even knowing,” Green said. Many states are starting the three-month clock when residents first apply for food stamps or when they file their recertification forms, which generally happens every six to 12 months depending on the state and entails an interview. Connecticut has found it “very challenging” to implement the expanded work requirements, said Dan Giacomi, director of program oversight and grants administration at the state's Department of Social Services. “You can't just flip a switch in your eligibility system and have it do all of these new categories or new processes you have,” he said. Giacomi is also concerned about these cases being integrated properly into the system once it is updated, as well as any payment errors that may result in penalties for the state. States often want to wait for clear USDA guidance so they don't take steps that the agency might later say don't comply with the regulations, said Ed Bolen, director of state SNAP strategies for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Pennsylvania, the timetable began even earlier because its economic waivers, which covered many counties and localities, expired in September. Pennsylvania has several ways of verifying recipients' income, including state and federal data and a pilot program in which enrollees allow a third-party platform to pull and report their payroll information. But these sources don't necessarily cover all the work that recipients perform so they may also have to submit pay stubs. The legislation expanded that number to just under 248,000 people. The department projects that a total of 144,000 recipients could lose their benefits over the next year when they renew their eligibility. Connecticut is sending text messages, mailing notices and meeting with community groups. It has also set up an online questionnaire that will direct those potentially affected to the next steps they have to take. Still, Pham is worried that some people who would continue to qualify could lose their benefits because of the paperwork. “It is all too easy for someone to miss an action step, and for that reason alone, that opens up the risk for people to lose their SNAP eligibility — for just missing an administrative process, and not because they are not otherwise eligible,” she said.</p>

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins ‘Fox News Live' to break down President Donald Trump's warning that Venezuelan airspace is now closed as his cartel crackdown intensifies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a sharp warning Saturday about President Donald Trump's posture toward Venezuela, accusing him of edging the U.S. "closer and closer to another costly foreign war" without congressional approval. In a blistering statement, Schumer criticized Trump's recent escalation toward Venezuela and argued that the president had upended the Constitution. "President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war," Schumer stated. The minority leader cautioned the president to avoid entering into another overseas conflict, writing that "Americans are tired of endless foreign wars that cost the lives of countless American service members and drain precious resources." "This is not an America First policy," he added. The New York Democrat's comments came after Trump wrote on Truth Social that Venezuela's airspace should be considered "closed in its entirety." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a sharp warning on Nov. 29 regarding President Donald Trump's posture toward Venezuela, accusing him of edging the U.S. "closer and closer to another costly foreign war." "To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY," he wrote. That post came a week after the Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of a "worsening security situation" in the area. While speaking to U.S. service members on Thanksgiving, Trump said the U.S. will "very soon" begin stopping suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers "by land." Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea on Friday. "In recent weeks, you've been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many," Trump said. "Of course, there aren't too many coming in by sea anymore. Trump has not dismissed the idea of sending American troops into Venezuela, stating on Nov. 17 that he hasn't eliminated the possibility. President Donald Trump was criticized by Sen. Chuck Schumer on Saturday for his recent approach toward Venezuela. On Friday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea. "As we've said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,'" Hegseth wrote on X. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization." "As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland," Hegseth added in his post. House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., issued a joint statement Saturday reiterating that the committee is "committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense's military operations in the Caribbean." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized President Trump for his handling of Venezuela. Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment.

President Donald Trump‘s statement that the airspace over Venezuela is “closed” has resulted in the suspension of deportation flights from the United States, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said.

Trump issued a warning to pilots on Saturday morning that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela is now “closed in its entirety.” The surprising announcement was met with condemnation from the Venezuela government, which called it an “illegal” and “immoral act of aggression” in a statement that included an appeal to the United Nations as well as a vow to respond “with all the strength granted by international law.”

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela strongly repudiates the public message disseminated today on social media by the President of the United States,” the statement said. “The Bolivarian Government warns that Venezuela will not accept orders, threats, or interference from any foreign power. No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of national airspace.”

Venezuela also revealed a consequence of Trump's statement — the immediate suspension of deportation flights to Venezuela, a key part of the U.S. president's immigration agenda.

“Through this action, the United States government has unilaterally suspended the Venezuelan migrant flights that were being carried out regularly and weekly as part of the repatriation of Venezuelans through the Plan Vuelta a la Patria (Return to the Homeland Plan),” it added.

The deportation flights were a rare instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Venezuela at the beginning of Trump's second term.

TRUMP SAYS VENEZUELAN AIRSPACE NOW ‘CLOSED'

Those already fragile relations have significantly deteriorated as Trump wages a drug war on the South American country, which has so far been limited to strikes on small alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Southern Pacific.

Those military operations may be expanding, with the airspace announcement signaling strikes on targets inside Venezuela could be imminent.</p>
