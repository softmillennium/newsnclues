            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formally requested a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing it was in the “public interest.”
    


            In a letter addressed to President Isaac Herzog, Netanyahu wrote that his trial has become “a focal point of fierce controversy” for which he bears “broad public and more responsibility, with an understanding of the overall ramifications of these events.”
    


            Netanyahu said it was in his “personal interest” to prove his innocence in the ongoing trial, but “the public interest dictates otherwise.” The letter was submitted on Thursday and publicized on Sunday.
    


            As Israeli head of state, Herzog has the sole mandate to issue pardons. His office confirmed it received the request, and Herzog would “consider it with great care and responsibility.”
    


            In the one-page letter, Netanyahu does not include an admission of guilt or make any commitments about his political future. He has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
    


            The formal request for a pardon is a reversal for the long-time Israeli leader, who has said the indictments would collapse and that he would prove his innocence in court.
    


            “Faced with the security challenges and diplomatic opportunities currently before the State of Israel, I am committed to do everything in my power to heal the rifts, achieve national unity, and restore public trust in the state's institutions,” Netanyahu wrote, “and I expect all branches of government to do the same.”
    


            The opposition were quick to criticize the request from Netanyahu who has faced accusations of stoking rifts within Israeli society – against the Arab population and the left in particular – as well as prolonging the war in Gaza for his own political gain.
    


            Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's opposition, urged Herzog to reject the pardon request, at least in its current form. “You cannot grant Netanyahu a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life,” Lapid said in a video statement.
    


            Head of the left-wing Democrats party Yair Golan said on X, “Only someone guilty asks for a pardon. After eight years of trial, when the cases against him have not collapsed, Netanyahu is now asking for a pardon.”
    


            But Netanyahu's political allies came out in favor of the pardon. Far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir supported the request, saying in a statement it is “critical for the security for the security of the state.”
    


            Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump once again weighed in on the case with his own letter to Israel's president, asking for a pardon for arguably his most vocal international cheerleader.
    


            “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace,” Trump wrote in a letter distributed by the Israeli president's spokesperson.
    


            A Channel 12 poll conducted in mid-November after Trump's letter to Herzog suggested that 48% of the Israeli public oppose an unconditional pardon, while 44% support it. The remaining 8% said they did not know.
    


            According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the president's pardon authority in Israel is subject to his broad discretion. But, in general, pardons are only issued after an individual has already been convicted.
    


            “The possibility that the President might pardon someone before or during trial risks turning the President into an authority that bypasses the law-enforcement and judicial system,” wrote Dana Blander, a research fellow at the institute. “The rule is that the President acts as a ‘compassionate authority' only after all other authorities have spoken.”
    


            Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office. His trial began in May 2020 in three separate cases.
    


The war in Gaza is over, but the fight in Israel for accountability has barely begun



            In the most serious case he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq. In return, the prosecution claims, Elovitch ensured positive coverage of the prime minister in an online news site he owned called Walla! News. Elovitch has denied the charges.
    


            Netanyahu's own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of the trial, which include testimony, judgment and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.
    


            There is no deadline for Herzog to make a decision regarding a pardon.

            Heavy rainfall has unleashed widespread flooding and landslides across Asia, killing more than 700 people with hundreds still missing.
    


            Cyclone-fueled downpours battered parts of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia this week when a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait – a narrow waterway separating the Indonesian island of Sumatra from the other two nations.
    


            Sri Lanka was struck by a separate storm from which heavy rains are now approaching India's southern coast.
    


            The severe weather has claimed the lives of at least 435 people in Indonesia, 153 in Sri Lanka, 162 in Thailand and two in Malaysia, officials told the Reuters news agency.
    


            Indonesian rescue teams are struggling to reach the hardest-hit areas of Sumatra, where Cyclone Senyar caused catastrophic landslides and flooding.
    


            At least 435 people have died, government data on Sunday showed, an increase from 303 on Saturday. A further 406 people are reported still missing.
    


            Video footage shows helicopters delivering supplies to the island, renowned for lush rainforests, active volcanoes and a critically endangered orangutan population.
    


            “During the flood, everything was gone,” a resident of Bireuen, in Sumatra's northernmost province Aceh, told Reuters.
    


            “I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.”
    


            Maulidin, a 41-year-old resident of North Aceh, fled her home with her family when she woke to the sound of flooding.
    


            “My house is already destroyed, all my belongings are ruined, and mud is inside,” she told AFP.
    


            Rescuers have been trying to reach residents stranded by the floodwaters since Tuesday when monsoon rains caused rivers to overflow in North Sumatra province.
    


            Local media footage shows people using rubber boats to evacuate those trapped.
    


            On the flood-hit Indonesian island of Sumatra, some residents have turned to stealing food and water in order to survive, according to authorities there.
    


            “The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,” police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said, according to AP. “(Residents) didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.”
    


            Across the strait, at least 162 people have died due to the extreme weather in southern Thailand, government spokesperson Siripong Angkasakulkiat told Reuters on Saturday.
    


            Some 3.5 million people have been affected, with authorities airlifting patients and flying critical supplies, including oxygen tanks, to submerged communities, the outlet said.
    


            Amphorn Kaeophengkro and her family of eight had no time to escape when floodwaters swept into their home in Hat Yai city last Saturday.
    


            Instead, they rushed to the second floor as water levels swelled, eventually spending 48 hours perched atop a table, washing machine and on a window frame.
    


            “We weren't thinking about anything else except surviving,” the 44-year-old told Reuters by candlelight, as her family began to clean their dwelling after the water had receded.
    


            “Sometimes we sat at the edge of the window and had to lift our legs to avoid keeping them too deep in the water.”
    


Global demand for rare earths is wreaking havoc on one of Asia's mightiest river systems



            Hat Yai city was Thailand's hardest-hit region, recording the type of heavy rain the occurs once-in-300-years, bringing floodwaters more than eight feet high on Tuesday and cutting off access to a maternity ward holding 30 newborn babies, staff and officials said.
    


            It is not yet clear when power will be restored to the area where agencies have provided evacuations, medical support and essential supplies.
    


            The city is part of Thailand's Songkhla region, where the government declared an emergency on Tuesday due to severe flooding, an official said on X.
    


            Ten tourists, from Australia, Britain, China, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa, were rescued in Songkhla province on Friday, the Ministry of Tourism told CNN.
    


            “The situation has improved significantly. Water levels have almost completely receded, with only some areas remaining flooded,” a spokesperson said.
    


            More than half a million people felt the wrath of Cyclone Ditwah, which triggered mud slides and flooding on Friday, Reuters said.
    


            Over 25,000 homes have been destroyed and 147,000 people have been forced into state-run temporary shelters, AP reported.
    


            Mallika Kumari was among more than 78,000 people moved to relief centers, mostly set up in schools, after her home was quickly submerged, according to the news agency.
    


            “I first heard about the flood warning on TV but we never expected the river to overflow so quickly. We just rushed out of the house without anything,” Kumari told reporters.
    


            “We haven't even had breakfast. Two of my sons have caught the flu. I have to get them medication. I've brought a few garbage bags to collect their clothes.”
    


            In the rush, Kumari left behind her cat, which was later picked up by a navy boat and brought to dry land.

            Some 191 people remain missing in Sri Lanka and most homes in low-lying areas near the capital, Colombo, are under water and without power, authorities told Reuters.
    


            Some residents chose to stay on the upper floors of partially submerged homes to protect their belongings, the outlet said.
    


            Selvi, a 46-year-old resident of Colombo's Wennawatte suburb, fled her home with four bags of clothes and other possessions. “My house is completely flooded. I don't know where to go, but I hope there is some safe shelter where I can take my family,” she told AFP.
    


            At the Dalugala Thakiya Mosque, volunteers prepared rice parcels with chicken and dhal curry for flood victims.
    


            “We are getting more requests for food because people who work daily jobs cannot find work and are running low on savings,” meal organizer Risham Ahmed told Reuters.
    


            “They are worried about how to piece their lives back together.”
    


            In Malaysia, two people were confirmed dead after Senyar, then a tropical storm, made landfall shortly after midnight on Friday, Reuters said.
    


            Around 34,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, but Gon Qasim and her husband were less fortunate, stranded in a field in northern Perlis state last weekend when rising floodwaters cut off their escape.
    


            The elderly couple were eventually rescued by one of their children and brought to an evacuation center in the state capital of Kangar, where hundreds of families sheltered in tents provided by the national disaster management agency, Reuters reported.
    


            “I was inside, and I couldn't go out. When I was out, there was nowhere to stay but the field,” the 73-year-old Gon said told its reporters, recalling her ordeal in an interview on Wednesday.
    


            “The water was like the ocean. That's what it looked like.”
    


            Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change, scientists have warned.
    


            Current extremes of weather in the region could stem from the interaction of two active systems, Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the unusual formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait, meteorologists told Reuters.
    


            Elsewhere in Southeast Asia this month, deadly floods devastated parts of Vietnam, where flooding and landslides killed dozens of people.
    


            Also in the region this month, the Philippines endured two deadly typhoons – Kalmaegi and Fung-wong – in a week, which killed hundreds of people and forced more than 1.4 million to evacuate.
    


            This summer, the region also saw temperatures reach unprecedented levels, with little respite from merciless heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article contains images and descriptions that some readers may find distsurbing.



            Two human skeletons lie entangled on the rough earth – the arms of one wrapped around the other's head, as though protecting them from danger.
    


            Simply known as numbers 177 and 178, their identities remain a mystery.
    


            They are among 240 human skeletal remains, including children and babies, uncovered at this mass gravesite in Chemmani in Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna district.
    


            “This place is a crime scene no entry,” reads a sign at the entrance.
    


            Numbered white cards placed alongside the bones mark how many skeletons have been found since digging began in May of this year, reviving decades-old allegations of wartime atrocities and cover-ups.
    


            In the heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority, a bloody and brutal history is re-emerging from the soil.
    


            But it is difficult to bury the past entirely.
    


            From 1983 to 2009, the South Asian island nation of 21 million endured a brutal civil war between the Sri Lankan army and the separatist militant group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). More commonly known as The Tamil Tigers, the group was listed as a terrorist organization by many countries including the United States.
    


            The war was fought along ethnic lines, pitting the majority Buddhist Sinhalese state against the predominantly Hindu ethnic minority rebels fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east after years of anti-Tamil violence. The Tigers were ultimately defeated.
    


                    “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”
                


                    Mariranjini Nirmalanathan
                


            Atrocities were committed by both sides, according to the United Nations, which estimates up to 100,000 people were killed in the conflict, with thousands of others forcibly disappeared.
    


            Sixteen years after the war ended, families of the victims and missing are still fighting for justice and accountability.
    


            “One day the truth will come,” said V S Niranjan, a lawyer representing relatives of people who went missing in Jaffna.
    


            Just a stone's throw from a main road, the Chemmani gravesite is one of more than 20 mass graves identified in Sri Lanka.
    


            Many of the gravesites that pockmark the north and east of the country are believed to contain the victims of atrocities committed during the civil war. Caught between warring rebel fighters and the Sri Lankan army, the Tamil community in these regions bore the brunt of the violence.
    


            The military occupied Jaffna from 1995 until the end of the war. Chemmani first gained international attention in 1998 when Sri Lankan soldier former Lance Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse, who was on trial for the rape and murder of schoolgirl Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, confessed that hundreds of Tamils had been buried there after the Sri Lankan army retook Jaffna.
    


                    “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings.”
                


                    Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka
                


            For decades, the mass grave remained hidden until construction workers clearing land in the grounds of a Hindu cemetery in February unearthed human skeletal remains.
    


            Their discovery prompted a court-ordered forensic excavation of the site in May and June, which initially uncovered 19 skeletons.
    


            Since then, the bones of hundreds more people have been found.
    


            A baby's milk bottle, a blue schoolbag, bangles and cloth fragments have been uncovered alongside the bones.
    


            More than 90% of the remains had no form of clothing. The bodies were buried in a disordered way, heaped together in shallow graves of 1.5-2 feet, according to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, an independent national body that investigates violations of fundamental rights.
    


            Tamils, who have lived in the north and east of Sri Lanka for thousands of years, are primarily followers of Hinduism, with a significant Christian minority population, but the commission determined that the fact the bodies were buried naked rules out customary Hindu burials. “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings,” it said.
    


            Teams of archaeologists, crime scene officers, and forensic medicine specialists under the jurisdiction of the Jaffna magistrate were working at the site digging, dusting and storing the remains. As investigators carefully chipped away the earth at one location, the head of a skeleton slowly emerged from the dirt, followed by a torso, arms and the rest of the body.
    


                    “These are very disturbing things.”
                


                    V S Niranjan, lawyer.
                


            Equipped with fine tools, shovels and hammers, they meticulously separated earth and rock from bone, often using their gloved hands to sweep away the dirt.
    


            One small, rectangular block of earth has been cut out of the ground. A tiny spine and rib cage can be made out – the remains of what investigators believe was a baby.
    


            “There are children with a doll we recovered… These are very disturbing things,” said Niranjan, the lawyer who attended the gravesite every day to monitor the excavation on behalf of the families.
    


            Investigators in September appealed to the Jaffna court for a greater area to be mapped and excavated as ground radar suggests additional human remains could be buried there. But by the end of November, work had not restarted.
    


            Amnesty International estimated as many as 100,000 people were “forcibly disappeared” – the secret arrest, imprisonment or abduction of a person with the blessing of state organizations, or rebel groups – in Sri Lanka during the war, and the United Nations Human Rights Office has laid most of the blame on Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups.
    


            CNN sent repeated and detailed requests for comment about the Chemmani gravesite and allegations of wartime abuses to the Sri Lankan army, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice. The army directed CNN to a defense ministry spokesperson who said the matter “is being handled purely by the law enforcement authorities under the supervision of the judiciary.” Sri Lankan Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara said he was not available to comment.
    


            Speaking at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances in Geneva on September 29, Nanayakkara said the Sri Lankan government “believed in securing justice for the victims and finding truth and closure, in line with its commitment with human rights and fundamental freedoms.”
    


            Mothers and widows are leading the charge in Sri Lanka demanding answers.
    


            For more than 30 years they have struggled to find out what happened to their loved ones, pressing the government and authorities through the courts and on the streets.
    


            Previous investigations into other gravesites were not successful in identifying victims, did not lead to prosecutions, or were halted due to lack of funds or political will.
    


            Clutching photos of their missing relatives, hundreds of residents marched in the stifling heat from Jaffna to the Chemmani gravesite on August 30, calling for independent international oversight of the investigation because they don't trust the local justice system to give them answers.
    


            “Where are our children?” the protesters chanted.
    


            Each came with similar stories – a husband, a brother, a son; sometimes a whole family missing, without a trace.
    


            At the protest, Sivapatham Elangkothai dropped to the dusty ground, and in an expression of grief and anger slammed her hand to her head and heart.
    


            “Where are you? I want to see you all, I want you all to come to me,” she cried.
    


            Elangkothai, who helped to organize the protest, held a photo of her daughter, son-in-law and her three young grandchildren, who she hasn't seen in more than 16 years.
    


            Back at her house in Jaffna, she recounted their last months together.
    


                    “When I hear a knock at the door, I think it's my child.”
                


                    Sivapatham Elangkothai
                


            Like many others living in the north and east of Sri Lanka during the war, intense fighting had forced Elangkothai's family to flee their home.
    


            They ended up in Vavuniya, a strategically important district for the Sri Lankan army as a gateway to the largely Tamil-controlled northeast.
    


            In late 2008, Elangkothai's daughter gave birth to her third child – another grandchild for Elangkothai and her husband to dote on.
    


            “We loved them dearly,” she said.
    


            But the family was split between north and south Vavuniya, and when the Sri Lankan army began its final and most bloody assault, they became separated forever.
    


            Elangkothai later learned through family friends that her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren were herded onto a military bus, along with other residents, and taken away by Sri Lankan army soldiers. Her youngest grandchild was just 7 months old at the time.
    


            At her home in Jaffna, surrounded by photos of her family, Elangkothai hugged two saris that belonged to her daughter.
    


            “When I hear a knock at the door, I think it's my child,” she said. “I searched everywhere for them. They aren't to be found.”
    


            Despite filing multiple affidavits and appeals to the government, Elangkothai still does not know what happened to her family.
    


            She now assists the Jaffna branch of the Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances, a civil society group of Tamil families of the disappeared that holds regular protests and pushes for accountability from the state.
    


            “What was our crime? Was it being born a Tamil?” she said.
    


            UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk laid flowers at a vigil demanding justice near the Chemmani mass grave in June.
    


            “Today, an opportunity presents itself for Sri Lanka to break from the past,” said Türk, after he visited the gravesite, and called for “a clear and formal acknowledgment of the violations, abuses and crimes that occurred, including during the civil war.”
    


            Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office last year, has promised to restore trust, investigate crimes and bring justice to victims' families. The government said it would establish a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate wartime abuses in Sri Lanka, and an independent public prosecutor's office.
    


            But the discovery of the Chemmani mass graves has strengthened calls from Tamils for international justice, including referring Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court.
    


            Those calls for an international investigation appeared to have been shut down in September when Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that accountability would be handled “through credible domestic processes” as “external action will only serve to create divisions.”
    


            Herath said investigations into the Chemmani gravesite are being conducted “independent of any government interference” and “the government has and will continue to provide adequate resources for the related processes.”
    


            Over the years, successive Sri Lankan governments have established various state-run commissions of inquiry and investigative bodies, but they have had little success in bringing perpetrators to account.
    


            Families of victims, human rights defenders and international bodies such as the UN have criticized the commissions for a lack of transparency, for being ineffective and ultimately unfit for delivering accountability.
    


            The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was established in 2017 with an explicit mandate to establish the fate of missing persons. It has records of more than 23,000 cases, but has traced just 23 people, a Sri Lankan delegation told the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances on September 29.
    


            The UN human rights office said the OMP's independence had been “undermined” by “appointing members lacking credibility and independence” and it had lost the trust of victim communities.
    


            CNN has reached out to the OMP for comment.
    


            The Sri Lankan delegation told the UN committee that “Sri Lanka had a long-standing practice of investigating complaints of disappearances” and “all investigations of mass graves were carried out with judicial oversight in accordance with legal standards.”
    


            The government was “working on addressing” challenges within the OMP, had allocated additional funding to the body and hoped to “achieve positive results through its investigations and gain public trust,” it added.
    


            Sri Lanka's government “had the political will to investigate cases of enforced disappearance” and was “working to introduce a new system to compensate victims' families,” the delegation said.
    


            Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan is in her 70s and spent her whole life in Jaffna.
    


            She and her husband saved hard to build their dream home but it sat between an army camp and the Jaffna hospital, and as the war intensified around them, they were forced to abandon it, she told CNN.
    


            Her husband did some work for the army as a translator – Nirmalanathan thought it would offer them some protection. But one day in 1990, he didn't return from the army base.
    


            Nirmalanathan said she used to go to the military camp demanding answers from the soldiers. As a lone woman with two young children in tow, she said she feared for her life and that of her sons.
    


            Soldiers would say her husband was working and fine.
    


            Weeks became months, months became years, and her husband never returned home.
    


            Her two boys grew up without a father and carried the trauma of war.
    


            “They saw children their own age die before their eyes,” Nirmalanathan said. “When there was an airstrike, the children would run to the bunkers. That's how they played. We did not teach them. Even while studying, if they saw a plane, they would drop everything and hide.”
    


            She would tell her children that, one day, their father would come home.
    


            But the fighting got worse. She applied for passports for her sons to move away from Sri Lanka – to join the huge exodus of Tamils who fled to Europe, India, Canada and elsewhere during the war.
    


                    “Many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope.”
                


                    Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan
                


            In 2007, tragedy struck again. The morning that her eldest son's passport arrived, he was taken on a motorbike by soldiers.
    


            Her son, 19 at the time, was last seen at a massive army camp near the airport in Jaffna. She has had no word from him since.
    


            Today, she and other women hold a protest every month demanding answers and an international investigation.
    


            Nirmalanathan said she faces harassment from the authorities for her protests. Some nights, between 2 and 4 a.m., she sees and hears security personnel outside her door.
    


            She believes it's an intimidation tactic to stop her galvanizing other family members.
    


            United Nations observers noted in a report released in August “continued patterns of surveillance, intimidation and harassment of families of the disappeared, community leaders, civil society actors, especially those working on accountability for enforced disappearances and other conflict-related crimes.”
    


            Speaking in Geneva in September at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, a Sri Lankan government representative accused freelance Tamil journalist Kumanan Kanapathipillai, one of the authors of this CNN report, of “terrorist activities and financial crime.” Kanapathipillai had previously been brought in for questioning by counter-terrorism police following his reporting on the Chemmani mass graves.
    


            The Committee to Protect Journalists and several other press advocate groups called on the government to end its “harassment” of Kanapathipillai. More than 100 other Sri Lankan organizations and individuals issued a joined statement saying the “ill-founded accusations and persistent harassment are an attempt to silence” Kanapathipillai, and serve as “a warning to other Tamil-speaking journalists and activists” working on historic and continued repression of the Tamil community.
    


            The country's Foreign Minister Herath said the government “will not hesitate to take action on any alleged harassment or intimidation.”
    


            The discovery of the Chemmani gravesite reopened old wounds but also gave many mothers like Nirmalanathan hope that some answers may finally come.
    


            “Today there is a reason why the relatives come and sob. After all these years they strongly believe that (their loved ones) will come home… many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope,” she said.
    


            “Our loved ones couldn't speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”

ASTANA, November 30. /TASS/. The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs has voiced its protest against the attack on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, the ministry's spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov said in a statement.

""The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs protests another targeted attack on the critical infrastructure of the international Caspian Pipeline Consortium in the waters of the Novorossiysk seaport. This incident is the third act of aggression against a purely civilian facility, the operation of which is guaranteed by international law,"" the statement noted.

US president favours Nasry ‘Tito' Asfura of rightwing National party, as polls show three candidates are neck-and-neck

Hondurans have begun voting in an election held amid threats by Donald Trump to cut aid to the country if his preferred candidate loses.

Honduras could be the next country in Latin America, after Argentina and Bolivia, to swing right after years of leftwing rule.

Polls show three candidates neck-and-neck in the race to succeed President Xiomara Castro, whose husband, Manuel Zelaya, also led the country before being toppled in a 2009 coup.

Trump's favourite is 67-year-old Nasry “Tito” Asfura of the rightwing National party. His main challengers are 60-year-old lawyer Rixi Moncada from the ruling Libre party and 72-year-old TV host Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal party.

Polls opened at 7.00 am (1300 GMT) for 10 hours of voting, with the first results expected on Sunday.

Trump has conditioned continued US support for one of Latin America's poorest countries on Asfura winning. “If he [Asfura] doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad,” he wrote on Friday on his Truth Social platform, echoing threats he made in support of the Argentine president Javier Milei's party in that country's recent midterms.

In a dramatic move on Friday, Trump also announced he would pardon the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez of the National party, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US for cocaine trafficking and other charges.

Despite making narco-traffickers the target of a significant military buildup in the Caribbean, Trump claimed the Honduran “has been, according to many people that I greatly respect, treated very harshly and unfairly”, without elaborating.

Hernandez was convicted of turning Honduras into a “narco-state” while president between 2014 and 2022. He was convicted in Manhattan last year and sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Some Hondurans have welcomed Trump's interventionism, saying they hope it might mean Honduran migrants will be allowed to remain in the US. But others have rejected his meddling in the vote.

Nearly 30,000 Honduran people have been deported from the US since Trump returned to office in January. The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country of 11 million people, where remittances represented 27% of GDP last year.

Moncada has portrayed the election as a choice between a “coup-plotting oligarchy” – a reference to the right's backing of the 2009 military ouster of Zelaya – and democratic socialism. Moncada has held ministerial portfolios under both Zelaya and Castro.

Nasralla also served in Castro's government but fell out with the ruling party and has since shifted to the right. Asfura was a building entrepreneur before being elected mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, where he served two terms.

Pre-emptive accusations of election fraud, made both by the ruling party and opposition, have sown mistrust in the vote and sparked fears of post-election unrest.

Ana Paola Hall, the president of the National Electoral Council, told all parties “not to fan the flames of confrontation or violence” at the start of the single-round elections, in which Hondurans are also picking members of the unicameral Congress and local mayors.

Asfura has distanced himself from Hernandez, his party's figurehead. “I have no ties [with Hernandez] … the party is not responsible for his personal actions,” he told AFP on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

David Gentile had just begun to serve a seven-year sentence for role in $1.6bn scheme that defrauded thousands 

Donald Trump granted clemency to private equity executive David Gentile, who had just begun a seven-year prison sentence for what prosecutors described as a $1.6bn fraud scheme, reported the New York Times.

The founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GPB Capital, 59 year old Gentile was convicted and sentenced in May to seven years in prison for his role in defrauding thousands of individual investors.

He reported to prison on 14 November. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, Gentile was released on Wednesday, 26 November.

“The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,” said Joseph Nocella Jr, United States attorney for the eastern district of New York, in a statement on the sentencing in May.

According to a complaint from regulators, some investor funds were used to “cover the costs of private jets, including a $90,000-a-year flight attendant, all-terrain vehicle rentals and more than $29,000 in expenses that an auditor said included ‘David's 50th Bday,' according to the state's complaint. It also claims GPB spent $355,000 on a 2015 Ferrari FF used by Mr. Gentile.”

In 2021, New York attorney general Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the private equity firm, Gentile, and two other executives, in seeking restitution for impacted investors.

“Investors put in more than $1.8 billion into GPB funds but were left without a single cent of profit,” James said in a statement on the lawsuit. “GPB and its operators fleeced New Yorkers and investors around the country while subsidizing their own lavish lifestyles, which is why we are filing this lawsuit and fighting to hold these bad actors accountable.”

The New York Times reported “it was not immediately clear whether Mr Gentile had connections to Mr Trump or to the president's supporters. Lawyers for Mr Gentile and Mr Schneider declined to comment. Mr Gentile did not respond to a request for comment.”

As of Sunday, the details of the commutation has yet to be posted on the Department of Justice website.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner meet Kyiv delegation, after another weekend of deadly Russian attacks in Ukraine

Ukrainian negotiators are meeting with US officials in Florida to thrash out details of Washington's proposed framework to end Russia's war in Ukraine, as Kyiv faces pressure on military and political fronts.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, are sitting down with a Ukrainian delegation on Sunday before planned US talks this week in Moscow with Vladimir Putin.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the national security and defence council in Ukraine, posted a photo of the meeting on X and described it as focusing on “steps toward achieving a just peace”.

Diplomats focused on revisions to a proposed 28-point plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticised as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.

“The end goal, obviously, is not just the end of the war. But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity,” Rubio said in brief remarks.

“This is not just about peace deals,” he added as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach.

Umerov responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for US efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has previously claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for US assistance during the war. “US is supporting us. US is working beside us,” he said.

At least six people were killed and dozens wounded across Ukraine over the weekend. A drone attack on the outskirts of Kyiv on Saturday night had killed one person and wounded 11, the regional governor said.

A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by naval drones on two oil tankers off Turkey's Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil.

The talks will focus on details of a draft framework to end the war, more than three years after Russian forces launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The US has pared back an initial draft after criticism from Kyiv and Europe that it was too favourable towards Russia, but the contents of the latest proposals remain unclear. Witkoff, a New York property developer turned Trump official, is expected to travel to Moscow next week.

The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy, and Witkoff. It called on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato. Washington's original proposal – drafted without input from Ukraine's European allies – would have involved Kyiv's withdrawal from its eastern Donetsk region and the US's de facto recognition of Donetsk, Crimea and Luhansk as Russian.

During negotiations last weekend in Switzerland – led by Rubio and Ukrainian negotiators – the plan was revised substantially. Kyiv and its European partners say the existing frontline has to be the starting point for territorial discussions. They say there can be no recognition of land seized by Russia militarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he expected that the results of recent meetings with the US in Geneva would be “hammered out”.

The US talks come amid turbulence for the Ukrainian government. Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, was forced to resign on Friday after his flat was searched by anti-corruption officials investigating a kickback scheme.

Yermak had been the lead negotiator in talks with the US. Zelenskyy has said the Ukrainian delegation in Florida includes Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, Andrii Sybiha, the foreign minister, and Rustem Umerov, head of the security council.

Ukraine is facing significant pressure from Washington to agree to the terms of a deal while Zelenskyy finds himself in increasing difficulty. Russia is making incremental gains on the frontline and Ukrainian cities suffer hours of blackouts every day due to a rolling bombardment of its power grid.

Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is in one of the most difficult moments in its history, but promised his people in a dramatic address last week that he would not betray the country.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian ambassador to Britain and former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, who is considered a potential challenger for the future presidency, wrote in the Telegraph: “We are in an extremely difficult situation, where a rushed peace will only lead to a devastating defeat and loss of independence.”

He said “effective security guarantees” were essential to any framework.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is to meet Zelenskyy in Paris on Monday. “Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of reconstituting the Soviet empire by first subjugating Ukraine,” the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, told La Tribune Dimanche.

Barrot said: “Vladimir Putin must accept the ceasefire or accept exposing Russia to new sanctions that will exhaust its economy, as well as intensified European support for Ukraine.”

Pope Leo XIV wrapped up a four-day trip to Turkey yesterday after a warm welcome by its tiny Christian community, before heading to Lebanon with a message of peace for the crisis-mired nation. 

On his first overseas trip since being elected leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, Leo met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before traveling to Iznik for a celebration marking 1,700 years since the First Council of Nicaea, one of the early Church's most important gatherings. 

On Saturday, the American pope hosted thousands of worshipers who battled the rain to attend a public mass in Istanbul, with many traveling from across Turkey to join the multilingual service, which left many moved by its beautiful and haunting choral interludes.

On his final morning, Leo attended a prayer service at the Armenian cathedral then joined a divine liturgy — the Orthodox equivalent of Mass — at the Patriarchal Church of St. George before a final blessing. 

He was to have lunch with Patriarch Bartholomew I, the leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, a day after they signed a joint declaration in which they pledged to take “new and courageous steps on the path towards unity.”

Despite doctrinal differences that led to the Great Schism of 1054, resulting in a split between the Roman Catholic Church in the West and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the two sides maintain dialogue and hold joint celebrations.

They also agreed to continue their efforts to establish a common date for Easter, which is currently celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox Christians on different days.

The pope's trip comes as the Orthodox world appears more fragmented than ever, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine accelerating the split between the Moscow and Constantinople patriarchates.

Pope Leo is the fifth pontiff to visit Turkey, after Paul VI in 1967, John Paul II in 1979, Benedict XVI in 2006 and Francis in 2014.

He was yesterday scheduled to leave Istanbul and fly to Beirut for a visit lasting until tomorrow.

The six-day two-nation trip is the first major international test for the first pope from the US, who was elected head of the Catholic Church in May and whose understated style contrasts with that of his charismatic and impulsive predecessor, Francis.

Although Leo's visit drew little attention in Turkey, a Muslim-majority nation of 86 million whose Christian community numbers only about 100,000, it is eagerly awaited in Lebanon, a religiously diverse country of 5.8 million people.

Since 2019 Lebanon has been ravaged by crises, including an economic collapse, a devastating port blast in Beirut in 2020 and the recent war with Israel.

President William Lai's (賴清德) historic announcement on Wednesday, Nov. 26, of a supplemental defense budget valued in excess of US$40 billion is a testament to the seriousness with which Taiwan is responding to the relentless expansionist ambitions of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), the Chinese Communist Party and its People's Liberation Army (PLA). Lai is responding to the threat posed to Taiwan sovereignty along with US President Donald Trump's insistence that American partners in good standing must take on more responsibility for their own defense.

The supplemental defense budget will be broken into three main parts. The first and largest piece will be several Foreign Military Sales or FMS programs that are government-to-government transactions. FMS allows for both governments to negotiate directly on the value of procured equipment, such as previously procured HiMARS or NASAMs, while conferring sovereignty to Taiwan through the government-to-government nature of the transaction. 

It equips Taiwan with important, modern, difference-making weapons while binding the two governments together in the training and sustainment of the equipment. FMS is the bedrock of America's primary security relationships throughout the world.



Second, the budget will contain several Direct Commercial Sales or DCS programs. Where FMS is not a priority, DCS is utilized to expedite the delivery of equipment while placing increased pressure on price; it's cheaper and faster. 

This is the direction more defense transactions can go as Taiwan builds out its domestic defense industrial base and becomes further embedded in American and European supply chains. 

This is possible because a new wave of relatively inexpensive unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are not tied to onerous technology restrictions and can therefore be co-developed and co-produced inexpensively and at scale.

The third set of programs are intended for Taiwan's domestic defense industrial base. This is a critical area of investment, as Taiwan must expand the ability to produce more of what it needs, domestically. Taiwan's contract manufacturers are the best in the world and employing their manufacturing expertise to produce large quantities of needed items, particularly UAS, is crucial for Taiwan's defense. 

As Cathy Fang at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET) recently noted when discussing the utility of UAS, “quantity has its own quality”. It is imperative that Taiwan significantly expand its procurement of UAS capabilities; however, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates, the pace of innovation means you cannot over-procure, because the battlefield is changing so rapidly. Most UAS capabilities must be bought in tranches every two or three years, so the military and other agencies can constantly assess their needs and adjust procurement over time. 

Indeed, Ukraine embeds decision making on procurement with some fighting units so they can provide input on new product development quickly.

Lai, in his recent column in The Washington Post, stated, “This landmark package will not only fund significant new arms acquisitions from the US, but also vastly enhance Taiwan's asymmetric capabilities.” Since 2020, the US has narrowed its security assistance to Taiwan to include only so-called asymmetric capabilities. Please note, the term asymmetric is highly subjective, resulting in different interpretations. With Taiwan it mostly means procuring large quantities of munitions and mobile equipment to complicate the planning and execution of a D-Day-style attack on Taiwan's main island. While this has the benefit of pushing off any PLA timeline regarding this scenario, it leaves Taiwan under-supported in dealing with quarantine, gray zone and blockade domains. It is no surprise that we now see China expanding its pressure on everyday challenges such as gray zone incursions. Taiwan seeks a balance between the D-Day domain and everyday challenges in the sky and on the sea. 

US security assistance still needs to adjust to the reality of all of Taiwan's challenges, not just one of them, and with the passage of the supplemental budget we should press for a less boundaried approach to Taiwan's defense with equipment that can manage everyday challenges.

Additionally, it is essential that Taiwan's political parties find a path forward to assess and pass the government's regular annual budget. The defense budget, embedded in the regular government budget, is at the core of support for Taiwan's military. A special supplemental budget is a useful mechanism to surge spending; however, it is the regular year-on-year defense budget that provides sustained resources for all the military's needs. 

To deny the military that certainty undermines the country's defense with one step forward on the supplemental defense budget and two steps back on the regular defense budget. Both must pass in the coming several months for Taiwan's security to be enhanced.

So what comes next? Several of the programs are already under review in the US system. When ready for contract finalization, the Trump administration will alert the US Congress, through a congressional notification or CN, of an impending sale such as the recent November 13 CN, which represented the first arms sales to Taiwan in Mr. Trump's second term. 

Given the sheer size of the programs captured in the supplemental budget, we can expect the Trump administration, over the next 6-12 months, to notify to the US Congress the largest gross value of arms sales to Taiwan since the switch in recognition in 1979. 

This is an extraordinary response to the Chinese threat from the people of Taiwan and the partnered support they receive from the US.

The timing of Lai's commitment is most welcome. The Chinese have chosen to pick an early fight with Japan's new prime minister Sanae Takaichi when she noted in parliamentary question time, “If there are battleships and the use of force [in the Taiwan Strait], no matter how you think about it, there is a possibility that it becomes a survival-threatening situation [for Japan].” 

China has rapidly escalated its rhetoric against Japan, threatened its leader with assassination, pursued some modest and frankly inconsequential economic actions while flooding the international media with claims of Japanese neo-militarism.

 The latter assertion is simply preposterous given China's recent militaristic behavior.

Takaichi's comments are significant and worthy of consideration and support from the US and Taiwan. Like the United States, the Japanese have long pursued a policy of ambiguity over what military involvement in a Chinese attack on Taiwan would entail . As the threat from the Chinese has expanded, particularly under Xi, we are seeing increasing clarity fr2om countries affected by this threat. 

Strategic ambiguity is increasingly being replaced by strategic clarity, not all at once, but with each step. We have seen multilateral and bilateral declarations include the demand for “peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.” China naturally objects given its contention that this is a domestic matter, but it is the only belligerent threatening peace. We saw former US president Joe Biden on four separate occasions state the US would come to Taiwan's defense. Yes, three instances were walked back by his staff, but the boundaries around acceptable clarity of global interest in Taiwan's future is expanding and clarifying.

Taiwan's supplemental defense budget is the correct response to China's daily harassment of Taiwan. Takaichi's statements along with her government's consideration of deployment of Type 03 Chu-SAM missiles on Yonaguni Island, in response to constant PLA harassment of Japanese sovereignty, is the correct way to push back on Chinese threats and elevated tensions. 

President Trump would do well to robustly support Japan when speaking to China. Conversely, in the United Kingdom constant violations of British sovereignty by Chinese intelligence services are met with appeasement as the government moves toward approving China's mega-embassy designed for a single purpose: to undermine UK sovereignty. An utterly discredited approach where Mr. Starmer's government self-censors sovereignty for marginal economic gain. The US spent two decades plus pursuing this approach, and it was a disaster; only China wins.

Trump's insistence that partners and allies do more for their own defense is well-established. Lai's recent commitments place Taiwan's defense ambitions concurrently in line with the United States, Japan, Australia and other partner nations who are expanding their military capabilities to deter China's destabilizing military modernization — the largest expansion of hostile combat power, by any country, since the end of World War II.

Trump, Lai and Takaichi should receive global support for their leadership.

The Japanese developed Kaohsiung. There was little to show before they arrived. The city does not define itself as a “Japanese” place, but it does not anchor its identity in anything that would oppose Japan, such as revanchism — a barbaric ideology that has only ever generated suffering — or national pride.
The residents of Kaohsiung are too pragmatic for that. The city might have become a wonderful                                    



                                                                                Urban prosperity does not always begin with industrial parks or investment briefings — sometimes, it begins overnight, when the heartbeats of 170,000 people land in a stadium, shaking the ground like an invisible wave of urban renewal. 
During the two nights that K-pop group Twice performed in Kaohsiung last weekend, the city was not just a city. Instead, it felt like a massive body that had just woken up — the MRT's blood flow sped up, the night markets' sense of smell remained active until 4am and the shopping districts swelled as if injected with oxygen. This was not a                                    



                                                                                The recent confirmation hearing for Austin Dahmer, US President Donald Trump's nominee for assistant secretary of war for strategy, plans and capabilities, was potentially groundbreaking. 
Asked how the US could help Taiwan deter or defeat a Chinese attack, Dahmer said: “The US strategy of denial complements Taiwan's plans for layered defense by providing combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines, to provide a strong local defense that is difficult and painful to dislodge while bolstering allied confidence in our resolve.”
For the US to provide “combat-capable forces on operationally relevant timelines,” it would be necessary for Washington to implement an assertive forward                                    



                                                                                I recently watched a panel discussion on Taiwan Talks in which the host rightly asked a critical question: Why is the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) spearheading a robust global movement to reject China's ongoing distortion of UN Resolution 2758?
While the discussion offered some context, a more penetrating analysis and urgent development was missed. The IPAC action is not merely a political gesture; it is an essential legal and diplomatic countermeasure to China's escalating and fundamentally baseless campaign to manufacture a claim over Taiwan through the deliberate misinterpretation of a 1971 UN resolution.

An orange warning indicates air quality that is “unhealthy for sensitive groups.”
None of the monitoring stations nationwide reported a “green” air quality rating, with all other stations recording yellow for “moderate” air quality. 
The ministry advised those sensitive to pollution, such as the elderly, children and those with weaker immune systems, to reduce strenuous outdoor activities and wear masks for protection.

Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) government is escalating the dispute with an appeal to the UN, a move aimed at pressuring countries to side with China's stance on a potential conflict over Taiwan — or stay out of its way.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday last week, Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN Fu Cong (傅聰) accused Takaichi of contravening

Cutting Ukraine's military might has been raised as among the key points in U.S. President Donald Trump's latest push to end the war at all costs. 

The original 28-point peace proposal, criticized in Ukraine for aligning with Russia's sweeping demands, envisioned a 600,000-cap for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Within days, European leaders sent a counterproposal, which reportedly included a push to increase the limitation to 800,000 instead. 

While imposing such restrictions on Ukraine, a country that has only been trying to defend itself from the Russian invasion, is unjustified, the post-war Ukrainian army size would realistically be much lower than the cap due to factors such as economic constraints, according to experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent. 

Ukrainian military analyst and retired major Oleksii Hetman believes that 300,000 would suffice, but only if the troops are professional and regularly trained to be ready for a sudden change in situation. 

""We will not need nearly a million troops in the Armed Forces post-war, as we have today, because we don't even have enough training grounds where these people could conduct training and combat coordination,"" Hetman told the Kyiv Independent. 

As the U.S. pressures Kyiv and Europe to finally reach a war-ending deal after nearly a year of back-and-forth peace talks, Ukraine is seeking to establish conditions that would help prevent another Russian invasion. 

While Ukrainian officials and civil society criticized the original proposal as ""capitulation"" after nearly four years of full-scale war, CBS News reported, citing an unnamed U.S. official, on Nov. 25 that Ukraine has agreed to the proposal's revised version with the exception of ""minor details.""

A peace plan approved by Ukraine and the U.S. includes a limitation on the post-war Ukrainian army to 800,000 service members, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 26, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials.

The D.C.-based think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) echoed Hetman's argument, saying that ""the reduction will not be a problem for Ukraine to implement."" 

""With a ceasefire, it will want to demobilize some of its forces, now estimated at 880,000, and will likely end up below 600,000,"" the CSIS wrote in its Nov. 24 analysis, adding that the Ukrainian army only had 209,000 active-duty personnel before the full-scale war.

Analyst Hetman, however, stressed that it is crucial for Ukraine to maintain its battle-ready reserves of more than a million people, who undergo training once or twice a year. He added that the entire society needs to be ready for an outbreak of another war, which means both men and women aged 18-60, similarly to Israel, need to be ready for ""various combat operations.""


""Putting a cap on Ukraine is going to send the wrong signal because in this case Russia is the aggressor and Russia continues to pose a threat.""
    

""Conduct training and be prepared in case of an emergency, so that they know what to do and how to do it, so that there is no chaos, so that it is clear where to go, to which units, what to do there,"" Hetman said. 

The ability to quickly mobilize reserves who are already assigned units is important for defending the country against another potential attack, according to Andriy Tkachuk, a Ukrainian major and political scientist. 

""In this regard, we need to look at the Israeli example, where the army can double in size in a day,"" Tkachuk told the Kyiv Independent. 

""I believe that this is the right thing to do, and that everyone should undergo training and be ready to mobilize for the army,"" he added, supporting the Israeli model of compulsory military training for draft-age men. 

While Ukraine should be allowed to dictate its own military size as a sovereign country, it understands it's part of the negotiation process and reducing the army size would likely still be necessary from an economic point of view, Tkachuk said. 

Yulia Kazdobina, Senior Fellow of the Security Studies Program at the Ukrainian Prism think-tank, said that the Parliament would have to adopt it as a law on the size of the Ukrainian army if the cap is enforced on Ukraine. But she believes that finding people who are ready to fight — especially after many of those who were ready had volunteered in 2022 and were killed — would be difficult if Ukraine were to have a small army.

Echoing EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's call that Russia should be limited in its army size and military budgets instead, Kazdobina stressed that ""putting a cap on Ukraine is going to send the wrong signal because in this case Russia is the aggressor and Russia continues to pose a threat."" 

The important details to work out would be ""what is and isn't being counted"" in the cap, such as the number of reserves and an international monitoring mechanism, according to Steven Horrell, a Senior Fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) think-tank. 

""If this limitation becomes key to the success of an overall ceasefire and eventual peace, Ukraine should still press for a higher and higher cap,"" the former Naval Intelligence Officer told the Kyiv Independent. 

""Ultimately, the last 12 years have demonstrated that Ukraine must maintain their own capabilities for national security.""

Editor's note: The story was updated with the latest details.

The United States is displaying ""a constructive approach"" in peace negotiations with Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Nov. 29, as delegates from Kyiv arrived in the U.S.

A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov traveled to the U.S. on Nov. 29 to continue negotiations on the latest U.S.-backed peace plan to end Russia's war against Ukraine. 

The delegates will meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, in Florida on Nov. 30, a U.S. official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. 

Despite earlier speculation that military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov might join the delegation, Ukrainska Pravda's sources reported that Budanov remained in Kyiv, with HUR to be represented at the talks by his deputy, Vadym Skibitskyi.

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to the military agency for comment.

""The American side is demonstrating a constructive approach, and in the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,"" Zelensky said. 

The talks will build off the recent negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European representatives worked to revise the original 28-point proposal — a plan that initially demanded sweeping concessions from Kyiv in line with Moscow's maximalist demands. 

The revised version reportedly aligns more closely with Ukraine's position, but a new framework has not been finalized. 

Following the Florida talks, Witkoff is set to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin for separate talks in Moscow. Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House. 

The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have for months been promoting a ""peace through business"" approach to diplomacy, hoping to tempt Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for bringing Russia's economy out of isolation. 

Ukraine's peace negotiations have also been disrupted by political turmoil at home: Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's top aide and lead negotiator, resigned on Nov. 28 amid a major corruption investigation. 

In comments to the Financial Times (FT) on Nov. 29, Yermak claimed credit for successfully revising the plan in Geneva. 

""The delegation under my leadership in Geneva, together with our American partners, managed to ensure that the 28-point document no longer exists,"" he told the FT. 

""A few difficult points remain that need to be agreed upon, and I believe that this is possible. In any case, the president — no matter the pressure — will not sign or approve anything that goes against Ukraine's interests.""

Russia, meanwhile, has shown little interest in declaring a ceasefire or negotiating peace under the revised Geneva terms. Putin on Nov. 27 demanded that Ukrainian troops withdraw from their current positions as a condition for a ceasefire and said that negotiating with the Ukrainian leadership was ""pointless.""

Russia's Ministry of Justice designated Human Rights Watch an “undesirable organization” on Nov. 28, effectively banning the group from operating in the country.

Human Rights Watch noted that Russia had already forced the closure of its Moscow office in 2022.

“Our work hasn't changed, but what's changed, dramatically, is the government's full-throttled embrace of dictatorial policies, its staggering rise in repression, and the scope of the war crimes its forces are committing in Ukraine,” said Philippe Bolopion, executive director at Human Rights Watch. 

The Prosecutor General's Office initially issued the ban on the organization on Nov. 10. 

The designation under Russia's controversial ""undesirable organizations"" law prohibits groups from operating within Russia and makes it a criminal offense for individuals to participate in their activities. The law has been widely criticized by human rights advocates.

The move underscores the Kremlin's intensifying crackdown on civil society and international organizations following the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Founded in 1978, Human Rights Watch conducts research and investigations into human rights abuses in countries worldwide.

The Vancouver Whitecaps know their work is not done. 

The team downed expansion side San Diego FC 3-1 to earn the title of Western Conference champions Saturday. 

Even as they raised the trophy in the air, confetti falling around them, the players were already turning their minds toward their next task: the MLS Cup final against Lionel Messi's Inter Miami on Dec. 6.

“Obviously winning the conference and getting a trophy is nice. And we'll enjoy that,” said striker Brian White. “But the ultimate goal is to win an MLS Cup. And we know how hard that will be in Miami.”

The ‘Caps finished the regular season second in the West with an 18-7-9 record and eliminated FC Dallas and Los Angeles FC before taking on San Diego in Saturday's conference final.

Vancouver was dominant from the outset, with White poking a ball from teammate Andres Cubas into the San Diego goal in the eighth minute. 

The visitors doubled their lead in the 11th off an own goal by 'keeper Pablo Sisniega. 

Emmanuel Sabbi collected a ball from Whitecaps superstar Thomas Muller and launched a shot, but Sisniega turned it away. The rebound popped out to Vancouver's Ali Ahmed, who sent it flying back toward the net, where it pinged in off the netminder. 

Ahmed set up another striker in the second minute of first-half injury time, slicing a ball across the six-yard box to White, who chested it in for his second goal of the night. 

Vancouver took a 3-0 cushion into the locker room. 

San Diego made a trio of changes out of the half in a bid to spark its offence, including bringing Mexican forward Hirving Lozano on for Corey Baird. 

The move paid off in the 60th minute when Lozano lobbed a right-footed shot up and into the Vancouver net from above the penalty area, cutting his team's deficit to 3-1.

San Diego's bid for a comeback took a hit in the 79th minute when Sisniega was sent off after coming up out of the penalty area to challenge attacking midfielder Ryan Gauld. The 'keeper sent Gauld flying and was quickly shown the red card, leaving the home side down a man for the rest of the game.

While the two sides were even in shots across the match at 12-12, Vancouver had the better chances with an 8-4 edge in on-target chances. 

“We played with conviction in the way we wanted to play,” said Whitecaps head coach Jesper Sorensen. “And we played with pace on the ball but still with good movements and with some patience, so we didn't attack too fast. We waited until the openings were there. 

“I think it was a great game from the players.”

The victory marks Vancouver's first MLS conference title. Next week, the club will make its first appearance in the league's championship game. 

The Whitecaps know Saturday's win was a big achievement, Muller said, but the team is staying level-headed. 

“The boys are calm,” he said. “We know that there's one more step to go. And that's a really good feeling, to be with them.”

Vancouver has already faced Miami twice this year, taking a pair of wins to advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final, where the 'Caps ultimately fell to LIGA MX side Cruz Azul. 

Next week's battle at Chase Stadium will feature a matchup of global superstars. Miami has Messi, while Vancouver's Muller is a German soccer legend. 

Despite the big names, the game will be about more than two players, Muller said. 

“It's not about Messi against Thomas Muller. It's about Miami against the Whitecaps,” said the star attacking midfielder. “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me because we are such a good group.”

The Whitecaps have lost just once since Muller joined the team in mid-August. 

“Since August, it's like a Cinderella story. And I try to keep on dancing,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Venezuela: Trump signals imminent land attacks","https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-trump-signals-imminent-land-attacks/a-74952467","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:20:07 GMT","

As tensions and rhetoric between the US and Venezuela continue to rise, President Donald Trump has announced the closure of Venezuelan airspace — sparking fears of an imminent US land attack.

The Caribbean Sea is already now largely closed to drug smugglers from South America, but on Thursday Donald Trump announced that American troops will also begin land strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers ""very soon."" Marking another significant escalation, Trump said on Saturday that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela is to be closed in its entirety.

Since early September, the US has killed more than 80 people in attacks on around 20 speedboats with suspected drug smugglers on board — mostly from Venezuela — in the southern Caribbean. Venezuela describes the actions as ""extrajudicial executions"" and international observers see them as clear violations of international law.

But of greater concern to Caracas has been the associated demonstration of force off the Venezuelan coast by the US. In the last three months, the US Navy has assembled around 12,000 soldiers and a dozen warships, among them the world's largest aircraft carrier.

The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which has been ruling by increasingly authoritarian means for over 20 years, with President Nicolás Maduro at its helm, sees this as a direct threat to both the party and the country's sovereignty.

Officially, the US military operation now known as ""Southern Spear"" is aimed at combating drug smuggling from South America to the US. But the massive military deployment is fueling doubts on many sides that this can be the only goal. Geopolitical interests, such as diminishing the influence of China and Russia in the region, along with economic concerns, have been cited as possible motives. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.

There is no doubt that the US government wants to pressure the Venezuelan government. Trump has repeatedly referred to Maduro and his government as narco-terrorists. The United States has offered a $50 million (€58 million) bounty for Maduro's capture — twice as much as that offered for Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

The ""Cartel de los Soles"" (Cartel of the Suns), said to be led by Maduro, was also officially designated a terrorist organization early this week. Named after the shoulder insignia worn by officers, the alleged criminal organization has roots in the Venezuelan military. And since PSUV has also always based its power largely on the country's armed forces, Venezuela's rise as one of South America's most important drug trafficking hubs has fueled suspicions that the government is also involved. 

Maduro denies the existence of Cartel de los Soles, and has described the accusations as a ""ridiculous lie"" intended to justify ""illegal intervention"" in Venezuela. At the same time, he and key cabinet members are stirring up Venezuelan nationalism. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López used the105th anniversary of the Venezuelan Air Force on Thursday to call on citizens to ""defend the nation with their lives if necessary.”

The government has also provided weapons training to thousands of civilians and activated tens of thousands of militiamen since September. In early November, the Venezuelan armed forces reportedly held a large-scale exercise involving some 200,000 soldiers and paramilitaries — almost two-thirds of the country's currently available armed forces. Maduro has said that 4.5 million trained civilians could be added to that number.

While Trump's vague announcement of impending land operations once again sparked accusations that he aims to overthrow Maduro's government, experts consider this unlikely.

""I don't believe that the United States is planning a ground invasion of Venezuela — that could turn into a new Vietnam,"" says Christian Cwik, a Latin American historian at the University of Klagenfurt, referring to the Vietnam War, in which the US tried unsuccessfully from 1965 to 1975 to resolve the civil war there in favor of anti-communist forces.

Targeted missile strikes or air attacks on suspected smuggling infrastructure, on the other hand, would be conceivable, Cwik says.

The goal of taking such action could be destabilizing the PSUV leadership, says Günther Maihold, a political scientist at the Freie Universität Berlin. But so far, it doesn't look like that will happen, he says. Especially since, as both experts emphasize, US attacks could rally the deeply divided Venezuelan people behind their government again.

Which could be why good Trump — parallel to his recent threats — has offered Maduro talks, according to US news site Axios, citing a US government source.

This comes as no surprise to Francisco Rodriguez, a political scientist from the University of Denver. ""Instead, throughout his two administrations, Trump has consistently approached thorny domestic and foreign policy issues via a strategy he laid out in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal: escalate to negotiate,"" he wrote a week ago in Foreign Affairs.

Phil Gunson, a senior analyst of Venezuela for the International Crisis Group, takes a similar view, saying that Trump's instinct tells him to negotiate rather than get involved in a war.

Still, further escalation seems almost inevitable because so far threats have been ineffective. If pressure doesn't work and there is no military response from the US, then the fleet would have to withdraw without fulfilling its mission and suffer the political fallout, Gunson says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","White House launches tracker to call out 'media offenders'","https://www.dw.com/en/white-house-launches-media-bias-tracker/a-74954883","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 02:30:13 GMT","

The White House has launched a tracker designed to call out ""media offenders"" every week. The site labels every story the Trump administration objects to by classifying them into categories like ""lie"" or ""bias.""

The White House launched a new page on its website on Friday called ""media offenders,"" listing news sites, reporters, and stories it claims misled the public.

The top publications cited as ""media offenders of the week"" were the Boston Globe, CBS News, and the Independent. Reporters from those outlets were singled out for stories about a controversial video released last week by six Democratic lawmakers.

The lawmakers, all of whom are military veterans or former intelligence officials, reminded service members they are not obligated to follow illegal orders.

In a video posted online last week, the lawmakers said, ""Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home.""

""Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal order. ... You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,"" they added.

US President Donald Trump called the lawmakers' actions ""seditious"" and ""treason.""

The page included an ""offender hall of shame"" with a list of stories the White House considers mistruths.

Each story is explained and categorized under labels such as ""lie,"" ""omission of context,"" or ""left-wing lunacy.""

The White House described the site as ""a record of the media's false and misleading stories flagged by The White House.""

The page also features a leaderboard of news sites the administration claims reported stories incorrectly.

The Washington Post tops the list, followed by MSNBC (recently rebranded as MS NOW), CBS News, CNN, The New York Times, Politico, and The Wall Street Journal.

There's also a section with ""repeat offenders"" with outlets that the Trump administration objects to.

All outlets on the leaderboard, along with others, turned in their Pentagon press badges last month after rejecting new rules imposed by the Department of Defense.

The rules would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they reported information, classified or otherwise, that had not been approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for release.

Trump has also been involved in court battles against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal, and the Associated Press over the past year.

The administration's broader conflict with media outlets has also taken a personal turn. In recent weeks, Trump has faced criticism for insulting female reporters.

This week, the president called a female reporter from The Times ""ugly"" after she co-wrote a data-driven report about the president showing signs of aging.

The president, who is 79, drew fire two weeks ago after telling a Bloomberg reporter to be ""quiet, piggy"" when she tried to ask a follow-up question about disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's emails.

The Associated Press contributed to the report.

Russian missiles and drones slammed residential Kyiv overnight, killing three civilians and injuring dozens, including a child. Meanwhile, Russia has banned the NGO Human Rights Watch as ""undesirable."" 

This was the development regarding Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, November 29. This blog is now closed.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are meeting Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, according to the AFP and Reuters news agencies. Both agencies cited unnamed sources.

It comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that a Ukrainian delegation was en route to the US.

According to a French presidency, President Emmanuel Macron will host his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, for talks in Paris on Monday.

The Elysee Palace said that the two leaders would discuss ""the conditions for a just and lasting peace.""

Zelenskyy's visit to France comes at a time when Washington is seeking to advance a plan aimed at ending the war between Kyiv and Moscow. 

Police in South Africa said Saturday they had arrested four men en route to Russia who were suspected of being signed up for the Russian military amid the war in Ukraine.

Police said the men were stopped at the boarding gate in Johannesburg on Friday. This occurred weeks after reports surfaced that 17 other South Africans were stranded in Ukraine after being lured into joining the Russian military.

Under South African law, it is prohibited to provide military assistance to foreign governments without authorization.

""The arrests followed a tip-off from (Johannesburg airport police) regarding four males who were en route to Russia via the United Arab Emirates,"" the elite Hawks police unit said in a statement. ""A preliminary investigation revealed that a South African female had allegedly been facilitating the travel and recruitment of these individuals into the Russian Federation military.""

The Hawks said the four men are due to appear in court on Monday.

Elsewhere, earlier this week, police said they will investigate Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, a daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma.

Zuma-Sambudla was accused by her half-sister of being part of an operation to lure men to Russia under false pretences.

Ukraine hit two ""shadow fleet"" tankers with drones in the Black Sea, an official from Kyiv's SBU security service said on Saturday.

The two tankers, the Virat and the Kairos, were rocked by explosions near Turkey's coastline late on Friday, according to the Turkish transport ministry. One of the fleet was struck again early Saturday, the ministry said.

""Modernized Sea Baby naval drones successfully targeted the vessels,"" a source in Ukraine's SBU security service told the news agency AFP.

Separately, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) announced that it had halted operations due to significant damage to a mooring at its Black Sea terminal near the port of Novorossiysk, which was caused by a Ukrainian naval drone attack. The CPC handles over one percent of the world's oil supply.

The Ukrainian military said on Saturday it had hit Russia's Afipsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region overnight, as well as the Beriev military aviation plant in Rostov region.

In a statement on social media, the military said it had reported explosions and a blaze at the refinery.

The strike targeted a key logistics hub, situated some 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the front line, that supplies diesel fuel and aviation kerosene to Russian forces fighting in Ukraine.

A team of Ukrainian negotiators on Saturday headed to the United States for talks on Washington's proposal to end the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

""Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine and head of the Ukrainian delegation Rustem Umerov, together with the team, is already on the way to the United States,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on X.

""Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,"" Zelenskyy continued. ""Ukraine continues to work with the United States in the most constructive way possible, and we expect that the results of the meetings in Geneva will now be hammered out in the United States.""

Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has added the non-governmental organization (NGO) Human Rights Watch (HRW) to its growing list of ""undesirable organizations."" 

The designation means that HRW must immediately cease all activity in Russia as well as making it illegal for persons or organizations inside Russia to work with it. 

""For over three decades, Human Rights Watch's work on post-Soviet Russia has pressed the government to uphold human rights and freedoms,"" said Human Rights Watch Executive Director Philippe Bolopion in a statement. ""Our work hasn't changed, but what's changed, dramatically, is the government's full-throttled embrace of dictatorial policies, its staggering rise in repression, and the scope of the war crimes its forces are committing in Ukraine.""

Repressive prior to its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, the Kremlin has only intensified its assault on critics since February 2022.

Friday's move came on the same day that a case against the feminist punk band Pussy Riot began on ""extremism"" grounds and a day after the late Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation was labeled a ""terrorist organization."" 

Russia has designated more than 270 entities — including major independent news organizations and rights groups — ""undesirable."" 

HRW has been an outspoken critic of Russia's war and documented what it says are war crimes. Recently, it published an investigation into Russian troops terrorizing and killing individual civilians with drones. 

In yet another massive overnight assault, Russian forces targeted civilians in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with a deadly missile and drone attack that damaged buildings and sparked fires across the city. 

The projectiles slammed residential apartment complexes, killing three people and injuring two dozen more, according to Ukrainian officials.

One of the injured was a child. 

The full extent of damage is not yet clear, but the attack targeted several residential neighborhoods. 

This is the second time in days that Kyiv has been targeted. 

Earlier this week, seven people were killed in attacks involving ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons and drones, in what was described by Ukraine's Energy Ministry as a ""massive combined attack"" on the country's energy infrastructure.

Foreign Minister Sybiha's post excoriated Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal pursuit of his illegal war, as well as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent overtures to him. A Putin apologist, Orban traveled to the Kremlin this week with promises to purchase more Russian oil and to offer his services as a peace mediator.

Thank you for joining us as we bring you the latest news from Russia's war on Ukraine.

The Ukrainian capital Kyiv was once again targeted by Russian missiles and drones overnight with the country's foreign minister reporting that two civilians were killed and dozens more injured in residential areas across the city.

The Kremlin also took another step to muzzle critics of its invasion of Ukraine and abuses at home, adding the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) to its growing list of ""undesirable organizations."" The designation makes it illegal for anyone in the country to work with the investigative outfit.

Four people have been killed and ten wounded in a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California.

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said a total of 14 people were shot, four of whom were confirmed dead, just before 6pm local time in Stockton, which sits approximately 80 miles east of San Francisco.

The shooting took place at a banquet hall where a family had gathered to celebrate, local media reported.

A spokesman for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said early indications suggest the incident was targeted and that some of the victims were children.

The suspected shooter is still at large, police told local media.

Christina Fugazi, the mayor of Stockton, said “heaven is a little bigger” as she paid tribute to the victims of the deadly shooting.

“This is Thanksgiving weekend. This is when families come together to celebrate, share memories, give each other love. Unfortunately tonight, heaven is a little bigger with the children and adults who did not make it,” Ms Fugazi said during a press conference on Saturday night.

“What happened tonight, again, unacceptable. Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.”

Ms Fugazi said she had spoken on the phone with Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, and that he had offered additional support to city officials and law enforcement.

Mr Newsom's office said he had been briefed on the “horrific” shooting and was monitoring the situation.

Jason Lee, the vice mayor of Stockton, said the outbreak of violence “shakes me deeply”, in a statement released after the incident.

“Violence touched my life as a young person, and seeing our own children, parents and neighbours go through this shakes me deeply. Stockton is my home. These are our families. This is our community,” Mr Lee said.

Josh Harder, the Democratic congressman for Stockton, said he was “devastated” by news of the shooting and was “praying for the victims and their families”.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

A combination of economic pain and cultural grievance has given rise, in Stewart's analysis, to a loosely organized but generously funded political movement that would propel Trump back to the White House in 2024.

 by Nick Troiano

Troiano compellingly argues, based in part on his personal experience running for Congress, that the single biggest problem afflicting the U.S. political system is partisan primaries—that is, primaries open only to voters registered with one of the two major parties.

            • Ukraine talks: Top Trump administration officials are meeting now with a delegation from Kyiv in Florida. Key sticking points remain despite a mounting US effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with a team from Washington expected to visit Moscow later this week.
    


            • Military buildup: President Donald Trump is also maintaining his pressure campaign against Venezuela, which the administration says is aimed at cutting off the flow of drugs from South America. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have expressed alarm about Trump's use of the military in the region as he threatens potential land strikes in Venezuela.
    


            • Immigration crackdown: Trump is doubling down on aggressive anti-immigration policies after last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC. An Afghan national is suspected of carrying out the attack.
    


            Republican Rep. Don Bacon says modifications to the US-proposed plan for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appear to have made it more mindful of Kyiv's interests than the original draft.
    


            “I do think that agreement has shifted a little more back toward the middle,” Bacon said today on ABC's “This Week.”
    


                    “But I would like to see the president be a stronger advocate for the free country, the sovereign country of Ukraine that wants to be a democracy, wants to be allied with us, and have a little more clear idea of who Putin is — that Putin is the invader. He's the dictator.”
                





            Bacon, who has consistently advocated for Ukraine, maintained that he is not seeing “moral clarity coming out of the White House” at the moment.
    


            The Nebraska congressman previously told Axios that the original draft of the plan — which was widely viewed as favorable to Moscow — made him seriously consider resignation.
    


            The comments come as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner hold talks with Ukrainian officials in the Miami area.
    


            While a delegation from Kyiv meets with Trump administration officials in Florida, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been checking in with other allies today, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
    


                    “These are important days, and much can change,” Zelensky said in a social media post about his call with Rutte. “We are coordinating closely, and in our efforts – and in the efforts of all our partners – it is our joint measures and shared positions that will be extremely effective.”
                





            The Ukrainian leader also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen today.
    


            “We have a shared understanding of the key issues. It also matters that Ursula is paying close attention to the need to strengthen our resilience amid Russia's constant strikes on our infrastructure and the energy sector,” Zelensky said.
    


            Moscow launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight Friday into Saturday, killing at least three people and leaving large parts of Kyiv without power, according to Zelensky.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine thinks more senators will join his attempts to limit President Donald Trump's war powers in Central and South America if the president follows through on his threat of military action against Venezuela.
    


            “I do believe the numbers will change,” Kaine said of his resolution with Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and GOP Sen. Rand Paul to block the potential use of US Armed Forces in the South American country without congressional approval.
    


            Kaine said he would force another vote on the legislation “immediately” should there be US military action in Venezuela.
    


            The Virginia Democrat also led a resolution to rein in strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. He said “the circumstances have changed” in terms of gathering support for that motion, citing a report that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on one of the vessels earlier this year after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


What the administration is saying: Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the Trump administration's escalating military and intelligence campaign in the region today, saying in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the US won't temper its fight against “narco-terrorists.”
    


            Asked about a reported classified memo that outlines expanded authorities for operations inside Venezuela, Bondi declined to elaborate.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended President Donald Trump's threat to “permanently pause” migration from some countries to the US, saying the administration's approach is rooted in concerns about national security and vetting failures.
    


            “These Third World countries don't have stable governments,” Noem said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            “Third World countries,” a term used by some to refer to developing nations, has repeatedly been used by Trump as part of his anti-immigration rhetoric.
    


Some background: Trump said in a social media post Thursday that his administration will work to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.”
    


            The post came after the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC. The shooting suspect is an Afghan national who came to the country after working with the CIA in the Middle East.
    


            It wasn't immediately clear which specific countries Trump was referring to.
    


            Asked for details, US Citizenship and Immigration Services pointed CNN to 19 countries “of concern” listed in a June presidential proclamation, including Afghanistan.
    


            While the DC shooting suspect came to the US in 2021 under a relocation program launched by the Biden administration, he was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration, law enforcement officials tell CNN.
    


More from Noem: The DHS secretary argued on NBC that instability in developing nations — and what she described as the inability of those countries to aid in vetting migrants — has created unacceptable risks.
    


            Noem said the Trump administration is also reviewing asylum cases and will deport people with pending claims if it's necessary.

            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has kicked off another round of high-level talks with Ukrainian officials today aimed not only at ending the war, but “creating a pathway forward that leaves Ukraine sovereign, independent, and prosperous,” he told reporters.
    


            The top US diplomat, speaking at the start of the meeting outside of Miami, Florida, said the two delegations would be building from progress already made.
    


                    “The end goal is obviously not just the end of the war, obviously, that's central and fundamental,” said Rubio, who was flanked by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
                





            “This is about ending a war in a way that creates a mechanism and a way forward that will allow (Ukraine) to be independent and sovereign, never have another war again, and create tremendous prosperity for its people, not just rebuild the country, but enter an era of extraordinary economic progress in the country,” Rubio said, noting the country has “tremendous economic potential.”
    


            Top Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov told reporters there had been “great progress” and thanked the US negotiating team.
    


                    “We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine. And we are thankful for the efforts of United States and its team to helping us,” Umerov said.
                





For context: The meeting is the second round of high-level talks between the Ukrainian and US delegations in as many weeks. It is the first since Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead Ukrainian negotiator, resigned.
    


            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar rebuked President Donald Trump for a Truth Social post on Thanksgiving that accused Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of entering the United States illegally and mocked her hijab.
    


            Trump's post also referred to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz using a slur that demeans people with disabilities.
    


            “These words shouldn't even be repeated by anyone, much less a president of the United States,” Klobuchar told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            For his part, Walz called attacks by Trump a “badge of honor” this morning in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press,” though he said that as a former educator, he worries about the impact of the president's language on kids.
    


            “We have fought three decades to get this out of our schools. Kids know better than to use it,” Walz said, referring to the slur. “But look, this is what Donald Trump has done. He's normalized this type of hateful behavior and this type of language.”
    


This post has been updated to reflect Walz's remarks.



            The suspect accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House was “radicalized” after arriving in the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today.
    


            Asked about the probe into the suspected shooter on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Noem said investigators are still going through information, adding, “I will say we believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country.”
    


            The suspect, who was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national. Noem said investigators believe he was radicalized within his local community in Bellingham, Washington, though she did not provide any details on what that may have entailed.
    


                    “We do believe it was in his home community and state,” Noem said. “And we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members, to talk to them.”
                





            When pressed on if there was a vetting process in place to approve the asylum request during the Trump administration, Noem said: “the vetting process all happened under Joe Biden's administration.”
    


More on the suspect: According to officials, Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 under a relocation program launched by the Biden administration following the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
    


            He was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration after applying in 2024, multiple law enforcement officials have told CNN.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called President Donald Trump's warning that “seditious” activity is punishable by death — prompted by a video the senator participated in urging service members not to follow illegal orders — “obviously ridiculous.”
    


            Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds published the video reminding members of the military of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting the furious response from Trump and a military review by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
    


            Hegseth should be fired, Kelly told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” this morning.
    


                    “What he is doing is sending a very chilling message across our entire nation, not only in the military, but the civilian workforce,” the Arizona senator said. “Who's going to speak up and say anything if they see something that's unlawful or see something — waste, fraud and abuse.”
                





            Asked by Bash if he has been contacted by the FBI, which has also launched a probe, Kelly said he's received communication that amounts more to “intimidation,” with a request to come in for an interview but no point of contact.
    


            “I'm not backing down. These guys don't scare me. They're not serious people,” he said of Trump and Hegseth.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly says he would not have carried out a reported follow-up strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean had he been given the order.
    


            “It seems to,” Kelly, who served in the Navy for 25 years, told CNN's Dana Bash this morning when asked if that second strike constitutes a war crime.
    


                    “If what has been reported is accurate, I've got serious concerns about anybody in that, you know, chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said on “State of the Union.”
                





            CNN has reported that the US military carried out a second strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


            Pressed on if he would have carried out the order to execute a second strike, Kelly responded, “No, no,” adding, “and I'm a guy who — I have sunk two ships.”
    


More context: Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers published a video recently reminding service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders, prompting a furious response from President Donald Trump and an FBI investigation.
    


            The second strike reporting also comes as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Trump has made the regime in Caracas central to his case for the boat strikes and potential other military action in the Caribbean, saying it's all part of an effort to curb the flow of migrants and drugs from South America to the US.
    


            While President Donald Trump's team has heralded “tremendous progress” toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of the negotiations told CNN last week that substantial gaps remain even between the delegations from Washington and Kyiv.
    


            There are at least three crucial areas where significant differences remain, the source said, including the sensitive issue of whether Ukraine would surrender key territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, annexed but not yet conquered by Russia.
    


            Differences also remain over the controversial US proposal for Ukraine to limit the size of its military to 600,000, as outlined in the original draft of Trump's 28-point plan.
    


            That plan also called for Ukraine to renounce its ambition to become a member of NATO, a longtime Kremlin demand that the source told CNN remains unacceptable to the Ukrainian side.
    


Meanwhile, in Moscow: Those three issues — the surrender of annexed territory, the demilitarization of Ukraine and its permanent exclusion from NATO — are Russian President Vladimir Putin's most-cited reasons for waging the war in the first place.
    


            Putin has shown little signal he's ready to offer concessions on those fronts, saying the war will only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.”
    


            That leaves glaring sticking points when a US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Putin later this week, regardless of what happens during today's meetings between the US and Ukraine in Florida.
    


            President Donald Trump will return to the White House later today after spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
    


            His arrival at the White House, along with first lady Melania Trump, is expected around 5:50 p.m. ET.
    


            There have been no shortage of developments on the politics front, however. Here's what else we've been reporting over the weekend:
    


            Top officials in President Donald Trump's administration will meet with a Ukrainian delegation in the Miami area today, a White House official told CNN.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will participate in the talks, the official said.
    


            The Ukrainian side will be led by Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, who Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed following the resignation of his top aide on Friday.
    


How we got here: Today's meetings mark the latest step in a flurry of diplomacy that kicked off this month after a plan put forward by Trump triggered alarm in Kyiv, as the original draft heavily favored Russia.
    


            Ukraine is hoping to build on developments from subsequent meetings in Geneva, where Kyiv and its European allies put forward a counter-proposal. Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation involved in the talks voiced a more upbeat assessment following the Geneva meetings, and Rubio indicated the draft was a “living, breathing document” that was evolving based on their input.
    


Keep in mind: There's no indication yet of Russia's openness to the terms being discussed by the allies.
    


            A US team is expected to visit Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week.
    


Meanwhile: The talks come after Ukraine said its underwater drones struck two tankers belonging to Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Friday and Saturday. Both tankers sustained critical damage, said a Ukrainian security source, adding that “this will deal a significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.”
    


            Russia launched its largest barrage of drones and missiles in a month across Ukraine, killing at least three people overnight Friday into Saturday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Large parts of the Ukrainian capital were without power yesterday.
    


            Another key storyline we're monitoring for today's coverage involves the Trump administration's military buildup in the Caribbean.
    


            President Donald Trump is keeping up a pressure campaign on Venezuela, days after implying US land strikes on the country could be imminent. He issued a broad directive on social media yesterday, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.
    


                    “Please consider the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela to be closed in its entirety,” he wrote in a Truth Social post.
                





The big picture: This is the latest turn of the wheel in the administration's efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro out of office. Officially, Trump says he is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts.
    


            Venezuela's foreign minister denounced Trump's airspace message, calling it a “colonialist threat” constituting an “extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.”
    


            Trump previously said he's signed off on plans for the CIA to operate inside the South American nation. And the US president designated Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization, a move administration officials argue will give the US expanded military options.
    


Some key context on Trump's latest comment: The US can't close another country's airspace.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration did issue a warning last week to major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for South American flights.
    


            In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week, President Donald Trump has argued he has a mandate to toughen immigration enforcement even further.
    


            The suspect in the attack is an Afghan national who came to the US in 2021 after working with the CIA in the Middle East.
    


Before the shooting: Trump made vows to deport tens of millions of people central to his reelection platform.
    


            Since taking office, he's overseen removal flights, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in major US cities, and an executive order suspending the refugee program, though some in the administration have been frustrated over lagging immigration arrests.
    


In the hours following the shooting: An emboldened Trump painted a picture of a country with millions of “unvetted” migrants. Trump vowed a crackdown to expel them and “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”



In a few days since, we've seen the following:



            • All asylum decisions halted: The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a halt on asylum application decisions, saying it's to ensure that migrants are vetted and screened “to the maximum degree possible.”
    


            • Visas paused: The State Department says it has paused the issuance of visas for travelers with Afghan passports.
    


            • Green cards under review: The US immigration service also announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern,” including Afghanistan.
    


Keep in mind: While Trump makes the case for more stringent checks and limitations on people entering the US, sources tell CNN that the suspect in the National Guard shooting cleared numerous rounds of vetting, including earlier this year when he was approved for permanent asylum in the US by the Trump administration.

            Pope Leo XIV touched down in Lebanon's capital Beirut on Sunday with the hope of being a “messenger of peace” as he began a three-day visit to the nation at the heart of a Middle East battered by recent conflicts, just days after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut.
    


            Standing below a message that read “Blessed Are The Peacemakers” at the presidential palace in Baabda, Leo urged people to remain in Lebanon amid an “exodus of young people and families seeking a future elsewhere” due to “uncertainty, violence, poverty and many other threats.”
    


            “We must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable,” he said in his address to the country's authorities and civil society.
    


            Peace knows “no fear in the face of apparent defeat” and is not “daunted by disappointment,” Leo said. “It takes tenacity to build peace. It takes perseverance to protect and nurture life.”
    


            Leo's visit will offer support to Lebanon's sizeable Christian minority, which has ancient roots in the country. The pontiff is due to meet political leaders and young people, take part in an inter-religious gathering and celebrate mass on the Beirut waterfront as part of the second leg of his first foreign trip since his election in May.
    


            Large crowds, some holding Lebanese and Vatican flags, lined the streets to welcome the first American pontiff to the presidential palace. More spectators gathered inside palace grounds in the hopes of spotting the pope, donning plastic raincoats under a gray sky.
    


            Leo's calls for dialogue and unity come at a time of heightened tensions in the region and days after the Israeli strike last week on southern Beirut.
    


            The strike, which targeted Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai, killed five people and injured 28, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.
    


            Moments before arriving in Beirut, Leo told reporters aboard the papal plane that he had come to Lebanon and Turkey – the first port of call on his international trip – as a “messenger” to “promote peace throughout the region.”
    


            He also reiterated the Holy See's support for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, saying it is the only way to offer a “solution to the conflict they continually live.”
    


            “We seek with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help to draw close to a solution with justice for all,” Leo said in the first in-flight press conference of his papacy.
    


            One stop on Leo's tour will be the Monastery of Mar Maroun, or Saint Maroun, in the town of Annaya, high in the Lebanese mountains. There, he is expected to pray at the tomb of Charbel Makhlouf, a monk known for bringing people of different faiths together.
    


            Lebanon has 18 officially recognized faiths and sects – including 12 Christian communities – with Shia Muslims now Lebanon's single largest sect. Leo is due to have private meetings with Christian leaders, as well as with Muslim and Druze leaders.
    


            On Tuesday, the final day of his visit, Leo will pray at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which left more than 200 people dead and injured at least 6,000 others. He will then depart for Italy's capital Rome.
    


            Earlier this week, while condemning the use of religion for justifying “war,” Leo urged Catholics to mobilize their faith and unify others “regardless of ethnicity, nationality, religion or personal perspectives.”
    


            “We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism,” Leo reflected.
    


            Leo's trip comes at a tense time, one year after an uneasy truce was established between Israel and Hezbollah through US mediation.
    


            The Vatican has long been engaged in diplomacy in the Middle East, and in 2021 the late Pope Francis hosted Lebanese Christian leaders in the Vatican to address the country's political crisis. The last papal visit to Lebanon took place in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How life changed in a rural town that lost its clinic after Trump's megabill","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-rural-healthcare","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 12:01:00 GMT","


            As the final hues of autumn linger in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the 200-person community of Churchville, Virginia, is grappling with the loss of its health clinic.



            Gone are the days of seniors walking down the road from their house to see the town doctor. 



            Augusta Medical Group cited the health care provisions in President Donald Trump's signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for closing the rural clinics in Churchville and two other locations.
    


            “I've called around trying to find a replacement, a new doctor, and for just a well-being appointment, the soonest is the end of January,” said Teresa Leach, 56, in an interview while sipping her coffee at the MTN. Mystic shop just a few feet from the shuttered clinic. Leach, who has asthma, said she voted for Trump last year.
    


            Democrats are hoping to make health care a defining issue nationally in next year's midterms. But the environment in Churchville illustrates the challenges the party faces, particularly in rural communities.
    


            Trump carried Augusta County, which includes Churchville, by nearly 50 points in 2024. Jena Crisler, a physician, ran to represent the area in the Virginia House of Delegates and lost this month to the Republican incumbent by more than 40 points even in a Democratic statewide sweep.
    


            A woman sitting in the same coffee shop whispered under her breath that she supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. It takes her over an hour to visit her doctors in Charlottesville. Rural health care is always precarious, she says, and the clinic closure was especially a blow for her husband.
    


            But she said she wouldn't put up a sign for a Democrat “because of the environment,” and she declined to be named by CNN.
    


            Across the street from the coffee shop, a sign in the window of a storefront reads, “Thank you, Trump, Save America Again.”
    


            Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, primarily by instituting work requirements and more eligibility checks.
    


Here's how Trump's megabill will affect you



            Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural Ground Game, a group focused on driving up Democratic participation in rural areas, says Democrats will continue highlighting the significance of accessible health care through town hall-style events and canvassing, trying to win back credibility and trust in rural America.
    


            “I think people have an interest in having real conversations about what's going on with their lives, and there's really nothing that can replace that person to person at your doorstep conversation,” Thorne said.
    


            Crisler knew she faced long odds when she took on incumbent Delegate Chris Runion in the state's 35th district. She suggests her race was less about the outcome and more about the need for Democrats to show up everywhere instead of simply surrendering communities where they're outnumbered.
    


            “I think they are very concerned, and they're going to be even more when it starts hitting them personally,” said Crisler of the clinic closures.
    


            A spokesperson for Runion said he was not available for comment.
    


            CNN has reached out to US Rep. Ben Cline, a Republican who represents the area in Washington and voted for the Trump policy bill. His office did not respond.
    


            Pediatrician Mark Downey defeated incumbent Republican Chad Green in the state's 69th district, which includes Newport News, York, James City and Gloucester counties. In an interview with CNN, he said it's important Democrats continue to run on health care even if the message does not immediately resonate with voters.
    


            “It may not happen overnight. People's minds don't change right away, but when they start seeing loss of access, loss of services, eventually there's going to be a situation where it's not going to be as convenient for them or more of a hardship for them,” said Downey, who had made two previous unsuccessful tries for the state legislature.
    


            Irene Holmes, 59, moved to Churchville three years ago. When her son died, she and her husband wanted a change of scenery from New York. Beset with a host of medical challenges from liver issues to high blood pressure, she relied on and valued the town clinic.
    


            “I'm a mixed bag of tricks, a lot of medical issues,” she said.
    


            On politics, she tends to “keep her mouth shut” to avoid getting into it with her neighbors. But when asked if Trump was to blame for the clinic closure, Holmes said, “Absolutely.”
    


            “What he's done is destroying rural areas,” said Holmes.
    


            Dale White, a Churchville resident and church administrator, says the concerns about the clinic are overblown.
    


            “These are old-time rural farming folks, and they've been going to get medical care in Staunton and Fishersville, Waynesboro and Charlottesville since they can remember,” said White.
    


            Back at the MTN. Mystic coffeehouse, shop owner Dane Buse suggests now is the time for rural communities to get creative.
    


            “To lose the clinic is the same as losing a grocery store or a local provider,” Buse said.
    


            He suggested the community could band together to find a doctor to make house calls.
    


            “Maybe that would fit the bill for us,” Buse said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","SNAP benefits are flowing again, but many enrollees will soon hit another hurdle","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/snap-benefits-work-requirements-changes","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:00:59 GMT","


            Food stamp recipients are now receiving their November benefits, but a growing swath of enrollees may soon lose their vital food assistance completely.
    


            At the same time as the government shutdown disrupted the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, states began implementing an expansion of the program's work requirements as mandated in the Republicans' “big, beautiful bill,” which was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer.
    


            Under the GOP package, more food stamp enrollees will have to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month or they will only be able to receive benefits for three months out of every three years.
    


            The expanded work requirements will result in 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps benefits in an average month over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. This includes 300,000 families with children.
    


            Recipients who don't meet the requirement will likely start losing their benefits in March, but the timing will depend on where they live and when they must recertify their eligibility for food stamps.
    


            Republicans have long wanted to beef up SNAP's existing work requirement, which used to apply to beneficiaries ages 18 to 49 who did not have disabilities or dependent children. The GOP increased the age threshold to 54 as part of the 2023 debt ceiling agreement.
    


            The GOP spending bill further broadened the work requirement to include recipients through age 64 and parents of children ages 14 through 17. Veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth are now also subject to the mandate.
    


            Plus, the legislation made it harder for states to seek waivers during poor economic conditions. Previously, states could obtain waivers in areas they identify as having a lack of sufficient jobs. Now, only areas with unemployment rates over 10% qualify.
    


            A federal judge in Rhode Island has temporarily barred the US Department of Agriculture from terminating existing waivers before their expiration dates, but the agency has yet to release guidance on the decision, said Chloe Green, assistant director of policy at the American Public Human Services Association.
    


            Asked about the case, the USDA said it is approving waivers “within its statutory authority under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, on an individual basis.”
    


            Overall, roughly double the number of SNAP recipients will be subject to the mandate, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
    


            The rollout of the expanded work requirements, however, has been chaotic, which was exacerbated by the record-long government shutdown, states officials and experts say.
    


            “There is both a tremendous amount of confusion and, strangely, a wide array of differences across states and how they are implementing it,” Bauer said.
    


            The SNAP work requirement provisions were among the few GOP agenda bill measures that did not have a set implementation date. In the fall, the US Department of Agriculture published guidance that said the new rules took effect on July 4, when the bill was signed into law, but effectively gave states until November 1 to stand up their programs.
    


            Then, earlier this month, the USDA said that states should not count November when calculating whether enrollees are meeting their work requirements because of the shutdown-spurred benefit disruptions.
    


            Most states set November 1 as their implementation date, though some started earlier, Green said. But other states say their systems may not be ready to track the expanded requirement until the spring, even though that could put them at risk for being penalized by the USDA.
    


            “One worry we have is that when you make systems changes this fast, there's a risk for unintended impacts somewhere else in the system,” she said, noting that such updates usually take 12 to 18 months to do properly.
    


            States are particularly sensitive to making payment mistakes now because another provision of the Republican agenda bill requires that they shoulder a larger share of the program's administrative costs if they have high error rates.
    


            Beneficiaries who may be newly subject to the work requirements need to be notified and screened to make sure they don't qualify for other exemptions, such as having physical or mental limitations.
    


            “A lot of people who are calling in are worried that now they're being assigned work requirements without them even knowing,” Green said. “That should not happen.”
    


            Many states are starting the three-month clock when residents first apply for food stamps or when they file their recertification forms, which generally happens every six to 12 months depending on the state and entails an interview. But some states are checking all their enrollees at once, without waiting for their recertification dates.
    


            Connecticut has found it “very challenging” to implement the expanded work requirements, said Dan Giacomi, director of program oversight and grants administration at the state's Department of Social Services. An estimated 36,000 residents — or 10% of the state's SNAP enrollees — could be at risk of losing their benefits in coming months because of the law's changes.
    


            “You can't just flip a switch in your eligibility system and have it do all of these new categories or new processes you have,” he said.
    


            To ensure it is complying with the Republican agenda bill the state has had to implement temporary workarounds — which involve case workers manually inputting whether recipients are newly subject to the requirement — while it races to update its technology. Giacomi is also concerned about these cases being integrated properly into the system once it is updated, as well as any payment errors that may result in penalties for the state.
    


            Another reason for the delay is that the state had to wait for guidance from the USDA so staffers knew how to handle all scenarios, he said. Though it still has several outstanding questions, it has enough information to get started.
    


            States often want to wait for clear USDA guidance so they don't take steps that the agency might later say don't comply with the regulations, said Ed Bolen, director of state SNAP strategies for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
    


            In Pennsylvania, the timetable began even earlier because its economic waivers, which covered many counties and localities, expired in September. The commonwealth took “substantial steps” to connect with all the SNAP recipients in these areas to determine if they could qualify for another exemption from the work requirements, Hoa Pham, a deputy secretary in the Department of Human Services, said. If they don't qualify, they could start losing their benefits as soon as January 1 unless they meet the work mandate.
    


            Pennsylvania has several ways of verifying recipients' income, including state and federal data and a pilot program in which enrollees allow a third-party platform to pull and report their payroll information. But these sources don't necessarily cover all the work that recipients perform so they may also have to submit pay stubs.
    


            Prior to the GOP agenda bill, fewer than 25,000 of Pennsylvania's roughly 1 million SNAP enrollees were subject to the work requirement rules that applied to those ages 18 to 54. The legislation expanded that number to just under 248,000 people.
    


            The department projects that a total of 144,000 recipients could lose their benefits over the next year when they renew their eligibility.
    


            States are also racing to inform SNAP beneficiaries who may now be subject to the work requirements to make sure they meet the mandate or file for exemptions.
    


            Connecticut is sending text messages, mailing notices and meeting with community groups. It has also set up an online questionnaire that will direct those potentially affected to the next steps they have to take. Pennsylvania has launched a website — with a video and a screener — to explain the changes to residents.
    


            Still, Pham is worried that some people who would continue to qualify could lose their benefits because of the paperwork.
    


            “It is all too easy for someone to miss an action step, and for that reason alone, that opens up the risk for people to lose their SNAP eligibility — for just missing an administrative process, and not because they are not otherwise eligible,” she said.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — English phrases once bothered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro so much that he urged his State of the Union address audience to phase out words like skatepark and fashion. 

But as the White House now ponders whether the U.S. military should strike Venezuela, Maduro is embracing English, singing John Lennon's Imagine, advocating for peace and dancing to a remix of his latest English catchphrase, “No War, Yes Peace.” 

While his turnaround is seen as a sign of desperation by supporters of Venezuela's political opposition, whose leaders have repeatedly told their backers in Washington that the threat of military action would crack Maduro's inner circle, months of pressure have yet to produce defections or a government transition. 

Behind this knack for staying in power is a system that punishes disloyal associates harshly and allows loyal ministers, justices, military leaders and other officials to enrich themselves.

“The Bolivarian Revolution possesses a remarkable ability: the capacity for cohesion in the face of external pressure,” Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuela Observatory in Colombia's Universidad del Rosario, said referring to the political movement, also known as Chavismo, that Maduro inherited from the late President Hugo Chávez. “When pressure comes from abroad, they manage to unite, defend and protect themselves.”

Underpinning the loyalty-or-punishment principle are corruption networks blessed by Chávez and Maduro that give the loyal permission to get richer. The policy has vexed previous efforts to unseat Maduro and has helped him and his close associates to skirt economic sanctions, obtain U.S. presidential pardons and claim an electoral victory they resoundingly lost.




Rodríguez explained that prison and torture can be part of the punishment, which is usually harsher for accused wrongdoers with military affiliation. The strategy has been crucial for an authoritarian Maduro to keep control of the military, which he lets traffic drugs, oil, wildlife and myriad goods in exchange for coup-proof barracks.

“This has been a very effective tool because Chavismo has always been able to eliminate those actors who at some point try to rise up, and it has been able to expose corrupt practices from all sorts of actors,” Rodríguez said.

Venezuela's political opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, had banked on the military's support to dislodge Maduro after credible evidence showed that he lost the 2024 presidential election. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López and other military leaders stood by Maduro, just like they did in 2019 during a barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized at the time by the first Trump administration as Venezuela's rightful leader.

Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has increased the pressure on Maduro and his allies, including by doubling to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest on narcoterrorism charges. A 2020 indictment accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. State Department on Monday designated as a foreign terrorist organization. 

Maduro denies the accusations. 

On Saturday, Trump said that the airspace “above and surrounding” the South American country should be considered as “closed in its entirety.” Maduro's government responded by accusing Trump of making a ”colonial threat,” rallying supporters behind what it called an assault on national sovereignty.

In early September, the U.S. military began blowing up boats that the Trump administration has accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people. 

Many, including Maduro himself, see the U.S. military moves as an effort to end Chavismo's hold on power. The opposition only added to this perception by reigniting its promise to remove Maduro from office.

Two weeks after the first boat strike, Chavismo's loyalty was tested directly when Maduro's pilot rebuffed efforts from the U.S. to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into custody to face the charges.

“We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Bitner Villegas, a member of the elite presidential honor guard, wrote to a retired U.S. officer trying to recruit him. “The last thing we are is traitors.” 

On Tuesday, ruling party supporters marched in Caracas to demonstrate what they described as the “anti-imperialist spirit” of Chavismo. The march ended in a ceremony in which Maduro raised a jeweled sword that belonged to South American independence hero Simón Bolívar and guided attendees, including Cabinet ministers, to swear in God's name to defend peace and freedom.

Susan Shirk, a research professor at the University of California, San Diego, said authoritarian leaders have a “fetish for unity” and like public displays of loyalty to prevent splits among leadership and social upheaval. She explained that division can lead people to believe that the risk of protesting has lessened. 

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the designation of Cartel de los Soles provides Trump with additional options for dealing with Maduro. Hegseth hasn't provided details on those options, but administration officials have signaled that they have trouble seeing a situation in which Maduro is still in power as an acceptable endgame.

David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for more than three decades, said that only people who don't understand Chavismo would think that a show of force will cause a government change.

“This is exactly the type of thing that unifies them,” Smilde said of the deployment of U.S. military forces. “They also talk about the $50 million reward, but what military officer in their right mind would trust the U.S. government? And more broadly, if the whole premise of the operation is that the Venezuelan armed forces are a drug cartel, what motivation could they possibly have to turn on Maduro and participate in regime change?”

Maduro's entire presidency has been marked by a political, social and economic crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than 7.7 million people to migrate. The crisis has also caused support for the ruling party to plummet across the country.

With loyalty keeping his inner circle intact despite mounting U.S. pressure, Maduro has also sought to maintain his diminished base through the long-established practices that include organizing marches in the capital.

Zenaida Quintero, a school porter, has seen the country come undone under Maduro's watch, with vivid memories of the severe food shortages that Venezuelans experienced in the late 2010s. Her support for Maduro, however, hasn't wavered, and her commitment comes down to one fact: He was handpicked by Chávez to lead the Bolivarian Revolution.

Quintero, 60, said that Maduro, like Chávez, won't abandon his supporters.

“I trust him,” Quintero said of Maduro. “We have to remain united. We have to defend ourselves.”

Netanyahu comments on request for pardon during his ongoing corruption trial

TEL AVIV (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Netanyahu, who has been at war against Israel's legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous change in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from opponents, who said a pardon would weaken democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he's above the rule of law.

Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President, the prime minister's office said in a statement. The president's office called it an “extraordinary request,” carrying with it “significant implications.”

Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He hasn't been convicted of anything.

Netanyahu rejects the allegations and has described the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.




His request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Trump also sent a letter to President Isaac Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Herzog is a former political rival of Netanyahu, but the men have a good working relationship. Later Sunday, Israeli media reported a small protest outside Herzog's home, including a pile of bananas with a sign saying a pardon equals a banana republic.

In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead.

“The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,” he said.

Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year. But the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents: a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the Justice Ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the legal adviser at the president's office, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.

Legal experts say the pardon request isn't able to stop the trial.

“It's impossible,” said Emi Palmor, former director-general of the Justice Ministry.

“You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,” she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said.

In rare cases, the system could pardon Netanyahu. Experts say the president has broad discretion to grant one, and oversight is limited.

However, “as a rule, the president reviews a pardon request only after all legal proceedings have ended. The possibility of a preconviction pardon ... is extremely rare,” the Israel Democracy Institute wrote earlier this month. “A pardon before conviction, while legal proceedings are ongoing, threatens the rule of law and seriously undermines the principle of equality before the law.”

In 2008, as opposition leader, Netanyahu called on then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down as he faced a growing corruption scandal. At the time, Netanyahu said that a prime minister “up to his neck” in scandal did not have a mandate to lead the country, and there was a risk that Olmert would make decisions that served his personal interests and not those of the nation. 

Olmert resigned even before he was indicted that year and would later serve 16 months in prison.

Netanyahu has struck a different, defiant tone since his own legal problems began. He has portrayed himself as the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy trying to oust him from office.

Shortly after forming his current government in late 2022, Netanyahu launched a plan to overhaul Israel's justice system.

Netanyahu presented the plan as a much-needed reform. But his opponents accused him of trying to weaken the justice system, damaging the country's system of checks and balances and having a conflict of interest at a time when he was on trial.

The plan triggered large street protests against the government, and critics have said the deep divisions sent a message of weakness to Israel's enemies that encouraged Hamas to launch its 2023 attacks.

Netanyahu's request also sparked backlash on Sunday, with an immediate response from the opposition and advocacy groups urging the president not to give in to his request.

“You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel said that granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offenses of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law.

But some Israelis expressed support for Netanyahu's request. 

“Bibi Netanyahu did totally the right thing requesting the pardon,” said Lior Gal, a Jerusalem resident, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “He deserves to be pardoned. This chapter should be over and to remain united people and carry on.”

ISTANBUL (AP) — The Turkish government has condemned Ukrainian drone attacks on two Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers in the Black Sea.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Oncu Keceli said the attacks on the Kairos and Virat vessels happened inside Turkey's exclusive economic zone and “have posed serious risks to navigation, life, property and environmental safety in the region.”

In a social media post late Saturday, Keceli added that Turkey is carrying out talks with “the relevant parties” to prevent the spread of the war in Ukraine across the Black Sea and to protect Turkey's economic interests.

Ukraine has said it used naval drones to hit the tankers in quick succession off Turkey's Black Sea coast late Friday afternoon. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe.

The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have previously largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea.

U.S. Border Patrol agents look on, Monday, Nov. 17, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Matt Kelley)




NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are expected to launch a monthslong immigration crackdown on Monday in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi dubbed “Swamp Sweep.” 

The deployment, which aims to arrest 5,000 people, is centered in liberal New Orleans and is the latest federal immigration enforcement operation to target a Democratic-run city as President Donald Trump's administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign.

Many in the greater New Orleans area, particularly in Latino communities, have been on edge since the planned operations were reported earlier this month, even as Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

Here's what to know about “Swamp Sweep.”

Bovino has become the Trump administration's go-to operative for leading large-scale, high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns. During his operation in Chicago, federal agents rappelled from a helicopter into a residential apartment complex and fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters.

Federal agents arrested more than 3,200 immigrants during a surge in the Chicago area in recent months, but have not provided many details. Court documents on roughly 600 recent arrests showed that only a handful had criminal records representing a “high public safety risk,” according to federal government data.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Border Patrol, which does not typically operate in dense urban areas or in situations with protesters, has been accused of heavy-handed tactics, prompting several lawsuits. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Chicago accused Bovino of lying and rebuked him for deploying chemical irritants against protesters.




Bovino has doubled down on the efficacy of his agency's operations.

“We're finding and arresting illegal aliens, making these communities safer for the Americans who live there,” he said in a post on X.

The Department of Justice has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement and included it on a list of 18 so-called sanctuary cities. The city's jail, which has been under longstanding oversight from a federal judge, does not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under most circumstances, and its police department views immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction.

However, Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature has passed laws to compel New Orleans agencies to align with the Trump administration's hard-line immigration stance. 

One such law makes it a crime to “knowingly” do something intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. Anyone who violates the law could face fines and up to a year of jail time.

Additionally, lawmakers expanded the crime of malfeasance in office, which is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, for government officials who refuse to comply with requests from agencies like ICE. It also prohibits police and judges from releasing from their custody anyone who “illegally entered or unlawfully remained” in the U.S. without providing advance notice to ICE.

In and around New Orleans, some immigration lawyers say they have been inundated with calls from people trying to prepare for the upcoming operation. One immigration lawyer, Miguel Elias, says his firm is conducting many consultations virtually or by telephone because people are too afraid to come in person.

He likens the steps many in the immigrant community are taking to what people do to prepare for a hurricane — hunker down or evacuate. Families are stocking up on groceries and making arrangements for friends to take their children to school to limit how frequently they leave the house, he said.

In the days leading up to Border Patrol's planned operations, businesses have posted signs barring federal agents from entry and grassroots advocacy groups have offered rights-related trainings and workshops on documenting the planned crackdown.

While New Orleans is famous for its blend of cultures, only around 6.7% of its population of nearly 400,000 is foreign-born, though that rises to almost 10% in neighboring metro areas. That's still well below the national average of 14.3%, according to U.S. census data.

The city's Hispanic population ballooned during rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now makes up around 14% of the population, according to census data compiled by New Orleans-based Data Center.

The Pew Research Center estimates 110,000 immigrants who lack permanent legal status were living in Louisiana as of 2023, comprising approximately 2.4% of the state's population. Most of them are from Honduras.

Amanda Toups, who owns local restaurant Toups Meatery and runs a nonprofit to help feed neighbors in need, said she expects the federal operations to negatively impact the city's tourism-dependent economy, which supports the rest of Louisiana.

“If you're scaring off even 5% of tourism, that's devastating,” she said. “You're brown and walking around in town somewhere and you could get tackled by ICE and you're an American citizen? Does that make you want to travel to New Orleans?”

NEW YORK (AP) — Cat Murphy, a college student, has wanted to be a journalist since she was 11. Many of her friends don't understand why.

When they engage with the news — if they do — they hear a cacophony of voices. They don't know who to believe. Reporters are biased. They make mistakes. Besides, why would you hitch your future to a dying industry?

“There is a lot of commentary — ‘Oh, good for you. Look what you're walking into. You're going to be screaming into the void. You're going to be useless,'” said Murphy, a 21-year-old graduate student at the University of Maryland's journalism school.

She is undeterred. And it's also why she's not surprised by the findings of a study this fall that documented negative attitudes toward the news media among 13- to 18-year-old Americans. The press rarely fares well in surveys of adults, but it's sobering to see the same disdain among people whose opinions about the world are still forming.

Asked by the News Literacy Project for one word to describe today's news media, 84% of teens responded with something negative — “biased,” “crazy,” “boring,” “fake, ”bad,” “depressing,” “confusing,” “scary.”

More than half of the teens surveyed believe journalists regularly engage in unethical behaviors like making up details or quotes in stories, paying sources, taking visual images out of context or doing favors for advertisers. Less than a third believe reporters correct their errors, confirm facts before reporting them, gather information from multiple sources or cover stories in the public interest — practices ingrained in the DNA of reputable journalists.




To some degree, teens reflect the attitudes they're exposed to, particularly when the most prominent politician of their age has made “fake news” a mantra. Experts say few teens follow news regularly or learn in school about the purpose of journalism.

Journalists don't help themselves with mistakes or ethical lapses that make headlines. Opinionated reporters or commentators in an era of political division make readers wonder what to believe.

“Some of this (attitude) is earned, but much of it is based on misperception,” said Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design for the Washington-based News Literacy Project.

There are ways to turn things around, but it will take work.

Many of Lily Ogburn's classmates get their information from social media. Their parents didn't watch or read news reports as they grew up, so they didn't pick up the habit, said Ogburn, a senior at Northwestern University's journalism school.

Ogburn is the former editor-in-chief at the well-regarded Daily Northwestern student newspaper. The newspaper's 2023 reports on alleged hazing and racism within the school's football program led to the ouster of its coach. Still, she found some students don't understand the newspaper's role; they believe it exists to protect people in power rather than hold them accountable.

She frequently had to explain what she did to classmates. “There's a lot of mistrust toward journalists,” she said. But it has firmed her resolve to stick with the profession.

“I want to be a journalist that people trust,” Ogburn said, “and I want to report news that makes people believe and trust in the media.”

The news industry's financial troubles over the past two decades have hollowed out newsrooms and left fewer journalists on duty. Along with not seeing much legitimate journalism, young people frequently don't experience it through popular culture — unlike a previous generation, which learned in detail how Washington Post reporters Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein exposed the Watergate scandal in the Academy Award-winning movie “All the President's Men.”

When the News Literacy Project asked, two-thirds of teens couldn't think of anything when asked what movies or TV shows come to mind when they think about journalism. Those who had answers most frequently cited the “Spider-Man” franchise or the movie “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.” Neither portrayal was particularly flattering. 

Upon retiring as editor of Newsday, Howard Schneider helped develop the State University of New York system's first School of Journalism. But instead of teaching future writers, editors or producers, he became drawn to teaching non-journalists about being news consumers.

Now the executive director of SUNY Stony Brook's Center for News Literacy, Schneider wasn't surprised about any of the recent survey's findings, either.

“The negativity, the feeling that news is biased, is just a reflection of how their parents feel,” Schneider said. “The more exposed to news, legitimate news, the more their attitudes turn positive.”

He has developed news literacy programs for school districts. “Students will say, ‘I get my news from YouTube,'” he said. “I say, ‘No, you don't,'” and explains where the news originates and how to be discerning about what they see.

That's one of the lessons that 16-year-old Brianne Boyack has taken from her course in news literacy at Brighton High School in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. She had little trust in news going in, but has learned the importance of double-checking sources when she sees something interesting and seeking outlets she's found reliable.

Her classmate, Rhett MacFarlane, applied what he learned in class to investigate when a friend told him the Louvre was robbed in Paris.

“I've learned that there is definitely fact-checking (in journalism),” MacFarlane, also 16, told The Associated Press. “You guys are professionals and you have to tell the truth or you'd be fired. I thought you guys just did whatever you wanted and chose what to say about a topic.”

Still, news literacy programs in schools are relatively rare. Schools already have a lot of subjects to cover to prepare students for the future. And, remember, journalists don't have the best reputations. It can be hard for educators to stick their necks out for them.

“There's an inertia here,” Schneider said, “and this is an urgent issue.”

At the University of Maryland, Murphy said she didn't think there was an inherent hatred toward journalists among her fellow students. “They don't have any experience reading journalism,” she said.

That's where she sees the journalism industry needing to make more of an effort. One of the things she finds most frustrating about her chosen field is a resistance to change, particularly an unwillingness or inability to make meaningful use of social media.

“There's very little movement in the direction of going to where people are, as opposed to expecting them to come to where you are,” Murphy said. “The only way to turn it around is going to be to switch to doing things that captivate people today, as opposed to captivating people 20 years ago.”

The Afghan man accused of shooting two National Guard members blocks from the White House had been unraveling for years, unable to hold a job and flipping between long, lightless stretches of isolation and taking sudden weekslong cross-country drives. Rahmanullah Lakanwal's behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.

Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal mounting warnings about the asylum-seeker whose erratic conduct raised alarms long before the attack that jolted the nation's capital on Wednesday, the eve of Thanksgiving. The previously unreported concerns offer the clearest picture yet of how he was struggling in his new life in the United States.

Even so, when the community member who works with Afghan families in Washington state saw on the news that Lakanwal was named as the suspect in the attack, they said they were stunned, unable to square the violence with the memory of seeing Lakanwal play with his young sons. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to share undisclosed details while cooperating with the FBI in its investigation. 

West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in the shooting, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically wounded. Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with first-degree murder.

In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as a Zero Unit. The units were backed by the CIA. He entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the American withdrawal. Many had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats.




As investigators work to determine a motive, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press” that officials “believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country. We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members.” She offered no additional information to support her statement.

Lakanwal resettled with his wife and their five sons, all under the age of 12, in Bellingham, Washington, but struggled, according to the community member, who shared emails that had been sent to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit group that provides services to refugees.

“Rahmanullah has not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023. He quit his job that month, and his behavior has changed greatly,” the person wrote in a January 2024 email.

The emails described a man who was struggling to assimilate, unable to hold a steady job or commit to his English courses while he alternated between “periods of dark isolation and reckless travel.” Sometimes, he spent weeks in his “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids.” At one point in 2023, the family faced eviction after months of not paying rent.

The community member, in an interview, spoke of becoming worried that Lakanwal was so depressed that he would end up harming himself. But the community member did not see any indication that Lakanwal would commit violence against another person. 

Lakanwal's family members often resorted to sending his toddler sons into his room to bring him the phone or messages because he would not respond to anyone else, one email stated. A couple of times, when his wife left him with the kids for a week to travel to visit relatives, the children would not be bathed, their clothes would not be changed, and they would not eat well. Their school raised concerns about the situation.

But then, there were “interim” weeks where Lakanwal would try to make amends and “do the right things,” according to the email, reengaging with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services as was mandated by the terms of his entry into the U.S. 

“But that has quickly evolved into ‘manic' episodes for one or two weeks at a time, where he will take off in the family car, and drive nonstop,” the email outlined. Once, he went to Chicago, and another time, to Arizona. 

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, said this past week that Lakanwal drove across the country from Bellingham, which is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, to the nation's capital.

In response to the two emails, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants or USCRI, visited Bellingham a few weeks later in March 2024 and attempted to make contact with Lakanwal and his family, according to the community member, who, after not receiving any updates, was left with the impression that Lakanwal refused their assistance. 

A request for comment and clarification from USCRI was not immediately returned.

The Auburn Tigers hired Alex Golesh as their next head football coach, the school announced on Sunday.

Golesh will head to the SEC school after three seasons at the helm of the South Florida Bulls. The team finished the regular season with a 9-3 record and capped it off with a 52-3 win over the Rice Owls on Saturday.

He joined South Florida for the 2023 season, leading the school to seven wins, including a victory in the Boca Raton Bowl. It was much of the same in 2024 – a 7-6 record and a win in the Hawaii Bowl.

The 2025 season was Golesh's best. Bulls quarterback Byrum Brown had 3,158 passing yards and led the team with 1,008 rushing yards. The team started with wins over ranked opponents Boise State and Florida before suffering their first loss against Miami. The team also had losses against Memphis and Navy.

Auburn parted ways with Hugh Freeze after nine games. Freeze was hired over from the Liberty Flames after he was able to get them into three bowl games in four years.

However, Auburn never had more than six wins under Freeze. In 2023, the Tigers were 6-7 and lost in the Music City Bowl.

The reality star called the case against him a ""trophy prosecution,"" making it clear there is no money missing.

Steve McBee Sr. is preparing to begin his two-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme involving crop insurance.

In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, the 52-year-old reality star shared how he reacted to learning he would be going to prison, saying, ""It was a sobering moment.""

He explained that when he first heard about the investigation, he ""really wasn't overly concerned,"" because, as a business owner for more than 33 years, he had ""gone through every audit under the sun."" He thought it was just like any other audit, and after they got the necessary information, ""it'll go away like the rest of them.""

However, after a meeting with his lawyer, he came to understand that this time was different.

""I went down there and the government basically just gave us kind of a BAFO – best and final offer,"" he said. ""We have 48 hours. He said this is their bullying technique, kind of the poker game here. And then, basically what they said was, OK, you as an individual can plead guilty and, just for clarification, you can plead to one count of giving a fraudulent statement to crop insurance. If you don't do that as an individual, Steve A. McBee, in turn, we're going to charge one of my teammates, one of my co-workers, with 27 federal indictments in 48 hours.""

He called what they did a ""bullying technique,"" saying both he and his teammates ""had nothing to do with it."" He said, ""When I looked at them charging some of my fellow co-workers,"" he couldn't let them take the blame, adding that as the owner of the company, ""I made the decision the buck stops with me,"" so he took the responsibility.

WATCH: STEVE MCBEE SR. THOUGHT THE INVESTIGATION WAS JUST ANOTHER AUDIT BEFORE GETTING SENTENCED TO PRISON TIME FOR CROP INSURANCE FRAUD

McBee was sentenced to two years at the Federal Prison Camp in Yankton, South Dakota, and during a sentencing hearing on Oct. 16, was also ordered to an additional two years of supervised release once he completes his prison sentence. He will also have to pay $4,022,124 in restitution to the USDA Risk Management Agency.

""I wanna make absolute, with absolute clarity, that people understand, there's no money missing,"" he said. ""When you farm like over 10,000 acres, which we farmed 44,000 acres, three states, in 2020, 923 different fields, they do a post-planting audit, a pre-harvest, and a post-harvest audit. They know what grain we have. They've been all over every field.""

""They found a plant date that was half wrong. We were there on May 20. We planted half the field. We didn't go back till like June 19,"" he added. ""And they basically said, your entire crop insurance is null and void because of a half wrong plant date. I mean, I'm like, this can't be real. That's day-to-day common business.""

McBee went on to call the case against him a ""trophy prosecution,"" adding that the business has been greatly impacted by the two-year prison sentence, explaining he's lost over $20 million in loans. ""I had to pay all them off, had to sell a bunch of land. I mean it goes on and on,"" he said.

In addition to the monetary loss, McBee said his reputation has also been ""destroyed,"" with people now thinking he earned all his money by defrauding the government, and not through ""33 years of working seven days a week.""

""We didn't make money farming. We broke even some years, and farming is very difficult to make money and, I like challenges and I love farming. It's, I think it's in my DNA,"" he said. ""Literally 75 people lost their job. We downsized drastically, and I still have 300 employees at my other businesses. It caused problems at my other businesses, well, everywhere. Everywhere you bank with, because when they charge you with a felony, I mean, then the banks get involved, as you would know from personal guarantees.""

When it comes to his family, however, the reality star said they ""have never been closer."" He said he knows he ""raised four lions, not four sheep,"" and isn't worried about his sons, adding they have a strong work ethic. 

Despite everything he is going through, McBee maintains he will ""never let somebody make me a victim"" and once his sentence is over, he ""will come out stronger and more ready to go than ever.""

WATCH: STEVE MCBEE SR. SHARES HOW HE IS PREPARING FOR PRISON

""Steve McBee holds the door open for every young and old person. My kids are always like, 'Dad, don't pick up hitchhikers.' I stop and change tires on the side of the highway. That's who Steve McBee is. I know who I am,"" he said. ""I'm not stabbing somebody at a gas pump after I've been arrested 100 times and let back out on the streets. But I'm the one going to prison. Life ain't fair sometimes, for no reason at all. I told the boys that, and I'm going to buck up, but I want my story heard because other farmers need to know they can get you any time they want.""

Well, now they'll get the opportunity to make those decisions, so I think they're they're nervous, but they'll be fine so I've tried to prepare everything.""

""One thing that we said when we were making the show with Bravo and NBC Universal was that we want to keep it real,"" he said. ""We feel like too many of the shows, the drama they kind of tried to create it and whatever, so we want to be very transparent and open with our lives if we think that people can read through the BS, and they know what's real and what's not. And so yeah, we're gonna allow them.""

""That was a family decision,"" he added. ""They asked, and they were very respectful if they could film that. And we kind of all talked about it collectively, as a group, and decided that it's happening regardless. It's part of our lives.""

Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had ""full reign access"" to telecommunications data.

A former FBI official claims that it's likely every American has been impacted by a Chinese-state-sponsored cyberattack.

International law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and National Security Agency, issued a joint advisory in September warning the public that CCP-sponsored actors are ""targeting"" many aspects of American lives, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks.

The cyberattack wasn't limited to the U.S. and targeted many countries around the globe, according to the advisory. According to the international agencies, the three Chinese companies believed to be behind Salt Typhoon work for China's intelligence services, which include units in the People's Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security. 

Through the information gathered during the cyberattacks, the Chinese intelligence services can ""identify and track their targets' communications and movements around the world.""

Cynthia Kaiser, a former high-ranking official in the FBI's cyber division, told the New York Times it's hard to envision a scenario where any American wasn't impacted by the hack.

""I can't imagine any American was spared given the breadth of the campaign,"" she said.

Those directly impacted by the cyberattack include senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures whose communications were accessed, according to the FBI.

Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that those behind the Salt Typhoon cyberattack had unprecedented access to phone calls being placed by Americans.

""They had full rein access,"" Nicoletti, said. ""So, you know, your grandmother calling you to remind you to pick up groceries was not a targeted person and they're gonna listen into that call. But Trump, Vance, Kamala Harris, and dozens of other U.S. government officials were specifically targeted.""

Nicoletti said the Salt Typhoon hackers ""established a foothold and exfiltrated data for five years,"" which is ""almost unprecedented.""

Yet the cybersecurity expert says his greatest concern is not what Salt Typhoon may target in the future, but whether the group remains embedded inside companies and agencies that still haven't discovered the intrusion.

""My biggest concern is they're still in various organizations and undetected,"" he said. ""So the thing that I worry about is not the next time that these guys hack somebody, it's what they're doing currently and who they're in.""

When discussing the cyberattack in December 2024, then-deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said the hackers worked to identify the owners of various devices, then spy on phone calls and text messages if they were ""government targets of interest.""

Police have launched an intensive manhunt for the at-large gunman who opened fire at a Stockton family gathering, killing four people and wounding ten others.

Four people were killed and 10 were wounded in a mass shooting in Stockton, California, Saturday evening, according to officials.

Deputies responded shortly before 6 p.m. to a report of a shooting near the 1900 block of Lucile Avenue.

The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said at a news conference that children and adults were shot.

Early indications ""suggest this may have been a targeted incident,"" a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said.

President Donald Trump says in video message the alleged shooter of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., entered the United States from Afghanistan in 2021 and asks for Americans to pray for the victims.

Before the West Virginia Mountaineers football team took on the No. 5 Texas Tech Red Raiders Saturday afternoon in Morgantown, the crowd shared a moment of silence for the two West Virginia National Guard soldiers shot in Washington, D.C., Wednesday.

The public address announcer asked the crowd for silence as it came together to honor 24-year-old U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe from Martinsburg and 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom from Webster Springs. Their pictures were shown on the scoreboard during the moment of silence.

The two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House during their deployment in D.C. Spc. Beckstrom died from her injuries, while Staff Sgt. Wolfe remains in critical condition.

The suspected shooter is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national.

The shooting happened in broad daylight, and eyewitness video has emerged showing the shooter, believed to be Lakanwal, wearing dark clothing, turning a corner with a revolver in hand while Guardsmen scramble for cover.

One of the Guardsmen was seen around a corner down a street and returned fire. Metro Police say other National Guardsmen heard the shots about three blocks away from the White House and were able to detain Lakanwal after he had been shot.

The shooter fired off 10 to 15 rounds with a .357 revolver, according to federal charging documents cited by Reuters.

Lakanwal had entered the United States in September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden administration's Afghan evacuation and resettlement program. Prosecutors say he traveled across the country shortly before the attack and had no prior criminal record.

Lakanwal faces charges of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the Department of Justice intends to seek the death penalty.

Beckstrom and Wolfe were among members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to the D.C. area to tackle crime in the city in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., told ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" Saturday that Wolfe is ""hanging on,"" adding his family is calling for prayer. 

""Andrew is fighting for his life right now, and his family and all of his friends, they're trying to harvest as many prayers as possible from all across the country, all across the globe, to help him recover,"" West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey told ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" Saturday.

""West Virginia cares very deeply about its guard. And there's just a proud tradition of West Virginians who step up from military service. So, when something like this happens, it's really a gut punch to the communities.""

As for the Mountaineers' game, they weren't competitive against one of the best teams in the country. The Red Raiders beat them, 49-0, to move to 11-1 on the year. West Virginia finished its season 4-8.

The Arkansas Razorbacks pulled the trigger on their choice for their next head football coach on Sunday after the team's disastrous 2025 season ended with a 14-point loss to Missouri.

Arkansas agreed to make Ryan Silverfield their next head coach, ESPN reported.

Silverfield will come over from the Memphis Tigers where he spent six years. He took the Memphis job before the 2020 season and led the Tigers to four bowl games, all of which he won.

The Tigers didn't have a great year, but managed to win eight games and reach as high as 22nd in The Associated Press top 25 poll. He also guided the Tigers to two 10-win seasons – the most since Mike Norvell was the head coach of Memphis.

He will be in charge of trying to revitalize the Razorbacks.

Arkansas fired Sam Pittman after five games this season. The team replaced him with Bobby Petrino, but the Razorbacks didn't win a game with him. Pittman was with Arkansas from 2020 to 2025. He had the school as high as eighth in the AP poll in 2021 as they finished with nine wins. But the team dropped off from there.

The Razorbacks have not won at least 10 games since 2011 under Petrino. But his tenure at Arkansas ended in scandal.

Four people were killed, and 10 were wounded in a shooting at a Stockton, California, banquet hall on Saturday evening, county police and local officials said.

A family gathering was being held at the venue when the shooting occurred, and victims included children and adults. The shooter remains at large, and several California agencies are searching for the suspect, San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas confirmed Saturday evening.

“This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited. Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities. Detectives are actively working to determine the circumstances leading up to this tragedy,” San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said in a social media update.

Police were called just before 6 p.m. on Saturday. Local officials encouraged anyone with information about the incident or with knowledge of a suspected shooter to relay information.

“If you have any information as to this individual, reach out immediately. And if you are this individual, turn yourself in immediately,” Freitas said in a press briefing Saturday evening.

Christina Fugazi, mayor of the Central Valley city east of San Francisco and south of Sacramento, encouraged witnesses to call Crime Stoppers if they wish to leave an anonymous tip.

“This is Thanksgiving weekend. This is when families come together, celebrate, share memories, give each other love. Unfortunately, tonight, Heaven is a little bigger with the individuals, children and adults, that unfortunately did not make it. Stockton is better than this,” Fugazi said.

The district attorney also confirmed Saturday that his office was providing support to the victims of the shooting.

“My office is also working very, very hard with all the other agencies providing support, including my investigation unit, my chief of homicide and my victim witness advocates, they're providing assistance to the families and their victims,” Freitas said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration faced initial headwinds for many of its transgender policies. However, as the cases have reached higher courts, the Trump administration has notched wins, allowing key policies to be implemented.

The president issued several prominent executive orders limiting the definition of gender to biological sex, limiting women's sports to biological women, and banning transgender people from serving in the military, topics that have been at the center of the legal battles.

The Supreme Court in May allowed Trump's transgender military service ban to take effect while litigation continues, after a district court had temporarily blocked it nationwide.

Trump administration lawyers have argued the ban on transgender troops is no different than other policies disqualifying people from military service over medical conditions that can affect military readiness, such as epilepsy or schizophrenia. The policy disqualifies people based on a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria as defined by psychiatric professionals.

An appeals court heard arguments over the ban in May. The three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit pressed the Trump administration on why the seven transgender servicemembers at the heart of the lawsuit, all of whom are actively serving in the military, should be discharged despite each one individually serving without a problem.

“When we talk about unit cohesion and good order and discipline, that affects everyone” in the military, said Abhishek Kambli, the DOJ lawyer defending the transgender military ban.

Kambli also pushed back on questions about whether the ban was hastily implemented at the start of Trump's presidency, noting that the Pentagon had built its policy off a similar one put in place under then-Defense Secretary James Mattis during Trump's first term.

In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld that transgender ban, which allowed transgender troops who were already serving to remain in the military but otherwise included similar reasoning for banning the enlistment of new ones.

The president issued an executive order at the beginning of his term in January, reversing a Biden-era policy that allowed people to select their listed sex on passports, along with allowing an X designation, and reverting to the long-standing policy of listing the biological sex of the passport holder on the document.

The move was met with a lawsuit and a subsequent injunction in April, which blocked the new rule from taking effect, as ordered by U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick.

Kobick claimed in her ruling that the order was “part of a coordinated and rapid rollback of rights and protections previously afforded to transgender Americans” and said that “such targeting of a politically unpopular group runs afoul of our Nation's constitutional commitment to equal protection.”

The Trump administration appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which upheld the lower court's ruling halting the policy, leading the Justice Department to submit the case to the Supreme Court's emergency docket.

The people who sued the administration over the policy claim it violated the Equal Protection Clause and discriminated against transgender people, while the Justice Department has maintained it is about presenting factual information on government documents.

“Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex—especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his petition to the Supreme Court's emergency docket.

The justices sided with the administration 6-3, lifting the block on the passport rule while the case continues in lower federal courts. The unsigned majority opinion stated that the policy is not discriminatory, but instead requires the listing of a “historical fact” about the passport holder.

“Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment. And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex ‘lack[s] any purpose other than a bare … desire to harm a politically unpopular group,'” the majority ruling in the Nov. 6 order said.

The ruling marked the second victory on transgender policy issues for the Trump administration this year on the Supreme Court's emergency docket. It also continued the broader trend of higher courts largely reversing lower courts' injunctions of Trump policies.

While the pair of lawsuits over transgender sports laws before the Supreme Court in January are not directly related to Trump orders, the two state laws at the center of the cases mirror Trump administration policies and have the administration's backing.

On Jan. 13, 2026, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., where laws in Idaho and West Virginia, respectively, limiting women's sports to biological women will be under scrutiny. The laws are similar in substance to the president's February executive order aiming to keep biological men out of women's sports.

The pair of cases will examine whether the laws either violate the 14th Amendment, as in the Hecox case, or if they violate Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause, as in the B.P.J. case. In Hecox, both the federal district and appeals courts ruled that the law was unconstitutional, while in B.P.J., a federal district court sided with West Virginia in upholding the law, but a federal appeals court later struck down the law.

The Justice Department will receive time to argue in favor of both state laws during oral arguments in January, hoping to notch another legal win with transgender policies via a ruling that upholds the state laws.

“In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else. That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination,” the Justice Department said in a brief to the Supreme Court.

SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH WHETHER STATES CAN TARGET DONOR LISTS

“However else Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause may apply to trans-identifying individuals, they certainly do not require granting these men and boys a preferential exemption from biology-based rules, let alone when that would come at the expense of competitive fairness and safety for women and girls—the very people Title IX was enacted to protect,” the brief continued. “In holding the opposite, the courts below relied on a set of rationales that have no basis in law or fact.”

The Supreme Court has not offered any insight into how it will rule in the transgender sports cases, but it has not handed LGBT activists many wins in recent years. Earlier this year, the high court ruled 6-3, upholding a Tennessee law that banned transgender procedures for minors, a significant loss for LGBT activists.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump‘s statement that the airspace over Venezuela is “closed” has resulted in the suspension of deportation flights from the United States, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said.

Trump issued a warning to pilots on Saturday morning that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela is now “closed in its entirety.” The surprising announcement was met with condemnation from the Venezuela government, which called it an “illegal” and “immoral act of aggression” in a statement that included an appeal to the United Nations as well as a vow to respond “with all the strength granted by international law.”

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela strongly repudiates the public message disseminated today on social media by the President of the United States,” the statement said. “The Bolivarian Government warns that Venezuela will not accept orders, threats, or interference from any foreign power. No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of national airspace.”

Venezuela also revealed a consequence of Trump's statement — the immediate suspension of deportation flights to Venezuela, a key part of the U.S. president's immigration agenda.

“Through this action, the United States government has unilaterally suspended the Venezuelan migrant flights that were being carried out regularly and weekly as part of the repatriation of Venezuelans through the Plan Vuelta a la Patria (Return to the Homeland Plan),” it added.

The deportation flights were a rare instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Venezuela at the beginning of Trump's second term.

TRUMP SAYS VENEZUELAN AIRSPACE NOW ‘CLOSED'

Those already fragile relations have significantly deteriorated as Trump wages a drug war on the South American country, which has so far been limited to strikes on small alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Southern Pacific.

Those military operations may be expanding, with the airspace announcement signaling strikes on targets inside Venezuela could be imminent.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Employees with the Minnesota Department of Human Services accused Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) of creating a “cascade of systemic failures” that led to statewide fraud.

A report from the New York Times prompted a response from the agency regarding the fraudulent cases of Somali residents in Minnesota enrolling in nonexistent services through nonexistent companies. Employees with Minnesota DHS thanked the New York Times for its reporting.

“Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota. We let Tim Walz know of fraud early on, hoping for a partnership in stopping fraud but no, we got the opposite response. Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression, and did his best to discredit fraud reports,” Minnesota DHS employees wrote on X on Saturday.

“This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz. Agency leaders appointed by Tim Walz willfully disregarded rules and laws to keep fraud reports quiet – even to the extent of threatening families of whistleblowers,” the post added. “These same leaders are not qualified for their jobs, instead getting leadership jobs via Tim Walz's friendship so state government were left floundering.”

Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression,… https://t.co/cEtbnuKmgn

According to the agency, there are many who should be “held responsible for their role” in the scheme but haven't faced consequences, naming DHS temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi, former DHS Commissioner Jodi Harpstead, DHS compliance officer Jess Geil, Assistant Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services Natasha Merz, and former DHS Assistant Commissioner for Homelessness Eric Grumdahl. Harpstead notably resigned from her position in January, while Grumdahl was fired in September.

“Fundamentally, Tim Walz is dishonest, lacks ethics and integrity, has poor leadership abilities, and has never taken any accountability for his role in fraud,” the employees wrote. “Fact is, Minnesota never had a surplus, we had been given federal ARPA funds that were conflated as surplus money otherwise, we'd be in a deficit. And those ARPA funds, which were meant to be temporary funds were used to create more leadership positions for Tim Walz ‘buddies.'”

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump ended the temporary protected status for Somali residents in Minnesota. Trump alleged “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.”

TIM WALZ RESPONDS TO JAB FROM TRUMP WITH CALL TO ‘RELEASE THE MRI RESULTS'

While Walz was quick to respond to Trump name-calling him in a Truth Social post this week that was unrelated to the fraud, Walz has not commented publicly on the matter as it circulated in media reports for over a week.

Until now, no president had yielded to royal temptations from abroad.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Benjamin Franklin left Paris in 1785, after nearly nine years as the American emissary to France, King Louis XVI presented him with a parting gift. The token exuded the rococo extravagance of the ancien régime: a portrait of the monarch, surrounded by 408 diamonds, held in a gold case. It was frequently described as a snuffbox, a term that hardly captures its opulent nature; the item was likely far more valuable than anything Franklin owned.

Under the Articles of Confederation—the document governing the still-fragile republic—Franklin could keep the gift only with the explicit permission of Congress, which it reluctantly granted. But the gift unsettled the country. The Constitution, written two years later, barred federal officeholders from accepting any gift, payment, or title from a foreign state without Congress's explicit consent. The Founders feared that European monarchies would seek to control the new country by showering it with gifts, which would undermine its capacity for self-government.

Until Donald Trump, no U.S. president had ever yielded to royal temptations from abroad. But in his second term, Trump has discarded that old inhibition in its totality. Since 2022, the Trump family has been promised hundreds of millions of dollars—in the form of investments, real-estate licensing deals, even an airplane—from Gulf monarchies and the business entities they control.

During his second term, and especially during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's recent visit to Washington, Trump has rewarded his benefactors with sweeping geopolitical favors. Their huge investments in his family's businesses are hard to describe as anything other than the spectacular subversion of American sovereignty, wherein the nation's foreign policy reads as a thank-you note to the president's biggest financial boosters.

Really, Trump is adopting the governing style of his backers. In the Gulf states, hardly any distinction exists between public and private interests; the royal family governs the state and dominates the economy. They oversee sovereign-wealth funds, control the largest companies, and treat nominally private enterprises as instruments of royal policy. When a Gulf developer or investment vehicle pays Trump—or licenses his brand—it is not a private commercial transaction. It is a political act: a foreign monarch using his wealth to cultivate influence, dependence, and favor.

In a monarchy, a ruler governs in part through beneficence—binding subjects through appointments, indulgences, and other blandishments. That this model might be applied to American officeholders was the gravest threat to the republic: Leaders enriched by a foreign monarch cannot be trusted to act independently. When a leader is financially entangled with foreign regimes, it becomes impossible to discern their motives: Are they acting out of conviction, or obligation? That uncertainty was precisely what the Framers sought to banish.

The timing of Trump's deals with the Saudis tells a disturbing story. Before he became president, he never managed to break into the kingdom's real-estate market. But during his first term, he proved his worth. He stood by MBS after the Saudi leader ordered the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump backed the kingdom and its Emirati allies during their blockade of Qatar in 2017, despite the fact that the United States maintains one of its largest military bases there.

The Trump family was rewarded for its demonstrations of loyalty. In 2021, Jared Kushner—Trump's son-in-law, who was a top adviser during his first term—sought a $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign-wealth fund for the private-equity firm he was creating. The Saudi fund's professional advisers warned that the fledgling Kushner firm's operations were “unsatisfactory in all aspects.” But the crown prince controls the fund's board, and the board overruled the professionals.

Then, after Trump announced that he was running to reclaim the presidency, the Saudis began to shower him with real-estate deals. In 2022, Dar Global—the international arm of a Saudi developer that is routinely described as having “close ties” to the royal family—contracted with the Trump Organization to manage a hotel and golf course in Oman. Two years later, the company unveiled a Trump Tower in Jeddah, followed by plans for a Trump Plaza in the city. The pattern was unmistakable: The Saudis were licensing the Trump name for a series of lavish mega-projects in places such as Riyadh, Dubai, Doha, and the Maldives.

The Trump family has become enmeshed in Saudi investment deals to an extent possible only with the crown prince's approval. But have these entanglements actually corrupted American foreign policy? As the Founders understood, that question drifts into the murky realm of motives—always difficult to parse and almost impossible to prove.

American foreign policy was already becoming pro-Saudi long before Trump arrived for his second term. Although Joe Biden came into office vowing to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for killing Khashoggi, he softened his stance over time and pursued a grand bargain: Saudi normalization with Israel in exchange for Israeli movement toward a two-state solution. That shift didn't stem from personal enrichment or private dealings involving the Biden family; it emerged from geopolitics. Biden did not want Saudi Arabia drifting into China's orbit. And Iran's growing menace ensured that any American administration—whatever its ideological priors—would be pushed toward cooperation with Riyadh, which stands among Tehran's most committed regional adversaries.

Listen: The most corrupt presidency in American history

But Biden sought to extract substantial concessions as he deepened the alliance: not just Saudi diplomatic recognition of Israel but also assurances that the kingdom would keep the dollar at the center of its financial system. His administration pressed Riyadh to curb its brutal intervention in Yemen.

In his first months back in office, Trump has delivered the defense protections that Biden merely dangled before the Saudis. Last week, he even designated the kingdom a “major non-NATO ally.” He signed an executive order pledging to defend Qatar against any attack, not long after that country gifted him a $400 million airplane. (Technically donated to the Pentagon, the plane will be transferred to Trump's presidential-library foundation no later than January 2029.) At Riyadh's urging—“Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” Trump said—the president lifted sanctions on the new Sunni-led government in Syria. And to burnish the image of his family business's financial benefactor, he once again excused the murder of Khashoggi. Yet he has extracted almost nothing in return—aside from vague promises of Saudi investment in American firms, commitments the kingdom has every incentive to make regardless of American favors. This is exactly the kind of one-sided arrangement the Constitution was written to prevent: a republic bending toward the preferences of a foreign monarch whose wealth has seeped into the president's private dealings.

What the Founders feared as an existential threat to the republic is now unfolding in plain sight. The anxiety they enshrined in the Constitution is being flouted with barely any disguise. The Founders understood that the nation's immune system needed to reject even the smallest, most seemingly innocent foreign attempts to influence American politics. The president is ceding American sovereignty to a foreign monarchy, and there's hardly any price to be paid.

OpenAI's chaos machine turns three.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This story is part of a series marking ChatGPT's third anniversary. Read Ian Bogost on how ChatGPT broke reality, or browse more AI coverage from The Atlantic.

On this day three years ago, OpenAI released what it referred to internally as a “low-key research preview.” This preview was so low-key that, inside OpenAI, staff were instructed not to frame it as a product launch. Some OpenAI employees were nervous that the company was rushing out an unfinished product, but CEO Sam Altman forged ahead, hoping to beat a competitor to market and to see how everyday people might use the company's AI. They called it ChatGPT.



And people sure did use it—more than 1 million of them in the first five days. ChatGPT grew faster than any other consumer app in history. Today, it has 800 million weekly users. Numbers matter, but what is undeniable is that ChatGPT's success has quickly rewired parts of our society and economy. Now we are living in a world that ChatGPT helped build.



OpenAI's product solidified the oracular chatbot as the primary way the world interacts with large language models. Other companies released their own spin on the technology, such as Google Bard (now named Gemini) and Microsoft's Bing chatbot, the latter of which quickly went off the rails and told a New York Times reporter to leave his spouse and spend the rest of his life with the bot instead. ChatGPT introduced millions to a tool that, although prone to presenting false information, simulates conversation well enough that people began to use it as an interface for countless tasks, such as finding information. Others employ it to automate the act of creation itself. The bot has proved handy for cheating on homework, writing boring work emails, researching, and coding. Now some people struggle to do anything without it.



Read: Welcome to the slopverse



ChatGPT improved, as did its competitors, all new releases performing better on rigorous benchmark tests. Companies embedded chatbots in customer-service platforms, and social-media grifters used them to create bot armies. Amazon became flooded with spammy, synthetically generated books. Articles written by robots clogged Google, making the site less and less useful. Already beleaguered universities struggled to adapt to the reality that their curricula are now gamed effortlessly by students. Artists of all kinds protested as large language models, trained on the creative output of humankind, threatened to render their jobs irrelevant or obsolete—or to simply devalue creative work altogether. Many media companies chose to strike a deal with the scrapers; others sued. (OpenAI entered into a corporate partnership with The Atlantic last year.) Some businesses laid off staff as chatbots became more useful.



A nascent culture ballooned in the Bay Area—hacker houses and manifestos. “You can see the future first in San Francisco” was the overall argument articulated by the AI researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner. More people started using phrases such as p(doom) and situational awareness. There were more manifestos about technological timelines; “superintelligence” and “artificial general intelligence” became things that rich people with serious-sounding jobs said in public without laughing.



The models got better, and the unintended consequences grew commensurately. People confided in the chatbots as they would therapists. They confessed their darkest desires despite no guarantee of perfect privacy. They expressed joy and sorrow and intentions to kill themselves; in one high-profile incident, ChatGPT reportedly offered help, suggesting the right material for a noose. (OpenAI denies responsibility for this incident.) People fell in love with the tools and gave them names. Others saw something in their conversations—a discovery or a conspiracy on the horizon. Some withdrew from daily life. Some found help; others didn't.



From the December 2025 issue: The age of anti-social media is here



ChatGPT is just one tool for interacting with large language models, but its runaway success was the spark that led to further excitement and investment, and the rollout of other AI interfaces: text-to-speech voice clones; image, video, and music generators; web browsers. The models have continued to get better, helping build websites and other models, and allowing people to outsource more and more of their decisions. Generative-AI tools are used to write personalized bedtime stories and digitally reanimate children killed in mass shootings. People use them to generate entire songs; at least one debuted on a Billboard chart. Low-quality synthetic renderings are staples of political propaganda and click-farm rage bait. People came up with a name for it: Slop.



These tools are not magic, nor are they “intelligent” in any human way. But for plenty of people, their first encounter with ChatGPT checked many of the boxes of a transformative technology. The bot is intuitive yet uncanny—a piece of the future dropped into the present. If the disappointing-technology hype cycles that preceded large language models—cryptocurrency booms and busts, Web3 and the metaverse—felt like solutions in search of a problem, generative AI seemed to offer limitless applications. Rather than casting about for a use case, its boosters argued that it would eat the world. In a sense, it has. How else to explain a timeline in which OpenAI has partnered with Mattel to embed ChatGPT into Barbies, and the pope has warned students, “AI cannot ever replace the unique gift that you are to the world”?



Read: AI is a mass-delusion event



These models are unknowable—black boxes with anthropomorphic traits, but that are ultimately a series of complex calculations and statistical inferences based on mind-boggling sums of training data; much of that information was taken without express permission from its creators. The models do not have souls or rights. But their ability to mimic us—in part due to the human feedback in their training—has inspired scientists and researchers to ask questions about our cognition and further probe how our minds work.



This list barely begins to capture the past three years—the enthusiasm for these machines, as well as the loathing and anxiety they inspire. Depending on a person's view, one might see these models as a useful tool; others as “stochastic parrots” or fancy autocorrect; and others still as catalysts for a fearsome alien intelligence.

This is disruption, in the less technical sense of the word. In August, I wrote that “one of AI's enduring impacts is to make people feel like they're losing it.” If you genuinely believe that we are just years away from the arrival of a paradigm-shifting, society-remaking superintelligence, behaving irrationally makes sense. If you believe that Silicon Valley's elites have lost their minds, foisting a useful-but-not-magical technology on society, declaring that it's building God, investing historic amounts of money in its development, and fusing the fate of its tools with the fate of the global economy, being furious makes sense.



The world that ChatGPT built is a world defined by a particular type of precarity. It is a world that is perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop. Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career. Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they've honed may not be relevant. Investors are waiting too, dumping unfathomable amounts of capital into AI companies, data centers, and the physical infrastructure that they believe is necessary to bring about this arrival. It is, we're told, a race—a geopolitical one, but also a race against the market, a bubble, a circular movement of money and byzantine financial instruments and debt investment that could tank the economy. The AI boosters are waiting. They've created detailed timelines for this arrival. Then the timelines shift.



Read: Here's how the AI crash happens



We are waiting because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form. Like ChatGPT before its release, every model in some way is also a “low-key research preview”—a proof of concept for what's really possible. You think the models are good now? Ha! Just wait. Depending on your views, this is trademark showmanship, a truism of innovation, a hostage situation, or a long con. Where you fall on this rapture-to-bullshit continuum likely tracks with how optimistic you are for the future. But you are waiting nonetheless—for a bubble to burst, for a genie to arrive with a plan to print money, for a bailout, for Judgment Day. In that way, generative AI is a faith-based technology.



It doesn't matter that the technology is already useful to many, that it can code and write marketing copy and complete basic research tasks. Because Silicon Valley is not selling useful; it's selling transformation—with all the grand promises, return on investment, genuine risk, and collateral damage that entails. And even if you aren't buying it, three years out, you're definitely feeling it.

Flying during one of the busiest travel seasons of the year means a lot of waiting. To help you pass the time at the gate and on the tarmac, we asked The Atlantic's writers and editors: What is the best airport book?

The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, by Stuart Turton

There's a reason the stereotypical “airport novel” is a thriller. When you are trapped in the metal sky tube, or the pre-tube waiting room, all you really need is for time to go by. And that means you need plot, baby! With no disrespect, this is not the place for the meandering introspections of literary fiction, much as I adore that in other contexts. For a mystery with style and substance, you can't do much better than The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. In a supernatural Groundhog Day twist on a classic “someone dies at a rich-people party” whodunnit, a detective relives the day of a murder over and over in the body of a different guest each time. The characters are richly imagined; their unique skills and flaws shape what the detective is able to figure out each day. This adds a psychological depth to the intricate puzzle of the mystery itself—after you start this book, you'll be landing before you know it.

— Julie Beck, staff writer

Speedboat, by Renata Adler

I first read this book while on vacation last summer, and when I picked it up again this week, I found that I remembered almost none of it. This is a compliment—a testament to its hypnotic effect. Adler's first novel has no real plot to follow, instead unspooling in a series of shorter and slightly longer fragments: mostly observations and pronouncements in the voice of a New York journalist, Jen Fain, about her city, her acquaintances, her work, current affairs. It's a book you can dip in and out of. Nab a few passages while you're at your gate, or let it wash over you until you're distracted by the jostling drinks cart. Adler refuses clichés; her prose is unexpected and funny and assured. The novel is full of non sequiturs and random anecdotes; although it rewards close (and multiple) reads, it is pleasurable even if you miss some of it or end up reading some sentences twice.

— Maya Chung, senior associate editor

The Portrait of a Lady, by Henry James

My preferences for in-flight entertainment are counterintuitive: Nothing distracts me like an epic does. Never mind the tight confines of a tiny screen or an arm-crushing middle seat; in the liminal world of airplane mode, time sprawls gloriously, if you know how to use it. When film selections are subpar, I prefer cracking a book that is long, absorbing, and reasonably difficult. This year, on the way to Thanksgiving, I finished Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady—more than 600 pages of brambly syntax, intimate character studies, subtle reasoning, and devious hidden motives. I found it far easier to enjoy the machinations of the 19th-century leisure class amid the din of screaming babies and PA announcements than I would have if my news alerts were enabled. Isabel Archer could agonize over her choices during days-long train rides and months-long holidays; I can just as keenly consider them on the 7:45 a.m. flight to PHX.

— Boris Kachka, senior editor

The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

Collins's dystopian tale has all the elements of a solid airplane book: a fast-moving plot, uncomplicated world-building, and a poignant conclusion, good for an emotional release at 30,000 feet without ruining your mood for the rest of the day. The first book in the trilogy offers a straightforward and captivating David-versus-Goliath story about teens trying to survive a deadly spectacle put on by an ailing autocrat for the benefit of society's elites. The latter two books make for more sobering but still compelling reads, as the clear-cut morality of the first novel gives way to Catching Fire's debate over incremental rather than revolutionary change, and then to Mockingjay's consideration of complicity and the slippery slope of corruption. Plus, if you finish reading all three before your trip is over, you can always go back to the start and watch the film versions.

— Karen Ostergren, deputy copy chief

Aimless Love, by Billy Collins

Airport trips are full of distractions: The stop-and-go TSA line. The gate-change notifications. And just when you think you can finally focus, the muffled intercom voice that tells you to board. Yet once you're in flight, the pace slows and your mind can start to wander.

Aimless Love, a poetry collection by the former poet laureate Billy Collins, suits all of these facets of air travel. His quippy, slice-of-life poems thrive when time is scarce. (See the bite-size “No Time” about parental dynamics, or the pedestrian-mall devotion of “Oh, My God!”) But they also quickly give way to weightier meditations—about maternal dedication, or the endurance of poetry, or a love “without gifts, / or unkind words, without suspicion, / or silence on the telephone”—that can only benefit from a gaze out at the firmament.

— Luis Parrales, assistant editor

Essay

Make Culture Weird Again

By W. David Marx

Twenty-five years into the 21st century, culture is markedly different than it was in the previous millennium. Everyday life has never contained more stuff—an endless reel of words, ideas, games, songs, videos, memes, outrageous statements, celebrity meltdowns, life hacks, extremely talented animals. Yet audiences can sense what's missing. For all the energy society invests in culture today, little has emerged that feels new, and certainly nothing revolutionary enough to properly outmode the past.

Going to the movies with my dad

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

I saw Jaws with my father in the summer of 1975, the year it came out. When we walked out of the Oaks movie theater in Berkeley, California, we were giddy, punch-drunk. It's a perfect movie—a big, exciting American movie. From its opening minutes you live inside of it, your regular life suspended somewhere behind you. Waiting for my mother to pick us up, we noticed that we were both vaguely on guard against shark attacks, even though we were standing on Solano Avenue, where the only dangerous sea creatures were down the street in the King Tsin lobster tank. The tagline of the marketing campaign was “You'll never go in the water again,” and my only non-Jaws thought during the movie was I am never going to the beach again.

My mother picked us up, and we tried to tell her about the effect it had on us. My father compared it to Psycho, which many people of his generation did.

“There's a guy who gets his leg bitten off!” I said. “And you see it floating to the bottom!”

“Sinking to the bottom,” my father said mildly.

I thought of the leg falling through the water, the foot in its tennis shoe landing first and making a little bounce: sinking.

From the January 2025 issue: Walk on air against your better judgment

My father loved the movies, and he knew a lot about them. He'd grown up in Greenwich, Connecticut, and as a child he'd gone by himself to the Pickwick Theatre every weekend. On Saturdays, he'd get the whole enchilada: the serial, the cartoons, the short subjects, the newsreel, a Western, and then the feature. On Sundays, there would be a shorter, more dignified program—the coming attractions, the newsreel, and a better class of feature. I had the clear impression that those hours at the movies—maybe as much as his tremendous reading, which began early and never stopped—were the most fully lived hours of his childhood. While other boys were playing baseball or running track or engaging in any of those dull and harassing pastimes that boys were supposed to love, he was at the movies.

He went to see the original Dracula in 1931, and it had a tremendous effect on him. He loved to say, “Children of the night—what music they make!” in a very Bela Lugosi way. He did it for laughs, but “children of the night” must have been a frightening thing to hear as a kid, and he was partly laughing off his own childhood fear.

When I was about 10, he started taking the family to a Berkeley revival house that played the great movies of my parents' youth. I loved those nights; even though many of the movies confused me, I never missed a show. I was a Flanagan, and this is what we did—we read everything, and we saw a lot of movies. There were lines from some of them that we repeated for years: “I was misinformed” and “Was you ever bit by a dead bee?” My older sister looked a bit like Lauren Bacall, with the same side part, and sometimes we'd address the question to her. “Ellen, was you ever bit by a dead bee?”

The movies were shown in a double feature, and in the half-hour intermission between them, you'd spill out of the black-and-white 1930s and into the night carnival of Telegraph Avenue, 1971. Pushing through those doors was like Dorothy Gale opening her own front door in The Wizard of Oz, when the world switches from black and white to Technicolor; the scene on Telegraph was itself a bit like Oz: filled with strange people, vibrant with noise, attractive but also tinged with menace. What a relief to get back to the world of light and shadow, to the breakfast tables set with white linen, where educated people shake open newspapers and murmur, “Yes, please,” when uniformed servants offer coffee from a silver pot. Was real life ever like that? It was in the movies.

When I was in seventh or eighth grade, my sister moved out, which left a gaping hole in the family. She was the smart one, the ideal moviegoer, my father's favorite. In an effort to drag me up from the farm system, my father instituted a new policy: On very special Saturdays—which would follow no schedule and would always be announced on a Wednesday night—he and I would go to San Francisco, have lunch, and see a movie. My father didn't drive, and this was before BART ran under the bay to the city, so these trips—unlike the countless times my mother drove me or all of us to the city—never really felt like a sure thing until we were back at the house. First, we'd catch the 7 bus that went from the Berkeley Hills to downtown Berkeley, and then we'd wait for the F into San Francisco. Very occasionally, and theoretically in a way that could be predicted by looking at the bus schedule in the kitchen, what creaked to a stop wasn't the 7 but the 7-F, which had all of the benefits of the 7 combined with the ultimate destination of the F, and we received it as an augury of safe passage and a fantastic piece of luck. From the moment we took our seats, way up on Cragmont and Euclid Avenues, we could relax as the bus moved in its stately way through Oakland, and then onto the freeway and across the Bay Bridge, eventually to the end of the line, the old Transbay Terminal in San Francisco, which I recently read described as a “hot mess” during that era. But San Francisco itself was a hot mess at that time.

The city was peerless in its beauty and famous for murderers who came with boogeyman names: the Zodiac Killer, the Zebra Killers. There was also street crime, much of it violent, and political assassinations, and bombings. The terminal was cavernous and poorly lit, and I thought it was a bit scary, but my father's noninterest in ordinary things, such as driving and figuring out a bus schedule, extended to a failure to notice—really to acknowledge—dangerous circumstances, and so we'd hop off the bus and ankle it up to Union Square to have lunch at Lefty O'Doul's.

Lefty's was a baseball bar named for a beloved player and manager, so you wouldn't think it would be a Tom Flanagan kind of place. But it was also an Irish bar with shamrocks and tricolors in the grand old tradition of the San Francisco Irish, so it was actually very much a Tom Flanagan kind of place. It also had a great steam table. We always ordered either hot pastrami sandwiches or plates of corned beef with the works—cabbage, carrots, horseradish, the full catastrophe—and then we'd bring our trays to a table and give the cocktail waitress our order (“One martini and one Coca-Cola, please”), and we'd sit there eating and talking.

He'd order a second martini, and I'd have a slice of what I think of as California cheesecake (the flat kind, unlike those texture-filled ordeals I would encounter in the East). There was never another child in the bar, but no one ever said anything about my being there, just as nobody said it at the Top of the Mark or the half a dozen other San Francisco bars I frequented with my parents. I owe a lot of my education to conversations held in those places. Lefty's closed in 2017 because nothing gold can stay, but you can almost catch a glimpse of it at the very beginning of The Birds, when Tippi Hedren walks past Union Square and takes a left on Powell to go Davidson's Pet Shop.

At a certain point, my father would look at his watch and say, “Okay, drink up,” and we'd squeeze our eyes shut, drain our glasses, and head out. Our first movie was The Poseidon Adventure, which was released at the beginning of the disaster-movie craze of the 1970s, and unlike Spellbound and Casablanca, I understood it perfectly and found it thrilling. It's about an ocean liner that gets capsized by a rogue wave—“an enormous wall of water,” someone tells the captain, played by Leslie Nielsen—and a group of passengers who band together and try to escape.

Every disaster movie operates the same way. In a busy and cheerful first act, you meet the principals and find out what makes them tick: Mr. and Mrs. Rosen are going to Israel to meet their grandson. Mr. Rogo is a brusque cop who's always trying to cheer up his wife—the 13th labor of Hercules because she's a former prostitute who tells him that one of the men on board looks like a former customer—played by Stella Stevens. Reverend Scott, who will eventually lead the group to safety, is a turtleneck-wearing, semi-groovy Protestant minister trying to hash out his theological problems. Once you've made these and several more introductions, disaster strikes and you wait to see who gets picked off and who makes it.

I was engaged by every moment of that movie, horrified when Mrs. Rogo called Mrs. Rosen “old fat ass” and satisfied when she herself fell into a pit of fire. The actual plot of the movie is summarized by Reverend Scott's runic assessment of their predicament: “We're floating upside down. We've got to climb up.” Our group stalwartly tries to get to the hull, even as they pass doomed passengers, in their soaked gowns and tuxedos (it's New Year's Eve). At the end of the movie, Reverend Scott has delivered a sinners-in-the-hands-of-an-angry-God speech and sacrificed himself so that the survivors can make the final hurdle without being scalded by steam. Soon enough, rescuers use a blowtorch to make a hatch, and they climb out, saved. I realized that I'd been living so deeply inside the movie that I never thought about their actual rescue. As the light in the theater began to rise, I felt like the movie was breaking up with me.

My father's favorite movie was Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion, closely followed by Les Enfants du Paradis, so he certainly had a developed taste in film. But I think all of those Saturday mornings watching serials—fast-paced, full of adventures and cliff-hangers—gave him an appreciation for movies like The Poseidon Adventure.

We only once went to a restaurant other than Lefty's. My father presented it as a special surprise and mentioned it all week. It turned out to be a fancy French restaurant, and there wasn't one thing on the menu I wanted to eat. At the very bottom, I saw that there was an omelet, which I chose, and my father looked disappointed: “Don't you like it?” I convinced him that I really, really loved omelets and ate most of it, but from then on, we went to Lefty's.

Only one bad restaurant and only one bad movie—although it wasn't really a case of its being bad; it was a case of wishing we'd never been born—and it was The Day of the Dolphin, possibly the most sinister movie of the 1970s. We all know that Roman Polanski was in Europe working on a movie when Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson family. Do you know what that movie was? The Day of the Dolphin. Mike Nichols replaced Polanski, Buck Henry wrote the script, and George C. Scott played the lead role, but even with this congeries of talent, the film could not escape its curse. The Day of the Dolphin is a talking-dolphin movie, but it's also a thriller about an attempt to assassinate the president. Pauline Kael said that Nichols should find other work if he couldn't come up with a better story. A New York Times review that said that, despite its loftier ambitions, the movie prompts “memories of last winter's visit to Marineland.”

Scott plays Jake Turrell, a marine scientist and a man with a secret: At a marine center off Florida's coast, he's taught a dolphin to talk. Fa is an all-around swell dolphin, and I fell in love with him at once. If anyone else had played Jake, the thing would have been a nonstarter. But this is General Patton–level George C. Scott, and he's not phoning it in. Jake has an obvious, fatherly bond with Fa, and Fa has the mien of a 10-year-old boy who idolizes his dad; he calls Jake “Pa” and splashes happily in the tanks of blue water, snapping up fishy treats when he says his words.

Don't let anything happen to that dolphin, you think, because it can't be this simple, can it? No, it can't, and soon enough we're in Come Back, Little Sheba territory. It turns out that if a talking dolphin falls into the wrong hands, there's hell to pay. Poor little Fa and his girlfriend, Bea, are kidnapped and trained to attach magnetic bombs to the bottom of the president's yacht. After 25 minutes of frantic plot that even the greatest script girl of the 1940s wouldn't have been able to get straight, they manage to escape and find their way back home. Fa goes right to Jake, who's standing on the dock.

“Fa … love … Pa.”

“Yes, Pa knows,” Jake says. The dolphins can't stay; they must get as far from humankind as possible. The bad guys are probably on their way back to get revenge. Somehow he has to explain this to Fa, who's confused and heartbroken.

“Fa … stay … with … Pa.”

I was so overcome by emotion that I had to fight to keep myself from outright sobbing in a way that might indicate I was not old enough to go to PG movies or, for that matter, bars. Moreover, I knew this was the exact thing my father hated in movies. Now I know the term is sentimentality; I couldn't have named it then, but I could certainly recognize it.

Finally, Jake conveys that he could be in danger if the dolphins don't leave, and Fa is persuaded to turn away and swim off with Bea.

Jake stumbles away from the marine center and walks down the beach, his wife beside him. But then Fa appears at the shoreline a few feet away, lifting his head out of the water: “Pa!”

Jake doesn't even look at him. He collapses onto the sand and he sits there, saying nothing. His heart is broken.

Fa says it again—“Pa!”—and Jake doesn't move. Eventually Fa turns away a final time, and he and Bea swim away forever.

By then I was so distraught that by modern standards I was probably traumatized, but it wasn't about Fa anymore. It was because, in between the times Fa says “Pa,” my own father had emitted a sound: a quick, surprised sound—like a gasp, but not a gasp. It was a small, audible sob.

My father was from the generation of men who didn't know that crying was even an option. He had spent much of World War II in a destroyer that eventually came under kamikaze attack, the real reason—not his oblivious nature—for his physical courage. He had been an only child, and his father died when he was 8, the same age, I realize only now, that he started going to the movies by himself. The grief, as far as I understood, had expressed itself years before I was born. But then this happened.

That one moment was probably the closest I ever felt to my father. It was probably one of the closest moments anyone but my mother ever had with him. I knew I shouldn't mention it to my mother, or to anyone. I never even mentioned it to him directly.

When we got on the bus, I asked him, “Why did we even go to that terrible movie?”

“I don't know,” he said bleakly. “I don't know.”

My father and I went to see Jaws in Berkeley because we couldn't waste a minute of time dithering over the bus schedule or the steam table at Lefty's. We needed to see this movie right away. It had been out for only a couple of weeks, but it had roared into the center of the culture. Driving to the theater with my husband 50 years later, for an anniversary showing of the film, I had an idea that had never struck me before: At its heart Jaws is a detective movie. A cop can't catch a vicious killer, so he brings in a profiler who knows all about this kind of crime and the men who commit them, as well as a mercenary, someone who comes as much from the killer's world as from his own. But in the end, the cop is alone with the monster and kills him, triumphing over not just the killer but also his own fear.

I graced my husband with this cinematic observation, and in reply he asked if I'd rather get out at street level or drive down into the parking garage with him. Fair enough. But that's the kind of thing my father and I would have talked about while real life carried on around us. If anyone asked me the famous question of “why I write,” the answer would be: to keep the conversation going. He died a year after I started.

I felt like I was watching Jaws under the influence of a mild hallucinogenic. I'd seen it only on television since that first time—the events on the screen were so vivid and so clear that it was like having my own youth returned to me, as though I could stand up from that seat to get in my mother's car, drive up to the house, and set the table for dinner. The whole time I could feel the essence of my father beside me. Not the complicated, unknowable full measure of him, but the person who took me to the movies.

For years, going to the movies was an almost definitionally American habit. They were where you went on first dates and what you did with a friend if you wanted to get together. There was no such thing as a weekend with nothing to do, because you went to the movies. But now that tradition is falling away. Americans buy roughly half the number of movie tickets they did at the turn of the millennium. We all know the reasons: streaming, iPhones, the pandemic, and Americans' ever-diminishing attention spans.

The movie business has tried to adjust to this reality by betting on a few tentpole movies each year. Almost all of the top 10 movies at the domestic box office last year were sequels or remakes. Half were animated—children's movies, essentially, that the whole family can see—and the live-action movies were based on properties originally created in 1900, 1933, 1965, 1988, 1996.

Why are we so afraid of AI? We might get some new yarns out of it.

From the June 2025 issue: Is this the worst-ever era of American pop culture? 

We're running out of stories to tell one another. I'm sure that Kung Fu Panda 4 breaks new ground in the Kung Fu Panda universe, but I also know that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that if you start out with a character you'll end up with a type, but if you start out with a type you'll end up with nothing. There used to be a million stories, but today the dead-last subject anyone wants to see a movie about is human nature. Jaws is about a shark, but it's also about greed and courage. Disaster movies answer the question of how different kinds of people respond to crises. We don't want to contemplate that question anymore, because we're letting go of ourselves; we're exhausted. To pervert Norma Desmond's famous line: The movies are small, and we're getting small too.

When I was child, I wanted to be the same thing for Halloween every year: a princess or a fairy, or—eureka in the third grade—a fairy princess. My mother was great at making costumes, and my father, of course, had no practical skills to contribute. This costume included two large wings made of wire twisted together, bent into the right shape, and covered first in muslin and then in pale-blue chiffon. But the more the wire had to be twisted, the harder it was to manipulate, and my mother wasn't strong enough to do it, so she called in my father, and he sat at the dining-room table with a pair of needle-nose pliers in his left hand, making those wings. What would I have become without my father? I'd be no one. I'd be nothing. You sink into water, and you float on top of it.

One of humanity's biggest achievements may be slipping away.

Thanksgiving is traditionally a good time to start counting your blessings. And for years, hundreds of millions of people have had this to be thankful for: they live in a time that has made historic progress against the scourge of extreme poverty.

Between 1990 and today, the number of people living in extreme poverty — meaning on the equivalent of $3 or less per day in US purchasing power — fell from 2.3 billion to around 800 million, even as the global population nearly doubled. To put it another way, each day over the past 35 years, an average of 115,000 people escaped from extreme poverty. Through financial recessions and technological revolutions, through wars and climate change, even through pandemics, this fundamental progress continued. It was the ultimate good news story.

And now it may be ending.

That's the dire conclusion of a recent post by Max Roser, founder of the website Our World in Data. While Roser projects that the number of people in extreme poverty will decline by about 40 million over the next five years, he writes that “after 2030, the number of extremely poor people is expected to increase.”

If that projection holds, it would mark the end of one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. And it wouldn't be because the tools that worked for decades mysteriously stopped working. It would, in a way, be precisely because of the success of those tools.

The last few decades of astonishing global progress were propelled above all by growth.

In the 1990s and 2000s, hundreds of millions of people in China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and other rapidly developing countries rose above the extreme poverty line because their economies were growing at extraordinary speed. And because most of the planet's poorest people lived in these countries at that time, they were able to experience explosive gains in income, infrastructure, education, and health.

Today, however, the majority of people living in extreme poverty are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and in fragile and conflict-affected states — places where economic growth has been weak, volatile, or nonexistent for decades. This means the remaining pockets of extreme poverty are concentrated in places where our usual engines of progress barely turn over at all.

Madagascar — where my Vox colleague Benji Jones just returned from — is Roser's example of a country stuck in this trap: GDP per capita today is roughly what it was in the 1950s, even as its population has grown by 700 percent.

When an economy doesn't grow but its population does, the math is brutal. More children are born into extreme poverty, and the total number of people living in deprivation stays flat or rises. And the problem will become more challenging in the future, as much of the world's population growth is projected to be in countries mired in extreme poverty.

Layer on conflict and the situation becomes even more intractable. By 2030, the World Bank estimates that nearly 60 percent of the world's extreme poor will live in conflict-affected economies. A civil war can wipe out a decade of economic progress. Climate shocks can do the same. When drought, flooding, or crop failure hits a region where people already live one bad break away from destitution, millions can fall back below the poverty line overnight.

Roser acknowledges that his projections are not prophecy. Change the growth pattern — through better governance, fewer conflicts, more investment, cheap clean energy, or even dramatically expanded migration opportunities — and the projections change with them. The future of extreme poverty depends on whether the countries where the poorest people live can finally begin to grow.

Keeping this progress going will be harder, but we shouldn't mistake “harder” for “hopeless.” The gains of the last 35 years might feel like a miracle, but they were the result of specific choices, investments, and reforms that helped billions of people build better lives.

The challenge now is to extend that success to the places that were left behind. If we can do that, the age of progress against extreme poverty doesn't have to end. If we can't, then this past Thanksgiving might be one of the last moments when we can look at the global numbers and confidently call them a blessing.

An entrepreneur explains what's broken about America's system for skilled immigration.

President Donald Trump has been walking a fine line when it comes to H-1B visas — the visa that high-skill foreign professionals apply for to work in the US. These visas often go to physicians, software developers, engineers, university professors, and other specialty professions.

Earlier this year Trump proposed a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a move that aimed to restrict the flow of legal immigrant workers into the US. But in a recent interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, the president defended the program and said H-1B visas were necessary “to bring in talent.”

“We have plenty of talented people here,” Ingraham replied.

“No you don't, no you don't,” Trump said.

His comments have sparked outrage among his MAGA base.

“Trump needs to get out of his bubble and back on the ground listening to the American people who elected him to work for us,” Savanah Hernandez, a MAGA influencer and contributor to conservative youth group Turning Point USA said online. “His H-1B comment shows how out of touch with the base he has become.”

The debate over high-skill work visas inside this very anti-immigration White House gets at a fundamental tension. Trump may have been elected on an “America First” platform, but as his comments to Ingraham suggest, the reality of the American economy may turn out to be more complicated.

And some in the tech industry say that this debate over the H-1B visas is missing the larger point. Today, Explained's Astead Herndon spoke with tech CEO Vivek Wadhwa to get an inside perspective. Wadhwa runs a medical diagnostics company here in the US. He thinks the visa system is broken — but that by making it harder for the world's highly skilled workers to come here, America will only harm itself.

“I came here as an immigrant. I came here as a skilled worker. My father was a diplomat, so I came on a diplomatic visa. And when I came here in 1980, it took 18 months for me to get a green card,” Wadhwa tells Herndon. “Five years later, I was a US citizen. I became part of the American success story.”

When he became an academic, he studied US competitiveness — and found immigration at the heart of the story. “From 1995 to 2005, a quarter of all the startups in Silicon Valley were founded by immigrants. A decade later, the trend had become national — that a quarter of all the startups all across America were founded by immigrants,” Wadhwa says.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Why do you think the H-1B program has been so vital when it comes to entrepreneurship?

Because this is the way skilled immigrants come to the United States. They come here either as students or they come here as workers who are working for American companies. And that's the path to entering the United States.

You've recently been writing about your experience with H-1Bs and you write that it has been ripe for abuse. What's been your experience seeing the system tested in those ways?

Every government program is susceptible to corruption and misuse. [H-1B visa holders] go to body shops, they go to companies looking for cheap labor. And when the H-1B workers do come here and decide that they love America, they want to now become Americans, [but] they're stuck in the same job.

What happens is there's a nasty trick over here. If you're a computer programmer, when you've filed your H-1B visa and you become a manager three or four years later — which is what's normal in the tech industry — it's a different job.

So therefore people continue doing the same job they did when they started the H-1B process, which means that they're stuck in limbo and they're also making below-market salaries. So the opponents of H-1B visas are correct in the fact that the system is abused and that it does impact US salaries.

Trump has sent out some mixed signals when it comes to this. A lot of parts of his administration have talked against the visas, while he has said in other instances that he finds them to be somewhat effective. Now they've announced a $100,000 fee on every H-1B visa application. As someone who has leaned on it as an entrepreneur, what would that mean for you?

A startup works on fumes. You don't have that kind of money. The Googles and the Microsofts and the Oracles, they've got big money, so $100,000 is nothing to them. But to the companies that really need the deep talent to be able to do world-changing innovations, we're on tight budgets. $100,000 is unaffordable.

If I hear you correctly, you're saying the people who are most affected by this proposed fee are the ones in your sphere, maybe not those big companies.

Yes, it basically shuts off the system.

About two years ago, I was looking to start my medical diagnostics company that's going to now be able to detect diseases. I'll bring it to the United States when the time is right. But the skills I needed for that were electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, experts in plasma physics, thermodynamics, lab technicians — a lot of skills that you can't readily find in the United States. I needed top-notch mathematicians who understood biology, all right? There are very few of those in the United States. And if they exist, they're outside Silicon Valley.

So at first, I was looking to raise money over here, build my company over here. And then I realized, I simply can't find — I looked, it's not that I didn't try, I looked for talent.

So I started looking on LinkedIn for experts across the globe. And there were quite a few of them in India because they still have universities that teach these things. So I was looking to hire them and then I said, ”My God, H-1Bs, I need to bring them on H-1B visas.” And I looked at the numbers, the chances of being able to, it's literally a lottery.

Yeah.

And then all the hassles, the fact that you're bringing people in, if they fall in love with America, they can't stay. It was a losing battle. I knew enough about the system that I said, “Forget it.” I decided to move my company to India. So the United States lost over here.

You know, you mentioned about being a proud American, about what this country has given you. Is there any kind of — I don't know — a feeling that when it comes time to build this company here, that you're going back to India? Is there anything you owe the United States to build the company here?

Absolutely. I owe the United States everything. I wouldn't be where I am. I wouldn't be able to do these innovations. I wouldn't have had the opportunities if it wasn't for America. This is my country. I consider myself 100 percent American and my loyalty is to America.

This is why it pains me that I had to build my technology in India, even though I love India also. I wanted to build my technology here. And I could have raised the money I needed to build the technology here, but not dealing with all the nightmares and the stigma around H-1B visas and then the delays, the $100,000 [fee]. Because at the end of the day, even if I raise $20 million from Silicon Valley, I'm still a startup. I can't afford $100,000 fees on every employee I hire.

A question I have for you is, what do you think the solution is? I mean, we're coming at a point now where H-1Bs have been kind of politicized for several years. There's been so much back and forth about what the right level should be. You get back and forth messages from the White House itself. What would be the biggest thing that the country could do to make your life easier?

Well, number one, free the people who are trapped in immigration limbo. There are about 1 million people who are here legally — they're working for American companies, paying taxes. They can get a green card immediately, all right? You'd have half a million people buying houses, okay? That would boost the American economy more than his tariffs can, more than anything else can. And then get rid of the stupidity, $100,000 fees and so on.

Is some of what we're subtly talking about here a kind of American cultural thing too, that we think that because of our education system, the American worker is just not fit for the emergence of jobs that we have right now?

I've written books about this, about the exclusion of minorities, the exclusion of women. I mean, there are a lot of issues here, okay? And the fact that Americans aren't studying the hard sciences anymore. They aren't studying mathematics anymore. So if we don't bring the skills, engineers and scientists to the United States, other countries will. Or countries like India will have innovation systems that rival Silicon Valley. And that breaks my heart. We have to save America from itself.

China's factory activity edged higher in November but remained stuck in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, while services weakened as the boost from earlier holidays faded, according to official data released Sunday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.2, up 0.2 points from October, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The figures were in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.

The non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 49.5, down 0.6 points from October, while the composite PMI output index eased to 49.7, indicating a slight pullback in both manufacturing and services activities.

Supply and demand in manufacturing improved modestly, said Huo Lihui, chief statistician at the bureau's Service Industry Survey Center, with the production index reaching the 50 threshold and new orders rising to 49.2.

High-tech manufacturing stayed in expansion for a tenth straight month at 50.1, even as equipment manufacturing and consumer goods producers slipped below 50. Energy-intensive industries posted a mild rebound to 48.4, up 1.1 percentage points from October.

Business activity for small enterprises recorded a significant rebound. The PMI for small enterprises jumped 2 percentage points to 49.1, its highest in nearly six months, while medium-sized firms edged up to 48.9. Large manufacturers weakened, falling to 49.3.

Market confidence showed a slight uptick. The index measuring expectations for production and operations rose to 53.1. Industries including non-ferrous metal smelting and aerospace-related equipment reported particularly strong sentiment, with readings above 57.

Non-manufacturing activity, covering construction and services, softened, weighed down by services. Huo attributed the decline partly to the fading impact of earlier holiday-driven spending. 

China's Golden Week holiday, which typically lifts travel and consumer spending before activity normalizes in the following months, ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year.

Service-sector activity fell to 49.5,  down 0.6 percentage points from October, though pockets of strength remained: railway transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting and satellite transmission, and financial services all posted readings above 55.

Real estate and residential services continued to lag below the 50 mark, underscoring persistent weakness in property-related activity. Construction activity improved to 49.6, aided by stronger expectations for near-term growth, with that sector's sentiment index climbing to 57.9.

The non-manufacturing new orders index slipped to 45.7, reflecting softer demand. Input prices rose to 50.4, and service-sector sales prices, while still below 50, narrowed their decline.

Manufacturing employment ticked up slightly to 48.4, while non-manufacturing employment rose marginally to 45.3. Supplier delivery times for factories improved to 50.1.

China surveys roughly 3,200 manufacturers and 4,300 non-manufacturing firms for the monthly PMI readings, which are seasonally adjusted and considered a leading indicator for economic momentum.

China's manufacturing activity has contracted since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump launched new tariffs that squeezed producers.

Industrial profits fell 5.5% in October, the sharpest drop since June, reversing the strong gains seen in late summer. Earnings for the first ten months at major industrial firms rose 1.9%, slowing from the January–September pace.

The broader Chinese economy has cooled as growth slipped to 4.8% in the third quarter.

Trade tensions with the U.S. spiked in October as Washington threatened new 100% tariffs before both sides reached a late-month deal in South Korea. The agreement cut U.S. fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% from 20%, paused Beijing's rare-earth controls for a year and reopened China's purchases of American soybeans and other farm goods.

Despite the truce, demand at home remains soft. A drawn-out property slump and weak labor conditions are weighing on consumer spending. Policymakers have signaled a longer-term push to lift consumption and tech self-reliance but have avoided major new stimulus as the economy remains on track to meet its 5% growth target.

For nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left.

Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world.

""I hope this all works out,"" Dioguardi said. ""I have no idea if it will.""

Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. 

As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year.

Dioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad.

""God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,"" Dioguardi said. ""We have nothing like that in our country.""

Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs.

In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%.

He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result.

""There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,"" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. ""But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.""

In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect.

Because the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S.

""The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,"" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades.

Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices.

Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term.

But memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers.

""It's hard,"" Milano said. ""We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'""

Even before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials.

The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029.

Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one.

He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a ""rainbow bridge"" memorial that contains the ashes of pets.

""Cremation has changed our business tremendously,"" Dioguardi said. ""It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.""

If monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits.

To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand.

Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. 

When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry members say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment.

""Forget about making the pyramid,"" Dioguardi said. ""I don't even know if they want a pebble.""

And just like that... December is upon us. 

It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets.

So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year? 

Fidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. 

It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a ""good place"" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. 

The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December. 

But there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, ""fear of missing out."" The central bank warned of ""sharp correlated price adjustments"" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks. 

Crypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the ""halving"" schedule, which happens every four years and ""programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.""

Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end

Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.

In this article

After the search for survivors and recovery of victims in tragic aviation accidents — like that of a UPS cargo plane shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky last month — comes the search for flight data and a cockpit voice recorder often called the ""black box."" 

Every commercial plane has them. Aerospace giants GE Aerospace and Honeywell are among a few companies that design them to be nearly indestructible so they can help investigators understand the cause of a crash. 

""They're very crucial because it's one of the few sources of information that tells us what happened leading up to the accident,"" said Chris Babcock, branch chief of the vehicle recorder division at the National Transportation Safety Board. ""We can get a lot of information from parts and from the airplane."" 

Commercial aircraft have become very complex. A Boeing 787 Dreamliner records thousands of different pieces of information. In the case of the Air India crash in June, data revealed both engine fuel switches were put into a cutoff position within one second of each other. A voice recording from inside the cockpit captured the pilots discussing the cutoffs.

""All of those parameters today can have a very huge impact on the investigation,"" said former NTSB member John Goglia. ""It's our goal to to provide information back to our investigators who are on scene as quick as we can to help move the investigation forward.""

This crucial data can also help prevent future accidents. A crash can cost airlines or plane manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars and leave victims' families with a lifetime of grief.

But in some circumstances black boxes were destroyed or never found. Experts say further developments such as cockpit video recorders and real-time data streaming are needed. 

""The technology is there. Crash worthy cockpit video recorders are already being installed in a lot of helicopters and other types of airplanes, but they're not required,"" said Jeff Guzzetti, aviation analyst and former accident investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB. ""There's privacy and cost issues involving cockpit video recorders but the NTSB has been recommending that the FAA require them for years now.""

Ethereum presently trades around $3,000 following a broader crypto market rebound in the last week. During this time, the market's largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum's outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. 

Ethereum Bulls Buy The Dip After Weak Position Exits

Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum's prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market.

In particular, Ethereum's open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced.

Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. 

XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars' worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market. 

Ethereum Market Outlook

At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,003, reflecting a 0.22% loss in the past day. Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses.

XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto-keen Russians are spending millions of dollars on domestic financial products based on BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds.

That's according to the country's central bank, which, according to the Russian outlet RBC, says that the worth of individual investments in cryptocurrency futures contract funds on the Moscow Exchange, the MOEX, currently totals over $27 million.

The majority of investors are “building small portfolios” of shares in the funds worth up to $6,430, the bank said. But the largest contributions are “made by a few larger-scale investors, whose open positions are worth more than [$1.3 million],” it added.

Considering the funds launched as recently as mid-July, the data points to growing crypto adoption rates in Russia, as investors look for alternatives to international markets.

The bank said it was unconcerned by the development. “Total private investments in Russian financial instruments related to [cryptocurrencies] amount to approximately [$48 million],” the bank said. “This does not pose any systemic risk to the Russian economy.”

The Moscow Exchange launched its first futures contracts, based on share prices of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, in early June.

MOEX followed up with a similar product based on the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF in July.

The central bank also noted, in its quarterly financial stability report, that the volume of Russia-linked trade on overseas crypto exchanges has fallen in recent months.

This drop will come as a surprise to some, with other statistics from Russia pointing to a rise in adoption rates.

At the end of September, it said, the majority of Russian citizens' crypto on overseas crypto exchanges was held in Bitcoin.

The bank thinks Russian citizens collectively hold $7.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, as well as almost $2 billion worth of Ethereum and altcoins worth $2.7 billion.

The central bank compiles its data using a tool named Transparent Blockchain, developed in part by Rosfinmonitoring, the Russian anti-money laundering agency.

The government says Transparent Blockchain lets it analyse the volume of inflows and outflows of funds from Russian citizens' wallets to some of the largest centralized crypto exchanges in the world.

The bank said that it monitored transactions at Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bybit, Gate, HTX, KuCoin, Mexc, OKX, Poloniex, and “several other exchanges popular with Russians.”

However, the bank conceded that there may have been a growth in the number of Russians using decentralised exchanges in recent months. And it said that this may explain the sharp drop in centralized exchanges' Russian user numbers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Animoca's Altcoin Investment Strategy for SMEs: A Critical Perspective","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/animoca-brands-altcoin-investment-strategies","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:46:35 GMT","

Animoca Brands, co-founded by Yat Siu, is advocating for an investment strategy that prioritizes a diverse portfolio of altcoins over solely Bitcoin. Siu believes that the collective performance of altcoins will surpass that of Bitcoin, capturing a larger share of economic activities in the crypto space. This theory is not new; historically, altcoins have surged when Bitcoin's dominance decreases. Siu likens Bitcoin's function in crypto to gold's in traditional finance—valuable, but not the sole player in the game.

The argument for altcoins is rooted in their potential for innovation and the ability to capitalize on emerging trends. Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions, for instance, have significantly outpaced Bitcoin, with Ethereum outperforming it by 72% since April 2025. The driving force? Institutional backing and the growth of decentralized applications.

Allocating a portion of investment into altcoins—around 20-30%—while keeping Bitcoin central could yield better risk-adjusted returns. The approach utilizes dollar-cost averaging and AI tools to navigate market fluctuations, making it more palatable for SMEs that prefer lower risk profiles.

The regions ripe for investment appear to be Ethereum, Layer 2 solutions, and select high-utility altcoins. Projects with real-world applications and those tied to artificial intelligence seem to represent the next phase of growth. Animoca Brands has already invested in over 600 projects across gaming, DeFi, and blockchain infrastructure, suggesting that they are hedging their bets on a diverse range of upcoming projects.

Regulatory red tape poses a significant challenge for fintech startups in Europe. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has established strict compliance measures that can stifle altcoin adoption. For example, a minimum capital requirement of €350,000 and stringent anti-money laundering regulations could limit smaller firms' capabilities.

The licensing timeline can stretch from 6 to 12 months, delaying the launch of any altcoin-related services and potentially leaving smaller outfits at a disadvantage against traditional banks, which may have greater resources for compliance.

A balanced investment strategy is recommended. SMEs should consider diversifying a portion of their portfolio into altcoins while keeping Bitcoin as a significant holding. Regular rebalancing and extensive research into altcoin projects are essential for risk management. Targeting altcoins with genuine use cases and transparent roadmaps could yield better outcomes.

Understanding market cycles is also crucial. Investing in altcoins during periods of diminishing Bitcoin dominance could yield substantial gains.

Animoca Brands emphasizes a diversified investment strategy and the need for institutional engagement, suggesting that a broad approach could prove more beneficial. The planned Nasdaq listing via a reverse merger with Currenc Group may provide access to global capital and institutional investors.

As the market evolves, companies like Animoca could serve as indicators for future altcoin investments. Their focus on integrating Web3 with traditional finance and tokenizing real-world assets suggests a recognition of the necessity for varied revenue streams and use cases within sustainable Web3 infrastructure.

In summary, as the cryptocurrency market moves towards structured investment themes, understanding altcoins and the regulatory landscape will be vital for SMEs. A diversified investment strategy, coupled with an awareness of market trends, may help businesses seize the opportunities that lie ahead in altcoin investment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Tapzi vs. Solana: Which is the Best Altcoin To Buy Now That Benefits From Trump's New Maldives Crypto Resort Plan?","https://coincentral.com/tapzi-vs-solana-which-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-now-that-benefits-from-trumps-new-maldives-crypto-resort-plan/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 16:10:48 GMT","

A surprising wave of crypto activity is coming from an unexpected source: real estate. The Trump Organization, in partnership with a Saudi developer, has unveiled plans for a luxury resort in the Maldives. They plan to tokenize it. Investors could buy digital shares tied to this resort, blending high-end hospitality with blockchain finance.

As tokenized real estate gains attention, many are asking: Which is the best altcoin to buy now that stands to benefit the most? Two very different but powerful contenders emerge: Tapzi (TAPZI), a new gaming-crypto presale, and Solana (SOL), a leading smart-contract blockchain and one of the top altcoins to invest in by its large market cap.

This guide explores both, compares their strengths, and argues why Tapzi (TAPZI) may offer a rare blend of growth and adoption given this moment.

The Trump Organization is partnering with Dar Global, a Saudi-backed developer, to build an 80-villa luxury resort in the Maldives, close to the capital, Malé. What makes this project especially interesting is that they're planning to tokenize ownership. Through blockchain, investors will be able to buy digital tokens that represent fractional shares of the resort; essentially, real estate divided into tradable units.

This isn't just a gimmick. The idea signals a serious shift: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is evolving, and large brands like Trump are leaning in. It's a signal that tokenized investing could become more mainstream, and that could ripple through the altcoin space.

Tapzi (TAPZI) is a skill-to-earn gaming platform built around competitive mini-games. Players stake TAPZI tokens to compete in games like chess, tic-tac-toe, or rock-paper-scissors. The winners earn real rewards, and TAPZI fuels the entire system.



Presale Details:

Tokenomics & Utility:

The best altcoin to invest in today, Tapzi (TAPZI), is designed for long-term engagement. The team has built a non-inflationary staking model. Staking rewards aren't just printed out; they are backed by actual gameplay demand. Players must use TAPZI to enter tournaments, which creates consistent, utility-driven demand.

Roadmap & Market Audience:

Tapzi plans to launch a mobile app, developer SDKs, and global tournaments. Early adopters of this best crypto presale will be gamers, guilds, and competitive players. Because mobile gaming is massive worldwide, Tapzi has a large potential audience.

If real-world tokenization brings more mainstream capital into crypto, that could flow into presales like Tapzi, and early buyers may benefit massively.

Solana (SOL) is one of the most well-known Layer-1 blockchains in crypto. It's fast, scalable, and has gained real traction with developers, DeFi projects, and Web3 games alike.

Strengths & Adoption:

Why Solana Might Ride the Tokenization Wave:

As real-world assets like the Trump Maldives resort get tokenized, blockchains that power those tokenized assets could see rising demand. Solana has the scalability and low cost to support large-scale tokenized real estate, RWA platforms, and high-volume on-chain activity.



Risks & Challenges:

Despite being a high-growth altcoin, Solana has faced network outages and competition from other layer-1s. Moreover, while tokenization is powerful, it will only benefit if RWA platforms choose Solana. Adoption is not guaranteed, and regulatory risks still linger.

Use-Case Fit:

Growth Potential:

Token Demand Dynamics:

Impact of Trump Resort Tokenization:

In summary, if you want big upside and early-stage growth, Tapzi may be the best altcoin to invest in. If you want infrastructure exposure and reliability, Solana remains a powerful long-term bet.

When a major real estate brand tokenizes property, it validates blockchain's utility beyond speculative coins. For crypto native projects, this sends a message: tokenized real-world assets are not a niche but a part of the future. Investors may grow more comfortable allocating capital to new, early-stage tokens if they see real-world financialization happening on-chain.

Enter presale projects like Tapzi, which may benefit from this growing legitimacy. As tokenization becomes more accepted, investors will likely search for high-upside altcoins, especially ones with utility, community, and real use cases. Tapzi may not be a real estate token, but its presale could attract a new wave of crypto users mobilized by trust in on-chain asset innovation.

If you're sold on Tapzi, here's how to get in now:

To stay safe, always verify you're on the real Tapzi website. Never share your seed phrase. Use official community channels to verify links.

No. The tokenization pertains to real estate shares, not TAPZI. The resort's token isn't TAPZI, so you cannot use TAPZI to invest in the resort project directly.

Tapzi expects a listing after the presale and liquidity setup. The presale documentation suggests the listing price may be around $0.01.

There's no strict public cap per user mentioned, but presale allocation is limited. About 20% of the total supply is reserved for presale.

Solana is more mature and battle-tested. Tapzi is a high-risk, high-reward presale. Choose based on risk appetite and investment horizon.

Tokenized real estate has risks: regulation, construction delays, or liquidity issues. That could hurt investor confidence in RWA projects, but not necessarily across unrelated projects like Tapzi or Solana.

The Trump Maldives resort is more than a headline. It's a signal that tokenized real estate is coming, and that real-world assets may shift on-chain. In this context, Tapzi (TAPZI) represents a vibrant, high-upside entry into the world of Web3 gaming, while Solana offers infrastructure exposure for builders and developers.

If you believe that blockchain will power both real estate and play, then Tapzi stands out as the best altcoin to buy now for long term. Combine that with Solana for technical robustness, and you've got a balanced approach to the tokenization era.

In Africa crypto news this week, the Ghana Gold Board is pushing for blockchain implementation in tracking global gold movements.

Meanwhile, in South Africa, the South African Reserve Bank has warned of the stability risk from the country's crypto sector.

Across the border, the University of Namibia has rolled out a novel master's degree in blockchain technology.

Here's a more detailed look at these stories:

The Ghana Gold Board is pushing for blockchain technology usage in tracking gold shipments. This proposal comes even as gold prices continue to break records and demand remains high globally.

Ghana Gold Board CEO Samuel Gyamfi spoke at a high-level Precious Metals Conference in Dubai on the importance of tracking global gold movements. He notes that gold is a valuable resource and cannot be allowed to become a haven for illegal activities.

“Gold is a resource for global economic stability and transformation. It cannot be allowed to become a haven for drug lords, armed actors, corrupt politicians, human traffickers and criminal networks.”

Mineral traceability remains a key concern for law enforcement globally. The worries about illegal mining, the use of child labor in mines, and related crimes inform the need to trace minerals from mines to the markets.

Integrating any of the major blockchains introduces decentralization and immutability, which the Board believes can aid in proper mineral tracing.

Even so, the central bank is wary of the billions held by these exchanges and the borderless nature of the sector.

South Africa has exchange controls that govern traditional banking institutions, but do not affect crypto movements.

The acknowledgement by the industry poses a systemic risk, mostly because it is outside the purview of existing regulations.

This discrepancy presents a reason for the central bank and the legislature to enact common-sense crypto regulations.

In the education sector, the University of Namibia (UNAM) has launched the continent's first master's degree program in blockchain technology.

UNAM aims to become a research and development hub on the continent.

They will partner with the African Blockchain Institute on this initiative. This announcement is the culmination of over two years of work by the institution's IT department to integrate emerging technologies into its curriculum.

The program combines academic rigor and practical application in the leading aspects of the blockchain industry.

Applications are now open through the university's online academic portal. The first cohort of students is expected to chart new horizons in advanced blockchain studies.

For anyone who still thinks about security as guards, fences, and simple alarms, 2025 is a good year to update the mental image. Security now mixes cameras, code, algorithms, and sensors in ways that sound almost like science fiction.​

From small businesses to big companies, protection means watching doors and networks at the same time. Artificial intelligence, biometrics, blockchain, IoT, and even quantum computing are joining forces to keep people, data, and spaces safer.​

Artificial intelligence is becoming the brain behind many security systems. It can look at hours of video or millions of data points much faster than any human and find patterns that feel “odd” or risky.​

In physical security, AI helps smart cameras spot unusual movements or behaviors and send alerts quickly. In digital security, it reviews network traffic, looks for strange connections, and blocks threats in almost real time.​

The key advantage is that AI learns from past incidents. With each attack or suspicious event, models improve, which makes future detection more accurate and reduces the number of false alarms.​

Biometric security, which uses unique traits such fingerprints or faces, has quietly moved from spy movies to daily life. Many phones already unlock with a fingerprint or a face scan instead of a PIN.​

In companies, biometrics is replacing old access cards that can be lost or shared. Employees may enter offices with facial recognition, voice checks, or retina scans, which link access directly to the person, not a plastic badge.​

Online services are also adding biometrics to their login process. Instead of only typing a password, users confirm identity with their finger or face, creating a simple but much stronger protection for banking and other sensitive accounts.​

Blockchain, or chain of blocks, is a technology that stores information in linked records that are hard to change. Once data is written, it becomes extremely difficult to alter without leaving a clear trace.​

This property is useful for security because it helps guarantee that records, contracts, or transaction histories have not been secretly modified. It adds a layer of trust in digital environments where cheating can be hard to see.​

In cybersecurity, blockchain can support secure identity systems, protect logs from tampering, and power “smart contracts” that run automatically only when all conditions are met, reducing the need for middlemen.​

The Internet of Things connects everyday devices to the internet. Cameras, alarms, motion sensors, thermostats, and even lights now talk to each other and to central platforms that watch entire buildings or even whole neighborhoods.​

This connectivity helps security teams see everything from one dashboard. For example, a single app can show camera feeds, door status, and alarm events, and even trigger responses based on predefined rules.​

However, every connected gadget is also a small door that hackers might try to open. If a device has weak passwords or old software, it can become an easy entry point into larger systems.​

Because of this, IoT security needs strong defaults, regular updates, and careful network design. Otherwise, a smart camera meant to protect a building could turn into a risk instead.​

Quantum computing uses the rules of quantum physics to process information in new ways. While still early, it is expected to solve certain problems, including some types of encryption, much faster than normal computers.​

This creates both a promise and a challenge. On one side, quantum tech could enable almost unbreakable encryption for very sensitive data. On the other, it could eventually break many of today's common algorithms.​

Because of this, researchers are already working on “post‑quantum” cryptography. The idea is to design new methods that will stay safe even when quantum computers become powerful enough to threaten older systems.​

Modern security is no longer a one‑layer shield. It is a mix of AI, biometrics, blockchain, IoT, and quantum ideas working together to protect both physical and digital worlds.​ As these technologies grow, companies and users will need to stay informed and proactive. The tools are more powerful than ever, but so are the threats, so smart use and constant updates will be part of everyday security life.

Core Scientific, Bitdeer Technologies Group,  and Figure Technology Solutions are the three Blockchain stocks to watch today, according to MarketBeat's stock screener tool. Blockchain stocks are shares of publicly traded companies whose business revolves around developing, providing, or using blockchain technology—or that derive significant revenue from blockchain-related activities (for example, cryptocurrency miners, exchanges, blockchain software developers, or firms offering blockchain-based services). Stock market investors buy these shares to gain exposure to the potential growth of blockchain and crypto ecosystems without owning cryptocurrencies directly, while taking on company-specific, market, and regulatory risks. These companies had the highest dollar trading volume of any Blockchain stocks within the last several days.

Key Takeaways

Solana ETFs saw $419M inflows in November, validating SOL's appeal as a high-yield staking asset.

Solana's SIMD-0411 proposes double disinflation, cutting 22M SOL emissions for long-term token scarcity.

Critical economic conflict: Solana must choose between scarcity from disinflation and maintaining high staking yield for ETF success.

Solana ETFs (SOL) have attracted record net inflows in November, making them the single-largest draw in the crypto market. This institutional success, largely fueled by the network's attractive staking yield, is now colliding with a new governance proposal to execute a double disinflation.

Managing a recent 30% price correction, Solana now faces a critical choice: embrace long-term scarcity and reshape its economic identity, or maintain the high yield that is currently driving its institutional gold rush.

Helius Labs recently introduced the SIMD-0411 proposal, marking one of the most substantial monetary policies proposed since Solana's launch. Developers plan to double the network's annual disinflation rate, increasing it from 15% to 30%. The accelerated timeline brings the target date for the terminal 1.5% inflation rate forward by three years. This change cuts total projected emissions by over 22 million SOL (approximately $3 billion) over the next six years.

big

solana inflation reduction proposal is now live

tl;dr — we are proposing to speed up the existing solana disinflation rate by 2x

no complex mechanisms and no adverse cuts, and after alpenglow (and vote reduction)

we don't need to leak this value

— mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) November 21, 2025



Source: Solana Floor

Proponents maintain that the network is mature, citing massive increases in both network revenue and DeFi throughput. They argue this growth justifies lowering the issuance schedule, which in turn reduces structural sell pressure and satisfies institutional demands for disciplined tokenomics.

The drive to create scarcity is taking place during a period of intense market difficulty affecting Solana's price. Forward Industries, the largest corporate owner of SOL, is currently facing an estimated loss of $646.6 million. Upexi, the fifth-largest corporate SOL holder, has accrued approximately $31 million in unrealized losses, reflecting a 10% drop from its original purchase prices. In contrast, DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV), the proposal's first major supporter, maintains a $62 million profit.

In the meantime, market flow data for November strongly validates Solana's appeal as a “productive yield asset.” While major assets saw massive redemptions, Solana ETFs attracted $419.38 million in fresh capital. To be more specific, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed $3.57 billion in net redemptions, and Ether ETFs lost $1.56 billion during the same period.

In other words, investors increasingly choose the steady income of Solana's 5 – 7% native staking yield over the purely speculative nature of assets like Bitcoin, whose exchange-traded products offer no yield. Everstake co-founder Bohdan Opryshko explains that retail and institutional participants now treat SOL as an income-generating tool rather than simply a speculative trade.

Data from Coinbase confirms that a compelling 67% of all circulating SOL is in staking, a ratio that Sebastien Gilquin, Head of BD and Partnerships at Trezor, cites as one of the strongest staking profiles among proof-of-stake blockchains. Total staked SOL climbed this year to 407 million, and retail delegators increased their holdings by over 238,000 SOL even during the 30% downturn.

The data sets create a critical economic conflict. Solana's ETFs success hinges on the high yield, which depends on the current inflation rate. Yet, SIMD-0411 seeks to cut the inflation rate in half to achieve scarcity.

If the community approves the double disinflation plan, the resulting reduction in emissions will cut the staking yield, potentially halving the rate that currently protects SOL from the market outflows hurting its competitors.

Key Takeaways

Ethereum Whales are aggressively accumulating ETH, setting a new record and signaling a strong high-conviction price floor.

Binance ETH reserves plummeted while stablecoin reserves hit $42B, creating a “coiled spring” rally setup.

Low ETH supply and record USDT buying power suggests “armed patience,” likely fueling the next major market upside.

Crypto market analysis currently shows a critical divergence in on-chain data, indicating strong potential for a significant upside move. Recent findings confirm that influential Ethereum Whales are aggressively accumulating ETH, which pushed their total holdings to a historic high. Simultaneously, Binance has seen ETH reserves plummeting, while stablecoin reserves surged to a new record.

Ethereum's most influential market participants have shifted their strategy toward aggressive long-term accumulation. Data identifies holders with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH as the primary drivers of this trend. The influential group recently pushed their total balance past 21 million ETH, setting a new record and a strong accumulation wave.

Mid-cap whales used recent months to increase their holdings. Such a demographic often acts as a leading indicator for broader market trends. Their refusal to sell, combined with active buying, establishes a high-conviction floor for the asset.

Confidence extends beyond the mid-cap tier to the largest entities in the ecosystem. The “mega-whale” cohort, defined as addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH, has expanded its balance to approximately 4.3 million ETH. This rise reflects a decisive shift in sentiment among institutional and highly liquid investors.

In the past, when these huge groups buy, it comes before a strong price support level. These bases often act as starting points for big market rallies as the investors see current prices as a good deal. By locking away millions of ETH, they cut the supply available for trading.

Data from Binance, the world's largest exchange, backs up the bullish idea. Since August 15th, the exchange has seen a big difference in money flows. In just a few months, Ethereum reserves on Binance nearly dropped by half. The total value fell from over 20 billion to under 11 billion. The actual number of Ethereum tokens dropped to 3.764 million ETH in November. Investors clearly prefer cold storage or staking instead of keeping assets on exchanges.

While volatile assets leave exchanges, stablecoins are flooding in. The inflow creates a strong opposite trend. Tether (USDT) reserves across TRC20 and ERC20 networks on Binance surged from 26 billion to a record-breaking 42 billion.

This metric serves as the key to understanding the current market sentiment. Traders have taken profits during previous peaks but have not exited the crypto ecosystem. Instead of leaving, they put cash into stablecoins right on the exchange. The USDT setup shows that traders are not bearish; they are waiting for the right moment.

The data mix creates a “coiled spring” effect in the market. Two strong forces now meet: a dropping supply of assets for sale (BTC and ETH) and an all-time high in buying power (USDT reserves). Market players currently show “armed patience.” Investors wait for a specific sign, such as a price dip or better economic news, to use this money. When this cash floods the market, it chases a small supply of coins.

Thus, the on-chain signs give a clear outlook: The market looks quiet but holds lots of cash. Whales act with conviction by removing supply, while traders stand ready with record levels of stablecoin capital. This structure typically precedes significant market volatility favoring the upside. As the supply of Ethereum and Bitcoin disappears into cold storage, the $42 billion in stablecoin reserves will likely fuel the next big market growth.

South Africans will not see a digital version of the rand for everyday use anytime soon, as the South African Reserve Bank has decided there is no strong case right now for launching a retail central bank digital currency. In a new position paper released this week, the central bank says while the tech works and could fit with rules, other fixes to the payment system should come first. This choice shows a careful step in a world where digital money is becoming more common, but cash still plays a big part in daily life here.

The paper, put out on 26 November 2025 along with a background note, looks at how a retail CBDC could act like a digital banknote for people to pay shops or each other. The SARB's view comes after years of tests and talks, and it points to bigger plans for a wholesale CBDC aimed at banks and markets. As the country deals with tough money issues like high costs and uneven access to banking, this update gives a clear path forward for digital changes without rushing into big shifts.

A retail CBDC is basically a digital banknote, set in the national money unit, that folks can use to pay businesses, shops, or one another. It is different from a wholesale CBDC, which is for deals between banks to settle trades in money markets. At its heart, a retail CBDC tries to copy normal cash but in digital shape, the SARB explains.

The study zeroed in on if this digital cash could add to physical notes, especially as payments go more online and money inclusion stays a problem. The SARB ran research and trials to see if it is doable and fits with rules and goals. They found it is technically possible and could be set up to match what the country needs.

But the paper stresses that cash is still key in South Africa. About 16% of adults have no bank account, and many rely on notes and coins because of things like poor networks, power cuts, high fees, and shops that set minimums for card swipes. Cash gives a sense of control and acts as a safety net when times are hard, keeping trust in the money system.

The SARB's research and tests showed a retail CBDC is doable and could line up with rules and aims. “The SARB's research and experimentation found that a retail CBDC is technically feasible and could be implemented in a way that aligns with regulatory and policy objectives,” the bank states. Yet, the check did not show a big need right now for this tool.

Instead, the bank says to keep pushing plans like the Payment Ecosystem Modernisation Programme and letting non-banks join the national payment system. “However, the analysis does not reveal a strong immediate need for such an instrument. Instead, the SARB concluded that ongoing initiatives such as the Payment Ecosystem Modernisation Programme and expanding non-bank participation in the national payment system should remain the priority in the short- to medium-term,” it adds.

These steps aim to make payments better without a new digital currency. For example, things like growing PayShap's use, linking different money stores, letting non-banks issue e-money, setting QR code standards, and starting an open banking setup are seen as key. The SARB thinks these will help more people use digital payments and cut gaps in access.

Proof shows big growth in digital payments in South Africa, driven by banks, fintechs, and public efforts. “From the research and analysis conducted as part of this study, there is evidence of significant growth in the adoption and use of digital payments in South Africa. This has been driven by innovative solutions introduced by commercial banks, fintechs and the efforts of the SARB and other public sector agencies and partners,” the bank notes. It expects more South Africans to switch to digital as these get better.Still, cash holds strong for some groups due to barriers like spotty infrastructure and costs. 

“Notwithstanding the progress made, evidence also shows that physical cash continues to play a significant role in South Africa, particularly for certain segments of the population. This prevailing cash reliance is due to barriers such as infrastructure availability, costs of digital payments and network and power issues,” the SARB says.

Looking ahead, the SARB sees a possible need for a retail CBDC to keep public access to central bank money, which is vital in a digital world. It could also open doors to improve payments and spark new money ideas in South Africa. “In the longer-term, there may be a need for a retail CBDC to safeguard public access to central bank money − a public good that remains essential in a digital economy; and unlock opportunities to complement and enhance the existing payments landscape while supporting broader financial innovation in South Africa,” the paper states.

Central bank money is top-quality, cutting risks and making payments smooth. Being able to swap private money for safe public money builds trust and stops money troubles. “Central bank money plays a crucial role in the financial system for two primary reasons: it represents the highest quality of money, reducing risk and enhancing payment system efficiency, and its accessibility through convertibility with commercial bank money fosters trade efficiency and mitigates financial instability in a dual money system,” the SARB explains.

Keeping a mix of central and private money is key for best trade. “Balancing access to both central bank and commercial bank money is essential for maximising trade efficiency,” it adds. The bank warns not to see this as saying no to a retail CBDC forever. “The conclusion of the study should not be interpreted as a view that South Africa should not implement a retail CBDC in future,” it stresses.

Speculative activities in virtual currencies have resurfaced, PBOC statement warns after multi-department regulatory meeting

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) held a coordination meeting on virtual currency regulation on Friday with a coalition of top regulatory and law enforcement agencies, according to a statement released by the central bank on Saturday.

“Business activities related to virtual currencies constitute illegal financial activities,” the statement said.

“Stablecoins are a form of virtual currency, and currently cannot effectively meet requirements for customer identification and anti-money-laundering,” it added, warning that they posed risks of being exploited for illegal purposes such as fundraising fraud and unauthorised cross-border fund transfers.

The meeting included officials from 12 other departments, including the Ministry of Public Security, Central Financial Commission, Ministry of Justice and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It noted that speculative activities in virtual currencies had recently resurfaced.

According to the PBOC statement, the authorities emphasised that these currencies did not have the same legal status as fiat currency and “should not and cannot” be used in market circulation, while vowing to quash related illicit activities.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","China's Central Bank Reiterates Digital Asset Ban","https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-central-bank-reiterates-digital-asset-ban/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:30:06 GMT","

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has reaffirmed its commitment against cryptocurrency trading after confirming a resurgence in market speculation. The Chinese apex bank is nudging several government institutions to strengthen their crackdown on business and financial activities involving virtual currencies and curb related illegal operations.


In 2021, China issued a ban on all cryptocurrency trading and mining activities, citing a potential threat to the nation's financial stability and energy control system. Prior to this policy, the Asian giant had been one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs with the highest mining activity in the world. Four years later, the PBOC has reiterated this hostile stance against virtual assets despite a significant increase in cryptocurrency adoption and regulation globally. This development came on November 28, 2025, in a meeting centered on “The Coordination Mechanism for Combating Cryptocurrency Trading Speculation.”

Notably, this policy discussion involved representatives from 13 government departments and agencies, including the Ministry of Justice, the State Financial Regulatory Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, among others. While the PBOC acknowledged the steadfast implementation of the government's “Notice on Further Preventing and Handling Risks of Virtual Currency Trading and Speculation” issued in 2021, they also highlighted an increase in trading speculations and related illicit activities, requiring new methods for risk prevention and control. 

In particular, the meeting reaffirmed that no form of cryptocurrencies qualifies as a legal tender, including stablecoins, which they claim still fail to satisfy certain regulatory requirements.

The statement read:

Virtual currency-related business activities constitute illegal financial activities. Stablecoins are a form of virtual currency, and currently cannot effectively meet requirements for customer identification and anti-money laundering, posing a risk of being used for illegal activities such as money laundering, fundraising fraud, and illegal cross-border fund transfers.

Moving forward, the People's Bank of China admonished all concerned government institutions to bolster regulatory actions in enforcing the existing prohibitive policy on cryptocurrencies and all related criminal actions, in line with President Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. 

The directive read:

All units should deepen coordination and cooperation, improve regulatory policies and legal basis, focus on key links such as information flow and capital flow, strengthen information sharing, further enhance monitoring capabilities, severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities, protect the property safety of the people, and maintain the stability of the economic and financial order.

At the time of writing, the total market crypto cap stands at $3.06, reflecting a 0.12% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, total trading volume is down 32.95% to $81.28 billion.

China's central bank has repeated its stance that digital assets hold no legal status in the country, issuing one of its toughest warnings since the 2021 ban on trading and mining. Following a meeting involving thirteen government agencies, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said it will continue to clamp down on all forms of digital asset activity and highlighted renewed concerns about speculative trading.

“Virtual currencies do not have the same legal status as fiat currencies, lack legal tender status, and should not and cannot be used as currency in the market,” the PBoC stated. The bank added that it would “severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities,” signaling that authorities are monitoring what they described as a “resurfacing” of digital asset speculation.

Officials said the nationwide ban enacted in September 2021 had “rectified the chaos in the virtual currency market” and produced “significant results,” but warned that new forms of trading and cross-border activity continue to appear through informal channels.

Stablecoins received the strongest criticism in the PBoC's statement. Officials said they fail to meet anti-money-laundering and customer-identification rules, pointing to concerns around fraudulent fundraising, illegal cross-border transfers and underground payments.

The central bank called them a threat to financial security, arguing that their structure and circulation make enforcement difficult. This mirrors previous concerns raised by senior Chinese policymakers, including a warning from former PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan earlier this year. In a closed-door seminar, Zhou said: “Be wary of the risk of stablecoins being overused for asset speculation, as a deviation in direction could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system.”

Although China bans crypto trading and mining on the mainland, stablecoin usage through offshore platforms has persisted. Authorities appear focused on limiting these channels, especially where payments or asset transfers bypass capital-control rules.

The regulatory split between mainland China and Hong Kong remains one of the most closely watched developments in the region. While Beijing continues to enforce its nationwide ban, Hong Kong has pursued a licensing regime for exchanges and stablecoin issuers. Its model has drawn global firms and has been viewed as a controlled testing ground for digital-asset regulation.

However, Beijing has recently tightened supervision over Hong Kong's more open framework. In September, mainland authorities told several major brokerages to pause real-world asset tokenization projects. In October, officials moved to stop some Chinese tech companies from issuing their own stablecoins in the city, according to earlier reports.

The PBoC's latest comments suggest that any digital-asset activity connected to mainland firms or users—even through Hong Kong—will face added pressure.

While China keeps private digital assets outside the formal financial system, the government continues to expand the digital yuan project. More than 225 million personal wallets have been opened since the pilot began, and trials now include public-sector payments, transport networks and retail integrations.

The contrast is deliberate: private crypto is restricted, but state-backed digital currency is promoted as the sanctioned alternative for digital payments and programmable money. Friday's message reinforces that distinction and points to a regulatory approach where the digital yuan fills the space private tokens are not permitted to occupy.

China's stance leaves little room for change in the near term. Authorities show no sign of easing the ban, and stablecoins are now described in security terms rather than consumer-risk or market-risk language. Any remaining crypto activity routed through offshore platforms or intermediaries is likely to come under closer examination.

The most immediate impact falls on firms trying to operate between Hong Kong's regulatory framework and mainland expectations. Beijing's signals suggest that even legally licensed activity in Hong Kong may face constraints if it involves Chinese users, Chinese companies or cross-border token flows.

As other global jurisdictions experiment with regulated stablecoin frameworks, China continues to draw a firm line: private digital assets stay outside the financial system, while the digital yuan advances within it.

Brazil's central bank just tightened the screws on cryptocurrency trading with new regulations that could reshape how millions of Latin Americans use digital assets—particularly stablecoins that have become a popular workaround for traditional banking systems.

The long-awaited rules, announced on Nov. 11, will extend existing anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regulations to virtual-asset service providers starting in February. For a country where crypto adoption has exploded in recent years, this is the most significant regulatory shift since Brazil approved its cryptocurrency legal framework in 2022.

The timing isn't coincidental. Brazilian Central Bank Governor Gabriel Galipolo has raised concerns about the growing use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar—that are often associated with illicit activity

“New rules will reduce the scope for scams, fraud, and the use of virtual asset markets for money laundering,” central bank Director of Regulation Gilneu Vivan said at a press conference, Reuters reported.

Here's what makes stablecoins particularly tricky from a regulatory standpoint: they're less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making them more useful for payments than investments. Many users have gravitated toward them specifically to bypass more heavily supervised and taxed traditional payment systems—which is exactly what policymakers want to prevent.

The updated regulations will treat stablecoin transactions similarly to traditional currency exchanges. Buying, selling or swapping virtual assets tied to government-issued currencies will fall under foreign exchange rules, according to Reuters. Cross-border payments using digital assets—including card purchases and other electronic payment methods—will receive the same regulatory treatment.

This isn't just semantic hairsplitting. By reclassifying these transactions as foreign exchange operations, Brazil's central bank is bringing them under the same regulatory umbrella as traditional currency exchanges—complete with customer protection requirements, transparency standards, and compliance obligations.

The new framework will require virtual-asset service providers to meet standards around corporate oversight, security protocols, internal monitoring systems, and mandatory disclosures to regulators, according to Reuters. Authorization processes will now cover foreign-exchange and securities brokers, distributors, and virtual-asset service providers.

Brazil's moves matter beyond its borders. As Latin America's largest economy, regulatory decisions made in Brasilia often influence policy discussions throughout the region. The country held four public consultations before finalizing these rules, suggesting authorities were trying to strike a balance between innovation and oversight.

The central bank's statement emphasized that the framework includes customer protection requirements and transparency standards that previously didn't apply to virtual-asset service providers. For legitimate crypto users, these protections could actually increase confidence in the ecosystem by weeding out bad actors.

But for those who turned to stablecoins specifically to avoid traditional banking oversight, February marks the end of that regulatory arbitrage. The new rules are a clear signal that Brazilian authorities view unregulated crypto activity as a systemic risk worth addressing—even if it means slowing down an industry that has seen explosive growth.

The question now is whether other Latin American countries follow Brazil's lead in closing what has become a significant regulatory gap in the global financial system.

The landscape for crypto payroll platforms is changing quickly, spurred on by demands for compliance, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. With businesses leaning towards using cryptocurrencies for payroll, these platforms are fast becoming vital in managing employee compensation in a more decentralized economy. The rise of remote work and gig economies has only added to the urgency for flexible payment solutions that can deal with diverse workforces scattered across borders.

These crypto payroll platforms aren't just about paying employees in digital currencies; they also come with features like automated tax reporting, adherence to local regulations, and the capability to integrate with existing financial systems. This adaptation is especially crucial in regions like Europe and Asia, where regulatory frameworks are tightening up, forcing these platforms to evolve swiftly to remain within legal boundaries while still offering innovative services.

As regulatory attention ramps up, crypto payroll platforms are ensuring their operations align with frameworks like the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. These adjustments include establishing solid Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and automatic tax reporting systems to comply with various jurisdictions.

For example, platforms catering to gig workers in Europe are obtaining MiCA licenses and complying with the Platform Work Directive, which necessitates tracking transactions and confirming worker identities. This proactive stance reduces risks linked to money laundering and fraud and enhances transparency, thus building user trust.

In Asia, where many people are still unbanked, crypto payroll solutions are presenting themselves as a legitimate alternative to conventional banking systems. By using stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, these platforms are providing unbanked individuals with financial services, which contributes to financial inclusion.

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology is changing the game for crypto payroll systems by ramping up privacy and compliance. ZKPs enable companies to validate payroll transactions without revealing sensitive info like employee identities or salary amounts. This cryptographic mechanism keeps payroll processes under wraps while still meeting regulatory standards.

The advantages of incorporating ZKP in crypto payroll are numerous:

Enhanced Privacy: ZKPs validate payroll transactions without exposing individual salaries or identities, addressing the inherent conflict between transparency and privacy in public ledgers.

Regulatory Assurance: Companies can prove they're adhering to tax and labor laws without exposing personal payroll data, which simplifies audits and mitigates compliance risks.

Security and Trust: ZKPs build trust among employees and stakeholders by cryptographically proving payroll correctness without compromising confidentiality.

Scalability: ZKP solutions can handle large volumes of payroll transactions efficiently, making them particularly useful for decentralized organizations with global teams.

In short, incorporating ZKP technology into crypto payroll systems helps companies keep data confidential, comply with laws, and scale operations globally without losing transparency.

Stablecoin payments play a vital role in enhancing financial inclusion for unbanked populations, especially in Asia. With many people having smartphones, stablecoins allow direct access to digital financial services via mobile wallets, bypassing the traditional banking infrastructure that often leaves low-income individuals out.

Key points on how stablecoins encourage financial inclusion include:

Mobile Wallet Access: Stablecoins available through mobile wallets enable unbanked individuals to take part in digital financial activities without needing a bank account, enabling peer-to-peer payments and remittances.

Cost Efficiency and Speed: Stablecoins lower transaction fees and speed up payment processing compared to traditional banks, making payments more affordable for low-income users.

Stability of Currency: Stablecoins, being pegged to stable assets, lessen the risks posed by volatile local currencies, encouraging savings and digital financial activity.

Programmability and Financial Services: Smart contracts provide programmable payments, supporting small businesses and informal workers in securing credit and automated payments.

Regulatory Support and Adoption: Progressive regulatory frameworks in regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are building trust and institutional adoption, further bolstering the stablecoin ecosystem.

By providing unbanked populations with affordable, stable digital payment options, stablecoins enable new financial services and cross-border economic participation that traditional banking systems often ignore.

For investors eyeing crypto payroll solutions, several factors are worth considering:

Regulatory Compliance: As regulations tighten, platforms prioritizing compliance are likely to have a competitive edge. Understanding how platforms adapt is essential for evaluating their long-term potential.

Tech Innovation: The integration of technologies like ZKPs can boost security and privacy, making platforms more appealing to businesses focused on data protection.

Market Demand: The growing trend of remote work and gig economies is pushing for flexible payroll solutions. Platforms that cater to these needs are well-positioned for growth.

Financial Inclusion: Platforms utilizing stablecoins to improve financial access for unbanked populations offer a significant opportunity for impact investing.

Long-Term Potential: Investors should assess the sustainability of crypto payroll platforms, considering their adaptability to market changes and technological advancements.

To sum up, the intersection of crypto payroll, regulatory compliance, and technological innovation is defining the future of financial transactions. As more businesses and employees opt for these solutions, the potential for growth and transformation in the payroll landscape is huge. Crypto payroll platforms are more than a trend; they are shaping a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) companies have been making headlines in recent weeks, and often for the wrong reasons.

A sharp decline in crypto markets and over 40% slump (as of Nov. 27) in the share price of the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, Strategy (MSTR), this year, has led some to question the sustainability of these companies.

Strategy's steep underperformance relative to bitcoin (down about 2% this year) in recent months may be due to looming index-inclusion risk rather than crypto-market dynamics, according to Wall Street bank JPMorgan. However, the downturn in the share price of MSTR and other bitcoin DATs still raises the question: Is the bitcoin digital asset treasury model broken? 

According to Elliot Chun, managing partner at investment bank Architect Partners, it's the opposite. 

""This is the most exciting period for BTC DATs yet because in real time, we are seeing and will see which DATs will be able to successfully maneuver and communicate through this first 'macro' price move lower,"" Chun said in an interview with CoinDesk.

""We are still so early, as an industry, we haven't even properly categorized the DAT category yet, so it's impossible to say if the model is broken,"" he added.

Chun breaks the bitcoin DAT landscape into four broad groups now unfolding in real time. 

“Pure play"" DATs which direct nearly all corporate resources toward maximizing a bitcoin-denominated outcome, often BTC per share. “Producing"" DATs that actually generate bitcoin through operations like mining. “Hybrid"" DATs that treat the crypto as a primary pillar but still run non-BTC initiatives, and “participating"" DATs that simply hold the digital asset on their balance sheet and leverage it as a capital markets tool. 

As these categories experiment publicly, failures are inevitable, but according to Chun, that's standard for any emerging corporate or capital-markets model.

What all bitcoin DATs must ultimately solve, Chun notes, is revenue: how to generate yield or cash flow, whether denominated in BTC or otherwise. And not all will make it. 

He expects that within five years, half of today's pure play, producing and hybrid DATs will disappear through failure, delisting, mergers or acquisitions. 

About 35% will survive without outperforming, 10% will beat major market indices like the S&P 500, and the top 5% could challenge the Magnificent Seven's decade-long run, returning more than 700% between 2025 and 2034, Chun said.

Can these companies withstand a true downturn? It depends on how one defines 'severe.' If the recent pullback counts, Chun expects most DATs to make it through. The real test will be deeper macro stress, where operational clarity, treasury discipline and a credible plan will separate survivors from targets.

So what comes next for this industry? Just like any other industry that rises in breakneck speed during a bull run and starts to crumble during a downturn, it's consolidation.

The firms blending TradFi discipline with bitcoin-native understanding will craft messages that resonate with investors and position themselves to raise and deploy capital effectively. And those that can't, will be acquired, often by other DATs, Chun said.

Over the longer term, he expects the strongest performers to become acquisition targets for the world's largest public companies as the bitcoin price marches toward $1 million and corporate treasuries increasingly view BTC as a strategic, rather than speculative, asset.

The current bear market (and stop saying ""zoom out,"" it's a bear market), though, has some in traditional finance sharpening their nails yet again.

During the sleepy session the day before Americans celebrated Thanksgiving, S&P Global slashed the rating on Tether's USDT from 4 to 5, the weakest level on its stablecoin stability scale (yes, the agency whose ratings shenanigans helped enable the global financial crisis has a stablecoin stability scale).

Behind the downgrade were usual concerns about the opacity of Tether's reporting combined with something somewhat new: bitcoin now compromises more than 5% of the reserves backing USDT — thus continued declines in BTC's price could lead to potential undercollateralization.

""We wear your loathing with pride,"" said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, shortly after the S&P move. Taking note of the well-trodden previous failures of ratings agency models, Ardoino said, ""the traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system ... Tether instead built the first overcapitalized company in the financial industry, with no toxic reserves."" 

Tether, he concluded, ""is living proof that the traditional financial system is so broken that it's becoming feared by the emperors with no clothes.""

Possibly attempting to be helpful or maybe just trying to flame, well-known angel investor Jason Calacanis took to X over the weekend to offer his advice. 

""Tether has a lot left to clean up, but they're getting close,"" said Calacanis. He urged Tether to 1) sell all of its bitcoin, 2) own only U.S. treasuries, and 3) get not just one, but two audits done by American firms.

The Calacanis post drew a fast and fiery response from bitcoiners, with the general reaction being the absurdity of a stablecoin/bitcoin company swapping its relatively small holdings of BTC for government paper. Several drew attention to Calacanis' panicky request for a bailout of all bank deposits as Silicon Valley Bank was failing in March 2023, in part thanks to a plunge in value of U.S. Treasuries it was holding.

Fair enough. But even if Tether holds onto its bitcoin, what about a traditional audit? On that subject, Calacanis was later joined by popular financial blogger Quoth the Raven, a longtime gold bug who began coming around to bitcoin in 2024.

""I've been in this game long enough to know that when a company refuses to furnish a full, independent audit, it's never because things are pristine and they just forgot to schedule one,"" wrote QTR. ""I've found only ever one reason an outfit digs in its heels and won't submit to an audit when everyone requests one. And it's not a good reason.""

""Markets have a long, bloody track record of chewing up the naïve,"" he continued. ""[An audit is] the bare f---ing minimum anyone should demand from an entity issuing tens of billions in synthetic dollars that underpin entire markets.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why some memories last a lifetime while others fade fast","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251130050712.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 11:15:07 GMT","

Every day, the brain turns passing impressions, creative sparks, and emotional experiences into lasting memories that shape our identity and guide our decisions. A central question in neuroscience has been how the brain determines which pieces of information are worth storing and how long those memories should remain.

Recent findings show that long-term memories form through a sequence of molecular timing mechanisms that activate across different parts of the brain. Using a virtual reality behavioral system in mice, scientists identified regulatory factors that help move memories into increasingly stable states or allow them to fade entirely.

A study published in Nature highlights how several brain regions work together to reorganize memories over time, with checkpoints that help assess how significant each memory is and how durable it should be.

""This is a key revelation because it explains how we adjust the durability of memories,"" says Priya Rajasethupathy, head of the Skoler Horbach Family Laboratory of Neural Dynamics and Cognition. ""What we choose to remember is a continuously evolving process rather than a one-time flipping of a switch.""

Moving Beyond the Classic Memory Model

For many years, researchers focused on two primary memory centers: the hippocampus, which supports short-term memory, and the cortex, which was believed to store long-term memories. These long-term memories were thought to sit behind biological on-and-off switches.

""Existing models of memory in the brain involved transistor-like memory molecules that act as on/off switches,"" says Rajasethupathy.

This older view suggested that once a memory was marked for long-term storage, it would persist indefinitely. Although this framework provided useful insights, it did not explain why some long-term memories last for weeks while others remain vivid for decades.

A Key Pathway Linking Short and Long-Term Memory

In 2023, Rajasethupathy and colleagues described a brain circuit that connects short-term and long-term memory systems. A central element of this pathway is the thalamus, which helps determine which memories should be kept and directs them to the cortex for long-term stabilization.

These discoveries opened the door to deeper questions: What happens to memories once they leave the hippocampus, and what molecular processes decide whether a memory becomes lasting or disappears?

Virtual Reality Experiments Reveal Memory Persistence

To investigate these mechanisms, the team built a virtual reality setup that allowed mice to form specific memories. ""Andrea Terceros, a postdoc in my lab, created an elegant behavioral model allowed us to break open this problem in a new way,"" Rajasethupathy says. ""By varying how often certain experiences were repeated, we were able to get the mice to remember some things better than others, and then look into the brain to see what mechanisms were correlated with memory persistence.""

Correlation alone could not answer the key questions, so co-lead Celine Chen created a CRISPR-based screening platform to alter gene activity in the thalamus and cortex. This approach showed that removing certain molecules changed how long memories lasted, and each molecule operated on its own timescale.

Timed Programs Guide Memory Stability

The results indicate that long-term memory relies not on a single on/off switch, but on a sequence of gene-regulating programs that unfold like molecular timers across the brain.

Early timers activate quickly but fade fast, allowing memories to disappear. Later timers turn on more gradually, giving important experiences the structural support needed to persist. In this study, repetition served as a stand-in for importance, letting researchers compare frequently repeated contexts with those seen only occasionally.

The team identified three transcriptional regulators essential for maintaining memories: Camta1 and Tcf4 in the thalamus, and Ash1l in the anterior cingulate cortex. These molecules are not required to form the initial memory but are crucial for preserving it. Disrupting Camta1 and Tcf4 weakened connections between the thalamus and cortex and caused memory loss.

According to the model, memory formation begins in the hippocampus. Camta1 and its downstream targets help keep that early memory intact. Over time, Tcf4 and its targets activate to strengthen cell adhesion and structural support. Finally, Ash1l promotes chromatin remodeling programs that reinforce memory stability.

""Unless you promote memories onto these timers, we believe you're primed to forget it quickly,"" Rajasethupathy says.

Shared Memory Mechanisms Across Biology

Ash1l is part of a protein family known as histone methyltransferases, which help maintain memory-like functions in other systems. ""In the immune system, these molecules help the body remember past infections; during development, those same molecules help cells remember that they've become a neuron or muscle and maintain that identity long-term,"" Rajasethupathy says. ""The brain may be repurposing these ubiquitous forms of cellular memory to support cognitive memories.""

These discoveries may eventually help researchers address memory-related diseases. Rajasethupathy suggests that, by understanding the gene programs that preserve memory, scientists may be able to redirect memory pathways around damaged brain regions in conditions such as Alzheimer's. ""If we know the second and third areas that are important for memory consolidation, and we have neurons dying in the first area, perhaps we can bypass the damaged region and let healthy parts of the brain take over,"" she says.

Next Steps: Decoding the Memory Timer System

Rajasethupathy's team now aims to uncover how these molecular timers are activated and what determines their duration. This includes investigating how the brain evaluates the importance of a memory and decides how long it should last. Their work continues to point toward the thalamus as a central hub in this decision-making process.

""We're interested in understanding the life of a memory beyond its initial formation in the hippocampus,"" Rajasethupathy says. ""We think the thalamus, and its parallel streams of communication with cortex, are central in this process.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dinosaur mummy found with hooves and a hidden crest","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251129044518.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 08:47:57 GMT","

In a new paper in Science, researchers from the University of Chicago describe how, about 66 million years ago, the bodies of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus annectens were transformed into remarkably detailed dinosaur ""mummies"" that preserved tiny features of skin, scales, and hooves. The team names the process ""clay templating."" In this process, the outer soft tissues of the animal were preserved as a delicate clay coating that settled over the skeleton after burial, forming a mask less than 1/100th of an inch thick.

With a combination of advanced imaging methods, the scientists were able to recreate what the dinosaur would have looked like in life. Their reconstruction reveals a tall crest running along the neck and torso, a row of spikes down the tail, and hooves that enclosed the toes. When these results are combined with fossilized footprints, the overall appearance of this duck-billed dinosaur, long speculated about but never documented with this level of precision, becomes much clearer.

""It's the first time we've had a complete, fleshed-out view of a large dinosaur that we can really feel confident about,"" said senior author Paul Sereno, PhD, Professor of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at UChicago. ""The badlands in Wyoming where the finds were made is a unique 'mummy zone' that has more surprises in store from fossils collected over years of visits by teams of university undergrads.""

Rediscovering Wyoming's dinosaur ""mummy zone""

Using old field photographs and careful detective work, Sereno and his colleagues retraced the locations in east-central Wyoming where several classic dinosaur mummies had first been uncovered in the early 1900s. They mapped a compact ""mummy zone"" within these rock layers, which represent stacked river sands.

In this area, the team excavated two new Edmontosaurus mummies, a younger individual and a somewhat older one, both preserving large, continuous patches of the external skin surface. These fossils provided crucial pieces needed to build a full, fleshy profile of the animal.

Sereno emphasizes that these dinosaur mummies are very different from human-created mummies in Egyptian tombs; none of the original organic material is still present. In both the newly described specimens and earlier examples labeled as mummies (including those found at the same site in the 20th century), the preserved skin, spikes, and hooves exist not as tissue but as an extremely thin clay coating that formed on the outside of the carcass shortly after burial.

""This is a mask, a template, a clay layer so thin you could blow it away,"" Sereno said. ""It was attracted to the outside of the carcass in a fluke event of preservation.""

Ultra-thin clay films capture dinosaur skin in 3D

To investigate how these extraordinary fossils formed, the team used a suite of imaging and analytical approaches. These included hospital and micro-CT scans, thin sections, X-ray spectroscopy, clay mineral analyses, and a close study of the rock layers where the fossils were found. All lines of evidence pointed toward a specific sequence of events that produced this rare style of preservation.

The researchers propose that after the dinosaurs died, their bodies dried in the sun before being rapidly buried in sudden flash floods. A microbial film on the outer surface of the carcass then attracted clay particles from the surrounding wet sediment through electrostatic forces. This process created a wafer-thin clay template that faithfully captured the animal's outer shape in three dimensions. Over time, the soft tissues decayed away, leaving the clay film and the skeleton, which later fossilized on longer timescales.

Cleaning, scanning and digitally rebuilding the duckbill

Revealing a boundary as fragile as this paper-thin clay layer required painstaking work. Fossil Lab manager Tyler Keillor, a co-author on the study, led hours of meticulous preparation to uncover the crucial surfaces without destroying them.

Another group, led by postdoctoral scholar Evan Saitta, relied on 3D surface imaging, CT scans, and comparisons with fossil footprints from the same time period. They traced the preserved soft anatomy, examined the sediments inside and outside the mummy, and matched the dinosaur's hooves back into a footprint. Digital artists then worked alongside the scientists to create lifelike reconstructions that showed how the duckbill would have looked and moved as it walked across soft mud near the very end of the dinosaur age.

""I believe it's worth taking the time to assemble a dream team in order to generate science that can be appreciated by the general public,"" Sereno said. ""We've never been able to look at the appearance of a large prehistoric reptile like this -- and just in time for Halloween.""

Crest, spikes, scales and thin skin

Working from the two newly described mummies, the researchers were able to assemble a complete, fleshy outline of Edmontosaurus annectens.

""The two specimens complemented each other beautifully,"" Sereno said. ""For the first time, we could see the whole profile rather than scattered patches.""

They discovered a continuous feature running along the center of the back that started as a fleshy crest over the neck and torso. Over the hips, this structure shifted into a single row of spikes along the tail, with each spike aligned above a vertebra and fitting neatly with its neighbors.

The team also documented the dinosaur's scale patterns. The largest polygonal scales appeared along the lower body and tail, while most of the animal was covered in very small, pebble-like scales only 1-4 millimeters across, surprisingly tiny for a dinosaur that could reach more than 40 feet in length. Fine wrinkles preserved over the ribcage indicate that the skin of this duckbill was relatively thin.

Hooves and heel pads on a ""hoofed"" dinosaur

The most unexpected discovery came from the larger mummy's hind feet: this dinosaur had hooves. The tips of each of the three hind toes were enclosed in a wedge-shaped hoof with a flat underside, similar to that of a horse.

To confirm what these feet looked like in life, the researchers combined CT scans of the mummified feet with 3D images of the best-preserved duckbill footprint from the same time period, carefully aligning the bones and soft-tissue impressions. With this information, they produced a detailed reconstruction of the hind foot. Unlike the forefoot, which makes contact with the ground only through its hooves, the hind feet also included a fleshy heel pad behind the hooves.

""There are so many amazing 'firsts' preserved in these duck-billed mummies -- the earliest hooves documented in a land vertebrate, the first confirmed hooved reptile, and the first hooved four-legged animal with different forelimb and hindlimb posture,"" Sereno said.

A new toolkit for dinosaur soft-tissue research

Beyond revealing striking new anatomy, the research provides a practical framework for future studies of dinosaur soft tissue. The authors outline new preparation techniques, a clear set of terms for describing soft structures and scale types, a step-by-step imaging pathway from fossil specimen to fleshed-out model, and a recipe for how a dinosaur mummy can form under natural conditions.

Their work offers more than a series of isolated findings. It proposes a general model for dinosaur mummification based on clay templating, which can now be tested on other fossils that might have formed in similar ways.

The team also highlights the next steps: focused searches for additional specimens with this kind of preservation in the same Wyoming rock layers and in other regions; biomechanical studies that can now rely on accurate external body outlines; and complementary analyses designed to understand when and where clay templating is most likely to occur.

""This may be the single best paper I've released,"" Sereno said. ""From field to lab to 3D reconstructions along with a suite of useful terms defined, it's a tour de force, and it tells a coherent story about how these remarkable fossils come to be and what we can learn from them.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover a hidden brain circuit that rewrites vision","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251130050715.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 11:44:07 GMT","

Vision guides an animal's actions, but new research from MIT shows that the relationship goes both ways. The study, published November 25 in Neuron, reports that behavior and internal conditions directly influence how visual information is processed. In mice, the brain's prefrontal cortex, which serves as a major center for executive control, sends tailored signals to regions involved in vision and movement. These signals adjust how those regions operate depending on factors such as how alert the mouse is and whether it is actively moving.

""That's the major conclusion of this paper: There are targeted projections for targeted impact,"" said senior author Mriganka Sur, Paul and Lilah Newton Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.

Investigating Customized Prefrontal Signals

Scientists have long proposed, including Sur's colleague Earl K. Miller at MIT, that the prefrontal cortex can guide the activity of more posterior areas of the brain. While anatomical evidence has supported this idea, the goal of the new study was to determine whether the prefrontal cortex sends one broad type of signal or instead crafts distinct messages for different target regions. Lead author and Sur Lab postdoctoral researcher Sofie Ährlund-Richter also sought to identify which specific neurons receive these signals and how the communication influences downstream processing.

Different Prefrontal Regions Serve Different Roles

The team identified a number of new insights. Two areas in the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex (ORB) and the anterior cingulate area (ACA), were found to relay information about both arousal and movement to two other regions: the primary visual cortex (VISp) and the primary motor cortex (MOp). These messages appear to have unique effects. For example, higher arousal increased ACA's tendency to help VISp sharpen its visual representations. ORB, however, became influential only when arousal was very high, and its involvement appeared to decrease the clarity of visual encoding. According to Ährlund-Richter, ACA may help the brain focus on potentially meaningful visual details as arousal rises, while ORB may act to reduce attention to distracting or overly strong stimuli.

""These two PFC subregions are kind of balancing each other,"" Ährlund-Richter said. ""While one will enhance stimuli that might be more uncertain or more difficult to detect, the other one kind of dampens strong stimuli that might be irrelevant.""

Mapping and Monitoring Brain Circuits

To better understand the involved pathways, Ährlund-Richter performed detailed anatomical tracing of the connections ACA and ORB form with VISp and MOp. In additional experiments, mice ran freely on a wheel while viewing structured images or naturalistic movies at different contrast levels. At certain moments, small air puffs increased the animals' arousal level. Throughout these tasks, researchers recorded the activity of neurons in ACA, ORB, VISp and MOp, with particular attention to the signals traveling along the axons linking prefrontal and posterior areas.

The tracing work showed that ACA and ORB each communicate with a variety of cell types in their target regions rather than a single cell class. They also connect in distinct spatial patterns. In VISp, ACA primarily targeted layer 6, while ORB communicated mainly with layer 5.

How Arousal and Movement Shift Visual Processing

When the team examined the transmitted information and neural activity, several consistent patterns emerged. ACA neurons conveyed more detailed visual information than ORB neurons and were more responsive to changes in contrast. ACA activity also tracked closely with arousal level, while ORB responded only when arousal reached a high threshold. When signaling to MOp, both regions conveyed information about running speed. When signaling to VISp, however, they only indicated whether the mouse was moving or still. The two prefrontal regions also carried information about arousal and a small amount of visual detail to MOp.

To see how this communication affects visual processing, the researchers temporarily blocked the pathways leading from ACA and ORB to VISp. This allowed them to measure how VISp neurons responded without these inputs. They found that ACA and ORB exerted specific and opposing effects on visual encoding depending on the mouse's movement and level of arousal.

A Specialized Model of Prefrontal Feedback

""Our data support a model of PFC feedback that is specialized at both the level of PFC subregions and their targets, enabling each region to selectively shape target-specific cortical activity rather than modulating it globally,"" the authors wrote in Neuron.

In addition to Sur and Ährlund-Richter, the research team included Yuma Osako, Kyle R. Jenks, Emma Odom, Haoyang Huang, and Don B. Arnold.

The work was supported by a Wenner-Gren foundations Postdoctoral Fellowship, the National Institutes of Health, and the Freedom Together Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","RSV prevention in newborns could cut asthma risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251129044459.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 08:08:43 GMT","

Belgian researchers from VIB and Ghent University (UGent), working with partners in Denmark, have found strong evidence that infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) early in infancy sharply raises the likelihood of developing childhood asthma. The effect is especially pronounced in children who have a family history of allergies or asthma.

The findings, published on November 28 in Science Immunology, indicate that protecting newborns from RSV could meaningfully lower asthma rates later in life.

Understanding early asthma risks

Across Europe, 5-15% of children live with asthma, a long-term condition that can affect day-to-day well-being, place a heavy strain on families, and carry significant costs for society. Because of this, discovering effective ways to reduce asthma risk before symptoms begin has become a major health priority.

""Childhood asthma is a complex disease with many contributing factors,"" explains Prof. Bart Lambrecht (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research), senior author of the study. ""We found that early-life RSV infection and genetic allergy risk interact in a very specific way that pushes the immune system toward asthma. The encouraging news is that this process can be prevented.""

How RSV and inherited allergy risk work together

To explore this relationship, the team combined nationwide health registry information from all Danish children and their parents with controlled laboratory studies. This approach revealed how an early viral infection can magnify the impact of inherited allergy risk.

The researchers found that infants who suffer severe RSV infections in their first months of life are more likely to develop immune responses that overreact to common allergens, including house dust mites. This tendency becomes even stronger when asthma or allergy runs in the family, since allergen-specific antibodies passed from parents to their newborns increase sensitivity further.

Evidence that prevention could change long-term outcomes

A key part of the work showed that protecting newborns from RSV in experimental models prevented these immune system shifts altogether. As a result, asthma did not develop.

""With RSV prevention now becoming widely accessible, we have an opportunity to improve long-term respiratory health, not just prevent RSV hospitalizations,"" says Prof. Hamida Hammad (VIB-UGent), co-senior author. ""This is not just a laboratory insight. It's a message that should help parents choose RSV prevention with confidence.""

Maternal vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy and passive immunization of newborns using long-acting antibodies are being rolled out in many countries. However, uptake has been uneven, even though these tools are highly effective at preventing RSV hospitalizations.

""This is a moment where policy, science, and pediatricians can come together,"" Lambrecht adds. ""If preventing RSV infection also reduces asthma risk, the benefits for families and health systems could be enormous.""

This work was supported by the European Research Council, the University of Ghent, and Research Foundation -- Flanders (FWO).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find a hidden obesity trigger in soybean oil","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251129044503.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 15:47:27 GMT","

Soybean oil is the most commonly used cooking oil in the United States and appears in a wide range of processed foods. Research is now shedding light on how this highly consumed ingredient contributes to obesity in mice.

In a University of California, Riverside experiment, most mice fed a high-fat diet rich in soybean oil put on substantial weight. A separate group of genetically engineered mice did not, even though their diets were the same. These modified mice produced a slightly altered version of a liver protein that affects hundreds of genes involved in fat metabolism. The altered protein also changes how the body handles linoleic acid, one of the primary components of soybean oil.

""This may be the first step toward understanding why some people gain weight more easily than others on a diet high in soybean oil,"" said Sonia Deol, a UCR biomedical scientist and corresponding author of the study published in the Journal of Lipid Research.

How Differences in Liver Proteins May Influence Metabolism

Humans produce both versions of the liver protein HNF4α, but the alternative form generally appears only in special situations, including chronic illness or metabolic stress from fasting or alcoholic fatty liver. Variations in this protein, along with individual differences in age, sex, genetics, and medications, may help explain why some people are more vulnerable to the metabolic impact of soybean oil.

The new findings expand on previous UCR research linking soybean oil to weight gain. ""We've known since our 2015 study that soybean oil is more obesogenic than coconut oil,"" said Frances Sladek, a UCR professor of cell biology. ""But now we have the clearest evidence yet that it's not the oil itself, or even linoleic acid. It's what the fat turns into inside the body.""

Oxylipins and the Body's Response to Linoleic Acid

Inside the body, linoleic acid is broken down into compounds known as oxylipins. Too much linoleic acid can result in elevated oxylipin levels, which are tied to inflammation and fat buildup.

The genetically engineered, or transgenic, mice produced far fewer oxylipins and had healthier liver tissue despite consuming the same soybean oil-rich diet as normal mice. They also showed better mitochondrial function, which may contribute to their resistance to weight gain.

Researchers identified specific oxylipins created from linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, another fatty acid found in soybean oil. These molecules were required for weight gain in regular mice.

Why Oxylipins Alone Do Not Explain Obesity Risk

Transgenic mice on a low-fat diet still had elevated oxylipins but did not become obese. This suggests that oxylipins do not cause weight gain by themselves and that other metabolic conditions must also be involved.

Additional analysis showed that these altered mice had far lower levels of two enzyme families that convert linoleic acid into oxylipins. These enzymes operate similarly in all mammals, including humans, and their levels vary based on genetics, diet, and other biological factors.

The researchers also reported that only oxylipins in liver tissue, not those circulating in the blood, correlated with body weight. This indicates that standard blood tests may not reliably show early metabolic changes driven by diet.

Rising Soybean Oil Intake and Potential Health Impacts

Soybean oil consumption in the U.S. has increased dramatically over the past century, rising from about 2% of total calories to nearly 10% today. Although soybeans provide plant-based protein and the oil contains no cholesterol, excessive intake of linoleic acid from sources including ultra-processed foods may be contributing to chronic metabolic problems.

The UCR team also found that mice consuming soybean oil had higher cholesterol levels, despite the oil itself containing no cholesterol.

Exploring Other High-Linoleic Oils

Researchers are now examining how oxylipins lead to weight gain and whether similar reactions occur with other oils high in linoleic acid, including corn, sunflower, and safflower oils.

""Soybean oil isn't inherently evil,"" Sladek said. ""But the quantities in which we consume it is triggering pathways our bodies didn't evolve to handle.""

While human trials are not currently planned, the scientists hope their work will inform future studies and guide nutrition-related policy.

""It took 100 years from the first observed link between chewing tobacco and cancer to get warning labels on cigarettes,"" Sladek said. ""We hope it won't take that long for society to recognize the link between excessive soybean oil consumption and negative health effects.""

The Samsung S95F features a refined matte screen that eliminates glare with minimal sacrifice to image depth. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a dazzling picture with crystal-clear processing, vibrant color, and brightness that rivals the best OLEDs. This highly versatile TV includes four HDMI 2.1 ports for 165-Hz gaming. While the Tizen interface can be sluggish and it lacks Dolby Vision, these are minor quibbles given its knockout performance in any lighting.

We prefer the Bravia 8, but the Bravia 7 is a beautiful display, with impressive brightness, vivid colors, and sharpness for details. According to WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata, its biggest flaw is its off-axis viewing. —Boutayna Chokrane

Samsung

The Samsung S90D remains a top-tier TV, offering incredible contrast with deep blacks and impressive OLED brightness. Its quantum dot technology delivers intense, natural color. With a 144-Hz refresh rate, VRR, and built-in cloud gaming, it's our top choice for gamers. While it lacks Dolby Vision, it is a premium screen now priced below many midrange competitors.

TCL

Topping our best TVs guide, this is an excellent choice for the average viewer. This TV delivers vibrant color accuracy, superior image processing, and access to almost every streaming app. Its Mini LED backlight provides deep contrast and performs well in well-lit spaces, and TCL's anti-glare coating handles direct sunlight effectively.

Hisense

The Hisense U7 series is exceptionally bright for its class, offering vibrant quantum dot color and strong contrast with minimal blooming. It supports all major HDR formats and includes premium gaming features like HDMI 2.1 across all four ports—a rare find. While it has some minor drawbacks, its performance and features are unmatched for the price.

TCL

WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata says you shouldn't buy the QM7K at full price, but if you can get the 65-inch model for $1,000 or less, it's a pretty enticing choice. Today, you can get it for just $798. —Boutayna Chokrane

Hisense

At its lowest price (which is right now), Hisense's latest U8 Series is a great buy, especially if you want eye-searing brightness above all else. WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata noticed some SDR color accuracy issues, but you can always turn it down. It's powered by Google TV and has brilliant black levels, deep contrast, and plenty of features. —Boutayna Chokrane

Hisense

Amazon

The Hisense U6QF stands out thanks to its mini-LED backlighting and premium ULED technology. It has a 144-Hz refresh rate, so gamers will especially love this TV, and the built-in Fire TV interface allows for streaming. WIRED editor Parker Hall says the U6QF outcompetes TVs that cost almost twice as much on picture alone. —Boutayna Chokrane

Panasonic

Amazon

The Panasonic W70 is the cheapest Fire TV we'd recommend for Alexa and Prime TV fans. It has only a 60-Hz refresh rate, and it doesn't feature local dimming, but it has decent color and brightness. It features AirPlay, but the interface is a bit slow. WIRED editor Parker Hall says he's never had it freeze, but it can take a second to load apps. Still, it's hard to beat at this price. —Boutayna Chokrane

Roku

Amazon

Walmart

The Roku Pro Series is bright and easy to use, performing well for both movies and gaming. Reviewer Adrienne So's test of the 65-inch model showed no haloing on dark scenes, and its 120-Hz refresh rate ensures smooth gameplay. The interface is user-friendly, and the voice remote has a handy ping feature to find it when lost.

Vizio

Walmart

Target

This incredibly affordable Vizio TV supports Dolby Vision and has a simple interface for seamless casting from both Android and iOS. A 55-inch model costs around $250, a steal for these features and one of the best budget TVs we've tested. Sizes range from 48 inches to a large 85 inches.

Roku

Amazon

Walmart

Our all-around favorite streaming device also comes from Roku and is on sale. The Roku Streaming Stick has support for 4K resolution and HDR, streams up to twice as fast as the older model, and comes with a voice remote. The Roku interface is the easiest to navigate if you're new to streaming (or shopping for someone who's new to it). —Nena Farrell

Google

Amazon

Walmart

Best Buy

If you're looking for a great streaming device to cast from your phone, the Google TV Streamer is easily the best. It replaced the Chromecast with Google TV, but still has that same ability to stream from other devices on the Wi-Fi that made the Chromecast such a hit. Instead of a dongle, it's a sleek little box that sits on your media console. There are tons of handy features, but my favorite is that you can use the box to make the remote beep and help you find it. —Nena Farrell

Roku

Amazon

If you want to go with the best Roku streaming device (and still get it on sale, of course), the Roku Ultra has the highest possible streaming quality and can even support Dolby Vision. It's a great choice if you have a newer TV that can deliver on the screen quality to match. —Nena Farrell

Roku

Walmart

If you're looking to add streaming smarts to an older TV, this is the handy Roku streaming stick to add. WIRED editor Parker Hall recommends going for a nicer stick if you can, if the TV is on the newer side, but this price is fantastic for adding your favorite streaming sites to any old screen. —Nena Farrell

Amazon

Amazon

Best Buy

If you're more of an Amazon Prime person, you might prefer to get one of Amazon's Fire TV devices to stream from. Our favorite from the Amazon Fire ecosystem is on sale, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. You'll still get access to other major streaming apps, but it's designed for Amazon users in mind (including Amazon smart home, with a picture-in-picture security camera feed feature) and the ability to ask Alexa questions. —Nena Farrell

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Best Costco Deals for Black Friday","https://www.wired.com/story/costco-black-friday-2025/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 17:26:00 GMT","

If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Black Friday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs.

I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are already available, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales my be a little different depending on your location. Most of the sales, unless otherwise noted, run through December 1, so you have a few days to jump on them before they disappear.

For more great discounts, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here.

KitchenAid

Crate & Barrel

You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price.

Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Black Friday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black.

Ninja

Amazon

Crate & Barrel

WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties.

Dyson

Best Buy

Amazon (V15 Detect)

Amazon (V15 Detect Plus)

Dyson

The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason.

Apple

Amazon (15-inch)

Apple

If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available through November 29th, or until it sells out.

Apple

Amazon

Best Buy

Apple

The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Black Friday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features.

Sony

Best Buy

Walmart

Amazon

If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend.

Bose

Amazon

B&H

Bose

They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound.

Sonos

Amazon

Walmart

The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Rare Earth Metal Driving Tensions Between the US and China","https://www.wired.com/story/yttrium-rare-earth-metal-china-us/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have promised a truce over rare earth minerals, the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.

Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the Chinese export restrictions introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.

But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.

Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.

The problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.

When Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.

The effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.

The situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.

Chinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.

On the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.

China's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.

The United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.

During Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.

Yet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.

If you haven't started decorating yet because you need more holiday decor, good news: we found the best Black Friday Christmas tree deals and smart light sales.

Whether you need a whole new tree covered in artificial snow, or smart lights you can have automatically turn on (because an automated holiday is a happy one, trust me!) these sales have you covered from all of the best holiday gear we've tried. That includes permanent outdoor lights from the likes of Eufy and Lepro, smart string lights from Twinkly, and best of all a range of on-sale artificial Christmas trees we tested with interior designers from brands like Basalm Hill, King of Christmas, and more.

Don't miss these great Black Friday Christmas tree deals (and light deals, too!) while they're happening. Don't miss our guides to the best Black Friday deals or our Black Friday liveblog, either. Happy decorating!

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill (Color + Clear)

Our favorite overall artificial Christmas tree was the easy favorite of the interior designers who helped us test and review them. One assembler called it “the Hermès of Christmas trees” and it had both a beautiful look to the evergreen branches and bright built-in LED lights. The branches are easy to hang ornaments on thanks to the slight upward slope, and a mix of needle types give it a great texture. It's a great investment tree that's on sale.

King of Christmas

King of Christmas (LED)

Flocked trees are covered in artificial snow to give it that extra Christmas-y look, and our favorite flocked design is this tree from King of Christmas. Out of the trees we tested, this tree really nailed the fresh snow look, which is hard to do artificially. The branches are nice and thick, but it is a little harder to hang ornaments around the flocking.

National Tree Company

National Tree Company (Unlit)

Out of all the trees we tested, not only is this the cheapest one we liked, but it was rated easiest artificial Christmas tree to fluff thanks to its pliable branches. The easy fluff makes it look much fuller and more natural than trees that aren't easy to do that with, and makes this cheaper tree look high end. There's a wrapped pole in the middle that adds to the realistic look.

Twinkly

Amazon (Multicolor)

Amazon (Multicolor + White)

Twinkly (Gold + Silver)

These lights are the star of my garage this holiday season and one of my favorite sets I've tested for my smart Christmas lights guide. After sitting in storage for a year, these lights easily reconnected to my app and Wi-Fi with no problem, and it was easy to take a quick photo with the app to re-map the lights with my current setup. I love the range of designs you can find or create in the Twinkly app, and it was easy to set a timer so that they'll turn on and off at the right time.

Twinkly

Amazon (66 Foot)

Twinkly (66 Foot)

These are my all-around best pick for smart Christmas lights. You can put them on your house, your walls, your tree, your balcony railing, whatever you like! Then use the app and your camera to map the lights and start creating the designs you want for it. Like the Strings above, there's plenty of designs you can choose from or create in the app, and easy controls all around.

Eufy

Amazon (100 ft)

Best Buy (100 ft)

Eufy (100 ft)

We've been testing tons of outdoor permanent lights this holiday season, and this set from Eufy is one of the standouts. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck found the app easy to navigate for choosing colors and schedules for her lights, and loved the wide offering of holiday presets to take advantage of. There's an AI feature to make customized light shows, and the Eufy S4 lights work with the Matter protocol, so it can sync with Apple, Google, and Alexa's smart home ecosystems.

Lepro

Amazon (50 ft)

Amazon (100 ft)

If the sales aren't getting the permanent outdoor lights cheap enough for you, then you'll be thrilled to see our budget set is on sale for a similar price you'd get regular smart lights for. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar is happy with these lights on his home, but he does warn that there's annoying in-app AI you have to get around to get access to regular controls. Once you click past it, these lights are easy to control and customize like you would any set of smart lights.

Keep an eye on the model and waterproofing; while the 150-foot version has an IP65 rating for the lights and an IP67 for the power adapter, the 50-foot and 100-foot models have an IP65 rating for the light kits but no weatherproofing for the power adapter, so it needs to be in an enclosed outlet. If you're using an outdoor outlet with no protection from the weather, then upgrade to the 150-foot size.

A color e-reader is a delight. Your digital bookshelf on a device like the Kindle Colorsoft becomes almost as colorful as the ones you have at home, and browsing through a sea of new titles on the shop side becomes much more engaging than a sea of black-and-white. It's a great purchase if you read any books that might have illustrations on the pages, or if you like color highlights.

Amazon finally came out with color Kindles starting last year, but with the close-to-$300 price tag, we weren't as impressed as we should have been. But right now, during Black Friday, you can get the colorful Kindle Colorsoft for almost as cheap as the black-and-white Kindle Paperwhite. While there are a ton of Kindle deals you can shop right now, this is easily the biggest one not to miss.

Amazon

Amazon (Colorsoft Signature Edition)

Amazon (Colorsoft)

There are two versions of the Colorsoft: The base model that came out this summer, and the Signature model that came out last year. Both are on sale right now. Both also did well in our tests (though the Signature is the one that had issues with yellow bars appearing on the bottom of the devices last year) and are mostly similar, but have a few key differences. The Signature Edition has an auto-adjusting warm light, while the basic Colorsoft has a warm light you can manually adjust. You'll get twice as much storage on the Signature, too, with 32 GB over 16 GB, and the Signature can be wirelessly charged.

Other than those three features, though, both have the same 7-inch screen and resolution of 300 pixels-per-inch (or ppi) for black-and-white content and 150 ppi for color. They're both waterproof, too. My only complaint is that the Dark Mode no longer turns menu pages dark, and doesn't work on downloaded content like AZW3 documents (which are a special ebook style formatted specifically for Kindles).

Overall, it's a great e-reader, just pricey, especially since you aren't getting things like page-turner buttons or the ability to double as a digital notebook like you can with Kobo's colorful e-readers. If you're a Kindle enthusiast, though, this is truly the best time to buy.

I first assumed it was a pirated copy uploaded to Youtube that their filters had somehow missed.Moderators: Please change the link; feels kind of unethical to bait someone into paying for this now.

Science is exceeding the envelop of paradox, and what I see here is obeying the envelope in order to justify the binary as a path to AGI. It's not a path. The symbol is a bottleneck.

What I find to be reasonable comments from me are getting downvoting in a way that never usually happens on HN! Is it me? I didn't think that the HN community would turn so hard against the CDC and basic infectious disease research.

There's no reason to be fascinated. HN voting is generally inexplicable and random. For any given article, and even more so for any given comment, the ""voter turnout"" is extremely low, compared to the total HN user base. The votes depend crucially on which relatively small number of users happen to be around and reading at the time. It's always a mistake to project comment upvoting and downvoting into some kind of larger theory or conclusion.

What we have seen happen over the past decade is quite similar what happened in Russia in decades before it: complete dismantling of trust, of the idea of truth, of the idea of honesty or integrity. And in that space of uncertainty, a new sort of ruling class is enabled to control the population.Anti-vaxxers used to be a tiny minority, and living in a crunchy leftish area, they were concentrated around me, and I got into arguments with them all the time. Now, they are no longer leftists, they are MAHA/MAGA, because their fundamental view of the world is not left/right, it's authority/antiauthority. Vaccines were rejected as much because of the idea of an authority ""knowing stuff"" as it is about the ickiness of something impure being injected into the body, as much as they love the idea of ""everything natural"" including ""natural"" infectious disease.We've destroyed the idea of expertise and authority based on knowledge that's open to anybody who wants to put in the time to learn, and replaced it with authority that exists merely because it hated the past authority, and became what it hated.

'Well, the reason for that is that we were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply.

First, it's not clear that a significant number of people were hoarding TP at all. The best info I've read suggests that the reason for shortages were changing usage patterns: people would have been pooping at work, but since they weren't going to work, they pooped at home. Thus, sales changed from bulk institutional packaging to retail consumer products. The shortage was because the pipeline for retail products emptied, and manufacturers couldn't switch gears and distribute the alternative fast enough.Second, you have the timeline wrong. On February 29, the Surgeon General told the public to stop buying masks. On March 8, Fauci told 60 Minutes ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.""Only later, during the week of March 16, 2020, toilet paper panic buying exploded. According to NCSolutions (a retail data tracker), toilet paper sales skyrocketed compared to the previous month. And as of April 19, 2020, almost half of U.S. grocery stores experienced stockouts of toilet paper at some point during the day.

But more to the point, though, let's assume your right. Is it right for our leaders to manipulate our behavior by lying to us?

To me, the liberal enlightenment ideals in our Constitution and Bill of Rights are what have made us the greatest power the world has ever seen.

If your claim is that giving people access to ""all the information"" will allow them to make informed decisions and lead to utopia, the internet disproved that long ago.

For #1, about herd immunity numbers, consider the below. I don't see any space for interpretation here: Fauci flat-out admitted to changing what he told the public in order to manipulate their (our!) behavior:In the pandemic's early days, Dr. Fauci tended to cite the same 60 to 70 percent estimate that most experts did. About a month ago, he began saying “70, 75 percent” in television interviews. And last week, in an interview with CNBC News, he said “75, 80, 85 percent” and “75 to 80-plus percent.”In a telephone interview the next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.[...]Dr. Fauci said that weeks ago, he had hesitated to publicly raise his estimate because many Americans seemed hesitant about vaccines, which they would need to accept almost universally in order for the country to achieve herd immunity.“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,' so I went to 80, 85.” “We need to have some humility here,” he added. “We really don't know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90 percent. But, I'm not going to say 90 percent.”-- https://archive.is/20210305032312/https://www.nytimes.com/20...Regarding #2, this is also pretty clear. Here's another citation, which also seems pretty clear.The 6ft social distancing guidance enforced in the US during the Covid pandemic “sort of just appeared”, Dr Anthony Fauci, the former White House medical adviser, has admitted.It was “likely not based on data”, Dr Fauci conceded in a behind-closed-doors session of the House select subcommittee on the Coronavirus pandemic.-- https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/01/12/anthony-fa...For #3, I acknowledged from the start that this is more subjective. If we judge solely by academic jargon, then Fauci was telling the truth. The thing is, it's not reasonable to judge solely by that academic jargon when Fauci wasn't talking to fellow members of the academy. He was being questioned by Congress, and one expects an intelligent guy like him to be able to communicate effectively. When speaking to politicians and ultimately to the public, he should be aware of the language he uses.EDIT: Sorry to jump back into the same post. But I want to emphasize that the root question we're arguing about here is loss of trust. We don't need a mathematically airtight proof that Fauci was lying. I just need to demonstrate that the institution, and Fauci specifically, said things that for reasonable listeners could be construed in ways that destroyed trust. I think what I've illustrated clears that threshold easily.

At a minimum, if he thought that the truth would drive counterproductive behavior, he should have at least kept his mouth shut.But as a public servant, one of the leaders in our democracy, I think he owes it to us to actually tell us the truth, even when it doesn't seem to serve his immediate goals.HN is usually pretty positive on democratic principles, that it should be We The People driving rather than elites. But when the democracy is being steered behind the scenes, being misled into provoking us into the behaviors that the elites think are best for us, then that democracy is in name only. Functionally we've then become an oligarchy.

For me, this comparatively benign explanation of his behavior became much less plausible when the details of the EcoHealth arrangement became public.I'm not a big believer in the current so-called criminal justice system as a way to establish... well, justice, but I do think that a trial in open court for his crimes - even just the unambiguous perjury - was likely to be healing and perhaps restorative for our institutions of scientific research.

Previously people only got their information from the authorities and newspapers.  Newspapers were owned by the industries (either directly, or via advertising).  Now we can see diverse view points from others in various fields, and it is clear when ""doctors say ..."" that doesn't mean that all doctors believe that to be true.  We can now see that NIH scientists that approve drugs are allowed to approve drugs where they have a patent and commercial interest in the drugs they are approving, which is mind-bendingly wild that level of corruption is allowed.People can also question where the studies are to back guidelines from authorities.  Like what is the scientific basis of the food pyramid?  Turns out that was created by the Department of Agriculture to support grain farmers, not because it is a good diet for humans.  Or that the deaths and injuries for many infectious diseases had significantly declined before their respective vaccines hit the market, and that the authorities have been cherry picking the points of the graph to hide how much of the improvement happened before vaccines were available.The biggest change is the availability of diverse voices in an industry being able to be heard, rather than just a select few chosen by ""authority"", aka power, aka money.

In my life there have been two huge destructions of public trust.The first was the Iraq war, which could only be the result of either bald faced lies or gross incompetence or both. We blundered into the desert and set a trillion dollars and countless lives on fire and have nothing to show for it. Tons of people across the spectrum knew this was a terrible idea and were silenced or ignored.The other was the 2008 bank bailouts. The problem isn't that the state stepped in to avert a depression. The problem is that they did it by handing the very people who caused the crash a bonus and a promotion and then proceeded to reinflate the housing bubble to lock two generations out of home ownership. The response was that the Eastern establishment saved itself at the expense of the country, or that's how it looked to a ton of people all across the country and the political spectrum including myself.There have been smaller cuts but those are the big obvious ones.You could never get a Trump or an RFK Jr without these two things.Unfortunately these two characters are not reformers. They are vultures. They are frauds and con men dining on the corpse of trust.I'm not Russian but I imagine that the failure of the Soviet regime and the hollowness of its propaganda did a number on trust over there, and that Putin and his allies are likewise vultures.

What's interesting about this telling of it is how it reinterprets history. You are complaining about a lack of trust based on, if not an outright lie, an extremely biased narrative. The most obvious missing piece is you don't mention the auto makers or uaw workers at all. Or that you say “reinflate the housing bubble” instead of “subsidize mortgages on houses that should have been repossessed”. We forced banks that did have proper risk controls to take tarp funds and the attached compensation limits against their will and made money on many of the assets we bought with tarp funds.There is a trust gap, but it's not some one way problem of coastal elites selling fables to enrich themselves and the good proletariat being duped. It's at least as much a story of the populace not using critical reasoning skills to understand multifaceted and nuanced issues, which I suspect is not new.

But that's also not what happened.What we did is buy back junk assets from banks to keep the banks from going under.  The only way it really ""subsidized"" mortgages is in that it kept banks afloat which allowed them to keep issuing mortgage loans.People, particularly people that fell for predatory lending, still lost their homes.  The people that were mostly aided by the bailout were investors who bought snake oil mortgage backed securities which had fake credit ratings applied to them.And the reason people take a dim view on this is because it really was only people with significant assets in the first place that saw a benefit from these government interventions.  A direct result of the regulation was it became a lot harder for a few years to get a home loan unless you had significant assets behind you.That's not to say some percentage of these interventions didn't help everyone.  It's always messy.  But it is saying that a lot of people would have been in a much better situation had the government, instead of bailing out the banks and investors, taken that same money and given it directly to the citizenry.  Even the banks and investors would have ultimately been in a better position as people would have ultimately taken that money and spent it on things like their mortgages which they fell behind on.

We've had many of these trust-destroying events in the past, before the Iraq war, but their effects were limited. What we didn't have back then, and what I'd argue brought us Trump and RFK Jr., was a world-wide information-distributing machine and a megaphone in every idiot's (and malevolent foreign actor's) pocket. We're here because anger, belligerence, conspiracies, distrust, hatred, and ignorance are being deliberately spread on Internet platforms by 1. adversaries motivated to destabilize the country and destroy its institutions, and 2. domestic idiots who help to spread it (and make a buck off of its popularity).I used to think that ""platforming everyone"" was a noble goal, but we're seeing the results.

If we still had a half-dozen major largely reliable news outlets that may have had some political leanings, but could still be (hah) trusted to largely report truth, rather than crafting narratives to maximize profit, it would have been much harder for the lies to spread.The myriad effects of deregulation and massive consolidation that have cascaded in the past ~40 years (fewer companies owned by wealthier people, the destruction of local news, the erosion of norms protecting journalistic integrity, etc) are, IMO, very clearly hugely to blame for the modern state of political discourse. I'm not saying the internet didn't have an effect—it could hardly fail to; it's an enormous change in our world overall—but I have a very hard time seeing it as being more detrimental than these changes in how media companies operate.

I think the problem is that what you're describing is no longer a viable business model.Back when there were only at most a half dozen or so news sources (newspapers and TV stations) in each major market, it didn't make sense for any one of those sources to lean hard left or right because that would only alienate a significant portion of the market.Today, any given individual has access to thousands of different sources of ""news"", and everyone chooses to listen to only those sources that confirm their existing opinions. To me, that seems more than sufficient to explain a lot of things, including a lack of widespread agreement on basic facts.Objective reality is frequently very nuanced, but nuance is a PITA when it comes to comprehension, so people tend to very much avoid it (knowingly or not).

Fully agree with the rest but not with this. Pure and simple economic devastation is enough - yes, the Iraq war did a number on y'all... but most countries in Europe didn't join in on that particular shitshow and still got our version of Trump.Hell I'd say even the 2008 bank bailouts aren't the problem. The uber rich looting the country for all it's worth, that's been a staple of human society, it doesn't mean automated flip to fascism.IMHO, the true problem rather is that we (i.e. Western countries) allowed unrestricted trade with Asia, in particular China and India - our greedy big corporations swooped in and moved a lot of economic activity providing decent paid jobs of all skill levels there. Production mostly went off to China, service (i.e. callcenters) to India, high-tech to South Korea and especially Taiwan. And there was nothing domestic, other than maybe be a drone in an Amazon warehouse or Walmart (that, in turn, destroyed even more decent paid jobs in small retail!), to provide alternative gainful employment.That is what destroyed democracy the most - the devastation and the utter ignorance of politicians.

If there's ""mocking and ostracization"" then it's in some sort of other social space, not in the evaluation of the vaccine safety studies.And by trying to conflate these two areas, you are trying to undermine the very idea of truth seeking, and replace it with this weird vibes-based in-group/out-group emotionally-based judgements.We need to pivot to rationality, and away from in-group/out-group analysis.

No, I absolutely have not.

Sure. but when your mechanic tells you that the cost of fixing it is going to be astronomical, you don't just believe him and go into debt to fix it. You're going to consider your own common sense, you're going to read and ask in reddit subs where people who own and have experience with that car gather, and so forth. And given the reputation of many mechanics, you may challenge them; when (true story!) they say I need to let them take apart my engine to clean the fuel injectors, I ask them to show me where in the manufacturer's spec does it list that as normal maintenance.My point is that, annoying and time-consuming as it might be for the mechanics/scientists, we should not just accept whatever they say without question. It's proper to challenge them. Neither scientists nor mechanics are entitled to unquestioning devotion, especially given their actual observed behavior in the past.

So yeah, I hate those guys. But consider this in a completely abstract framework, stripped of all practical issues. Picture the debate as a number line, so any given proposal can be represented as a line going off in opposite directions. The origin represents the status quo, and the proposed policy is some point off to the right (or the left, if you like that better). As a simple matter of mathematics, then if we only consider answers in the interval [0, proposal], then we will only ever move in the direction of the proposal; perhaps slowly, but inevitably. And that will happen even if the proposal is dead wrong.The only way to guard against that inexorable pull in what's potential bad territory is to entertain conversation in the whole interval of [-proposal, proposal] (or at least some degree in the negative direction, anyway).We must always entertain the possibility that not only is the proposal wrong, but is fundamentally contrary to what's really needed. Failure to do this leads to what we see in our modern regulatory regime: a host of rules that are actively digging the whole deeper, even while we tell ourselves that we're fixing the problem. (There are countless examples, but I hesitate to cite any specifics because I want to keep the argument abstract and not get hung up in other partisan bickering.)

Is it ""privilege"" to study something and look at it in detail? Why would that be ""privilege""?If you want to critique them, then please do!

That's not at all what I said. The privilege you seem to be reserving for the scientific establishment is that the rest of us should accept their pronouncements without question. The implication of your prior statement was that ""The vaccines studies were heavily examined and critiqued inside the scientific community, and scientists found that they established safety and this should be sufficient for us to follow without challenging them.""

Unfortunately, the insurance policy against that trap - that annoying people will keep asking ""why?"" - itself has a steep price, sometimes almost turning into a heckler's veto. It's a tough problem.Sometimes that ignorant schmuck annoying us is the only thing pulling us out of a hole. Consider Alfred Wegener and his theory of continental drift. He was a meteorologist with no formal training in geology, and his ideas were rejected with what I've seen described as ""militantly hostile"" reactions. Before Barry Marshall, it was doctrine that peptic ulcers were caused by stress, and stomach acid. His theory that the real cause was bacterial led to cancelled speaking slots, blocked grant applications, and so forth. He finally resorted to intentionally infecting himself with H. Pylori and developing gastritis, then curing himself with antibiotics. Ignaz Semmelweis offended surgeons - seen as ""holy"" men in noble work - by suggesting that their unwashed hands were killing patients.Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science, said ""When a shift does happen, it's almost invariably the case that an outsider or a newcomer, at least, is going to be the one who pulls it off... Insiders are highly unlikely to shift a paradigm and history tells us they won't do it"".I agree that people repeatedly making you (again, the general ""you"") explain can slow down progress quite a lot. But this seems to be the price for having a democracy rather than a technical oligarchy.

Like one specific polio-vaccine that very rarely can mutate into a contagious variant [0]. Or one vaccine for chickens that had some rather serious overall issues [1]. Or that some of the Covid-19 vaccines, hastily developed, were rejected by some countries, while other Covid-19 vaccines were accepted by those same countries.And vaccines demand a huge amount of trust. Vaccines can be abused in lots of ways by governments, organizations and individuals [2]. This is extra unfortunate, considering the huge potential benefits of some variants of vaccines. Vaccines also require trust in competence and public control [3]. For urgency reasons, standards and checking of vaccines were lowered during the Covid-19 pandemic. Vaccines are also often administered to healthy individuals, not merely sick individuals.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease> Because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Marek's is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low. Current strains of Marek virus, decades after the first vaccine was introduced, cause lymphoma formation throughout the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens. The Marek's disease vaccine is a ""leaky vaccine"", which means that only the symptoms of the disease are prevented.[12] Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented.[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine> The fact that the CIA organized a fake vaccination program in 2011 to help find Osama bin Laden is an additional cause of distrust.[120][3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_Laboratories#Cutter_inc...

But there aren't even accusations that he gave favorable results to any drugs form companies that sponsored him, as far as I have every heard, it was merely that he didn't disclose that destroyed his career.This is a level of honesty and transparency that does not exist in most of society, and we should be proud in the US that science is so clean compared to every other aspect of our society.And for all the big money, pharma is far far more honest than grifters like those in the anti-vaxxer space who do not disclose how they are making their money, and who do directly benefit from pushing unproven experimental treatments that do not go through the same rigorous vetting that standard pharma does.

I largely consider Trump a symptom of a larger disorder, I think it is lazy to assume that he and his administration is the source of the breakdown here.Two thinkers come to mind to me in this case:1. Hannah Arendt, particularly her writing in The Human Condition (and maybe as an analogue: the Anthony Downs book on Bureaucracy and perhaps Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society I think?):> Bureaucracy is the form of government in which everybody is deprived of political freedom, of the power to act; for the rule by Nobody is not no-rule, and where all are equally powerless we have a tyranny without a tyrant.Another comment talks about accountability, but a bureau is composed of people ""just doing their jobs"" without the personal accountability that helps keep systems accountable.Per Downs, bureaus eventually become mainly obsessed with their own survival over their original mandate, and it requires careful design to avoid this consequence.2. Christopher Lasch: The idea that government institutions are required to force an centralized objectivity for democracy to survive is just about the opposite of what I think we actually need, per Lasch:> ""[Specialized expertise is] the antithesis of democracy.""> ""Democracy works best when men and women do things for themselves, with the help of their friends and neighbors, instead of depending on the state.""The attitude as espoused in this essay will not do any work to re-establish trust with Americans, it continues a long line of unaccountability or reflectiveness from the ""adults in the room"" on their own contributions to the degradation of the system by pretending Republicans or Trump are a unique aberration.

I think this attitude, that the work the CDC and other boring agencies do is elitist, or that those who defend it are elitist, is the root of distrust. The fact is that these agencies do the long slogging boring work to establish what works and what doesn't, only to be undermined in social media for clicks and ad impressions.The CDC had a very good reputation around the world for the work it did. Since covid everyone on the internet is somehow a health expert and the actual people doing the mountains of boring and thankless work are now seen as nothing more than gatekeepers to the social media platforms.

I'm not familiar with the facts of your anecdote, but clearly the CDC is a government agency and banning protests would be an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of speech, you would depend on the Supreme Court to get an exception.

It is impossible for every citizen to fully understand every scientific issue. Part of living in a society—in fact, one of the primary purposes of living in a society—is having different people specialize in different things, and trusting each other to actually be good at what they specialize in.None of this implies that people don't know enough to vote.Indeed, to the best of my knowledge, the available evidence suggests that a major part of the problem right now is people's votes being suppressed and people being poorly represented by their supposed representatives (both due to deliberate gerrymandering, and more simply due to the fact that the size of the House of Representatives was capped in the early 20th century, leading to one person representing hundreds of thousands or more, rather than the ~10k or so each they represented prior to the cap).

The Powell Memorandum is famous for being incredible explicit, for the scope & scale of how and where it would seek to dominate and control the media and abuse courts, for example. But no, even 1971 was not the first business plot to takeover the government, to foment dissent to try to rip the nation apart & assert a capitalist / oligarchical government on/against these United States.I agree the government has the obligation to maintain the trust of it's people. But my heavens, it is deeply woefully & sad that there is such a loud angry butter popular political party whose axis is revanchist hatred of the state.

Perhaps they could conduct themselves in a way that doesn't make the public hate them?  I'm not asking for much here.  Only that they do their basic duty as leaders in a democracy to maintain the trust of the citizenry.  As an educated elite myself I can't stand their condescension and I can only imagine what levels of hatred I would have towards them if I were the target of it.  Basic communication skills are something that every HS dropout car salesman knows, so I don't think I'm asking a lot here for all those elite ""experts"" in the government with all their fancy degrees to figure it out.  You don't sell many cars by acting like you're better than the customer, and you don't sell many vaccines either.

I've seen a lot of people claim it exists, but so far as I can tell, it's just a meme, a self-reinforcing narrative. Its only external support seems to be that people are upset that they can't actually understand scientific papers without....spending time learning what the terms mean and possibly getting a background education in the subjects they're talking about.But that's not condescension. That's just scientists doing science and people expecting everything in the world to be simple enough to be understood in a sound bite.

The fanciful, futuristic dream of an AI era has been powered by present-day energy all along. Increasingly, though, it looks like it's going to be powered by yesterday's energy too, by which I mean coal, an energy source with climate change externalities comparable to other combustible fuel, but with deadly effects on the local environment.

Now, according to a Politico report, itself drawn from a report by the think tank Frontier Group, utilities' plans to retire 30 coal-burning units have now been delayed in order to supply energy to data centers.

As EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a Fox News op-ed (also quoted by Politico), “To meet growing demand from domestic manufacturing and the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, America's coal-powered powerplants must remain in operation.”

Throughout most of the Obama era and the first two Trump years—the span from 2010 to the beginning of 2019—announcements from US energy companies heralded the coming shutdowns of 546 coal generating units. That means 102 gigawatts, a decommissioning project the size of (by my math) New York City in the summer ten times over.

As Grist pointed out all the way back in 2012, coal's decline appeared to have little to do with environmental restrictions. It was “primarily due to changing market conditions, not environmental rule revisions, which have trended towards more lenient requirements and schedules.”

Similarly, market conditions today are bringing it back. Look out, lungs.

A report on the National Institutes of Health website (somehow it's still up) notes that “between 1999 and 2020, 460,000 deaths would not have occurred in the absence of emission from the coal power plants.”

Obama did, for the record, eventually impose emissions limits target coal, and the first Trump Administration set out to annihilate them during Trump's first year on office. That effort succeeded in 2019. In his second administration, Trump has seemingly set out to increase not only the ubiquity of coal, but its potential deadliness, by further chipping away at what safeguards there are. Politico says almost 70 power plants are being allowed to simply not comply to 2027 mercury-and-soot limitations from the EPA while the EPA crafts new, more lenient laws.

And as Gizmodo noted earlier this year, Trump has praised “beautiful, clean coal” while dismantling workplace protections for miners. Unions have sued the administration for pausing long-sought silica dust regulations—rules the Department of Labor estimated would save 1,000 lives.

So, of course, Trump will give himself credit as the savior of the coal industry. Trump didn't invent AI demand, but you have to admit, he's certainly sweetening market conditions for the shareholders who extract, profit from coal—all while workers and bystanders pay the price, sometimes with their lives.

The first third of Stranger Things' end has come, and there's a lot to talk about—including the return of a character fans never really expected to see again…



And that'd be one Kali Prasad, aka Eight. Played by Linnea Berthelsen and introduced in season two in a standalone (and divisive) episode, Kali was another test subject with the power to create mental hallucinations and turn invisible. While seen in flashbacks throughout later seasons, she hadn't made an appearance since her debut until the Volume One episode “Sorcerer,” which ended with Eleven and Hopper finding her in Dr. Kay's clutches.

In a discussion with Entertainment Weekly, co-creator Matt Duffer said “none of [this season] would play out the way it would if she wasn't involved again.” Instead of bringing back supporting characters like Eddie or Barb that fans have speculated could return, Duffer called Kali “this loose end that we had never really resolved. We've talked about bringing her back before, but there was not a narrative or thematic reason to bring her back.”

Keeping Berthelsen's return quiet all this time was tough, added co-creator Ross Duffer, but he's proud they pulled it off. “Kudos to security and production and Linnea herself. She's outside, she's filming. It was a lot of work to keep this under wraps.”

For her part, Berthelsen told EW she was “so intrigued to see where they wanted to take Kali” after the Duffers contacted her again. It was important to “make sure she was in great hands.” For those who weren't too hot on her initial appearance, she teased viewers will get “an insight into who I personally believe Kali has always been” this time around.

And Kali will be around for the rest of Stranger Things, or at least its second volume. Matt Duffer said she'd be all over the next set of episodes and be “very important” to both Eleven's story and the larger plot of defeating Vecna. We'll see what she adds to the cast when Stranger Things returns with Volume Two on December 25.

Amazon keeps the deals coming all weekend long, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday and it turns the shopping event into a marathon of discounts in every category. The DJI Mini 4K has become the best-selling drone at this event and for good reason: it has a lot of professional features in a frame that weighs less than 250 grams which means it doesn't need to be registered with the FAA in the US.

Amazon has two different packages: The standard package is available to everyone for $239 instead of $299 and the Combo version is only available to Prime members for $309 instead of $389. The Combo comes with a second battery that doubles the flight time to 62 minutes as well as extra propellers and a carrying case. If you plan to fly more than just on weekends, this is the better option.

See at Amazon

DJI designed the Mini 4K to weigh less than 249 grams which is the weight at which most countries require pilots to register with aviation authorities and it makes it easier for recreational pilots to fly. This weight limit made engineers make smart decisions that let them put real 4K UHD recording capability into a drone that you can fold up and put in your jacket pocket.

The three-axis mechanical gimbal keeps the camera steady on all three axes of movement. This means that wind gusts and sudden changes in direction won't make the footage shaky and unusable, which happens with cheaper drones that have electronic stabilization. When you watch your footage, you'll see this mechanical advantage: smooth cinematic pans and tracking shots look professional instead of like someone running with a handheld camera.

The 1/2.6-inch CMOS sensor records 4K video at 30 frames per second with enough detail that you can crop and reframe it in post-production without losing quality. This resolution is important if you want to share content on modern screens or keep your options open for editing. The camera can also take 12-megapixel stills in JPEG or RAW format which lets photographers control exposure and color grading that automated JPEG processing takes away.

Under perfect conditions, OcuSync 4 transmission technology can keep a stable video feed up to 10 kilometers away with little interference. However, in the real world, the range is usually between 4 and 6 kilometers depending on obstacles and radio interference. You can fly beyond your line of sight for dramatic establishing shots or follow subjects over large areas without worrying about losing connection because of this longer range. The 1080p live feed to your phone shows in real time with little delay so it's easy to frame shots and get around obstacles even when the drone is just a dot in the sky.

With the standard package, the battery lasts for 31 minutes on a single charge which means that you can fly for about 25 minutes, taking into account the time it takes to take off, land, and reposition. The Combo package comes with two batteries so you can switch out a dead one and keep flying without having to wait hours for it to charge.

Auto Return to Home turns on automatically when the battery gets too low or the signal connection is lost: It uses GPS coordinates to find its way back to the launch point and land safely. This feature has saved a lot of drones from crashing into trees or getting lost in forests when pilots lose their way or run into problems they weren't expecting. The wind resistance can handle gusts of up to 10.7 meters per second (about 24 mph) so you can use the Mini 4K outside in normal weather instead of only on perfectly calm days, which don't happen very often in real life.

The standard package, which costs $239 instead of $299, is a good deal for people who only fly once in a while and don't mind shorter sessions. The Combo package, which is going for $309 instead of $389, is the best choice for people who plan to use it often. For just $70 more, Prime members get the second battery, extra props, and carrying case.

Micron is preparing a major expansion of its Hiroshima operations to build a dedicated high-bandwidth memory (HBM) facility, according to a report by Nikkei Asia. The report says the company intends to invest 1.5 trillion yen — US$9.6 billion — in a new plant on its existing site, with construction scheduled to begin in May next year. Shipments would follow around 2028. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is expected to contribute up to 500 billion yen in subsidies to support the project, though neither Micron nor METI has confirmed the report.

HBM has arguably become the most constrained component in the AI supply chain, giving the project some real weight in terms of government subsidies. SK hynix currently leads the market and has committed most of its HBM, DRAM and NAND output to Nvidia through 2026. Samsung is working to catch up with its 12-layer HBM3E stacks, while Micron has pushed hard to grow its own presence through HBM3E supply deals with Nvidia and AMD. TrendForce data shows Micron moving toward roughly a quarter of the HBM market with 20% of shipments as production increases; a dedicated Hiroshima expansion could shift that balance further once it comes online.

Japan has been aggressive in courting this kind of investment, offering substantial government incentives to foreign chipmakers as part of a wider effort to rebuild domestic semiconductor capacity. TSMC's Kumamoto fabs and the state-backed Rapidus project are already part of this strategy.

Micron itself has been a significant beneficiary. Last year, Micron announced plans to introduce EUV-based DRAM production on the same Hiroshima campus, investing 500 billion yen of its own cash and supported by nearly 200 billion yen in subsidies. The first LPDDR5X memory devices produced on its 1γ process at this facility then began sampling in May of this year.

The scale of the planned plant aligns with expectations for the next generation of AI accelerators. Nvidia and AMD are both shifting towards HBM4 and HBM4E, both of which require tighter process control and higher layer counts. Capacity has been thin throughout the current GPU cycle, with long lead times and allocation limits driven by the mismatch between demand and available wafer starts. If Micron's new plant reaches volume production in 2028, it will arrive just as those next-generation GPUs are.

For Micron, Hiroshima offers political and financial stability at a moment when both geopolitics and the market cause increasing uncertainty, and Tokyo's willingness to fund a third of the project removes some of the risk from a multiyear build. The long runway to 2028 also gives Micron a clear path to expand its role

Another day, another broken Windows update. Thankfully, this one is only affecting Insiders.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has admitted that the non-security preview update KB5064081 has an issue that will make it a bit harder to log into your computer using your password. According to Microsoft Support, one of the known issues in this update is that the “Password icon might be missing or invisible in the lock screen sign-in options.” While the button might have disappeared, you can still sign in with a password by clicking on the empty space where the button should be, and the password field will appear.

This isn't a critical security or performance issue, especially as it only impacts the Windows user interface. Furthermore, it's part of a preview update, meaning users in the preview channel should be the only ones affected. It's nonetheless annoying to those users, especially if you forgot your PIN for Windows Hello and you now can't quite figure out how to type in your password. Microsoft said that it's already “working to resolve this issue and will provide information when it's available.”

Windows Updates are meant to fix security issues, bugs, and release new features, but if you're tinkering with a complicated operating system such as Windows 11, you're bound to break something else if you aren't careful. In fact, Microsoft released an emergency patch last month after an update prevented users from using the keyboard and mouse when in the Windows Recovery Environment.

In the same month, the company also broke the Media Creation Tool just a day before Windows 10 end-of-life, which might prevent some users from updating their system to Windows 11. Even other companies need to deal with Windows Updates shenanigans. For example, Nvidia released an emergency driver update in the latter part of November after a Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2 update significantly reduced performance in some games. This hotfix resulted in 50% performance increase for affected titles, giving many frustrated gamers a reason to rejoice.

Thankfully, Microsoft has several Windows Insider channels where most bugs are caught before they're rolled out to the average user. These should catch most of the biggest bugs that Microsoft's engineering and programming teams might have missed, but even then, a few issues sometimes slip through the cracks and get a wider release.

Tyler Adams scored the second longest Premier League goal ever by a U.S. men's national team player in Bournemouth's 3–2 loss to Sunderland.

Saturday's affair saw two of the best stories so far this campaign clash at the Stadium of Light. The Cherries were primed for a big victory on the road after two goals in 15 minutes. The Black Cats eventually responded to keep themselves in the European places, but Adams still made history along the way.

The USMNT midfielder scored the second Cherries goal in the first half with a long-range wondergoal in the 15th minute. Bournemouth repelled a Sunderland corner routine as the rain poured down on Wearside. A costly turnover set Adams on his way looking to kickstart a counter-attack, but he had other ideas in mind.

Adams, right on the edge of the centre circle, saw Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs off his line and unleashed a perfectly weighted effort. The goal was measured at a staggering 47.4 yards out—the second longest scored by a USMNT player in the English top flight. His goal also overtook Tottenham Hotspur's Richarlison who scored from 38.6 yards in the north London derby just last weekend.

Adams's goal stands as the longest range goal in over a year in the English top flight since Moisés Caicedo scored from 55.2 yards, ironically enough, against Bournemouth. Though, Adams didn't even come halfway close to matching the record.

Former Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard holds the record for longest goal scored by a USMNT player at 100.8 yards.

Howard scored from inside his own penalty area back on Jan. 4, 2012 against Bolton Wanderers at Goodison Park. The American goalkeeper cleared a back pass and inadvertently scored one of the longest goals ever in the Premier league. A wicked bounce combined with intense winds lofted the ball over Bolton's Adam Bogdan.

Funnily enough, that's not even the longest goal scored in the Premier League. 

Asmir Begović, formerly of Chelsea, holds the record with a 101-yard strike when he was representing Stoke City in 2013. 

At least Adams gets to say he's got the record for longest outfield USMNT player. Plus, his goal against Sunderland might just stand as the longest scored this season.

On Friday, December 5, at approximately 18:00 CEST, Washington, DC, will host the draw for the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada, and Mexico next summer. 

There is plenty of excitement and anticipation. For the first time in World Cup history, 48 teams will participate, and over 100 games will be played in fewer than 40 days. 

Lots of current Real Madrid players will be participating. The likes of Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius, Jude Bellingham, and many others will be representing their nations and going for glory. There is little doubt that we will see some Los Blancos face each other during the tournament.

But as well as the current players, there might be one former player in North America next summer. At least, that is his plan anyway. As per Spanish outlet MARCA via Centre Goals, Sergio Ramos wants to play at the World Cup and will do everything he can to be there. 

The Real Madrid legend won the tournament in 2010, in between two European Championships, and represented Spain at a total of seven major tournaments - but was not selected for any of the last three finals in either competition. 

Despite not having caps since March 2021, Ramos has 180 caps for his country, the most of any Spanish player, and the (joint) ninth-most of any player from any country, with Real Madrid legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric among the few players ahead of him. 

Although there are some good options for Spain in central defence, the position in the team is not quite as strong as in other areas. Youngsters such as Pau Cubarsi and Dean Huijsen could learn a great deal from such a legend of the game. 

The 39-year-old has been playing for Mexican side Monterrey since 2025, but it has been confirmed that he will leave the club at the end of the year and is looking for a new side to join ahead of 2026. He showed during the Club World Cup that he is still capable of performing at a high level. 

During his 16 years at Real Madrid, Ramos played 657 games and scored 100 goals - two in Champions League finals - despite being a defender. Initially a right-back, he was converted into a central defender by Jose Mourinho, and never looked back after that. 

Given he will turn 40 in March, it will be interesting to see where he goes next. He has already had a homecoming at Sevilla. Would he have another one? It would make you wonder why he left in the first place. 

Surely, surely Real Madrid wouldn't, would they? That would be quite something. As recently discussed, there is a shortage in central defence. Who knows. He did play with Xabi Alonso for club and country after all.

Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi (10) holds the trophy as Inter Miami players celebrate winning an MLS Eastern Conference final soccer match against New York City FC, Saturday, Nov. 29, 2025, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Thomas Müller knows exactly what it is like to face Lionel Messi with a trophy at stake.

And he knows what it takes to win in those moments, too.

The 2025 MLS Cup final — Messi and Inter Miami vs. Müller and the Vancouver Whitecaps — is going to draw a few comparisons from a personnel standpoint to the 2014 World Cup final and 2010 World Cup quarterfinal matches between Argentina and Germany.

Germany, with Müller, won both times. Messi played in those matches for Argentina, as did Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano. They'll all meet again on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, with Müller surely knowing that facing Messi doesn't automatically mean a loss.

“It's not about Messi against Thomas Müller,"" he told reporters after Vancouver's 3-1 win over San Diego in the Western Conference final on Saturday night. “It's Miami against the Whitecaps.”

Then he added, “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group.”

What Messi thinks of the matchup — he's gone head to head with Müller 10 times in various competitions, and his side has won only three of those — is a bit of mystery and likely may stay that way. Inter Miami rarely makes Messi available for interviews.

This much, however, is known: Messi came to Inter Miami midway through 2023 with the goal of winning an MLS Cup, something that seemed far-fetched at the time considering when he joined the club it was at the bottom of the league. A win on Saturday would fulfill his quest and would cap a season when Messi also won MLS' Golden Boot as the top scorer — plus, more than likely, a second consecutive league MVP award.

“Even though he's the best in history ... it's unfair to believe that he's going to win every game,” Mascherano said after Inter Miami's 5-1 romp past New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final on Saturday night. “Everybody has raised their level.”

The MLS final comes as part of a huge week for soccer in North America.

The FIFA World Cup draw for next year's men's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is on Friday in Washington along with the initial awarding of that organization's peace prize that many expect the group to award to President Donald Trump. (“On the 5th of December, you will see,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said a few weeks ago when asked if Trump would win the award.) MLS, if past form holds, seems likely to announce its MVP award winner this week. And college soccer is nearing its championship rounds; the men's Division I quarterfinals are this coming weekend along with the start of the women's Division I College Cup.

It's not like either Messi or Müller needs a win on Saturday to complete some sort of validation. Their resumes and legacies were secured long ago: Both are World Cup winners, both are Champions League winners, both are Club World Cup winners.

But like Messi, Müller came to MLS — he joined Vancouver four months ago — seeking a title in that league to add to the list. The chance has arrived.

“I enjoy watching him,"" Müller said in an on-field interview for Apple TV following Vancouver's win Saturday night. “I have the feeling Miami's a very strong team. We saw them beating New York in quite a really strong manner. It's a big final. I wished for this final. And here we go. I think it's great for everyone.”

Cole Palmer has missed recent national team call-ups due to a persistent groin injury and a fractured toe, hampering his involvement in England's 2026 World Cup planning. And there's more bad news for the Chelsea star as his absence from the official 2026 England calendar has caused some media speculation, with some fans worrying it is a ""major hint"" he could miss the World Cup. 

The 2026 England calendar will be a popular stocking filler for many excited young football fans this Christmas, but they certainly won't feature on anyone's present list in the Palmer household. The players included features the likes of Morgan Gibbs-White, Eberechi Eze, Morgan Rogers, and there's even a space for Jack Grealish. But The Blues' star forward and the man who scored the Three Lions' sole goal in the Euro 2024 final against Spain doesn't make the cut. 

The England store website says: ""Celebrate the England National Team every day of the year with this 2026 Calendar. Featuring vibrant imagery and key dates, it's the perfect way to keep track of important events while showing your support.""

However, sources from the FA have suggested that players were largely selected for the calendar based on appearances during the 2024/25 season for production deadlines, a campaign during which Palmer struggled with injury issues and limited playing time under manager Thomas Tuchel.

Palmer has had to sit out a number of matches recently with a variety of injuries, but the most recent injury to his toe has caused real intrigue, particularly regarding how it occurred. And team-mate Marc Cucurella has hinted it may have happened while playing popular football computer game FIFA. 

He told reporters on Monday: ""To be fair, I don't believe it. It is true that these things can sometimes happen. I have had this a couple of times but I'm stronger than them, so I don't feel anything. It's a big upset for us because he's getting closer to playing with us, to train with us, and then now he needs to rest. But this is part of life, a part of footballers' lives, we have personal lives, and we have these kinds of problems, so hopefully he can recover fast."" 

When asked what he was doing, Cucurella replied: ""I don't know. He's running because I think he lost a FIFA game or something like this, I think!""

It has been a rollercoaster week for Palmer and the injury updates which have come from Blues boss Enzo Maresca. Midweek, Palmer was still recovering in a protective boot, by Friday he was in contention for the crunch London derby clash with Arsenal. 

Ahead of the game with Barcelona, Maresca said: ""Yes, Cole is wearing a (protective) boot. We don't know when he will be back but for sure it will be soon. He's already on the pitch, he's already touching the ball, and the feeling (for him) is good. At the moment, we are only looking at tomorrow's game. It's a Champions League game against Barcelona, that is our focus, and then we will look ahead to Arsenal. I don't think he will be available for these two games, but he is doing well."" 

But during his Friday press conference, he confirmed Palmer is ready to face the Gunners. Speaking to reporters, he said: ""He is available for both (to start and to play). (His return will elevate the squad) A lot. As you said, he's probably our best player. We are happy he is back. We need to give him time to make sure he's 100 per cent fit. He has done fantastically in the past, and there is no doubt he will do fantastically in the future.""

League leaders Arsenal visit Chelsea on Sunday with both teams in excellent form and the midfield clash featuring Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo will be key. A win for the Blues will move them to three points behind their north London rivals, but their recent record against Arteta's side is poor, having won just one of the last 11 Premier League encounters.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Iran have qualified for a seventh World Cup

Iran say they plan to boycott Friday's 2026 World Cup draw in the United States because of the limited number of visas for their delegation.

According to the Tehran Times, the US has issued four visas to Iran's delegation, but they do not include one for Mehdi Taj, the president of the country's football federation.

Taj said he had spoken to Fifa president Gianni Infantino about the issue.

""We are evaluating our options, which will depend on timing and circumstances,"" Taj said in an interview with Iranian television on Thursday.

""We remain in close communication with the Iranian foreign ministry and other authorities, and we will take the necessary decision at the appropriate time.

""The current position of the Iran Football Federation executive committee is that no one will attend the event unless all visas are issued.""

The draw is scheduled to take place in Washington DC on Friday, 5 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

US will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders 

Iran have qualified for their seventh World Cup finals and fourth in succession.

The US, which is co-hosting the 2026 tournament along with Canada and Mexico,  has long-standing strict visa restrictions on Iranians for political and security reasons.

In June, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from 12 countries from entering America, citing an effort to manage security threats.

Iran is among the countries affected by the ban, although the executive order is supposed to exempt athletes and coaching staff travelling for the World Cup and 2028 Olympics.

""It appears to us that the matter has become politicised,"" said Taj. ""We informed the Fifa president, Mr. Infantino, that they have taken a political stance and the situation is completely politicised. 

""We believe that Fifa should take a stand against such behaviour.""

Iran has announced they will boycott the event in Washington next month due to the U.S. denying visas to several members of its delegation, but will not withdraw from the World Cup itself, at this time. The U.S. has long-standing, strict visa restrictions on citizens from certain countries, including Iran, for claimed political and security reasons. 

The Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI) spokesman, Amir-Mahdi Alavi, stated the officials faced ""visa obstacles that go beyond sports considerations"". The U.S. granted only four visas, including one for the head coach, but notably denied the application for FFIRI President Mehdi Taj for the ceremony at the Kennedy Center on December 5th. Iran views the decision as a non-sporting, political decision and has informed FIFA, urging the governing body to intervene. 

The incident has raised speculation that the travel ban could potentially impact Iran's participation in the actual tournament to be held in America, Canada and Mexico, but officials have not confirmed a World Cup boycott at this stage. The issue highlights broader diplomatic tensions, as the U.S. previously announced potential visa exemptions for athletes and support staff for major sports events, though their application to the draw was unclear.  

Following the announcement, Taj said: ""We are evaluating our options, which will depend on timing and circumstances. We remain in close communication with the Iranian foreign ministry and other authorities, and we will take the necessary decision at the appropriate time. The current position of the Iran Football Federation executive committee is that no one will attend the event unless all visas are issued. It appears to us that the matter has become politicised. We informed the FIFA president, Mr. Infantino, that they have taken a political stance and the situation is completely politicised. We believe that FIFA should take a stand against such behaviour."" 

Iran have consistently navigated the challenging Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualification process to secure berths in the last four consecutive FIFA World Cups: 2014, 2018, 2022, and the upcoming 2026 tournament, making seven appearances in total at the tournament in the competition's history. 

For the 2014 World Cup, they topped their final qualification group with a decisive win against South Korea. They achieved back-to-back appearances for 2018 by dominating their group undefeated, without conceding a goal in the final two rounds. Qualification for 2022 saw them again finish atop their group as the first Asian team to secure a spot with a win over Iraq. Most recently, they secured their place for the 2026 World Cup with a draw against Uzbekistan during the third round of the qualifiers in March 2025, marking an unprecedented fourth consecutive appearance through consistent top-tier performance relative to the quality in their confederation. 

There's no suggestion Iran will boycott the tournament, but if the visa issue remains unresolved and they do pull out, FIFA will have a decision to make on who they replace them with. FIFA regulations state that if an association withdraws or is excluded from the competition, the Organising Committee ""shall decide on the matter at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed necessary"". If they pull out before the main tournament draw FIFA would be more likely to invite a replacement team to fill the spot in the final tournament to avoid an unbalanced group. This replacement would likely be the best-ranked non-qualifying team, potentially from the AFC. If they withdraw after this point the spot at the tournament would most likely remain empty and opponents awarded victory by forfeit.

The Mexican government has presented its strategy to turn this summer's World Cup soccer tournament into an engine to strengthen trade, sports, tourism, and culture in the country where most of the games will be hosted. The Mexico 2026 Social World Cup project includes cultural events like soccer matches between robots, a public transit plan, and a new app where fans can sell securely sell any tickets they can't use.

During a conference last week, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the intention is “to leave a sporting legacy in our country that goes beyond the competition itself.”

“[In this World Cup] the eyes of the world will be here,” Sheinbaum said, “and what they will see is a great country with an enormous cultural heritage. They will see that we are building a nation that is fairer, freer, and more democratic.”

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held in Mexico, the United States and Canada next June and July. The proposal for the Social World Cup project includes more than 177 parties and 5,000 activities related to the event, as well as 74 tournaments and soccer cups aimed at students, workers, and the general public. It will also include close to 1,500 actions within the Vive Saludable program (which promotes healthy lifestyles) and the rehabilitation of 4,200 public sports fields and spaces.

The plan also aims to break three Guinness World Records: the “Largest Soccer Shirt Human Image,” the “Largest Soccer Class,” and the “Largest Soccer Mural.” A robotics world cup will also be organized in which autonomous robots, programmed and designed by national and international high school and undergraduate students, will participate. The call for the latter competition was opened on November 28, and all matches will be broadcast in the Mexican venues in real time.

Claudia Sheinbaum, President of Mexico, during the presentation of the ""Mexico 2026 Social World Cup"" plan, a federal initiative that sets the guidelines to host the next FIFA World Cup.

Among the actions presented is the creation of the “Conoce México” app; the name is Spanish for “Get to Know Mexico.” The app was developed jointly by the the country's Agency for Digital Transformation and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Tourism. According to the authorities, it will have an intuitive and accessible interface that will allow fans, both local and foreign, to consult updated information on matches, venues, routes, services, and cultural activities.

The application will have three main sections. First is a tourism section, where users can find information on World Cup venues, alternative events, cultural events in different locations, as well as gastronomic and ecotourism recommendations. An interactive tourist atlas will list more than 260 fan routes, points of interest and thematic roads.

There's a dedication section for 2026 World Cup tournament, including details about the stadiums and game schedules, as well as real time results and standings.

Finally, a Services section will provide information on transportation, connectivity, special tours, and mobility routes.

The application will be available in English and Spanish to cater to the approximately 5.5 million domestic and foreign visitors that Mexico expects to receive during the World Cup. Although there is still no definite date for its launch, it is expected to be ready in the next few months.

At the same press event, Iván Escalante, head of Mexico's Federal Consumer Protection Agency, or Profeco, announced that an agreement has been reached with FIFA to enable a ticket sales platform that will operate in Spanish and will display prices in Mexican pesos, in accordance with national legislation.

The official explained that, in addition, and in collaboration with the international organization, work is being done on a “ticket relocation system.” (In other words, there will be official resale of tickets.) This tool will allow those who cannot use their tickets for a World Cup match to sell them safely and at appropriate prices.

The objective is to avoid informal resale. “This platform will allow fans who are no longer going to use their tickets to make them available to someone else at fair prices,” said Escalante, who did not provide details on the progress of the project or its date of operation.

Profeco's plan has four key directives: The prevention and monitoring of misleading advertising; dissuasion through informative campaigns and surveillance operations; protection through attention modules in airports, stations, tourist centers, and stadiums; and the launching of assistance tools such. One example of that last point is the platform “Who's Who in the World Cup,” where fans can consult and compare prices of products and services in order to facilitate informed purchases.

This FIFA World Cup will be historic. For the first time in more than 90 years, the tournament will have three host countries. 48 national teams will participate—16 more than in any edition since 1998—and 104 matches will be played, which implies an extension of around 10 match days and 40 additional matches compared to previous tournaments.

In this context, the event represents a considerable opportunity to boost tourism and trade in Mexico. (The United States presented its own initiative that will give toruist visa processing priority to fans with tickets.) However, some studies warn that the championship could generate a significant environmental impact, in addition to increasing pressure on essential services such as water and electricity. These aspects were not directly addressed in the strategy laid out by Sheinbaum's government, at least for now.

≡ FIFA WORLD CUP 2026 ≡

The latest tussle concerning the 2026 FIFA World Cup came Friday when Iran, one of the qualified countries, said it would not attend the 5 December Final Draw in Washington, D.C., as three of its football federation officials were denied visas to enter the U.S.

Iran federation spokesman Amir Mehdi Alavi told the English-language Tehran Times:

“We have informed FIFA that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw.”

Four officials obtained visas: head coach Amir Ghalenoei, executive director Mehdi Kharati, international relations director Omid Jamali and Alavi. Federation president Mehdi Taj and two others had their applications denied.

The Trump Administration has tightened entry controls considerably via an Executive Order in June, with Iran on a list of 19 countries with restricted entry; exceptions were noted in the Order for:

“any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

Iran and Haiti are the two World Cup qualifiers impacted by the order.

Nevertheless, the Final Draw will go on next Friday and who plays where will be determined; it will be fascinating to see if Iran and/or Haiti end up placed in groups which play most or all of their matches in Canada or Mexico.

¶

Is this important? As the Iranian noted, this is “unrelated to sport” and all about the long-standing animosity with the U.S. since the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979. So, no.

It is a complete side show to the FIFA World Cup itself, which will expand to 48 teams and 104 matches in 2026 from 32 teams and 64 matches in 2022. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino (SUI) has said that six billion people around the world; global population estimates are at about 8.2 billion. For the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, he said five billion people would watch some part of the tournament, with the FIFA follow-up audience review listing 4.792 billion “intended to reflect the total number of people who engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 in any manner, extending beyond TV reach and audience measurement.”

So, a lot of people will have heard something about the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and the Trump Administration has made its success a priority, establishing a White House Task Force. And this is an important proof-of-concept for FIFA, which is organizing the tournament itself – no in-country organizing committees any more – out of its offices in Coral Gables, Florida. FIFA has even talked about expanding its organizing efforts outside of football, assuming its 2026 experiment is successful.

That will depend on three things, which above all else will make the 2026 FIFA World Cup a success. They are basic and obvious, but these are the things that count:

● (1) The teams and accompanying officials need to be able to travel, train and compete without undue difficulties.

This is obvious, but in a charged environment like the World Cup and especially in the U.S., this is not to be taken for granted. The security apparatus will be enormous and beyond threats from outsiders, have we forgotten already the Canadian women's drone-spying scandal that surfaced at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games?

● (2) Spectators need to be able to get their purchased tickets and be able to get in and out of the stadia to watch the matches safely.

Again, totally obvious. But for the 2024 Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium outside of Miami, Florida, an after-action report stated that “20,000 to 30,000 patrons had a plan to arrive early, park off site, then crash the entry gates with overwhelming numbers was not gathered and shared by any intelligence source. Had this information been known, our plan would have been modified for this contingency.”

But the stadium, police and security staff were not ready and the kickoff between Colombia and Argentina was delayed for 82 minutes while the situation was brought under some level of control. Fifty-four people were ejected and 26 people were arrested; the same stadium will host seven World Cup matches.

No doubt Hard Rock Stadium will be heavily secured; but there are a record 16 stadia involved in this World Cup. The enormous attention paid to the tournament make it an attractive target for political protests of all kinds (no, Israel did not qualify).

● (3) The broadcast of the matches, on all platforms, has to work perfectly.

This is the least likely of the three core competencies for the tournament to be affected, since all of the venues regularly host major events that are televised and the infrastructure in all (most?) are hardened against difficulties.

While trouble in a stadium directly affects the people attending, trouble with broadcasts will impact millions of viewers worldwide. Here, FIFA has help from its production team but also its broadcast partners, especially those who work in the 2026 stadiums on a continuous basis. In the U.S., FOX has the broadcast rights.

Taking care of those three things will almost guarantee a successful tournament for FIFA and although obvious, are not assured.

A wild card for the entire tournament, which will run for more than a month – 11 June to 19 July – would be civil unrest, possibly tied to 2026 state or local primary elections which will take place during the World Cup period (New York is the only state with a World Cup venue – in New Jersey – an election primary during the World Cup itself.

Fan festivals, which FIFA is very proud of, are less secure than the stadia and could be a target, mostly under the control of the local host committees rather than FIFA itself. And those host cities know it.

And, will there be other conflicts, international, political or cultural, which pop up during the tournament? There's no “Olympic Truce” for FIFA and the Trump Administration is not going to be taking five weeks off.

All the other elements aren't that important, because if the teams can play, the fans can see and people can watch the matches, the World Cup will be great. Because, in the end, the players and teams always are.

Mexico Builds Digital Infrastructure for 2026 World Cup

Mexico launches tourism app and FIFA ticket resale platform ahead of 2026 World Cup

Mexico launches ""Conoce México"" tourism app for 2026 World Cup with venue info and 260+ fan routes

Official FIFA ticket resale platform will operate in Spanish pesos to combat informal scalping

Digital infrastructure targets 5.5 million expected visitors across Mexico, US, and Canada

Apps expected to launch in coming months as World Cup approaches in June 2026

Mexico is rolling out digital tools to handle the expected 5.5 million visitors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The government just unveiled plans for a bilingual tourism app called ""Conoce México"" and an official ticket resale platform developed in partnership with FIFA. These platforms represent Mexico's bid to modernize its tourism infrastructure while preventing ticket scalping through legitimate digital channels.

Mexico just dropped its digital playbook for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and it's banking on apps to manage what could be the largest tourism surge in the country's history. President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the ""Mexico 2026 Social World Cup"" project last week, centering on two key digital platforms that aim to transform how millions of visitors experience the tournament.

The centerpiece is ""Conoce México"" (Get to Know Mexico), a bilingual tourism app developed jointly by Mexico's Agency for Digital Transformation and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Tourism. The platform promises an ""intuitive and accessible interface"" that goes beyond basic match information to include cultural events, gastronomic recommendations, and ecotourism options across host cities.

But the real innovation lies in the app's interactive tourist atlas, which maps over 260 fan routes, points of interest, and thematic roads. This isn't just a digital brochure - it's positioning itself as the central nervous system for tourist navigation during the tournament. The app will deliver real-time match results, stadium details, transportation information, and connectivity guides, all designed for the 5.5 million domestic and international visitors Mexico expects to receive.

The timing is critical. This World Cup marks the first time in over 90 years that three countries will co-host, with 48 teams playing 104 matches across Mexico, the United States, and Canada. That's 16 more teams than previous tournaments and represents a massive logistical challenge that traditional tourism infrastructure simply can't handle.

Parallel to the tourism push, FIFA and Mexico's Federal Consumer Protection Agency (Profeco) are developing what they're calling a ""ticket relocation system"" - essentially an official resale marketplace. Iván Escalante, who heads Profeco, announced the platform will operate in Spanish and display prices in Mexican pesos, complying with national legislation while providing a legitimate alternative to informal ticket scalping.

""This platform will allow fans who are no longer going to use their tickets to make them available to someone else at fair prices,"" Escalante explained, though he didn't reveal technical details or launch timelines. The system represents a significant shift toward regulated digital marketplaces for major sporting events, potentially setting a precedent for future tournaments.

The broader digital strategy includes a price comparison platform called ""Who's Who in the World Cup,"" where fans can research and compare costs for products and services. It's part of Profeco's four-pronged approach that includes monitoring misleading advertising and establishing assistance modules in airports, stations, and stadiums.

What makes this particularly interesting from a tech perspective is how Mexico is using the World Cup as a forcing function to modernize its digital tourism infrastructure. The country is essentially building scalable platforms that will outlast the tournament itself, creating lasting digital assets for future tourism campaigns.

The competition pressure is real. The United States announced its own initiative giving tourist visa processing priority to fans with tickets, highlighting how host countries are leveraging technology and policy to capture tourism revenue.

Both Mexican platforms are expected to launch in the coming months, with the World Cup scheduled for June and July 2026. The success of these digital tools could influence how future mega-events approach visitor management and set new standards for government-led tourism technology initiatives.

Mexico's approach represents more than just event planning - it's a test case for how emerging markets can use major sporting events to leapfrog traditional tourism infrastructure through digital-first solutions.

Mexico's digital World Cup strategy shows how major sporting events can catalyze technology infrastructure development in emerging markets. While the immediate focus is managing 5.5 million visitors over six weeks, the real value lies in the lasting digital tourism assets these platforms will create. Success here could establish a playbook for how future host countries approach large-scale event management through technology-first solutions.

Former Manchester United star Mason Greenwood has been told how he can earn a recall to the England squad for the 2026 World Cup. Greenwood's last - and only - appearance for the Three Lions came in 2020 in a Nations League clash against Iceland. After that, he was charged with serious criminal allegations, which marked the end of his journey with the England national team.

After being banished from the United squad in 2023, despite criminal allegations against him being dropped, Greenwood briefly played in Spain for Getafe on loan before securing a permanent transfer to Marseille in 2024. It was in France that the winger finally got a chance to revive his professional career. He enjoyed a fine debut campaign in Ligue 1 as he scored 21 league goals in 34 matches and this season, he has already scored 10 Ligue 1 goals in 13 appearances and provided three assists.

After reviving his form in France, Greenwood now dreams of making a comeback for the Three Lions someday, according to the Daily Mail. This, despite being blacklisted by the FA and manager Tuchel. With only months left before the 2026 World Cup, Greenwood's comeback into the national team is even more improbable but he still believes he can make a miraculous comeback. 

Former Watford forward Troy Deeney wrote in The Sun: ""Football cannot be a place where people are written off after mistakes, alleged or not, in their younger years. This is not to dismiss the seriousness of those allegations. Greenwood will live with them forever. ""In truth, he does not owe an explanation to football supporters. It is his friends and family he must prove himself to. But, if he wants an England return, he must address it in public – prove he is worthy of wearing the England shirt, show he can be trusted. Rebuilding trust is the only way this can ever happen and it is an incredibly hard thing to achieve.

""It would be taxing on Greenwood himself having to face such justified scrutiny. If Greenwood can face that and come through it. He deserves a second chance with England. If there were to be no way back whatsoever, the game is setting a dangerous precedent. Sending a message that any mistake in your personal life rules you out for good.""

After Marseille's victory over Newcastle United in the Champions League earlier this week, USMNT star Timothy Weah told The Sun: ""When I speak about Mason, it's a special feeling because it's very rare in a lifetime that you get to share the pitch with such an amazing player and amazing character. We've grown closer since I've joined the team and been here. Hopefully he gets that call-up soon. I'm super proud of him. He's having an amazing season and hopefully I can help him to reach those heights that he's aiming for.""

Earlier this month, Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi had heaped praise on his star attacker as he described the 24-year-old as a complete player. He manager said: ""We played well against a tough team, Nice. For them, it's a derby. It was a very tense match; we needed to play better in the second half. Everything's fine, we scored 5 goals and we're provisionally top of Ligue 1. We need to get some injured players back (Aguerd, Medina). That shouldn't be an excuse. We have to see what we can do in these circumstances. Greenwood? He's doing a good job. He's scoring goals, providing assists. He's more involved in the game. He's becoming a complete player.""

Despite Greenwood's remarkable form, his selection in the English World Cup squad seems improbable. Addressing the issue, Tuchel had told reporters: ""I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

After more than two years of waiting, Lionel Messi finally has a chance to lift MLS Cup. The Argentine superstar guided Inter Miami to their first-ever trip to the championship game, sealing a 5-1 win over NYCFC in the Eastern Conference final. And he'll have another countryman to thank: Tadeo Allende, whose first-half brace set the tone for Javier Mascherano's side.

It wasn't Messi's most prolific performance - but it didn't have to be. His teammates did the heavy lifting, especially Allende, who tied the MLS postseason record for goals with a hat trick.

NYCFC opened the contest at Chase Stadium just as they have throughout the postseason: compact, taking away space, and looking to counter. It worked for the first 10 minutes, before the Herons' attack finally sparked. Messi created a clear-cut chance from a set piece, finding Jordi Alba at the back post, only for USMNT goalkeeper Matt Freese to block the header. Four minutes later, the breakthrough came.

Allende received a perfectly weighted pass in the box and made no mistake with a diagonal finish to put Miami up 1-0. Eight minutes after that, he was back again. Alba spotted Allende charging toward goal from 25 yards out and lofted a gorgeous long ball over the top, which the striker headed home. Inter Miami looked to be cruising, but NYCFC hit back in the 37th minute as lax defending allowed Justin Haak to nod in a set-piece header.

Miami turned ruthless after the break. Mateo Silvetti finally came alive following a quiet first half, coolly slotting home off a Messi assist - the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's lone goal contribution of the night. Alba followed with an outrageous backheel to set up Telasco Segovia, and Allende added his third to restore Miami's four-goal cushion and put the game out of reach.

The win ensures Inter Miami will host MLS Cup against the Western Conference finalists, the Vancouver Whitecaps. 

GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Chase Stadium....

Rocco Rios Novo (5/10):

A shaky performance from the 23-year-old, who couldn't do much with the first goal he conceded, but almost gave away Miami's advantage in the second half. He is very lucky NYCFC couldn't take advantage of a giveaway from Inter Miami's goalkeeper. He also made some ill-timed runs off his line. Did make an incredible save on Julian Fernandez, which prevented a game-tying opportunity in the 67th minute. 

Jordi Alba (9/10):

Typical Alba performance, excellent in his assist to Allende in the first half, but left spaces open at times for NYCFC to exploit. Delivered one of the best assists of the season with his behind-the-back delivery to Segovia. 

Noah Allen (6/10):

Allen always puts a shit on the back end, but doesn't offer much going forward. Had a then-game high five defensive contributions before being pulled off due to his yellow card for Yannick Bright.

Sergio Busquets (6/10):

The legendary midfielder was put in the backline for his ability to distribute from the center back position, which he did. Yet, his lack of mobility, especially laterally, gave NYCFC a weakness to exploit. 

Maxi Falcon (6/10):

Solid but not spectacular. Typical showing from the center back. 

Marcelo Weigandt (6/10):

Wasn't the worst game from the fullback, and he actually offered some positive glimpses in the first half. Yet, once Hannes Wolf came on, the 25-year-old couldn't handle NYCFC's Austrian winger and was quickly replaced by Ian Fray in the second half. 

Baltasar Rodríguez (6/10):

NYCFC kept the match compact, and as a result, the young midfielder didn't have much space to operate in. Quiet night overall. 

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

Miami's big summer signing contributed on both sides of the ball, helping the Herons push forward and also helping his club win back possession with X recoveries. 

Mateo Silvetti (8/10):

Withdrawn from his typical winger/forward spot, the 19-year-old played in a No. 10 spot and was less effective in the first half than he had been in previous weeks. Yet, he effectively booked Miami's trip to the finals with his goal in the second half. 

Lionel Messi (7/10):

This wasn't Messi's best outing, with NYCFC swarming him on nearly every touch. But after the postseason he's had — and with the performances his teammates delivered on Saturday - it didn't really matter.

Tadeo Allende (10/10):Who needs Neymar or Luis Suárez when you have Allende? Jokes aside, the unheralded Argentine - quietly brought in on loan from Celta Vigo - has turned into one of Inter Miami's smartest pickups. And he showed it again when his team needed him most. In a tense, grinding match, it was the 26-year-old's clinical edge in front of goal that finally brought calm and confidence to Mascherano's side. Almost had a hat trick, but his header sailed wide. 

Telasco Segovia (7/10):

Took full advantage of Alba's outrageous backheel, applying a composed finish to cap Miami's second-half surge.

Yannick Bright (6/10):

A steady, if unspectacular, outing from the Italian midfielder, who helped Miami manage the game and close out the win.

Ian Fray (6/10):

Provided stability at right-back after coming on, especially with Hannes Wolf growing dangerous on the flanks.

Luis Suárez (5/10):

Replaced Silvetti but struggled to match Miami's uptempo rhythm, never quite finding his footing in the flow of the match.

Javier Mascherano (8/10):

Mascherano has fully settled into his postseason groove. Once again, he showed he's unafraid to make bold calls - from benching Suárez to trusting his young emerging players - and his tactical flexibility was central to Miami's dominance in the Conference Final. His fingerprints are all over this MLS Cup run.

Inter Miami crushed New York City FC 5-1 to win the Eastern Conference title and reach the first MLS Cup final in club history. After the match, manager Javier Mascherano praised the team's unity, calling them an “unbreakable group” and crediting the players for believing in the project. The Herons now await the Western Conference champion. 

Mascherano said Miami's performance mirrored exactly what he had hoped for. 

“One always imagines the best when thinking about games - being able to play a great match, dominate, create clear chances,” the Argentine said. “We knew it would be difficult. New York didn't create chances, and until the 60th minute or so, they were still alive.”

Miami rode a strong showing from Tadeo Allende, who had a hat-trick, along with Jordi Alba's creative genius to power their rout. 

He emphasized that Miami's transformation has come from players fully committing to the path laid out for them. 

“The credit is theirs,” he said. “I'd highlight the last two months - they've been incredible. But the merit goes to the players for convincing themselves of where we wanted to go. We've reached the end of the season with a brotherhood inside the team, everyone pulling in the same direction, and the power of a group is unbreakable. We're on the verge of playing the game we dreamed of, at home, with our people.”

Mascherano also reflected on what Inter Miami have become - and how past setbacks helped shape this moment. 

Mascherano made a point to acknowledge predecessor Gerardo Martino's impact.

“I think it would be unfair not to recognize what Gerardo Martino did,” he said. “He was the first to give this team its identity. A Leagues Cup, competing for the Supporters' Shield… the desire to compete and lift the club to another level kept growing. Beyond the big signings we made, you need players with hierarchy.”

The turning point for Miami, Mascherano explained, came earlier in the postseason. “Before Game 3 against Nashville - that was the moment when it felt most like last season would repeat itself. A similar match, playing against a lion at home. What happened last season… we wouldn't be experiencing this today if we hadn't gone through that elimination. In one way or another, the guys understood how to face the final stretch.”

Rodrigo De Paul echoed the sense of fulfillment as Miami now prepares to face either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps in MLS Cup.

“An emotion, a reward for the effort, for the work, with clear ideas to make history with this club,” De Paul said. “The happiness is immense. Every game has big meaning and importance - that prepares you for the big matches, and today we played a perfect game.”

Inter Miami will host the winner of San Diego FC vs. Vancouver next Saturday at Chase Stadium - the last MLS match the venue will host before the team moves to its new home in 2026.

Enzo Maresca's young guns might actually be Premier League title contenders","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/chelsea-enzo-maresca-young-guns-premier-league-title-contenders-arsenal-ultimate-test/blt04e7d99b9e74e15c","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Out of almost nowhere, Chelsea have emerged as Arsenal's closest challengers for the Premier League title this season as the London rivals prepare to lock horns at Stamford Bridge this weekend - but is this another false dawn? After all, Enzo Maresca's side found themselves in a similar position midway through 2024-25 only to fall away dramatically in the second half of the campaign. Ahead of Sunday's showdown, though, there is reason to believe the Blues could have staying power this time around.

After grinding out wins against Wolves and Burnley, following the customary defeat of Tottenham on the road, Chelsea have - somehow - risen to second in the Premier League table ahead of hosting Mikel Arteta's early-season champions-elect, albeit they are still six points behind their cross-capital foes.

Serious doubts, though, remain over their ability to stay the course for the long-term - which are justified given the Blues haven't mounted a sustained title challenge since they last lifted the trophy nine seasons ago, and the backdrop of the club's tumultuous recent history since the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital takeover three years ago.

It's not long since Chelsea were in a similar position, either; around this time last season they surged into second place behind eventual league winners Liverpool, before failing miserably to deal with the packed festive schedule and sliding back down the standings amid a winter of discontent.

This time, though, things feel slightly different, with Maresca's side showing the kind of mettle and big-game aptitude that suggests they could have staying power for the season. However, the visit of the Arsenal juggernaut will be the ultimate test of their credentials at the top of the table.

Chelsea's start to the season was inauspicious as they picked up just two wins from six league games, leading many to believe that another top-four finish would be the best that they could hope for. Since the start of October, though, there has been a shift.

The sensational late victory over Arne Slot's toiling champions has proven to be the catalyst for a run of eight victories in 10 matches in all competitions, with the alarming home defeat to high-flying Sunderland late last month proving to be an anomaly in what could prove to be a defining period in the west Londoners' campaign.

Having dropped points in clashes they were expected to win earlier in the season against Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton, the Blues have defeated Nottingham Forest, Wolves and Burnley with relative ease, as well as notching another victory over Spurs in north London in one of the most one-sided 1-0 wins you're likely to see.

Of course, Chelsea's young squad reached the latest significant milestone in its progression in the Champions League in midweek, as they utterly dominated the 10 men of Barcelona at Stamford Bridge in a mightily impressive 3-0 thumping that sets them up very nicely for Sunday's top-of-the-table showdown.

For Maresca, this developing winning habit is vital to his side's chances of success: ""Last year, we were playing in the Conference League, and I said many times that for me personally, if you want to build a winning mentality, there is only one way: winning games. Because otherwise, if you don't win games, it's difficult to convince the players, 'guys, we are building a winning mentality',"" the Italian tactician said after Tuesday night's dismantling for the Catalan giants.

""But when we don't win, it's difficult. So the only way in any competition, Conference League, Champions League this season, Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, is to win games. It's the only way to build the winning mentality. And I think the Conference League and the Club World Cup last season helped a lot.

""And now we are trying to do exactly the same. For sure, the players are better players in this moment compared to last season, because we spent more time together.""

In downing the mighty Barca by exploiting their recklessly high line, Maresca served up another timely reminder of his tactical acumen, but what has been even more impressive of late is his ability to utilise his whole squad without results and performances suffering.

No Premier League manager has made more changes to their starting XIs than the Italian so far in 2025-26, with the five he made for the Barcelona game from his team that eased past Burnley taking his tally for the season to a remarkable 102, and it's only November.

While he has a core of guaranteed starters in bigger games, Maresca has been able to lean on the likes of Tosin Adarabioyo, Andrey Santos, Jamie Gittens, fit-again Liam Delap and academy graduates Josh Acheampong and Tyrique George in lower-stakes situations - either from the start or as substitutes.

They have handled remarkably well without the talismanic Cole Palmer, too, who has made just four appearances this season due to a groin issue and subsequent broken toe. He has, though, been passed fit to play on Sunday. Meanwhile, defensive midfielders Romeo Lavia and Dario Essugo - whose imminent returns will strengthen the group again - have also been sidelined, as well as long-term absentee Levi Colwill.

That ability to rotate, and doing so successfully, could well prove to be vital for Chelsea as they fight on four fronts over the notoriously hectic winter period. If they require a two-legged play-off to reach the Champions League last 16 and make progress in the domestic cup competitions, then they face a brutal schedule of as many as 32 games in the next four months.

There will, of course, still be question marks over whether Chelsea have the staying power to go the distance and truly challenge Arsenal - who look ominously capable of becoming runaway leaders - all the way until the final day of the campaign, especially given the young group's lack of experience in that department.

If we zoom out, the Blues are only one point better off than at the same stage last season, and they have certainly benefitted from unrecognisable champions Liverpool and, to a lesser extent, disjointed Manchester City underperforming considerably to this point.

As we've touched upon, their title challenge completely unravelled over the winter period last term before they managed to steady the ship in time to secure a top-four finish on the final day. Even when they were second, Maresca was consistent in his messaging that his team were 'not ready' for a title challenge, although that led some to question whether he had manifested their downturn in form with his pessimistic outlook.

It will be very interesting to see how Chelsea contend with the relentless nature of the schedule this time around, but there is a sense that things are different one year on in terms of cohesiveness, togetherness and strength in depth - something the manager has recognised, albeit he maintains it is too early to predict what they are capable of.

Speaking in his press conference ahead of welcoming the Gunners, Maresca insisted it would still be premature to judge his side, but admitted things have changed: ""I think it's too early in any case. If we win, if we don't win, I think it's too early. We are still, end of November, we are still five, six months to go. I think it's very important when we're going to be in February, March, where we are, and from there we decide and we see if we can achieve something important.

""The mindset and mood in this moment, for us, is very good. We are doing quite well in the Premier League and the Champions League. We are evolving and growing. This is the best feeling for us.

""For sure, it's different compared to one year ago because we spent one more year together. Then again, we are at the end of November so it is very early. It's important to be where we are now in March/April and then we will see.""

The meeting with the seemingly unstoppable Arsenal, who steamrollered Europe's other form team Bayern Munich in midweek, will be the ultimate litmus test of how far Chelsea have progressed, and a barometer of just how far they can go this season. Few fans would have given them a chance of victory a matter of weeks ago, but now it feels like a game that's very hard to call, with the mood around the club far more buoyant.

That is thanks in no small part to Maresca's side demonstrating the strides they have made by rediscovering their ability to challenge and win in the biggest games, having beaten Liverpool, Spurs and Barcelona in 2025-26, while they boast further victories over Paris Saint-Germain, the Reds and Tottenham this calendar year.

""These players, in 16/17/18 months together, they showed many times that they can beat teams,"" Maresca said. ""In the Premier League last year I think we had some good moments where we were able to beat teams. Then PSG, the Club World Cup final. This season, I don't know, against Liverpool or Barcelona. We compete always. Sometimes we are able to win, sometimes we are not able to win. But it's important that we compete against any team.""

On Sunday, Chelsea's young squad will need to call on all the experience they've gleaned from those encounters if they are to stop Arsenal in their tracks and prove to their rivals and their doubters that they can be the team to push the Gunners all the way this season.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim has singled-out one key star for criticism, claiming their performances for their country are better than the shifts they put in for Manchester United. The United boss has also claimed he can ""feel the anxiety"" every time his player receives the ball in a damaging analysis ahead of the clash with Crystal Palace.

Dorgu has faced some initial problems since becoming Amorim's first signing at Man Utd, primarily due to being played as an attacking wing-back when he is a more natural full-back. Pundits and fans have described some of his performances as ""dreadful,"" pointing out defensive lapses and poor decision-making in the final third. He has also yet to register a goal or assist for the club. 

However, Dorgu is still only 21 years old and arrived mid-season from Lecce in Serie A, and was thrown into an unstable team under a new system. His struggles are often viewed as a result of being played out of position and mis-used by the current system rather than a lack of talent. But his boss has pointed out that Dorgu's instincts when playing for United are completely different to when he plays for his native Denmark. 

Ahead of the clash with Palace, Amorim said: ""You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he's making in our team. I think it's the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.""

He added: ""I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve. I just need to understand the context in trying to help them (Dorgu and Dalot). They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let's see this week if we can improve that.""

Manchester United have won just three of their last 26 Premier League away games against London sides and just one game away from home this season. And the United boss has acknowledged that his side's form away from home is a problem he needs fix quickly. Amorim said:  ""I felt during this year that when we played at home, the intensity was higher. And I felt in this game at home (against Everton) the intensity was not at the same level. So I think it's something that we need to work on. It's hard to point one thing why we are not winning away. There's a lot of issues. We are improving but we need to know how to finish the games in order to win.""

Palace are unbeaten in their last four meetings with the United, winning three, and have only lost one home game all season. United, winless in their last three Premier League matches and struggling away from home and are also hampered by injuries to key attackers Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, along with defender Harry Maguire.

Ahead of the match Amorim has conceded his team needs to defend better. The Portuguese said: “We are being really soft near the box. So we need to improve that in the last games, especially against Nottingham (Forest, the 2-2 draw). We allowed a lot of crosses, we didn't press well [in] moments. Against Everton, they were with 10 men and we suffered the goal (Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's winner) with the only shot on target.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United came from behind to secure victory over Crystal Palace as Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount emerged as match-winners for Ruben Amorim's side in a 2-1 win on Sunday. Palace led in the first half through a Jean-Philippe Mateta penalty, but the Red Devils came out for the second period a different side, and Zirkzee fired home before Mount struck the winner from the edge of the box to complete the turnaround.

United could have taken an early lead within the first minute, as Dean Henderson made a double save at the feet of Casemiro from point-blank range following a long throw-in. The Brazilian would soon come close to scoring again, too, when he glanced a header wide from a Bruno Fernandes delivery.

That would be as close as United came in the first half, as Palace soon took a strange-hold on proceedings. A defensive mix-up involving Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro saw Mateta run through on goal, only to drag the ball wide, while Senne Lammens saved from Daichi Kamada and Yoro blocked well from Yeremy Pino. But the French defender's naive challenge on fellow countryman Mateta allowed the Eagles striker to give his side the lead from the penalty spot, though it took him two attempts due to a double touch.

With seconds of first-half stoppage time remaining, De Ligt slipped and was bailed out by a last-ditch Luke Shaw block with Eddie Nketiah bearing down on goal, and that would prove to be a turning point in the game.

The Red Devils came out for the second half with purpose and captain Fernandes would be at the centre of all of it, assisting goals for both Zirkzee and Mount from free-kicks. The two finishes were outstanding, as Zirkzee swivelled to fire home from the tightest of angles before Mount struck from the edge of the box to complete the turnaround.

Palace rallied late on, but United defended strongly to see out an outstanding away victory.

GOAL rates United's players from Selhurst Park...

Senne Lammens (6/10):

Beaten twice by Mateta from the spot but made a couple of important first-half saves to keep United in the game. 

Leny Yoro (5/10):

Made a brilliant block from Pino to deny a certain goal, but ruined his own good work with a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty just minutes later. Taken off by Amorim moments after the equaliser, and looked visibly distressed with his own performance on the bench.

Matthijs de Ligt (5/10):

Looked far from on his game, particularly during the first half. Mateta had the beating of him way too easily, while his errors presented chances to both the France striker and Nketiah. Defended more resolutely after the break.

Luke Shaw (7/10):

Made a great block from Nketiah, though he should not have had the chance. Defended strongly, and a yellow card was the only blot on his display.

Amad Diallo (6/10):

Did not get forward as much as he would have liked, but the Ivorian continues to be a key cog in Amorim's side and works tirelessly despite his unfamiliarity with the wing-back role.

Casemiro (6/10):

Was afforded two big chances and should have got his name on the scoresheet with the game goalless. Struggled to prevent Palace dictating play in the first half but, like many team-mates, improved in the second. 

Bruno Fernandes (7/10):

United's goals were all about the finishes, but it was no surprise to see the captain laying on the opportunities. He impacted the outcome of the game and worked hard for his side at both ends of the pitch to see out the victory.

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

The Portuguese's long throw caused havoc within the first minute, and he did his primary job well of keeping Munoz quiet in a solid display.

Bryan Mbeumo (6/10):

Was not the match-winner on this occasion but always looks a threat. Could have scored on a couple of occasions, only to be foiled by Henderson in goal.

Joshua Zirkzee (7/10):

Was quiet in the first half but his equalising goal was outstanding. Taking the ball on his chest, the Dutchman volleyed home from the angle to get his side back in the game.

Mason Mount (7/10):

Stepped up when it mattered in the game's defining moment. Profiting from Fernandes' quick free-kick, Mount fired the ball through a non-existent Palace wall and into the bottom corner of the net.

Noussair Mazraoui (6/10):

Replaced Yoro and defended stoutly with the exception of a moment of madness, where he smashed the ball at Zirkzee and almost saw the ball bounce into the net.

Lisandro Martinez (N/A):

Came on in the final 10 minutes to return from a long ACL injury lay-off, and helped see out the victory.

Kobbie Mainoo (N/A):

The 20-year-old made a cameo in stoppage time as United secured the win.

Patrick Dorgu (N/A):

Came on alongside Mainoo.

Ruben Amorim (7/10):

His team were a different side after half-time and showed character to turn things around. His decision to start Zirkzee and Mount certainly paid off, as the pair made a rare start and were instrumental to victory.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

U.S. international Brian White sent a timely reminder of his quality, powering the Vancouver Whitecaps to their first MLS Cup final with a first-half brace. His early impact guided a commanding 3-1 win over San Diego FC, a match effectively settled before halftime as Jesper Sørensen's side overwhelmed Mikey Varas' team and added an own goal via Pablo Sisniega.

Vancouver struck first through White, who finished from close range on the right side of the box after a pass from Andrés Cubas. Moments later, the lead doubled via a Pablo Sisniega own goal, and before halftime White struck again - a low, composed finish inside the left post assisted by Ali Ahmed - making it 3-0.

In the second half, Mexico international Hirving Lozano pulled one back for San Diego with a right-footed curler from outside the box after an assist from Anders Dreyer. But any hopes of a late push disappeared when Sisniega was shown a red card in the 79th minute.



Thomas Muller started and played 60 minutes but was largely quiet, finishing with zero shots and 82 percent passing.

Vancouver will now face Lionel Messi's Inter Miami next Saturday in a highly anticipated showdown between two clubs making their first appearance in MLS Cup. San Diego, an expansion side in their inaugural season, can hold their heads high after a run to the Western Conference finals - an impressive debut year.

Brian White was the clear standout, striking twice in the first half to send Vancouver to the MLS Cup final. The USMNT forward now has 18 goals this season, reinforcing his status as one of Sørensen's key players. He heads into next weekend's final in top form as the Whitecaps look to pull off an upset against Messi and Inter Miami.

Mikey Varas will face criticism for choosing not to start Hirving ‘Chucky' Lozano in San Diego's most important match of the season. The Mexican star didn't enter until the team trailed 3-0, though he scored their lone goal after coming on.

The tactical approach also fell short. Playing at home, San Diego were outplayed and effectively eliminated within the first half - a disappointing ending to an otherwise historic inaugural season.

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri's win marked his third Sprint victory in Qatar as he looks to chase down team mate and title rival Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri did everything he needed to in the Qatar Sprint as he held off George Russell and Lando Norris to charge to a dominant victory, giving him the momentum to fight to stay at the top for the rest of the weekend.

After securing Sprint pole position by just 0.032s on his final attempt, Piastri executed a great launch at lights out and kept the lead ahead of the Mercedes driver, who immediately had to defend from Norris.

The top three remained as they were for the rest of the 19-lap Sprint, even with an early challenge from Max Verstappen on the second McLaren. With only one DRS zone, it was difficult to overtake and much of the focus was on managing tyres ahead of what will be a crucial Qualifying hour.

Nevertheless, Piastri added eight points to his tally to remain in contention for the 2025 Drivers' Championship, and will be targeting a similar performance in the remaining sessions.

Speaking after the Sprint, he said: “Nice start to the day, definitely. Obviously it's been a little while since I've had a smooth run like that so I'm very happy with it so far. There's still a long way to go this weekend but it's all pointing in the right direction. It's been going well so far. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.”

The Australian returned to the podium for the first time since the Italian Grand Prix, preferring the characteristics of the Lusail International Circuit to the lower grip tracks the paddock has visited in recent rounds.

“It's obviously a very different circuit to where we have been,” Piastri told F1TV. “Much higher speed, much higher grip. I think the last couple of weekends there's just been things going wrong rather than a lack of pace so to speak.

“I think here, everything has gone smoothly so far and the pace has been strong. It's a track I've enjoyed in the past so I'm enjoying it again clearly.

“I think everyone slowly finds a little bit more through Sprint weekends. You've got to try and get every bit out of the car that you can but we'll try our best to do that. I think our base performance seems very strong around here so it's more just tuning rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.”

His team mate Norris was more eager to make adjustments ahead of Qualifying, and with overtaking being more difficult at this track, pole position would be ideal if he wants to secure the title this weekend.

He came close to passing Russell at the first corner on the opening lap, but the Mercedes' defence was too strong and Norris was forced to settle for P3, crossing the line over five seconds behind Piastri.

Asked what changes he hopes to make before Qualifying gets underway at 2100 local time, he said: “I'm not sure yet. I need to go and speak to the team. There are certainly some things I want to be improved. We'll see if we can improve them though, that's the question.

“It was a pretty straightforward Sprint, you just can't really do a lot. It's pretty impossible to follow around this kind of track. Not much happened – it was more just trying different things, trying to get a bit more of a picture of how to drive the car.

“I struggled quite a bit yesterday with the confidence and knowledge of how to keep this car on the limit compared to the last few weekends. I tried to figure some of those things out and we'll see if that can help me later.”

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri continued his momentum from Sprint Qualifying as he took a strong victory over George Russell and Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri stormed to a commanding victory in the Qatar Sprint, comprehensively beating George Russell and the second McLaren of Lando Norris in the 19-lap event.

Piastri led the field away confidently from pole position and came under little threat, with the exception of the tyre performance dropping off in the later laps, while the lead Mercedes kept Norris at bay to maintain second place.

The third title contender Max Verstappen could only improve from sixth to fourth as he continued to experience a frustrating issue with porpoising, while Kimi Antonelli initially took fifth place after Yuki Tsunoda was handed a time penalty for exceeding track limits.

However, Antonelli was also dealt a five-second penalty after the chequered flag, dropping the Mercedes rookie back to sixth and leaving Tsunoda with four points. Alonso and Carlos Sainz rounded out the points-paying positions in a Sprint dictated by tyre management and staying cleanly on the track.

Sprint results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS QATAR GRAND PRIX 2025

There was just one hour of practice on offer on Friday, increasing the pressure to put together a perfect lap in Sprint Qualifying to dictate the order for the 19-lap event. Piastri stormed to pole position on his final attempt, putting him in the best position to claim the maximum eight points for a win.

The Australian edged out the lead Mercedes of Russell by just 0.032s, while an error saw Norris find the gravel at the final corner, dropping him out of contention for the top spot. Alonso was an impressive fourth for Aston Martin, with Tsunoda taking P5, unexpectedly outqualifying his Red Bull team mate Verstappen.

The Dutchman typically excels in Sprint Qualifying, having secured 10 pole positions in this format, but he settled for sixth on the grid on this occasion.

It was an even trickier day for Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton, whose performance was summarised by his 10-word response in the post-session interview as he was knocked out of SQ1 in P18. As a result, the team elected to make changes to the car overnight under parc ferme conditions, leaving him to start from the pit lane – Lance Stroll, Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto found themselves in the same situation.

As the other 16 contenders lined up on the grid and the tyre blankets were removed, it was revealed that the medium compound was the tyre of choice for the majority, with a mix of used and fresh for the frontrunners.

The lights went out at the Lusail International Circuit and Piastri got the launch he needed to charge away from Russell, who immediately had to defend against Norris as they headed down to Turn 1. Just behind, Alonso lost out the most as he was passed by both Red Bulls, with Verstappen improving to P4 within what was a dream couple of corners for him.

It was a less than ideal opening lap for Charles Leclerc, who went wide at Turn 2 and dropped from ninth to 13th, landing him in a midfield DRS train. Things didn't look much better for his team mate Hamilton, who was still lingering in P18 after failing to improve on his pit lane start.

As Piastri sped up the road, establishing a gap of over a second on the first few laps, Verstappen unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Norris for third place before reporting that “the bouncing is still very bad” – he struggled with porpoising throughout Friday's running and it was evident that the problem had not been fully resolved.

As he continued relaying issues with both the radio quality and the car “jumping”, a chunk of Carlos Sainz's Williams was thrown onto the circuit while he was running in P8, but with Isack Hadjar 1.7s behind, he could afford to manage the damage.

Back at the front of the field, Piastri appeared to be in a league of his own having extended his lead to two seconds over Russell by Lap 11. The Mercedes driver was warned that tyre degradation could begin to come into play, but the top three were in little danger of changing order.

There was more action outside of the points-paying positions as Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson battled with Leclerc, veering off track while trying to pass the Ferrari. He quickly gave the position back and was not the only one finding difficulty staying within track limits – Tsunoda was revealed to be under investigation for going over the white line too many times, and he was subsequently handed a five-second time penalty.

That proved to be good news for Kimi Antonelli, who improved to P6 when Alonso drifted wide at the final corner and looked to gain another position from the Red Bull driver's penalty if he could stay within the track limits himself.

However, the Italian youngster ended up being handed a time penalty for identical reasons to Tsunoda, ultimately leaving him in sixth place. He nevertheless had a much better Sprint than the Ferrari pair, who scored zero points as Leclerc and Hamilton crossed the line in P13 and P17 respectively.

Others who failed to score were Hadjar in P9 and Alex Albon in P10, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman, meaning that Kick Sauber is still the only team without a point from a Sprint this season.

Lawson was 14th ahead of Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg, with the remaining pit lane starters treating the session as a testing event and pitting for fresh tyres at various stages.

""I mean it's been a good weekend so far,"" said Piastri. ""I think everything went smoothly in the Sprint. I'm happy with how it's been so far, just need to keep it rolling.""

Following the Sprint, the drivers will return to the track for Qualifying for the Qatar Grand Prix at 1800 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri found his form in Qatar as he took pole position for both the Sprint and Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri put together an eye-catching lap to beat his title rivals Lando Norris and Max Verstappen to pole position at the last opportunity in Qualifying for the Qatar Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver will be more eager than ever to maintain his lead in the 57-lap race as a victory will force the battle for the Drivers' Championship to continue into Abu Dhabi, and he has undoubtedly put himself in the strongest place to keep himself in contention.

Norris, who holds a 22-point advantage over Piastri, took provisional pole with a blistering lap, but nevertheless needed to go again. At the beginning of his second attempt, he came close to drifting off track due to understeer and chose to abort the lap, leaving his team mate with one chance to beat his time.

Having converted pole to a win in the Sprint, Piastri knew what he needed to do and ended the session with a time of 1m 19.387s, 0.108s clear of Norris' earlier effort.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri secured what could be an all-important pole position to keep himself in the title fight in Qatar.

Oscar Piastri denied Standings leader Lando Norris a chance to start the Qatar Grand Prix from pole position as he delivered a spectacular lap on his final attempt, beating both his McLaren team mate and Max Verstappen.

After taking a commanding victory in the earlier Sprint, Piastri used the momentum to shoot to the top of the timesheets with a time of 1m 19.387s, nearly six-tenths faster than the lap that earned him Sprint pole position on Friday.

He looked in control throughout the session, but it was Norris who took provisional pole after the first runs of Q3. However, on his second attempt, a snap of understeer saw him abandon the lap, giving Piastri free rein to put together an even faster lap.

With the Australian aiming for a clean sweep in Qatar, a victory would take the title fight into the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

With Red Bull struggling to solve Max Verstappen's porpoising issue, he missed out on qualifying on the front row in Qatar.

Max Verstappen reluctantly accepted that the issues plaguing his Red Bull were too great for him to be in the fight for pole position in Qatar, but he was optimistic that “anything can happen” in the upcoming Grand Prix.

The reigning World Champion, who finds himself within 25 points of Lando Norris' lead in the Standings, has repeatedly struggled with the car bouncing at the Lusail International Circuit.

Red Bull have been unable to find a complete solution in the four sessions so far, making Verstappen's challenge of taking the fight to the McLaren duo even more difficult.

Despite struggling with the problem again in Qualifying, he ended the hour in P3, 0.264s adrift of Oscar Piastri's pole lap.

Asked whether his car performance had improved, he replied: “I think this Qualifying was a little bit better even though we were still quite far off, let's say it like that.

""I felt a little bit happier but there are still some limitations that don't allow us to push harder around the lap, but at least we are P3.

“Starting on the second row creates better opportunities because we know it's quite hard to pass around here. We'll see what we can do tomorrow. Realistically, it's a bit tough this weekend. It's just not been what I wanted it to be so far, but we'll see what we can do tomorrow.”

After identifying the issue in the sole practice session of the weekend, the Dutchman has gradually edged closer to the McLarens, turning sixth on the grid to fourth in the Sprint. After passing Fernando Alonso and Yuki Tsunoda on the opening lap, he was unable to follow third-placed Norris closely.

To carry the title fight between himself, Piastri and Norris into the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen must find a way to outscore the Briton in the Qatar Grand Prix, making his start on the opening lap crucial.

Prompted on his expectations for the race, he said: “I already saw it of course in the Sprint. I don't expect that to be completely different tomorrow so we'll see. We'll try to do the best we can. I'll try to have a good start and just go from there because anything can happen.

“I think it was a little bit nicer to drive but still lacking the same things as what I had yesterday and this afternoon. It was less severe but still big enough to not be closer, but that's our problem with these medium-speed corners.

“There's just a little bit too much understeer and you can't push how you want to, plus you overheat the tyres as well, which on a track like this is almost like a double whammy.”

‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Sprint and Qualifying at the Qatar Grand Prix from the Lusail International Circuit.

Piastri led from pole for the Sprint and was never troubled as he recorded his first Sprint win of the season and third on the bounce in Qatar. He did everything he could to reduce the Championship lead that his team mate enjoys, and in the end took two points out of Norris, who came home third. Norris had to work hard at the start after briefly challenging Russell for P2, and then had to defend with Verstappen behind having DRS in the early stages. But third place was more than enough to keep the Championship firmly in his own grasp.

When it came to Qualifying, the two team mates slugged it out all the way to the last laps of Q3. Norris grabbed provisional pole on the first runs, but was a spectator on the second runs after a mistake forced him to abandon at Turn 2. Piastri nailed his last lap to steal pole back, as McLaren locked out the front row.

Lando Norris, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:19.495

“Sprint and Quali done here in Qatar. The Sprint wasn't the most eventful, but it was useful ahead of tomorrow's Grand Prix.

""The front row is a good starting position for tomorrow's race. We saw in the Sprint how difficult it can be to overtake here, but with a longer race and some more strategy options, we'll see what we can do to fight for the win. We'll work this evening to prepare for the race and make sure we're in the best possible position for tomorrow's Grand Prix.""

Oscar Piastri, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 1st, 1:19.387

""A great result to be on Pole and to have won the Sprint. I've been able to get comfortable in the car really easily here and the pace has been mega. Driving around here in these conditions is some of the most fun you can have in an F1 car, so it seems to have all clicked well. However, the big points are in the main race, so let's see what we can do tomorrow. Just got to keep focused, do what we can overnight and make sure we finish first.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""A very positive day for the team, with a first and third place in the Sprint and a one-two finish in Qualifying. Oscar was perfect today, it would be difficult to ask him to do a better job, and it was great to hear him so happy on his in-lap after Pole position. Lando didn't have perfect balance in the Sprint and in Qualifying a small mistake in his last attempt in Q3 cost him the chance to fight for Pole right to the end, but once again another strong effort and he'll be on the front row of the starting grid.

""There is still a lot of work to do to prepare for the race and we have no intention of making calculations, especially because our main opponent will be right behind us, ready to take his chances. As always, we will focus on ourselves to maximise our starting positions.""

Russell had to get his elbows out at the start, aggressively moving across the track to ensure Norris did not slip past. From there, he could not keep up with Piastri, but did well to stay ahead of Norris and hold onto second place. Antonelli also scored, as the teenager managed to sneak past Alonso when the Spaniard ran wide. But he was handed a five-second time penalty for track limit infringements and was fortunate to hold onto sixth.

Come Qualifying, both cars made it to Q3. Russell went for the double warm-up tactic, but just did not have the pace to fight for higher than fourth, as he was ably backed up by his team mate in fifth.

George Russell, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 4th, 1:19.662

""We can be pleased to be starting P4 tomorrow; it's a good place to be on the grid and gives us a solid opportunity to score strong points in our battle for P2 in the Constructors' Championship. Obviously, being so close to P3 with such a small margin of just one hundredth between us and Verstappen is annoying, but the field is so close right now. Both McLarens were fast throughout and did an impressive job so I think P3 was the maximum we could have hoped for. Overall, we did a good job as a team with Kimi in P5, and we will be looking to secure P2 in the standings tomorrow.

""Tomorrow's race will be interesting with the tyre stint limit making it a mandatory two-stop race. The car balance has felt good this weekend so I'm hopeful that we can be in the race for the podium. We are looking forward and let's see what the points situation is once the chequered flag falls.""

Kimi Antonelli, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:19.846

""I am not fully satisfied with P5 today as I know we had a little bit more pace to show. That said, it is still a solid place to be starting tomorrow's race from and gives us a good chance of banking a decent number of points.

""My final lap in qualifying wasn't perfect. I had a strong second sector but struggled more than the rest of the weekend to hook up the first sector. I lost the rear a little bit at turn one and that caused me to lose some momentum. That always makes it a little more difficult to recover the lost time through the rest of the lap. That was disappointing, however, we improved our performance considerably compared to yesterday's sessions and I am sure we will be able to maximise the potential of the car tomorrow. Strategically, it should be a straightforward two-stop. The start, just like it did in today's Sprint, is likely going to play a huge role in the outcome of the race, so that is where I need to gain as many positions as possible.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""That was a solid, if not spectacular, Saturday in Qatar. Coming into the weekend, our focus has been on continuing to score good points as we try to secure P2 in the Constructors' Championship ahead of the final race of the season. P2 with George in the Sprint plus Kimi bringing home a further three points has helped us extend our advantage slightly. A decent qualifying session, with the cars in P4 and P5, gives us a good opportunity to seal our place in the standings on Sunday.

""We aren't getting ahead of ourselves though. The field is incredibly competitive with just one tenth of a second the difference between multiple places in qualifying today. We also saw how difficult it was to overtake in the Sprint so making sure we're in a strong position after lap one tomorrow will be key. McLaren are clearly the reference this weekend, but we are within striking distance. It will be interesting to see how the strategy plays out with the mandatory stint lengths too. We will race hard, be looking to challenge for the podium, and hopefully do the job we need to in order to close out P2.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""That was another solid day in Qatar. In the Sprint, George didn't get off the line brilliantly but did well to hold position. Kimi had a decent start but couldn't quite turn that into a gain of positions. Overtaking is challenging here so we knew that we would likely be looking to bank our positions from there. George did a good job to do that and pick up a Sprint podium whilst Kimi did well to pressure Alonso into a mistake. Unfortunately, he picked up a five0second penalty for track limits which without that would have given him P5; P6 was still useful points though.

""We didn't change the car much going into qualifying; it's always a bit of a balance between chasing more performance with setup changes and ending up with a car that the drivers find less compliant. This evening's session ran smoothly but both drivers felt that they could have found a bit of time and been starting higher up the grid tomorrow; there were no glaring errors though and realistically McLaren were out of reach today. We scored useful points in the Sprint and have a good chance of adding to that tomorrow. If we can do so, we can be confident of sewing up P2 in the Constructors' ahead of Abu Dhabi.""

Both Verstappen and Tsunoda had strong starts, and both picked Alonso off the line. Tsunoda then yielded to his team mate, which allowed Verstappen to charge after Norris. The Dutchman had DRS for lap after lap, but eventually had to give up the fight as his tyres ran out of life in the dirty air. As for Tsunoda, he was handed a track limit penalty and had five-seconds added to his race time. Fortunately, Antonelli behind did likewise, so Tsunoda did not lose any places at the flag.

But the Japanese driver's strong weekend did not continue as he exited Qualifying at the first time of asking. Verstappen made Q3 in a car that finally looked more balanced, but he did not have the pace to fight with the McLarens for pole tonight. He starts third, knowing he has to finish ahead of Norris to keep his Championship charge going.

Max Verstappen, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:19.651

“It was a tough start to the weekend with the Sprint as we were not entirely happy with the behaviour of the car. We were a bit off the pace and, although we got a good start, there was still a bit of work to do with the car. In Qualifying, the performance of the car was better; there were a few limitations, including understeer, which this track can highlight, but we still maximised our performance. Before the session, we changed a few things with the car and make the most out of it with our prep. Overall, I'm pretty happy with P3 and we will see what we can do in the race. Hopefully we can have a strong day tomorrow and you never know what can happen around here, there are a lot of medium speed corners which we can tend to struggle with, but it will also be about looking after our tyres. The two-stop strategy can work for you or against you, but we will find out tomorrow. On race day, the most important thing will be to try and have a good start. We might struggle to stay with the McLarens, but you never know what can happen, we will try everything that we can.""

Yuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:20.761

""Today was a mixed day, the Sprint was good for me and then Qualifying didn't follow the same pattern. I got a good start in the Sprint, I could have maybe taken more risks but I wanted to keep the car safe. Max also got a good start and as a Team we were able to make it work and I could help Max out. I nearly lost out with the time penalty but I felt like I had a strong Sprint, with good pace. I don't understand what then happened in Qualifying, we didn't change much in the car, but I just didn't have much grip and felt like I had lost the pace. My lap felt pretty tidy, probably tidier than yesterday, so I can't fully explain what was different from Sprint Qualifying, it is very frustrating. I will do my best tomorrow and try to use the pace I had in the Sprint to overtake as much as possible.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“We managed to recover a little from Friday in the Sprint, as Max did well to make up positions on a track on which it is tricky to pass. It was positive on Yuki's side too, he managed his best finish with the Team and carried on his good work from Sprint Qualifying. The Team, Max, and Yuki have never given up in the search for performance, and we had a fairly unpleasant car at times over the weekend. Everyone on track and back at base kept working to find the improvements and while we've not quite reached the pace of the McLarens, the gap has closed a little in Qualifying this evening. For Yuki, it was tough out there, he was only three tenths off Max, which on a track like this is nothing to be ashamed of and on any other day it would have been a strong session for him. Heading into the race tomorrow there is the mandatory two-stop in the race here, which could produce some surprises, and we will be ready to take any opportunity coming our way.”

Starting fourth, Alonso dropped two places at the start as he struggled to get his medium tyres working. He then ran sixth for much of the race, but found tyre wear quite high and slid wide at one point which allowed Antonelli through. In the end he held onto seventh, and those two points were enough to lift Aston Martin ahead of Haas in the Championship. As for Stroll, he started on tyres that were seven laps old and thus had to pit. He bolted on the softs, so gained some crucial information ahead of Qualifying.

Alonso's strong weekend continued apace as he made Q3 in Qualifying, but he could not quite match his P4 from yesterday. Eighth on the grid is still a very promising slot for tomorrow though. Stroll once again could not match the Spaniard, exiting at the first time of asking.

Fernando Alonso, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:20.418

""I was quite surprised we were able to fight for Q3 again tonight and I'm happy with P8. We only had four sets of new Softs in Qualifying, so we opted to use them in Q1 and Q2 and it meant we were left with used tyres at the end in Q3.  We scored two points earlier in the Sprint, but I think it will be more difficult for us tomorrow as the tyre degradation is quite high. Every point is crucial at the moment for the Constructors', so we will give it our all.""

Lance Stroll, Sprint: 19th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:21.058

""A frustrating day today qualifying in P19. I feel like I'm on the limit with the grip that I have and can't find any more pace. I felt pretty good in the car, but the lap time is just not coming together for me here and I didn't manage to go any quicker than that. It will be tricky tomorrow to fight back any positions as it's hard to overtake at this track, but we'll see what chances we get.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""It was good to score a couple of points in the Sprint earlier today with Fernando in P7 – an important result as we close out the season. Fernando carried this momentum into Qualifying ending the session in P8. He enjoys this track and the car has been more competitive here. Lance delivered clean laps but was not able to progress into Q2. Let's see what happens tomorrow. It's usually a track position race – with everybody mandated to stop twice – but we will be ready to capitalise on any opportunity.""

Sainz managed to score in the Sprint, holding on to his starting position of P8. That was despite a chunk of his bodywork falling off midway through the race, which could easily have cost him lap time. Albon was slightly unlucky, he finished 10th and was within touching distance of Hadjar ahead, but ran out of time to try and make a move.

Sainz made the top 10 again in Qualifying, but came a cropper in Q3 when he found himself on an out-lap with some material caught around his rear tyre. That damaged the side of his car, so all things considered, seventh on the grid is a great result. Albon faded in Qualifying, managing just P15.

Alex Albon, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:20.629

""We made some balance and setup changes after the Sprint and the car felt better in qualifying which is a positive takeaway. Ultimately, we just didn't have the grip today; I was sliding around a bit and struggled to get the tyres in the right window in Q2. We found that we had decent grip with used sets in Q1, so we'll review the operating windows and our out laps to better understand performance. Overtaking was difficult on this track in the Sprint, with it being a quiet race with not much action from my side. As a team this track wasn't expected to suit us, but I'm optimistic for tomorrow and we'll see what we can do during the race to make up some positions.""

Carlos Sainz, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:20.287

""Another good session and happy with P7. We took another step in the right direction and I think I extracted the maximum out of the car today. In Q3, the sticker on the floor of the garage stuck to my wheel and caused damage to the bodywork as it unravelled, but despite this I still managed to do a solid lap on the last attempt and secure a good starting position for tomorrow.

""We expect a good battle in the midfield and with two mandatory pit stops we are up for some interesting strategies. I'm confident we can execute a good race and hopefully bring more points for the team. Let's race!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""If anyone had said before the weekend that we'd be fighting in Q3 and qualifying in the top seven, we would have taken it. Well done to Carlos, brilliant execution, and well done to the team. It was really tricky getting the tyres into the right window today, but P7 was a brilliant result. It puts Carlos on the clean side of the grid and bodes well for tomorrow's race. In the case of Alex, it was just on a knife edge with everyone getting the tyres working, and we just couldn't get into the right window. He had snaps in turn one every time and couldn't show his performance today. We'll regroup overnight and review how we can create the best opportunities for him in the race tomorrow. He's still quick, it's just about maximising the opportunities.""

Contrasting fortunes in the Sprint for the two Racing Bulls boys. Hadjar made a great start and ran ninth, showing that the car does have top-10 potential this weekend after a disappointing Sprint Qualifying. But Lawson struggled, and had to give a place back to Leclerc after only managing to get the Ferrari man by running off track.

Hadjar made up for his SQ2 exit yesterday by making it to the top-10 in Qualifying, grabbing sixth on the grid as the best midfield runner out there. Lawson did not make Q3 this time around, but is not out of contention in P12.

Isack Hadjar, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 6th, 1:20.114

""We had a pretty good Saturday and I'm happy with the performance we showed. This afternoon in the Sprint I had an awesome first lap, and if I hadn't lost the position during a battle with Kimi and Carlos, then I would have probably been able to score a point. Later in Qualifying, I think we really extracted the maximum from the car as we couldn't have finished higher up in the standings; P6 was really our best today. I felt the car was easy to drive and I reached the limit pretty quickly in the session, then from there I just made tiny steps lap by lap. Looking at tomorrow, it's going to be important to have a good start even if we start from the wrong side of the grid. I expect it to be a full push race and the target is to score points.”

Liam Lawson, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:20.433

""The car has been very sensitive this weekend but it felt in a much better window compared to yesterday, meaning we ended Q1 in a good place. Unfortunately, very small changes make the car feel tricky to drive, so we barely improved in Q2. It's frustrating, but a step up from yesterday given our race pace was very good when the balance was there. We'll come together to make improvements ahead of the race tomorrow.”

Tim Goss, Chief Technical Officer

“A really good day for VCARB today in Qatar. Both drivers had good starts, good opening laps and gained places in the Sprint. Isack was briefly ahead of Sainz and into a points scoring position, but slipped back after attempting an overtake on Antonelli. He made up two places from his starting position and finished 9th. Liam had a great opening lap and settled in just behind Leclerc, gaining a total of three places to finish 14th. Overall we were pleased to make places and to show our car's race pace which was strong ahead of tomorrow. Qualifying was an exciting session. We knew both drivers had more to deliver than Sprint Qualifying and we proved it. Both drivers progressed through Q1 comfortably and retained new tyre sets for the later sessions. Q2 was extremely tight, and Liam just missed the cut into Q3. Isack progressed and ultimately delivered two fantastic laps to qualify an impressive 6th. Both drivers are well placed against our main competitors in the Constructor's Championship and we look forwards to bagging some vital points in the race tomorrow.”

Kick Sauber did not mange to score in any of the Sprints this year, the only team not to do so. Bortoleto finished ahead of his team mate though, as he picked up a couple of places in the 19-lap dash and Hulkenberg lost a couple. Come Qualifying, both cars made Q2 which was good considering Bortoleto has a five-place grid drop to take.

But he wound up 14th, and thus drops to the last row of the grid tomorrow. Therefore, any chance of points falls to Hulkenberg, who is handily placed in P11.

Nico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 16th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:20.353

""It was a clean qualifying session for us: I'm relatively happy with the laps and the effort we put in, although it's frustrating to miss out on Q3 for just three thousandths of a second. The margins were incredibly fine and that time was probably out there somewhere. Still, we are on the edge of the top ten and we have an extra set of soft tyres for tomorrow's race: we've seen this morning, in the Sprint, how difficult overtaking can be, but we are competitive and we're around cars we can fight.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:20.534

“The Sprint went quite okay for us. I gained two positions at the start, had a solid launch, and the pace felt decent, so I was pretty satisfied with that. Qualifying was a bit more challenging: I pushed a little too hard, ran slightly wide, and that was enough to cost me the lap. The rest of it wasn't too bad, but it definitely wasn't ideal. Tomorrow I'll be starting P19 with the penalty from Las Vegas, so it won't be an easy job. It's a long race though, and we'll take what we learned today and try to move forward up the grid.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“While today's Sprint was rather uneventful for us, seeing Gabi finishing in P11 after making up two positions at the start, and Nico in P16, Qualifying was much more positive. I was particularly pleased with how the pitwall executed throughout the session, placing the cars in the right windows in traffic and managing the run plans cleanly. We had an encouraging start with both cars moving comfortably into Q2. Nico delivered very clean laps and missed out on Q3 by only 0.003 seconds, finishing P11. Gabi didn't quite manage to perfectly execute his laps, and with the five-place grid penalty he carries from Las Vegas, he will start the race from P19.

“There is still everything to play for tomorrow. We need to finish ahead of our main competitors in what is a very tight battle in the Constructors' Championship, and with limitations on tyre life, it might be an interesting race.”

Haas dropped to eighth in the Constructors' Championship after the Sprint, having watched their rivals Aston Martin score courtesy of Alonso. They did not have the pace to fight for the points, but will hope to have learned enough to challenge tomorrow in the Grand Prix. But the bad news for the American outfit is that once again Alonso is in the top 10, and once again neither Haas car is. Thus, they are up against it to try and retake that P7 slot tomorrow in the Grand Prix.

Esteban Ocon, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 17th, 1:20.864

“It was a difficult Sprint. The start was good, but after that, we picked up a lot of degradation and we couldn't really keep up with the car in front, and being in traffic didn't help. We tried to push things to the extreme in terms of set-up for qualifying, we really gave it our best go. It's something we've never done as much to fix it, but we still have the underlying issue where we can't put more front wing into the car, it's still very loose on entry, and I still struggle to brake. I hope there's going to be high degradation in the race, and if that's the case, we can come back through the field and benefit from others, but at the moment, that's our only hope.”

Oliver Bearman, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:20.438

“The Sprint was quite uneventful – the race was difficult with the balance that I had. I was struggling quite a lot, and that was getting worse as I went on, so for the last few laps I was really hanging on. We've learned a lot from this race, so we get to fix things for the race tomorrow. Yesterday, we were very uncompetitive in high-speed, so that's really what we need to fix. We made a big step with the car for qualifying, which is positive, I had a much better feeling than I did this time yesterday. Unfortunately, in Q2 I think we chose the wrong approach, I went for two laps at the end, where in hindsight I think the peak of the tyre was in that first lap, but I was carrying the extra fuel of the run plan I was doing, so it's fine margins. I'm going to remain open-minded and positive, we made a big step with the car, so I'll look forward to tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“In the Sprint, limitations were actually quite different from what we anticipated from yesterday's Sprint Quali. It also gave us a good indication on what we needed to do for our qualifying set-up. Some areas were better, but there are other problems we still couldn't solve, hence we're still losing lap time in high-speed. It's a shame to miss out on Q3 with Ollie, I don't think we got the finer details right with tire usage on Q2. When the field is so tight, we have to get everything right. Tomorrow, we need to see how we make use of our pace, which I think is better than our qualifying position, but it won't be easy.”

Leclerc made a poor start, immediately dropping out of the top-10. That left him in the midst of the midfield fights, and although he got close to Bearman, he could not find a way through. The car looked difficult again, with Leclerc running wide on occasion. Hamilton had opted for a pit lane start after changing his downforce levels, but that did not pay dividends, and he was unable to make any progress from the back of the field.

Hamilton's day did not improve in Qualifying, as he exited in Q1 to make that two races in a row where he has dropped out at the first time of asking. Leclerc made Q3, but only had used tyres in the shootout. He then had a massive spin for good measure, managing just P10 in the end.

Charles Leclerc, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:20.561

""We gave it our all. This weekend has been very tough so far. We just don't have the pace needed in the car on this type of track and were struggling to put in good laps in qualifying.
We can't hide our disappointment. I don't have big expectations for tomorrow, but I'll try to reset and will do my best as always to bring home a good result for the team.""

Lewis Hamilton, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:20.907

""P18 is a disappointing result and doesn't reflect the hard work the team has put in over the last two days. Clearly this track doesn't seem to suit our car and we're still working to identify a set-up that meets its needs. We'll keep pushing, analyse the data tonight, and look for every opportunity to put ourselves back in the points tomorrow.""

Alpine opted for a double pit lane start for their drivers, after changing their set-ups in a bid to find some improvements ahead of Qualifying and the Grand Prix. They then pitted both cars late on for the soft tyres, to gain some experience on the C3 rubber. What they did clearly paid dividends on Gasly's side of the garage as the Frenchman made it to Q3 for the 10th time this season. He is well placed to fight for points tomorrow in P9.

Pierre Gasly, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 9th, 1:20.477

“I am very happy to be in Q3 for the tenth time this season. The team did a very good job today to make changes to the car, which felt a lot better and I was much more confident behind the wheel. We used the Sprint as a mini Practice session to try and understand a few things and make the necessary changes. The car felt much nicer to drive in Qualifying and we were able to put in a lot of good laps. After yesterday, I certainly did not think Q3 would be possible, so it just goes to show everyone's hard work and motivation within the team to find the right improvements. We will take the positives when we can and now we look forward to tomorrow's race. It is a mandatory two-stop for everyone with the limit on laps per tyre set. We saw today in the Sprint how hard it is to overtake here. We will need a good start, really fight for it, and hopefully we will be in the top ten at the end.”

Franco Colapinto, Sprint: 20th, Qualifying: 20th, 1:21.137

“It was not the best day on my side of the garage, particularly with how I drove today and my own performance. We made some positive improvements with the car between sessions, and it was just poor execution from my side. There was definitely more in the car and we didn't make the most of it today. For the Sprint, we decided to make some changes to the set up and used the session as a test. It was good to learn a few things and make some positive changes. The car immediately felt better on the first lap in Q1 but unfortunately, I ran wide into the gravel on the exit of Turn 15. I also made a mistake on my second push lap again running into the gravel on the exit kerb. Then we put everything on the final lap and we didn't do enough to progress. Overall, it was a messy session and one we take on the chin and quickly move on from.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“It has been an interesting past 24 hours where we have been able to completely transform our prospects for this race weekend courtesy of a lot of hard work and good decision making within the team. We decided to compromise our Sprint Race by changing the set up on both cars, meaning a Pit Lane start, in order to find improvements ahead of Qualifying, which clearly has worked. On Franco's side, while the car felt better, he probably knows he left some lap time on the table and we will continue to work with him in order to do a better job next time. Pierre has put himself in a great position for tomorrow's race where he will start in ninth place. He was really dialled in and put in some fantastic laps. We know we have the 25-lap limit per tyre set tomorrow so it will be interesting to see what teams decide to do on strategy and we will do our best to put ourselves in a competitive position to score points.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“The only difference in tyre choice for the sprint race was new or used mediums, depending on the results from sprint qualifying – as the few drivers not to get through SQ1 were able to use new tyres. Three drivers also made a pit stop in the sprint race to try out the soft tyres, probably to assess their potential use in Sunday's grand prix.

""Just as was the case last year, we saw some tyres where graining had accelerated wear: taking it to the maximum but without any loss of performance. These instances, noted mainly on the front-left tyres, are exactly why the limit of 25 laps on each set has been imposed.

""The considerably faster lap times compared not only to last year but also the latest simulations has led to a bigger increase in loads on the tyres than expected. As a precaution, we already prescribed an increase in minimum pressures of 1 psi on both axles at the end of Friday.

""We saw some more cuts on some of the tyre treads during Saturday, but fewer than Friday. The two pit stops expected on Sunday should mitigate this issue. Looking ahead to the race, the sets of mediums kept back by the teams lead to the conclusion that most could go for two stints on the yellow tyre. The fastest strategy is with a final stint on the soft, following a pit stop between laps 44-50. The use of the hard C1 at the beginning, or alternatively between two medium C2 stints, would allow the pit stops to be spread out more evenly during the race – but this is theoretically slower than a strategy that uses all three available compounds.

""Medium-hard-soft is the second-quickest tactic on paper, with pit stop windows that are identical to the fastest strategy: between laps 19-25 and 46-50, in accordance with the lap limit. If there are no safety cars, we believe that the teams are likely to maximise the 25 laps allowed for each set.

""Another strategy using all three compounds could be hard-medium-soft, with a shorter final stint to the flag. In short, there are plenty of options on the table.”

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive

Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Lando Norris reflect on finishing in the top three in the Qatar Sprint at the Lusail International Circuit.

1 – Oscar PIASTRI (McLaren), 2 – George RUSSELL (Mercedes), 3 – Lando NORRIS (McLaren)

TRACK INTERVIEWS

(Conducted by Jolyon Palmer)

Q: Well, down here with the top three. First things first, welcome back, Oscar. What a weekend it's been for you so far and that looked like a really controlled drive.

Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah, I mean, it's been a good weekend so far. I think everything went smoothly in the Sprint there, so yeah, happy with how it's been so far. Just need to keep it rolling.

Q: What do you feel has changed for this weekend compared to the tricky ones you've been on recently? Because from the first lap yesterday, you looked like you were right back in the zone.

OP: It's obviously a very different circuit to where we have been. Much higher speeds, much higher grip. I think the last couple of weekends it's just been things going wrong rather than a lack of pace, so to speak. So, I think here, everything's going smoothly so far and the pace has been strong. So yeah, it's a track I've enjoyed in the past, so enjoying it again, clearly.

Q: Three out of three Sprint wins, well done. George, playing detective, I saw you at the end out of the car. We heard a little bit of chatter about your left front. How was the race for you? And obviously, you spent a bit of time in the dirtier air. How was that?

George RUSSELL: Yeah, I mean, it was a good race. Good to get P2. We obviously know these guys are really quick but those last two laps were a real struggle. This track's so quick. It's one of the most fun tracks to drive and it's obviously brutal on the tyres, on the car. So yeah, glad to bring it home.

Q: Talk me through the physicality around this place. Obviously, the high-speed corners, especially that last sector. I imagine the necks of all of you guys are going to take a bit of a working, but particularly for the Grand Prix tomorrow.

GR: Yeah, I mean, I was trying to rest it as much as I could to be honest. It's pretty brutal. I mean, I don't know what the G-force is — it's like five G for what feels like forever around that triple right. But it's really cool. It's what it should be like everywhere really. And yeah, glad we got the chance to race around here.

Q: Absolutely. And Lando, good points for you, up in the top three once again. I can't imagine you loved seeing Max in your mirrors so close in the early laps, but you dealt with it very well. How was it?

Lando NORRIS: I never saw him, actually, I just saw George ahead. So yeah, I tried to go forwards. We got pretty close at the start, but it was good. No, I didn't see what happened behind. So, long stint, it felt like a lot of pushing. So, like you said, it's going to be a tough race tomorrow. But yeah, just not easy to pass around here. Too difficult. So yeah, it's all about qualifying.

Q: He was having half looks down your inside at Turn 1 on lap two…

LN: Never saw him!

Q: Good to see you focused all the way in front then. Speaking of being in front – qualifying. You said yesterday you thought there was a little bit more in there. Didn't quite hook up the soft tyres. You've got another chance later on. Feeling confident?

LN: Yeah, I mean, George was almost on pole, so he's showing that the Mercedes is quick and he's doing a very, very good job. So, I think it'll be close. I don't think it's going to be an easy one. But, you know, the team have also given us a very good car once again, as they always do this year, and it's been quick. It's a hell of a lap around here in qualifying, so I'm looking forward to it.

Q: Great. And Oscar, back to you. Lando's saying the car has been great for you, but we know from the Sprint to the Grand Prix, things can change. You've been so good so far. Do you stick with where you're at or do you have to keep moving forward to find more pace for qualifying?

OP: Ideally, if we can find more pace. I think, you know, everyone slowly finds a little bit more through a Sprint weekend, so you've got to try and get every bit out of the car that you can. But yeah, we'll try our best to do that. But I think our base performance seems very strong around here, so it's more just tuning rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Very well done, Oscar. Your first P1 of any sort since Zandvoort. Just how sweet was it to be back up front with a clear road ahead?

Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah, it was nice. It was nice to have some clean air again. It makes a pretty big difference. So yeah, just nice to get off to a smooth start to the weekend, really. So yeah, car's been good so far and I feel like I've been able to gel with it pretty good. So yeah, obviously, the short part of the weekend's over, and now the real stuff begins.

Q: It looked like a very controlled race from you. Were there any anxious moments? At one point, you were talking about a vibration on the radio?

OP: Yeah, like five or six laps to the end. I think it was front left that was starting to vibrate a bit, and I hadn't locked up or anything, so it's never a great sign when you start getting vibrations out of nowhere. So I think it was a similar thing for other people as well. So yeah, we'll see if there's any concerns with that, but that was pretty much the only concern.

Q: You seem much happier in the car here in Qatar. What do you put it down to? Is it the different circuit? Is there something different in the car?

OP: I mean, it's definitely a different circuit. You know, incredibly high-speed, much higher grip surface as well. But I think, honestly, the last couple of weekends have been not bad in terms of pace. It's just been mistakes or things out of our control going wrong. So, I think this weekend, the pace has been probably a little bit stronger, but everything's just been smooth. So, I think that's the biggest difference.

Q: Any changes set-up wise ahead of qualifying this evening?

OP: I'll find out shortly, but the car's been good so far. So, if it is, it'll be tweaks rather than anything major.

Q: George, let's come to you now. Very well done to you. From your point of view, how was the Sprint? How was the performance of the car?

George RUSSELL: Yeah, it was a pretty lonely race, to be honest. It was fun, because it was flat out, but I didn't really have any chance of attacking Oscar and had a pretty good gap ahead of Lando as well. So it was pretty uneventful until the last three laps – similar to Oscar's – started getting a big vibration on the tyres. I could just see it opening up and I thought, “yeah, this could be it,” you know, bit of a puncture or something. So just brought it home in the last two laps.

Q: It was quite a static race at the front, as you say. Coming into the weekend, did you expect to have a similar pace to the McLaren?

GR: We weren't too sure, to be honest. I think we all expected Red Bull to be the favourites this weekend based on their high-speed performance. Qualifying was strange yesterday. You know, every single lap was improving so much, and it was whoever put the lap together on the last lap of Q3 that defined the starting order. And ultimately, on a track like this with the lack of tyre degradation – at least at the front – where you finish lap one is where you're going to finish the race.
So I was happy with qualifying. It doesn't mean that this afternoon is going to be the same again because ultimately, it's just so tight.

Q: Going to make any changes? Do you think you can challenge for pole again today?

GR: Yeah. I mean, I felt really happy with my lap yesterday. It was one of my strongest of the season. I don't think we've really got the pace, to be honest. I think if we absolutely nail it, we can be there or thereabouts as we were yesterday. But I don't think it will be as straightforward this evening.

Q: Lando, let's come to you. Congratulations. Another Sprint podium for you. Just how did the race play out?

Lando NORRIS: Pretty simple, really. You know, there's not a lot going on. Nothing much throughout the whole race. Just impossible to follow around here, you know? As soon as you're within three seconds or so, you start to struggle. So yeah, not a lot. I tried to save my tyres a bit for the end and the pace was certainly a little bit better. But yeah, after doing the whole race not too far behind George, then you pay the price in terms of tyre deg. So yeah, honestly, not too much.

Q: Paying the price for tyre deg – is that the understeer that you were referring to over the radio with your engineer Will Joseph?

LN: A bit of everything around here, to be honest. It's understeer, oversteer. It's a little bit more all over the place than in some of the last few tracks. So yeah, I mean, it's just such a quick track. You really require every bit of downforce possible. And when you're following so closely, you lose a lot of the downforce, so it just makes your life very, very difficult. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Q: And just how happy are you with the car? I mean, Oscar's talking about only making minor tweaks ahead of qualifying this evening. Are you in a similar boat, or do you feel there's more to find?

LN: No. I mean, the car is in a pretty good place. There's certainly little things you might want to tweak as well, but it was more I just didn't put things together at all yesterday, but the pace was there. So yeah, some things, some driving styles that have been working the last few weeks have just really not worked at all here, especially when it got quicker and quicker. The more I leaned on what's been working, the more I just went slower and slower. So yeah, I tried to use the Sprint to try and learn some things. I feel like I got some things figured out and other things not. So yeah, maybe not in a perfect place, but probably a bit better than yesterday.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) Question to all three, please. George, you said yesterday that maybe we need to look at the length of the DRS zones after the Sprint. Given today's Sprint throughout the field was not the most exciting to watch, do you think that might help something for the main Grand Prix, or is it just as Lando said, almost impossible to follow here no matter what?

GR: Yeah. Well, I mean, I didn't even get DRS one single lap, so it doesn't matter if it was three times the length or shorter. I didn't get within DRS. Obviously, when you go around a corner almost flat out with three high-speed corners before the straight, it's challenging to stay close. And then Turn 1, we're braking, let's say, around 40 metres before the corner, whereas at other tracks we're braking at 100 or 110 metres. So yeah, as I said, it's definitely one of the best tracks on the whole calendar to drive. Overtaking? It's one of the toughest.

Q: (Matt Coch – PlanetF1.com) To all three again, if I could. There's a 25-lap stint limit with tyres. A couple of you reported vibrations. There are concerns of cuts in tyres with gravel and things as well. Do you guys have concerns with tyres and safety and what will you be feeding back following your experience in the Sprint?

OP: I mean, I think whenever you've got a vibration that sort of just comes from driving and not doing anything – me, you know, no lockups or anything – it's never a great sign. I think in terms of safety, I think it's the front tyres that are the main problem. So, I think the risk of having a catastrophic shunt from a rear puncture is probably pretty low. But yeah, whenever you've got to put a limit in for things like this, obviously it's a little bit of a concern, but everything was fine in the Sprint. There was a bit of a vibration. It's not the first time we've had a vibration from just driving, but I think it should be fine. I think they've taken the measures.

GR: Yeah. I guess when we see the tyre wear after the race, we'll get an indication. I think the vibration was probably coming from major tyre wear. And you see in those corners – if you probably saw a slow-motion replay – the front left is all going to be rolling over onto the outside edge of the tyre, and that's the bit that's going to give up first. So I think it's required to put this limit in because, at the end of the day, if you make a tyre for a 24-race season that's specifically designed for a track like Qatar, you'll then struggle everywhere else, if that makes sense. Or you'll have different issues everywhere else. So I don't think we should be putting any heat on Pirelli – they made the best tyre possible for 24 races – but it's just the nature of this track being so quick. They need to introduce something like that.

Q: (Sam Johnston – Sky Sports) Question for Lando. We just heard you in the post-race interview saying that you didn't see Max behind you. He's been saying earlier this week that he would have won the championship easily in your car. Are we seeing the mind games ramping up? And maybe if Oscar has anything to say about Max saying he would have won easily in the McLaren, you're welcome to weigh in too.

LN: No. Look, yeah. Of course, I saw him. But he was never too much of a threat at all. So no, my focus was more just on George and seeing how I could keep the tyres in a good place for later. But Max is very welcome to say everything he wants, to be honest. He's kind of earned the right. You know, he's won four World Championships. I have a lot of respect and I think that gives anyone a lot of credit. He's achieved an incredible amount – more than anyone generally dreams of achieving. So, you know, Max generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there's also a lot of things he doesn't have much of a clue about. It's also Red Bull's way of going about things, this kind of aggressive nature and, yeah, just talking nonsense a lot of the time. So it depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it – like you love to – or you do what we do as a team, which is just kind of keep our heads down, keep focused. So maybe he would have done, but he hasn't so far, and he keeps trying.

OP: [Gives thumbs up]

Q: (Adam Cooper – Adam Cooper F1) For all three of you. So it's our first chance to speak to you since the driving standards meeting. Was that a productive gathering, and did you get some clarity after reviewing those various case studies?

OP: Yeah. I mean, I think it was very productive. I think it's good to always give out direct feedback to the Stewards. I think [it was] tidying up a few things. I think generally things have been pretty good. Whenever you try and put any kind of guidelines or wording around going racing, there's always going to be gaps somewhere. It's impossible to cover everything. So, I think just some ideas and opinions on how we can close some of those gaps was good. So yeah, I thought it was productive.

GR: Yeah, definitely productive. I think from the incidents that were shown, all of the drivers agreed what the penalty either should have been or lack of penalty. And yeah, like Oscar said, the general consensus in the room is: if you put these guidelines in place, they absolutely have to be guidelines. Every track is different. Every overtake is different. Every circumstance is different. Sometimes you've got to use that racing knowledge that, as drivers, we've all accumulated over 20, 30, 40 years of our life. And the Stewards – the driving standards Stewards – sometimes have to judge it based on the common sense of racing, as opposed to exactly what a guideline says. Otherwise, you may as well have a lawyer dishing out the penalties. So yeah, hopefully we can migrate more in this direction.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Prêmio) Question for all three. Kimi and Yuki had some problems with track limits – Yuki got a five-second penalty. Do you expect track limits to play a part tomorrow in the results of the race?

OP: No, I don't think so. I mean, I think here, normally, if you have a track limit, you're touching the gravel or just running wide.

GR: Turn 10 entry.

OP: Turn 10 entry? Ah. Maybe not then. Maybe there will be a problem! I don't know. I think it should be fine.

LN: Yeah, I mean, every corner is okay except that Turn 10 entry. So shouldn't be an issue. But anyway, the only reference we have… well, there is no reference. It's a white line. And we usually judge a track limit based on a kerb or up to a gravel trap. So yeah, I think that was a bit of a surprise for a few people. Could be an easy solution just widening that white line. But yeah.

“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen,” the Oscar nominee said in a recent interview.

	McKinley Franklin



Josh Brolin says his character in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was not inspired by Donald Trump, whom he recalls as a former friend and “genius” in “marketing.”


	In a Saturday interview with The Independent, the Oscar nominee said his portrayal of Monsignor Wicks in the latest Knives Out film was not based on the president. “I could make something up and say it was rooted in a kind of Trumpian greed,” he noted, adding that after “Wicks garners a sense of power, then there are no boundaries.”




	The topic prompted Brolin to touch on his former friendship with the president, further addressing speculation of Trump running for a third term, which he predicted is “just not going to happen.”

	“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen. And if it does, then I'll deal with that moment,” Brolin said. “But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”


	The two met after Brolin starred in Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, which the president was supposed to make a cameo in. Of Trump's business ventures, the actor argued that “there is no greater genius than him in marketing — he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it.” 


	“And that's why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him,” he added. “I think it's much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”

The update from the ""Fancy"" rapper came via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 28).


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Iggy Azalea is officially closing the door on her rap career.


	The Australian-born artist, who has shifted her focus to entrepreneurial and digital ventures in recent years, reaffirmed that she does not plan to return to the music industry. The update came via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 28), when the “Fancy” rapper shared a selfie that prompted a fan to ask whether she had recently signed a new record deal.


	“F*** no,” Azalea replied in the comments. “But I did consider signing, for weeks. I'm very sure I don't want to come back to the music industry.”

	Her comment follows years of gradual distance from major releases. Azalea's last studio album, The End of an Era, arrived in 2021 and marked a personal milestone, intended as a closing chapter before a pivot to new creative paths. Her 2014 debut, The New Classic, made a global impact with the Billboard No. 1 single “Fancy” and established her as one of the most commercially successful Australian rappers of the decade.


	Earlier this year, Azalea publicly alleged on X (formerly Twitter) that Universal Music Group owed her what she described as “millions of dollars in back pay” from international royalties. She claimed the amount in question was in the “eight-figure range” and said the corporation “technically stole” earnings during her early career. UMG did not comment at the time, and Azalea has continued to discuss the issue while advocating for artist rights and royalty transparency online.


	In August, she appeared on ABC News and spoke candidly about the pressures she experienced at the height of her fame. She recalled being labeled an “industry plant” early on and described the rap industry as a “battlefield.” “I was stepping on landmines left and right, and I just couldn't survive it. It's not survivable,” she said. She added that while she made mistakes along the way, the emotional toll of navigating the spotlight ultimately reshaped her relationship with music.

	











	“There are some things I walked into and deserve, or things I could have done better,” she said. “But I can't sit here all day long feeling sorry about that. It's just part of life.”


	Azalea has since focused on business ventures — including cryptocurrency projects and online creative work — and has not hinted at reconsidering her decision. Her latest comments suggest her retirement from music is firm, with no plans for a comeback on the horizon.

The ""Sneakernight"" singer shared a selfie from her hospital bed.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Vanessa Hudgens and husband Cole Tucker have welcomed their second child together.


	The High School Musical alum — and singer behind pop songs including 2008's “Sneakernight” and 2006's “Come Back to Me” — announced her newborn's birth on Saturday (Nov. 29) with a photo of herself hooked up to monitors in a hospital bed. In the snapshot, Hudgens appears to be holding hands with Tucker, a former professional baseball player who most recently played for the Los Angeles Angels before retiring in May.


	“Well…. I did it,” Hudgens captioned her Instagram post. “Had another baby!!! What a wild ride labor is. Big shout out to all the moms. It's truly incredible what our bodies can do.”

	The singer/actress publicly shared the news of her pregnancy in July, when she debuted her baby bump on social media through a maternity photo shoot with Tucker.  Since then, she's shared other fun glimpses at life while expecting, including pictures of herself dressed up as Mother Earth — painting her belly as Earth — for Halloween, and vacation photos from attending a September wedding in Italy.


	The couple welcomed their first child together last year, in July 2024, and have since kept personal details private. 




	Last year Hudgens, aka “Goldfish,” was also crowned the winner of season 11 of The Masked Singer.


	Hudgens leads the upcoming '60s thriller Quiet Storm, the directorial debut of Anthony Thorne, who also co-stars (as does Mira Sorvino). As of July, production had wrapped. No post-production news has been released; Deadline last reported the film was being presented and executive produced by Nick Cassavetes. Hudgens portrays romance novelist Abby Lynche, who “finds herself confined during 1969's Hurricane Camille, confronting personal revelations amid social upheaval and women's liberation while the storm rages outside.”

""I think that's a hard line for me now,"" the Paramore frontwoman said.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Hayley Williams is drawing a firm boundary ahead of her 2026 solo tour. The Paramore frontwoman, who recently announced an expanded run of dates due to high demand, said she intends her shows to be explicitly inclusive spaces — and made clear that anyone who holds discriminatory views should not expect to feel comfortable attending.

	In a new interview with Clash, Williams said she wants the tour to be a place where every fan can “feel welcome to the party,” but added that this commitment also requires her to take a public stance about who she does not want in the room.

	“I don't want racists around, and I don't want sexist people around, and I don't want people there who think that trans people are a burden,” she said. “I think that's a hard line for me now.”


	Williams explained that she hopes anyone holding those beliefs will “walk in the door and realise that the gang's all here, all banded together around something positive,” adding: “All are welcome if you believe all should be welcome… If you don't believe that, you're not welcome.”




	Her upcoming tour — which supports her latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — The North American leg kicks off on March 28 in Atlanta and willl include stops in Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Oakland, Los Angeles, and more, before she hits the UK and Europe in June next year.


	Williams has long used her platform to advocate for equality, particularly in her home state of Tennessee. Last year, after declining an official state honor, she criticised the actions of the state's Republican leadership, calling out what she described as “blatant racism” and encouraging young people to vote with equality in mind.


	The singer has also spoken openly about the sexism she has faced throughout her career. In 2022, she said she avoided playing guitar on stage because of the likelihood of derisive comments, and in 2023 she addressed online backlash after postponing Paramore shows due to illness, calling out “internet bros” and clarifying that most rock bands would not co-sign that behaviour.

	Academy and Tony Award-winning actress Judi Dench detailed the realities of her eye condition, which has led to a loss of sight and her stepping back from the stage and screen.


	“No, you don't [see me on camera], because I can't see anymore,” she told an ITV News reporter in a recent joint interview with longtime collaborator and friend Ian McKellen, with whom she starred in Macbeth in 1979.


	When McKellen joked that they could see her, the veteran star responded, “Yes, and I can see your outline and I know you so well, in your Macbeth scarf. But I can't recognize anybody now.”

	The X-Men alum then jokingly asked Dench if she ever goes up to “total strangers [to] say, ‘Lovely to see you again,'” to which she laughed and answered, “Sometimes!”


	Dench, who has led a storied career from her memorable appearance in Shakespeare in Love to her formidable portrayal as M in Daniel Craig's run as James Bond, has been open about her diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, a degenerative eye condition that affects the central part of the retina and results in central vision distortion or loss, since 2012.


	She hinted at her retirement last year, and the year prior, said, “It's difficult for me if I have any length of a part. I haven't yet found a way. Because I have so many friends who will teach me the script. But I have a photographic memory.” 


	Her most recent credits include a cameo in the 2022 Apple TV+ Christmas musical comedy Spirited, starring Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds. ITV noted that the Belfast star also appeared in a recent holiday-themed advert in the U.K. She and McKellen are currently backing an initiative to revitalize the William Shakespeare curriculum taught at English schools, using rehearsals as teaching tools to invigorate understanding of the Bard.

She should try Preservision Areds 2. My father used to get shots in the eye for macular degeneration. 7 years later, his eye sight has improved so much he no longer has to wear prescription glasses. He had a total 3 shots then no longer needed them.

I have had macular degeneration since 2004. Luckily it hasn't advanced as fast as Judi's. But it's coming. There is no cure, no treatment

Have had several aging relatives lose their sight to Macular including my father who even had a hard time trying to eat finally.
It is sad it can't t be fixed at least some
She is an amazing actress and person.

I was hoping there would be some medical advances to help her from losing all her sight but she must be out of options. She is just amazing.

	Though Rian Johnson has noted there's no performer he counts as a “white whale” for his budding Benoit Blanc/Knives Out universe, there is one seasoned actress he'd love to work with.


	“There are so many great actors I'd like to work with,” the Academy Award nominee told our sister publication IndieWire recently. “But, yes, if you're reading this, Meryl Streep, I feel like you'd slot into a murder mystery very well.”


	When told that the Big Little Lies alumna finally appeared on the 50th season of Saturday Night Live, Johnson added, “If Lorne [Michaels] can do it, then, goddamn, so can we.”

	While Streep's resume speaks for itself (an understatement, to be sure), it should be noted that she's already made her mark in the comedic murder-mystery genre via Hulu's Only Murders in the Building, which wrapped the airing of its fifth season last month. (Next up, Streep will reprise her iconic role from The Devil Wears Prada, portraying the fierce editor-in-chief of a glossy, Miranda Priestly, in the film's 2026 sequel.)




			Watch on Deadline		







	Elsewhere in the interview, Johnson emphasized his love for making the Knives Out films, which first kicked off with the phenomenon of the first Ana de Armas vehicle released in 2019. 


	“I love working with actors so much,” he said. “There are so many actors I haven't worked with I want to work with. And that's one of the real treats of making these movies is you get to experience new actors and these big casts. At the same time, I'd be lying if I didn't say: one of the great things about doing these movies is I get to know these actors so, when I'm writing original stuff now, that are not these movies, of course I have everyone in mind for it.”

	











Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is the third installment in the tonally sprawling film series, featuring a stacked cast in Josh Brolin, Josh O'Connor, Kerry Washington, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, Andrew Scott, Glenn Close and Thomas Haden Church. This go around, Blanc (Daniel Craig) descends on an upstate New York town to solve the murder of a domineering and hate-spewing monsignor (Brolin). 


	The Gothic and darkly satirical film, which bowed in certain theaters before the Thanksgiving holiday, will release on Netflix Dec. 12. The box office take so far has been upward of $4 million, with great word of mouth from critics and audiences alike.

Josh Brolin reflected on his previous friendship with Donald Trump — back when the POTUS was a real estate mogul based in New York City. Calling him a “genius” in marketing, the Oscar-nominated Milk actor said he knew a “different guy” than the figure the GOP leader cuts today.


	In a sprawling interview with The Independent promoting Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, Brolin said he didn't base his character, the megalomaniacal Monsignor Wicks who leads a local church, off of the president.


	“I could make something up and say it was rooted in a kind of Trumpian greed,” he noted.

	Of his past acquaintanceship, he said, “I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying forever, it's just not going to happen. And if it does, then I'll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”


	He continued, discussing the Trump Hotel: “I'm sure there was a lot of corruption involved,” he remarked, adding that he found “interesting” the idea of building a high-rise “in the middle of a cesspool city during the late '70s … now it's power unmitigated, it's unregulated.”


	The No Country for Old Men alum concluded: “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it. And that's why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him. I think it's much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”

	











	Brolin has been forthcoming about having been friends with Trump, whom he first met after filming Oliver Stone's Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps in 2010. While speaking with journalist Graham Bensinger last year, the Weapons star described that initial dinner — which also featured Stone, co-star Shia LaBeouf and First Lady-to-be Melania Trump — as leading to the “weirdest fucking moment” in which the tycoon ignored his three separate asks to tour the upstairs of his Manhattan apartment. 


	In later years, during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2016, Brolin emphasized he “was” buddies with Trump, echoing current sentiments by characterizing the reality star-turned-politician as having “singlehandedly turned around the economy of Manhattan. I found that very fascinating. I think he's an interesting guy.”


	And, in 2020, Brolin shared an Instagram missive — in which he described himself as a “conservative Democrat” — speaking out against Trump ahead of that year's presidential election, saying, “I refuse to believe that Donald Trump is our core version of American masculinity.”

A grifter ripping off other people, squandering their money and reaping the benefit. He did it in with his daddy's money in real estate, going bankrupt multiple times in the process. Trump University, Trump Steaks, the XFL, Trump Casino. The only thing saving him was Mark Burnett making him a gameshow host. His biggest swindle was getting elected President where he and his crooked family have been filling their pockets since.

All valid points. I really liked Josh until  reading this. What a let down.

Buddies? Did he ever hang with Epstein?

A successful CON-MAN.

“Conservative Democrat” just feels like a Hollywood euphemism for Republican.

I wouldn't brag about being buddies with an animal like Trump but that's just me.

Yes – Brolin is a DINO – Democrat in name only.

Brolin is on point. If Trump were to fade into thin air tomorrow, Americans would have nothing to do with themselves. There is a hole in the American experiment that that man fills like a hand fills a glove.
How anyone thought that the Wild West was an aspirational concept is a case in point. The USA was built on the premise of maximum freedom for minimum responsibility. What did they think was going to happen?

	Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco may not (yet) have a Saturday Night Live hosting stint under his belt, but he does have something arguably just as coveted — a bona fide impression. The comic, who is known for his physical comedy style and exaggerated speech, reacted to Marcello Hernandez‘s recent parody of him, calling the eponymous sketch flattering. 


	In a preview clip of his upcoming appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show Dec. 2, Maniscalco said, “He did a great job. I was very flattered that they did that. He actually called me on Thursday before the show, said, ‘Do you want to come in and do a cameo at the end of it?' I couldn't do it because I was performing in Palm Springs, but I thought this kid did a fantastic job.”

	The Bookie actor noted the impersonation was “absolutely all in love.” Though he has never hosted the show, Maniscalco joked Barrymore could help him out as a member of the Five-Timers Club (the actress has hosted six times). “I'm here today to kind of petition — and maybe you could help me,” he said. “You're taking all the spots!”

	Maniscalco gave similar comments to Complex in an interview tied to the release of his latest Hulu special, It Ain't Right.


	“The first thing I noticed: Do they think I'm that gray? I thought the gray hair was a little excessive,” he said.


	The comic, who is among the top-grossing in the world, praised Hernandez for really going for it in terms of the physicality of his performance, saying he “really got a kick out of” his “over enunciation on the physical humor.”

	











	He continued, “That was my favorite part: the whole step over, jump over. And I actually talked to Marcello via text, and I said, ‘Man I wish I could jump like that.'”


	Maniscalco explained that he's “gotten more traction on this video than any video I've ever been in. If we could just have people keep imitating me, I think it'll be fine,” joking that “the problem is if I'm in it.” 


	In the viral SNL sketch, which debuted Nov. 15, host Glen Powell's bachelor party is thrown into disarray when he invites an old pal to join the rest of the boys, warning his friends that the acquaintance is none other than world-famous standup Maniscalco. 


	“You gotta be kidding me,” Maniscalco commented on his initial repost of the skit shortly after its release.


SNL is currently on its holiday hiatus, returning for a three-week run in December beginning this Saturday.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: It's a great Thanksgiving of second-best records for Disney with Zootopia 2 and that's nothing to complain about: The sequel posted the second highest grossing Saturday over Thanksgiving stretch of $35.8M, which is fueling the second-highest 5-day opening ever for the holiday of $156M. That's also the second best opening ever for a Walt Disney Animation title. This is after the second-highest Wednesday, Thursday and Black Friday in recent days — all these records are filing behind last year's Moana 2 (5-day of $225.4M).


	Exclaimed Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman this morning, “The incredible response to Zootopia 2 reflects both its worldwide appeal and the remarkable work of our filmmakers and cast. It's a proud moment for Disney Animation and all of us at Disney, not to mention a great way to start the holiday season.”

	











	Andrew Cripps, head of Disney Global Distribution, pointed out that Zootopia 2‘s success also “benefitted from the pent-up demand for animated movies from audiences.” There's been few this past year, at least few that have worked. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Box Office state firm EntTelligence counted 12 million admissions for Zootopia 2 over 5-days. Moana 2 clocked 17.5M last year. The average ticket price was $14.42 while the average premium large format ticket price for the sequel was $18. 


	The conservative 5-day forecast on Zootopia 2 was $125M. There is room for upside with the sequel apt to gross $3M more than what we're seeing currently. Interesting to note that the daily gross cadence for Zootopia 2 is very similar to Moana 2‘s on a percentile basis, i.e. Thanksgiving was down 50% from opening day Wednesday/previews, Black Friday was +96% over Thanksgiving, Saturday dipped -7% from Black Friday with Sunday being calculated at a -37% decline off yesterday (Note Moana 2 eased -31% on its first Sunday off Saturday). 


	Early industry estimates for the five-day weekend for all films is factored around $297M (that includes $4.25M from Netflix's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery), which among Thanksgiving 5-day hauls is third behind last year's all-time record of $424.9M, and 2018's $315.6M (that's when Disney Animation sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet led with $84.7M). We'll see what Comscore reports. 

	











	Disney arrived to this massive weekend with 11 promo partners who delivered over $215 million in media value that generated 3.7 billion-plus impressions and a retail footprint that spanned 100k+ locations. That promo campaign value outstrips that of Moana 2‘s $100M and Inside Out 2‘s. Zootopia 2‘s partners included:


	The trailer drop on May 20 timed to the release of Lilo & Stitch indicated anticipation was there for Zootopia 2 with 130M views in first 24 hours and the final trailer on Sept 29 pulling in 74M views in its first day. 


	One of the cute exhibitor tie-ins entailed an immersive experience for the sequel at AMC Century City in LA with “The Moovies,” a floor-to-ceiling wrap with parody posters (Devil Wears Preyda 2, The Incredibulls 3, Toy Ssstory 5). Also getting a makeover for the movie was Disney's own El Capitan in Hollywood renamed the “El Hopitan”. There were also12-foot bus displays at AMC Americana/Kips Bay; and touring statues across 12 theaters.


	AMC Dine-In in Disney Springs in Florida did $346K through EOD yesterday, the highest grossing location in the nation. Repeating the stat here: 21% came from premium large format and Imax (4% from Imax, 17% from PLFs with 12% from 3D). 


	Evident that the movie played “everywhere” can be seen in the EntTelligence breakdown: 38% of the foot traffic were in markets that ranged in population size from 1M to over 2.5M (high urban) versus 62% of admissions which were in cities of 500K or less. Rural and high rural areas (1K-500K) pulled in 36% admissions. Big matinee play, of course, with 60% of the audience watching Zootopia 2 before 5PM yesterday. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good is filing a second weekend of $62.8M (-57%), and a 5-day of $93M for a running cume of $270.4M. 


	5. Running Man (Par) 2,749 (-297) theaters, Wed $840K Thu $980K Fri $1.4M Sat $1.45M Sun $850K 3-day $3.7M (-35%), 5-day $5.5M, Total $34.2M/ Wk 3


	6. Eternity (A24) 1,348 theaters, Wed $1.45M (includes previews), Thu $616K Fri $1.1M Sat $1.2M Sun $826K 3 day $3.16M, 5 day $5.2M/Wk 1The Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner and Miles Teller romcom which cost around $15M before P&A is being comped to A24's Priscilla which did $5M over 3 days at a similar number of theaters. An expansion is expected. Priscilla, which was a dreamy bio-drama, grossed just under $21M at the domestic B.O. 


	7. Wake Up Dead Man (Netflix) 600 theaters, Wed $600K, Thu $400K Fri $600K Sat $400K 5-day $4.25M/Wk 1Dailies are for only those theaters reporting. Sources tell us the 5-day is $4M. More on that later. 8. Rental Family (Sea) 1,925 theaters, Wednesday $400K, Thu $575K Fri $800K Sat $800K Sun $500K 3-day $2.1M (-36%), 5-day $3M, Total $7.39M/Wk 2

	











	9. Hamnet (Foc) 119 theaters Wed $310K, Thu $160K Fri $310K Sat $350K Sun $220K 3-day $880K, 5-day $1.35M/5-day per theater $11,3K (third best of the weekend behind Zootopia 2‘s $39K per theater and Wicked 2‘s $22,6K theater average/Wk 1


	10. Sisu: Road to Revenge (Sony) 2,222 theaters Wed $200K, Thu $205K Fri $290K Sat $310K Sun 3-day $810K (-66%), 5-day $1.2M, Total $4.1M/Wk 2


SATURDAY AM, updated with new data: Consumers didn't just go to stores yesterday, they went to the movies, too, shelling out $38.5M to see Disney's Zootopia 2, the second best Black Friday at the box office after last year's Moana 2 ($54.3M), as well as Universal's Wicked: For Good which did $26M. For the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande sequel that's it's fourth highest grossing day after its opening weekend sequence of Friday ($69.1M), Saturday ($43.4M) and Sunday ($34.4M).


	And talk about walk-up business for Zootopia 2: Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak shows a massive 61% of the audience purchasing their tickets same day. The 5-day forecast on Zootopia 2 now surges to $152M-$156M (don't be surprised if it hits $160M), which as we always said is right behind Moana 2‘s ($225.4M) all-time 5-day Thanksgiving opening record. 3-day is between $98M-$99M on the Jason Bateman-Ginnifer Goodwin voiced movie. Note, it took the first Zootopia 12 days to hit $154M domestic, and it's taking the sequel only five days to do so. The first Zootopia in early March 2016 opened to $75M U.S./Canada, and finaled at $341.2M domestic, and $1 billion worldwide (that's with $39M from Russia and $236M from China). 


Wicked: For Good‘s 5-day ratchets up as well to a second weekend of $63.3M (-57%) and 5-day of $93.5M for a running cume of $270.9M by EOD tomorrow. 


	Back to Zootopia 2, next to Moana 2, it's more of a four-quad movie with women under 25 at 34%, women over 25 at 26%, and both men under and over 25 at 20% apiece. Since opening on Wednesday, definite recommend has shot up from 65% to 73% yesterday. Women over 25 are giving the movie its best definite recommend at a massive 82%. Yes, as expected with a massive hit like this, infrequent moviegoers, are the bulk of the ticket buyers here at 56%. Broken out on PostTrak that's 33% who go to the cinema every other month or so and 23% who attend the multiplex a few times a year or less. For theatrical to survive in a M&A studio collapsing-hungry world — it's on the industry's shoulders to convert this crowd into being more faithful. 


	Imax and PLFs still driving 21% of the sequel's business with ticket sales the strongest in South Central and the West. Right now, the AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (FL) is the pic's highest grossing multiplex at close to $270K. 


	Netflix's limited release of Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which is in around 600 sites, is now up to $4M+ over 5 days. The previous installment, Glass Onion, had a robust play over Thanksgiving: $9.4M 3-day, $13.2M 5-day at 696 sites for a very good 5-day theater average of $19K. Again, the top 3 circuits aren't playing Knives Out 3, which is weird. That said, we hear there are several hundred sell-out shows, and the movie will continue to play beyond Thanksgiving week and even possibly through its Dec. 12 streaming date. The top 3 circuits opted to prioritize Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good over the holiday stretch. Even though there's no big P&A on Knives Out 3, there's great word of mouth from both critics and audiences with 95% and 96%, respectively, on Rotten Tomatoes.


	Black Friday for the top 20 movies pulled in $75M, which was as we said about -30% off from last year's $108M boosted by not just Moana 2 and Wicked, but, hello, a R-rated male skewing movie in Gladiator II. Meanwhile, early consumer sales stats for the day aren't as gloomy as previously forecasted: Adobe Analytics reports that home-shoppers spent $11.8 billion online, +9% from a year ago. Meanwhile, Salesforce says that shoppers shelled out $18 billion on Black Friday purchases, +3% from Black Friday 2024, with luxury apparel and accessories the leading purchases. 

	











	Saturday AM estimates reflect Friday theater counts: 


FRIDAY AM: Disney's Zootopia 2 had a better Thanksgiving than expected with close to $20M. Rivals were seeing around $17.7M yesterday morning. Quite easily, that's the second-best Thanksgiving haul for any movie behind last year's Moana 2 at $27.7M. Confidence is rising that the 5-day on the Jared Bush and Byron Howard co-directed animated movie is well north of $140M, perhaps beyond $150M, however, that boils down today. That's a situation for all titles whether they overindex. 


	As we told you, Black Friday is one of the busiest moviegoing days of the year in addition to shopping. This Black Friday is expected to mint around $76M at the domestic box office, -29% from last year's $108M. Exhibition can be grateful that people are going to the movies as a recent Deloitte survey says that consumers plan to spend an average of $622 between Nov. 27 and Dec. 1, which is down -4% from a year ago. Last Black Friday, Moana 2 boomed +95% over Thanksgiving for a $54.7M haul. Zootopia 2 is expected to be around $34M, which is still robust. 


	Exclaims social media monitor firm RelishMix about the word of mouth on Zootopia 2, “Convo runs positive for Zootopia 2 as the comment stream glows like a fan-run marquee, with excitement bursting from every corner. Enthusiastic callouts celebrate, ‘the wait is finally ending, as seen in the only Disney movie I'm very excited to see because I've waited nine years for a sequel and YES!' Fans compare Jason Bateman's energy to the original Zootopia by cheering, ‘I love Ginnifer Goodwin and I love her as Judy Hopps.' Even the marketing gets applause with, ‘The edits are the best way to promote the sequel paired with another great look and can't wait to see Zootopia 2.'”


	Reach on social media for Zootopia 2 across X, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube before opening was 518 million followers, which is above Kung Fu Panda 4‘s 353 million, but below Minions: Rise of Gru‘s 668 million. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good had a $12.5M Thanksgiving, -25% off Wicked‘s $16.7M Turkey Day a year ago. Outlook for part 2 of the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande movie is still a second weekend of $61M (-59%) and 5-day of $91M. Running cume of $268.4M by Sunday will be pacing +2% ahead of Wicked over ten days. Also, a stat we left out last weekend about Wicked 2 is that its 1.33 billion followers on social media ranks as 6th for any movie franchise behind Avengers: Endgame (2.47 billion), Avengers: Infinity War (2.09 billion), Fast 8 (1.96B), Despicable Me 3 (1.6B), and Black Adam (1.38B). 




THURSDAY AM: Disney's Zootopia 2 caged up $39.5M yesterday including previews, just as we told you, with the sequel still on course for an $88M-$90M 3-day, $140M 5-day. No surprise, part two has an A CinemaScore just like the first one with a Rotten Tomatoes audience score that's slightly higher than the first, 95% to 92%. By the way that's the second best Wednesday before Thanksgiving after last year's Moana 2 had a first day/Tuesday previews of $57.9M.  

	











	Among all Disney Animation titles, Zootopia 2‘s Wednesday/previews ranks as the third best for the label after Moana 2 and Frozen 2 ($42.2M).


	Audience diagnostics day one for Zootopia 2 is a very good 65% definite recommend, 87% positive with adults and 80% positive with kids under 12 (The first movie in 2016 was enormous with 90% positive and 87% definite recommend for general audience, and kids under 12 with a 91% positive). Zootopia 2 skewed 52% women yesterday with the 18-24 demo seeing the biggest turnout at close to a third and 18-34 at 56%. Latino and Hispanic moviegoers led yesterday with 37%, followed by 25% Caucasian, 20% Black, and 13% Asian American, and 5% Native American/other. 


	Yesterday's money came from 21% PLF and Imax screens (4% Imax, 17% from a non-IMAX PLF and 12% coming from 3D screens). Zootopia is playing throughout North America, but best in South Central and West (the East is the softest, we hear). Disney's El Capitan in Hollywood was the leading single-location gross at $128K on Wednesday. 


	Universal's Wicked: For Good posted the $17M we were seeing, and is eyeing $61M over 3-days and $91M over 5 days. The promo machine for Wicked 2 won't let up: Cynthia Erivo opened the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade days after losing her voice with “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone. And Jeff Goldblum is on social singing “Popular” with Anthony Gargiula and Jonathan Tilkin barbershop-style:


	Ticket sales for all movies today, Thanksgiving, are expected to be down some -40% before jumping on Black Friday by +95%. Black Friday last year, thanks to Moana 2, Wicked and Gladiator II, grossed $108M. 


	The top 20 films minted $63M yesterday, and while great, it's -30% off from the same Thanksgiving Eve a year when Moana 2 led all titles to a $90M-plus take. 

	











	Let's not forget that this holiday stretch has Netflix's Rian Johnson threequel Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery at around 600 theaters. Though similar to the 696 theaters that Glass Onion: Knives Out played over Thanksgiving week 2022, Wake Up Dead Man doesn't have the major circuits AMC, Regal and Cinemark that Glass Onion did (I hear the top chains opted not play the movie despite a 24-day theatrical window). So, don't expect the $15M and beefy weekly $21K theater average that title posted. Rough estimates as Netflix doesn't report figures are $600K for Wednesday, 3-day of $2M, and 5-day of $3M. We won't rank in the chart until we have a better sense of numbers. Johnson, who sold the Knives Out sequels to Netflix during Covid for $400M as Deadline first told you, took to social recently to express his upset over the lack of theaters playing Knives Out 3. “I'm as frustrated as you that it's not everywhere, but new theaters will be added so keep checking — and also, if you're inclined, it wouldn't hurt to contact the manager of your local theater and (politely!) ask them if it's coming,” wrote Johnson to a fan on social. Frankly, not a good look for Netflix on a major film with a 2x Oscar nominated filmmaker, in the wake of the theatrical success on Kpop Demon Hunters, and with the mixed message that they're not into theatrical; yet will be if they purchase Warner Bros. Studios. Wake Up Dead Man drops on Netflix on Dec. 12. The movie is 95% certified fresh with critics, and 96% with audiences. The first movie, distributed by Liosngate, was a big Thanksgiving 2019 hit for the studio posted a $41M 5-day start, $165.3M domestic B.O., $312.8M global take and an $83M profit. 


	4. Predator: Badlands (Dis) 2,750 theaters, Wed $900K, 3-day $3.8M (-42%), 5-day $5.4M/Total $83.8M/Wk 4

The movie is leaning 57% female, with a third coming from 25-34 (biggest demo) and 51% 18-34. Diversity demos are 59% Caucasian, 16% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Asian American, and 6% Black.

UPDATED, Wednesday afternoon: Disney will continue to own nine of the top 10 Thanksgiving five-day box office openings as Zootopia 2 is set to do around $140 million from its Wednesday to Sunday at 4,000 theaters.


	Always take the projection this far out with a grain of salt as a lot comes down to Black Friday and Saturday. Already, with an estimated $39M Wednesday, including yesterday's $10.2M previews, Zooptopia 2 owns the second-best Wednesday opening for Thanksgiving after last year's Moana 2 ($57.8M). The Friday-Sunday for the animated sequel with the voices of Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin is pegged between $88M-$90M+.


	Remember, business eases on Thanksgiving but picks up in the evening, with Black Friday one of the year's highest-grossing box office days.


	Disney has premium large format screens for Zootopia 2, but they're sharing Imax with Universal's Wicked: For Good which gets those auditoriums for evening showtimes.


	Here's how part 2 of Wicked is shaping up next to its predecessor: Wednesday right now is figured at $17M (versus last year's $20.3M) at 4,115 locations. Wicked‘s Thanksgiving take last year dipped 17% from Wednesday for $16.7M. The three-day on the Jon M. Chu-directed part II is at $60.2M (-59%) at 4,115 sites, with a five-day of $90M and a running total by Sunday of $267.4M. Wicked‘s second weekend was $81.1M (-28%), with a five-day of $118.2M.


	Lionsgate's Now You See Me: Now You Don't at 3,138 theaters is eyeing around $1.5M in its second Wednesday for a third weekend of $6.4M (-28%), a five-day of $9.25M and a running cume of $48.7M by Sunday.


	Disney/20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands at 2,750 theaters is eyeing a third Wednesday of $855,000, a fourth weekend of $3.9M (-40%), a five-day of $5.65M and a running cume of $84M. That will easily make Predator: Badlands the highest-grossing installment of the 38-year-old franchise at the domestic box office, overtaking 2004's Alien vs. Predator which finaled at $80.2M.


	Paramount's Running Man at 3,046 sites is doing $910K today, $4.1M in weekend 3 (-28%), for a five-day of $5.88M and a running cume of $34.5M.


	A24's Eternity at 1,348 locations is seeing around $400K today, $2M over three days and north of $3M for for days. The afterlife rom-com starring Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller and Callum Turner is 76% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.


WEDNESDAY AM: After a barren harvest at the fall box office, exhibitors have a lot to be thankful for as Disney's Zootopia 2 and Universal's Wicked: For Good finally are delivering the goods this holiday season.


Zootopia 2 started previews at 2 p.m. Tuesday that delivered $10.2M. This is the second-highest preview start for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film ever, only behind Moana 2 ($13.8M Tuesday) and ahead of Frozen II ($8.5M Thursday). It's also the second-highest Tuesday preview for a Disney Thanksgiving opening title.

The domestic outlook for Zootopia 2 is $125M over five days. Many believe there's room for upside, but if it lands at that projection, it will be the second-best 5-day opener over the domestic Thanksgiving holiday after Moana 2. Global start on the movie directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard is north of $270M. The sequel to the Oscar-winning animated movie stands at 93% certified fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes, a few notches below the 98% of the 2016 title.


	Meanwhile, Universal's first Tuesday of Wicked: For Good saw $15.75M, which is the second-best Tuesday of 2025 so far after Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman, which did $17.1M. In addition, Wicked: For Good charted the fourth-best Tuesday in November after Frozen 2 ($20.7M, Nov. 26, 2019), Wicked ($16.6M, Nov. 26, 2024) and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ($15.9M, Nov. 26, 2013). Running cume for Wicked: For Good is $177.5M, 22% ahead of Wicked‘s five-day running cume/previews.

	Last year's trio of Moana 2, Wicked and Paramount's Gladiator II fueled a record Thanksgiving 5-day of $424.9M. Despite the top-heavy success of Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good this weekend, what's glaringly missing at this year's Turkey Day box office is a movie for guys a la 2024's R-rated Gladiator II. Last Tuesday at this time had an extra $6.6M from the Ridley Scott-directed sequel. The Running Man isn't cutting it, with the movie delivering around $980K yesterday for a cume of $28.7M. The top 20 titles on Tuesday (not counting Zootopia 2 previews) generated $21.7M, -25% from a year ago Tuesday's tally of $29M.

WICKED: FOR GOOD taking a much bigger hit in its second/Thanksgiving weekend than the first one. Will it still be around by the end of December?

W2 is a great film.  It also has Dorothy and the classic characters so it has a punch that a lot of people will like.  Strong legs.

As you don't see Dorothy's face and they are barely in it anyway that's a bit of a stretch.

Not even close

Queue the netflix bots to tell us this is actually a flop and everyone should stay home and give up on theatrical.

Didn't you know that every movie has a 100 million dollar marketing budget and 50 million dollars of secret reshoots? You can learn alot from Dedline comments.

We saw it Thanksgiving and it was awesome. The kiddos in the theater were captivated and we (72 year olds) were amazed by the animation and sophistication of the writing.

W2 has no chance of eclipsing W1 in US

A part two movie that relies on seeing part one is always going to be limited in its potential. There wasn't any way around that, unfortunately.

On the plus side, NBC did show Wicked recently, and it's been available for streaming, so there are a few million who will have skipped W1 in theaters but be open to W2. The real question is how many of them will go to the theater versus waiting for streaming. It's still going to be quite lucrative for streaming.

Didn't help that act II of the play was a snooze compared to act I

Dune: Part Two says hello.

If only any of the two new songs were in the same league as the unforgettable “Defying Gravity” and “Popular.”

“Popular” was so memorable, it's hard to top an earworm like that. W1 was truly a phenomenal soundtrack.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Britney Spears shares cryptic post about ‘suffering' and ‘darkness' as concerns grow about singer's erratic behavior","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/30/celebrity-news/britney-spears-shares-cryptic-post-about-suffering-and-darkness/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 15:02:00 GMT","

Britney Spears shared a cryptic post about “suffering” and “darkness” amid growing concerns about the singer's well-being.

Late Saturday night, the “Toxic” songstress took to Instagram to share a video of herself dancing in a leopard print bodysuit and black heels set to the tune of Adele's “Send My Love (To Your New Lover).”

“Haven't found my party dress for this year 👗… Reflecting is good for the soul… Sometimes when hard things happen, good things come from it and we learn,” she captioned the post.

“I learned that a real note of expression with emotion speaks volumes for us all!! Call it childish, silly, annoying… We grow up to become women but do you dare keep the most sensitive part of the soul and allow it to rebel… the child within must speak in the most vulnerable of times,” Spears, 43, penned.

“Sadness and darkness survive to make an understanding of losing someone and of the hurt and pain… Sometimes through suffering and ugliness and sacrifice, extremely rare and beautiful things can be manifested and shared that can touch another person so they understand they are not alone… and yet the woman in me will make sure I find my destination.”

The “Crossroads” actress ended her lengthy caption by switching gears to talk about how much food she indulged in during Thanksgiving. 

“PS I can't even look at food after this Thanksgiving… I cheated I was so bad… but it felt so damn good… forgive me father,” she wrote.

Spears' latest dancing video comes nearly two weeks after she was spotted leaving a wine bar with a champagne flute in hand, then getting into her car and speeding off.

At the time, the “Gimme More” hitmaker's team insisted to the Daily Mail that the pop star was not drinking any alcohol during the rare outing.

After the photos went viral, Spears took to Instagram to blast the paparazzi, calling them “incredibly mean” for always taking “the worst photos” of her.

The Grammy winner also said she “can't go anywhere” without being harassed. “It's so offensive,” she added.

In September, Page Six exclusively reported that Spears had been refusing help from people as fears about her mental health and living conditions continued to grow.

“She has people like staff, security guards, assistants, no real friends,” an insider told us.

One source told us that though Spears “has moments of clarity and moments where it feels like a roller coaster,” she is “still the sweetest, kindest person.”

They added: “We're always concerned about Britney and her well-being and making sure if she's OK. The question is, ‘How do we help her?'”

The “Oops!…I Did It Again” singer's friends are also reportedly worried that Spears is residing in a “messy mansion” covered in dog poop.

“Her house is a mess. She doesn't clean up after the dogs, she doesn't have someone there cleaning every day, and she just isn't functioning like an adult would function,” a source told the Daily Mail.

In November 2021, Spears famously broke free of her 13-year legal conservatorship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Amazon rolls out AI-generated dub of well-loved anime series Banana Fish","https://www.avclub.com/amazon-banana-fish-ai-dub","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 01:18:00 GMT","

Back in March, we reported that Amazon was embarking on a project that was going to be a bad idea that was going to make a lot of people mad, i.e., using artificial intelligence to generate dubbed voice tracks for anime series. Now, lo and behold, a whole bunch of people are exactly as mad as predicted, as the tech giant rolled out a new English dub of beloved anime series Banana Fish this month, completely generated by AI.

Originally published in manga form starting in 1985, Banana Fish was both controversial and influential at the time for several aspects of its story of a noble gangster investigating a crime ring using the titular drug to control people's minds: Its violence, yes, but also its sexuality, whether that meant more explicit material happening in the criminal underworld, or the implied-so-hard-it's-one-shade-short-of-canon relationship between main character Ash Lynx and his friend Eiji Okumura. The series was given an anime adaptation in 2018, produced by Japanese studio MAPPA, and syndicated internationally by Amazon. Although it released with English subtitles, the series never got an English voice track—until this week, when AI-generated Spanish and English versions of the show's dialogue were offered as “beta” features for Prime Video viewers.

The response to the news has included a lot of very strongly negative reactions, for a lot of very strongly obvious reasons: Animation fans take their dubs and subs extremely serious regardless, and having voice actors be put out of work while a mega-giant foists off a product that can't hope to match the richness of a fully voiced set of performances is an extra twist of the digital knife. Per CBR, at least one voice actor who's worked on a number of big-name projects for Amazon in the past—Daman Mills, whose credits include Rebuild Of Evangelion, Dragon Ball Super, and One Piece—has stated on social media that he won't work for the company again if they keep the AI-generated dub up. (Meanwhile, we popped up the show's first episode for a minute just to make sure we weren't talking out of our asses on the quality of the resulting dub, and woof, is that some hideously lifeless robot talking. If the goal here was to completely drain a vibrant, fascinating show of all life in the most piss-the-fans-off-way possible, that's definitely one way to pull it off.)

“The Bold and the Beautiful” star Lisa Yamada is living her life to the fullest following her exit as Luna Nozawa.

Yamada, who first debuted as the notorious villain in September 2023, has been keeping fans updated on her recent adventures, and needless to say, she's having a blast.

Last week, Yamada wrapped up her stint on “The Bold and the Beautiful” as the baddie Luna, or so it seems. The lunatic was run down by a car as she was making her epic escape.

And it turns out the one who finally brought about Luna's downfall was none other than one of her former victims, art teacher Ms. Dylan.

Shortly after her character was killed off, Yamada took to Instagram to reflect on her time on the show.

“So many tears shed, blood spilled, friendships formed, and memories made on @boldandbeautifulcbs,” Yamada captioned the post she shared on November 21. “What a ride it's been! Hope you enjoyed the adventures <3 #LUNAtic4ever.”

Yamada isn't wasting time sulking over Luna's death. “The Bold and the Beautiful” star is out and about, making the most of her time away from the long-running CBS soap.

In another Instagram post, Yamada shared a glimpse of her fun moments since leaving the show.

“Lucky me,” Yamada captioned a carousel of photos from her recent outing.

One photo showed Yamada having a blast at a bar, while another captured her enjoying a meal at the famous Nobu restaurant.

In other photos, Yamada could be seen smoking a cigarette and lounging on a car hood. She even posed with her real-life bestie and “The Bold and the Beautiful” co-star Christian Weissmann.

The Daytime Emmy-winning actress also appeared to have crossed paths with Kris Jenner, sharing a photo of the momager on Instagram.

Meanwhile, some fans are still not over Luna's unexpected exit on “The Bold and the Beautiful.”

One fan wrote, “Will you ever come back as Luna? It's boring without you.”

Another commented, “Please bring Luna back from the dead! You are extremely missed already!”

A fan shared, “With you gone on ‘B&B,' it's become a boring mess. You added all the spice!”

Someone suggested, “If you don't return as Luna, then please play a new character on ‘Y&R'.”

Let Luna stay dead. Sheila is enough!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark Dating Game Goes Hilariously Off-the-Rails at the Hallmark Christmas Experience (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/stars-funny-videos-hallmark-christmas-experience/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 16:08:07 GMT","

The 2025 Hallmark Christmas Experience in Kansas City is off to a rip-roaring start, with fans from across the country descending on Hallmark's national headquarters for the first of four weekends featuring events with Hallmark Channel stars, creative classes, a holiday market and more.

The featured stars during the first weekend include Andrew Walker, Benjamin Ayres, Paul Campbell, B.J. Britt, Kimberley Sustad, Tyler Hynes, Rhiannon Fish, Robert Buckley, and Jessy Schram. “Finding Mr. Christmas” host Jonathan Bennett also flew in to host several onstage events, including a Hallmark version of “The Dating Game” on November 29. But thanks to several stars' hilarious and suggestive comments, plus voice-disguising software on the stars' microphones, the mock game show went off the rails quickly.

For the Hallmark Dating Game, fans from the audience were chosen to participate, asking questions of the three hunks or leading ladies on the other side of a partition on stage. Just like with the classic game show, the goal was to decide which anonymous suitor the contestant would like to date, based on the “eligible” bachelors' or bachelorettes' answers. 

Bennett cutely clarified that no one would actually be winning a date with one of the stars but, rather, a selfie with them — which is as good as gold at a jam-packed event like this. Hallmark disguised the stars' voices to help keep them anonymous, and that turned into a hysterical part of their participation. 

Campbell, who stars in “Christmas at the Catnip Cafe” on November 30, didn't know his voice was disguised at first. As seen in the video above, he crumpled into laughter when he realized the high-pitched voice was his own. 

Next, when “A Christmas Angel Match” star Ayres tried out his microphone, he hilariously (and correctly) assessed that he sounded like a “serial killer.” Finally, Hynes gave his mic a try and had everyone laughing by only answering in Spanish. With those as the three choices for the fan to choose from, Campbell laughed, “There are no winners here today!” 

The hilarity did not end there; all three rounds of the game show were filled with ridiculous, side-splitting moments, including the video above. During the first round, the fan asked Contestant #2, which was Ayres, what animal he'd choose as his sidekick if he were a superhero. 

Ayres started out by saying, “If? Not if,” and it made him, Campbell, and Hynes laugh. With the voice distortion on the mic, Ayres' laugh sounded like a quintessential cartoon nemesis, and threw back his head with a guttural, mischievous laugh. As he leaned into it, the guys joined in. 

We're pretty sure no one had on their Hallmark Christmas Experience bingo card that Walker and Britt would be the ones to bring so much spice to the Dating Game! First, Walker had to be jokingly hauled off the stage multiple times by Hynes and Campbell, his “Three Wise Men” trilogy co-stars, for his suggestive comments and singing. 

During his round of the Hallmark Dating Game alongside Britt and Buckley, Walker had the same deep-voiced, sinister-sounding microphone that Ayres had used previously. And for whatever reason, it put him in the mood to repeatedly and inexplicably sing Exile's 1978 song “Kiss You All Over,” slowly crooning the lyrics, “I want to kiss you all over, till the night closes in.” 

Walker also grabbed Britt's high-pitched mic at one point to sing the song. It sounded just as creepy, prompting Campbell and Hynes to run out onstage to remove him, which sent the crowd into fits of laughter. 

But Walker's most egregious offense, which also got him yanked offstage by Hynes and Campbell, was his answer about what baked good he's most like. As seen in the video above, he was in trouble from the moment he hilariously suggested he was most like a “pudding cake.” 

It's not every day you hear hundreds of Hallmark fans shouting to someone, “Take it off! Take it off!” But that's exactly what happened when Britt answered what his superhero costume would look like and whether it would have any “special features.” 

When Britt stood up and pretended he was going to take off his clothes, the crowd gasped, squealed, and then started shouting, “Take it off! Take if off!” 

When Britt sat back down, he declared, “I'm more of a skin guy,” drawing surprised laughs from the crowd. When he raised his eyebrows and flashed his big grin, he simply asked, “Special features?” Worried the innuendo would be too spicy for Hallmark, Campbell and Hynes ran onto the stage to whisk him away. 

Hallmark leading ladies Taylor Cole, Rhiannon Fish, and Jessy Schram had their own funny segment, taking questions from a male fan on the other side of the partition. Cole pretended to be a whiny mean girl and declared she wasn't ever interested in dating the guy after he selected Schram as his “date.” 

After another full day of fun on November 30, the Hallmark Christmas Experience has three weekends left in Kansas City, with a different cast of stars attending each.

I Love these Guys & Gals. I just Love everything about the Hallmark Stars. None Better.

This was great!  Those video clips are so funny!

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw may be behind some of the year's most striking imagery, but the innovator who combined 65mm IMAX and Super Panavision 70 to create the gorgeous, ambitious large-format photography of “Sinners” never envisioned a career in filmmaking. In high school, she was interested in photography and made short films with her friends, but never considered them a serious pursuit. When she decided to attend Loyola Marymount University, her intention was to study art history. But even though she went to college with no plans to enter the film industry, the seeds had been planted years before.

“I'm from Northern California, and I was raised by a single mom,” Arkapaw said. “She would always take me to movies or watch movies at home. In the back of my mind, she played a big role in giving me a love for movies and going to the theater.” 

 










What turned her adolescent interest in movies into a lifelong passion and ambition was a film course Arkapaw took at LMU to fulfill a curriculum requirement. She wrote a paper on two black-and-white masterpieces: “Raging Bull,” which Michael Chapman shot for Martin Scorsese, and “Broadway Danny Rose,” one of many landmark collaborations between Gordon Willis and Woody Allen.  

“It blew my mind open, being in this class talking about how films were shot and what it meant,” Arkapaw said. “I wanted to know who was making these images.” When Arkapaw started researching cinematographers, she was disappointed by the dearth of women in the profession. But she found a few role models, like Ellen Kuras, who shot 2001's “Blow,” and that was enough to inspire her to dive headfirst into studying and immersing herself in the world of cinematography. “I was hooked,” she said.  

After graduating from LMU and spending a few years working in the corporate world, she decided to commit once and for all to pursuing a career in cinematography. Even though it meant trading steady employment for student loans and an uncertain future, when she was accepted into the AFI Conservatory's cinematography program, Arkapaw left the idea of a life working at a desk behind. 

 










At AFI, Arkapaw got the opportunity to shoot her first feature film when classmate Rafael Palacio Illingworth wrote, directed, and starred in “Macho,” a microbudget dramedy that Arkapaw photographed between her first and second years. “We shot on 35mm and it won an award at Raindance,” Arkapaw said, referring to the U.K. film festival. “That allowed me to become a DP before I graduated.” After graduation, Arkapaw shot another low-budget indie, “Guadalupe the Virgin,” and then she got the call that would lead to one of her most satisfying creative partnerships.

“A classmate of mine at AFI was going to shoot [Gia Coppola's] ‘Palo Alto,' and he was unavailable one day and asked me if I could fill in,” Arkapaw said. “Gia was shooting some stuff on a 7D to show [James] Franco — little vignettes with her friends.” 

When Arkapaw came on board to photograph the feature, in some ways it felt like starting from scratch — even with two features and several shorts already under her belt. “ It felt like my first film because I found a director that I really had a deep connection with. We shared a similar visual language and aesthetic and taste in a lot of things: fashion, food, music,” Arkapaw said, adding that working on a small set, filled with friends, deepened the experience. “It felt very powerful, like I was part of a group and could finally say something with a camera.”

 










Arkapaw and Coppola became fast friends and began an ongoing collaboration that would lead to last year's acclaimed “The Last Showgirl,” which earned star Pamela Anderson her first Golden Globe and SAG nominations.

Another filmmaker Arkapaw quickly found a common language with was “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler, whom she had initially hoped to work with on the 2015 “Rocky” spinoff, “Creed.” “I'm really good friends with [cinematographer] Bradford Young, and it was Bradford who told Ryan about me when he was looking for a DP for ‘Creed,'” Arkapaw said. “When he brought my name up to the studio, I only had ‘Palo Alto' as a credit, and it wasn't enough for the studio to move forward with me. Unfortunately, we were like ships passing in the night.”

Luckily, by the time Coogler needed a director of photography to come on board 2022's “Wakanda Forever,” Arkapaw had amassed several substantial credits, including work on the Marvel TV series “Loki.” The success of that series put Arkapaw at the top of not only Coogler's list but also the studio's, and after her first Zoom call with Coogler, she knew she had met another filmmaking soulmate.

“It felt like we were long lost cousins,” Arkapaw said. “It just felt right, like I was meant to meet him and meant to be a part of that group.” Coogler had already assembled most of his team from people he'd worked with on previous movies, with Arkapaw and the assistant director being the only two new additions. But the cinematographer immediately felt at home. “It's a daunting thing to come in on the second movie when the first one had such a tight-knit family, but I felt really supported,” she said.

 










Because “Wakanda Forever” had such a long shoot — around an entire year — Coogler said at the time that Arkapaw was the DP he had worked the most with, even though they had only made one movie together. After “Wakanda Forever,” Coogler and Arkapaw stayed in touch, and the cinematographer began to get hints about their next collaboration. “I knew that he was writing something personal, and that it was a period piece, and that he wanted to shoot it on 16mm,” Arkapaw said.

That project turned out to be “Sinners,” a film that would utilize Arkapaw's greatest strengths: her impeccable eye, along with her talent for marrying images to music, as seen in her music videos for SZA, Rihanna, the Jonas Brothers, and more. When Arkapaw read Coogler's ambitious script, she was immediately excited by the range of possibilities and challenges, from mixing genres as disparate as horror movies and musicals to shooting Michael B. Jordan as two distinct characters.

“The first time I read it all the way through, I was blown away,” Arkapaw said. She immediately began talking with Coogler about influences ranging from Paul Thomas Anderson's “There Will Be Blood” to John Carpenter's “The Thing,” but her primary inspiration came from a book of photographs by Eudora Welty. “It was a book of black-and-white photos Ryan told me about from the 1930s. I looked at it and knew exactly what he was after visually, and in terms of mood and tone,” she said.

 










Initially, Coogler planned to return to the 16mm format he had enjoyed working with on “Fruitvale Station,” and Arkapaw was equally excited, given her positive experience with 16mm on “The Last Showgirl.” Early conversations with the film's visual effects supervisor, however, made Arkapaw realize that the compositing required for Jordan's twinning shots would be compromised by the smaller gauge format, so the decision was made to go with 35mm. That's when the studio approached Coogler about shooting large format — resulting in the final 65mm IMAX extravaganza.

“It opened his mind up, and he called me immediately,” Arkapaw said. Coogler floated the extremely wide Ultra Panavision 70 process that Quentin Tarantino used for “The Hateful Eight” — and which had been used on spectacles like “Ben-Hur” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” So she began looking at 65mm dailies from a variety of processes and films, running scenes from Tarantino's 2015 Western, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Tenet,” and others at FotoKem. She then went out to the desert to shoot a series of tests with multiple lenses, cameras, and formats, including 35mm.

Eventually, both the cinematographer and director agreed that the clear choice was to shoot “Sinners” alternating between 65mm IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 — a bold decision given that IMAX boasts one of the tallest possible aspect ratios at 1.43:1, while Ultra Panavision 70 is the widest at 2.76:1. 

 










This made Arkapaw, who once struggled to find female role models, the first woman to shoot on both IMAX film and in Ultra Panavision. (She's also the only cinematographer to shoot with IMAX Ektachrome film stock, which was created by Kodak especially for “Sinners.”) But Arkapaw was convinced that it was the right decision, which was confirmed when she and Coogler shot more test footage and cut it together to see how the alternating, disparate aspect ratios would work. “I immediately thought it was a great idea,” she said, describing the effect as “beautiful.” “It didn't cross my mind that it wouldn't work,” she said.

The approach enabled Arkapaw to achieve a combination of period accuracy and visceral immediacy that was further enhanced by her careful selection of anamorphic lenses. Many of these were engineered specifically for “Sinners” by Panavision lens genius Dan Sasaki, though Arkapaw also “grabbed some other lenses, like the lenses from ‘2001: A Space Odyssey.'” “I gravitate toward older glass generally,” she said. “When you're working with this format that's very resolute, they pair nicely, as far as having age and texture to the image, because you want it to look like the 1930s.”

Given the audacious blend of genres and complex thematic layering, the critical and commercial success of “Sinners” was hardly a given, but Arkapaw did have a sense she was working on something unique during production. “It happened even in the tests,” she said. “We did a hair and makeup test, and just seeing Michael in those hats and walking on set — the power of his face — you just got so excited. There were so many moments on set early on where I would look at Ryan, and it would be unspoken: ‘Wow, this is really special.'”

 










The kind of inspiration she felt while working on “Sinners” is what Arkapaw always aspires to — and what makes her more and more excited about her work as a cinematographer. “All you want as a photographer is to be inspired every time you look through the lens,” she said, “and it was happening constantly on this film for me.”

Arkapaw may not have to wait too long to feel that way again, since she already has another project planned with Coogler and his team: a highly anticipated reboot of “The X-Files.” “I'm excited because I know we're going to be brave, and I'm going to be with people I like to be around, and they're going to protect me and let me exercise creativity at the highest level,” she said. “That happens to some people once in a lifetime, but I get to make more projects with this group. I'm very fortunate.”

[Editor's note: This article contains spoilers for both the film and novel versions of “Hamnet.”] 

It's always a question of whether you want to read a book first before you see a movie adaptation, but the flavor of the question facing “Hamnet” is a little bit different. It certainly isn't one of plot spoilers. The dramatis personae all lived and died 400 years ago, and if you don't yet know what happens in the William Shakespeare play “Hamlet,” well, your English teacher would prefer that you watch “The Lion King” and not ask ChatGPT, so go do that.  

 










Both Maggie O'Farrell's novel and Chloé Zhao's film, which she adapted with help from O'Farrell, are much more about vibes. The story in both makes liberal use of the fact that almost nothing is known about Shakespeare's family, that English did not have standardized spellings in the late 16th Century, and that the plague (or, if you want to be fancy with your Yersinia pestis, the Pestilence), according to O'Farrell's author's note, “is not mentioned once by Shakespeare, in any of his plays or poetry.”

From these bare limitations, O'Farrell's novel builds a garden of prose around the unknowable inner lives of his wife — commonly known as Anne Hathaway, but mentioned in her father's will as Agnes — and their three children, sweet William himself, his sister and parents, and a handful of neighbors and relations. Like cutting from path to path and moving from manicured grounds to wild weeds, O'Farrell's book jumps back and forth in time. It imagines the last days of their son Hamnet's life before he dies of the plague. (The real Hamnet Shakespeare did indeed die at age 10, but his cause of death isn't listed in parish records.) The novel intercuts these moments with a longer, poignant, dramatic-irony-laden tale of Agnes' and Will's courtship, marriage, and life as young parents.

One of the biggest changes Zhao makes to the material is her choice to avoid flashback/flashforward intercutting, even if it might seem tailor-made for a film editor. “Hamnet” proceeds in linear fashion, from Agnes' (Jessie Buckley) and Will's (Paul Mescal) first meeting to the performance of “Hamlet” that a heartbroken Agnes attends; there, she sees her husband play the ghost of old King and a youth embody the young, still-very-much alive Danish prince, and it gives her dead son back to his parents, in the only way he can return from the undiscovered country of death.

 










The time-jumps on display in the first part of O'Farrell's novel are meant to come across as a virtuosic feat, of course, and us groundlings are all so used to movies cutting back and forth in time, it's a much more meat-and-potatoes part of filmmaking. The conceit where Zhao invests a similar sense of elevated mystery is the stage-like bardo where young Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) finds himself, a dark mirror of the eventual Globe Theater stage set of “Hamlet” put on for Shakespeare's play. 

This space that is both real and pretend, a forest and a fake, alive and not, is the big invention of Zhao's screenplay. O'Farrell's point-of-view narration for Hamnet does follow him to the edge of death, but has him imagine a soft expanse of snow to lie down in, almost seeing ahead to the white shroud his mother will weave him into to bury him. Intercutting between the “real” events of the film and that mystic, undefined place is how Zhao and fellow editor Affonso Gonçalves attempt to achieve the same jarring, poignant mix of emotions as the novel's structure. 

As with any book adaptation, characters get compressed and erased from a two-hour runtime. O'Farrell's take on Agnes' annoying stepmother, Joan, is the biggest loser in terms of book characters squeezed out. She's still present, but much less of a menace. Shakespeare's parents don't get as much screentime to be nosy, although it is entirely to Emily Watson's credit that Shakespeare's mother, Mary, does get the same arc of coming to a kind of peace with her son's choice of a wild “forest-witch” for a bride in both the book and the film. Joe Alwyn's take on Agnes' brother Bartholomew is a slimmer, more doe-eyed one than the extremely tall farmer of few words O'Farrell imagines escorting his sister to London. 

 










While O'Farrell spends story real estate on imagining how the plague germs traveled the Mediterranean into Warwickshire and Zhao smartly cuts that tangent, maybe the biggest omission is one O'Farrell also doesn't directly show in the novel either. In the book, Agnes instantly knows her husband is having affairs in London in the year after their son's death as soon as he slinks back home to Stratford. She imagines these other women trying to press through her bed curtains. Mescal's Will is a truer husband in fiction than Shakespeare probably was, which makes a less complicated love story and gives Zhao's “Hamnet” a more total focus on the bleed back and forth between love, grief, and art. 

“Hamnet” is the rare case where reading/watching one version first really doesn't spoil the experience of reading/watching the other. They have different scopes and different formal ways of making you feel really sad — composer Max Richter shouldn't be allowed to keep getting away with this, at least as far as the film's concerned. 

In both, to bastardize a saying, the play's the thing. 

A Focus Features release, “Hamnet” is now in theaters.

“This Feels Unaccountably Ludicrous,” Anne Eickelberg wrote in her diary in April 1995. “Torrential Flood of Ugly Losers.” “Thwarting Forever Ubiquitous Lameness.” “Tit Fuck Uranus Lengthwise.” “Turds, Farts, and Uber-Logs.” “Tour Flunkies Under Live.”

Eickelberg was proposing variations on the initials of her own unwieldy band name: Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, the kind of name that arrives as a lark and settles in as an albatross. Seven months before, they had released Strangers From the Universe, an album that opens with a punk-surrealist ode to an enviable tortoise and closes with a folk-surrealist ballad about the end of humanity as we know it. The music between may be best summarized in the fragmentary style the band itself often put to brilliant and frustrating use.

Surrealism is a part of it. Pranks. Noise. Free improvisation. More interest in structure and sweetness than you might think at first, when all you notice are the smash cuts from one strange musical scene to the next. Soundtracks to imaginary pulp films, or religious rituals. Five singers, three guitars, bass, drums, banjo, mandolin, Optigan, taking turns or all going at once. Aching beauty, childhood regression, grotesque desire. Sort of like a lullaby that carries you into a nightmare from which you awake laughing. This was Thinking Fellers Union Local 282's idea of a commercial record.

The last of Eickelberg's proposed alternate names had to do with the band's particular circumstances in April 1995. They were getting ready to hit the road and open for—to be Tour Flunkies Under—Live. Yes, Live, the quartet of musical goatees then in the process of sending the magnificently dour single “Lightning Crashes” to the top of the Billboard rock charts. Humorless, messianic, bald, successful, they were everything Thinking Fellers were not. The Fellers' accounts of the disastrous arena shows that followed are like scenes out of Heironymous Bosch: basketballs hurled from the audience whizzing past their heads, a fan in the front row who “nearly broke his middle finger off giving me the finger so hard,” a conspicuous recurrence of the word hatred. For Eickelberg, the experience was educational. “It answered a lot of questions for us, too,” she later said in an interview with Perfect Sound Forever, “because it made it so clear that there was just no fucking way that we ever gonna get bigger than we were.”

Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, in this musically astounding and commercially disappointing stretch of mid-to-late life, was Eickelberg on bass; Mark Davies, Brian Hageman, and Hugh Swarts on guitars; and Jay Paget on drums. Everyone sang, contributed to songwriting, and played instruments other than their primary one. (An earlier album's liner notes simply credit all five with “instruments.”) The four string-playing Fellers had grown up in Iowa and moved to the Bay Area in the mid-'80s, where they soon linked up with original drummer Paul Bergmann and commenced living the dream of bohemian band life, with all five members shacking up together and practicing in the same Oakland house. A detailed timeline of the band's existence on their official website gives a window on their habits around this period: “drinking generic burgundy, listening to two big band radio stations at the same time, and writing songs.”

Rent was cheap and the music industry's brief but intense fascination with “alternative rock” made an actual career for a band as strange as this one seem worth pursuing. They'd even opened for Nirvana once, a month after Nevermind came out. It's hard to imagine their particular sensibility—driven by mind-meld improvisation and arcane inside jokes, so intensely collaborative as to render individual authorship nearly moot—emerging without this period of cohabitation and the economic conditions that enabled it. They must have spent so much time practicing, bouncing ideas, fucking around, hanging out.

By the time of Strangers From the Universe, they were four albums and three EPs deep and seriously considering quitting. The last two full-lengths had come out on Matador, a label whose combination of curatorial boldness and distribution muscle made it perhaps the ideal home for them, but their signing hadn't translated to big sales or reliable crowds. Eickelberg and Hageman's extensive tour diaries, archived on the band's website, are wryly candid catalogs of the thrills and indignities of life on the road. “The dread that we won't get our guarantee, that we'll be hog-tied or kicked out,” Eickelberg wrote at one particularly empty and dispiriting show in Buffalo. “And, of course, there's the hideous certain prospect of playing for 45 minutes to the bartender…[and] the more basic underlying anger at having to pay dues for ever & ever unto infinity.”

After touring relentlessly for several years, they took a yearlong hiatus in 1993. They'd stopped living together and moved into a new San Francisco practice space full of junkies and squatters. The situation was dire, but something about it inspired them to keep going, to take a big swing and see if they could make a real living in music after all. “We did sporadic things during that time, but we were kind of trying to take a break from each other,” Davies said of Strangers From the Universe's gestation. “And then at the end of that period we basically said, ‘Let's try to push it more instead of giving up.'” On your first listen to Strangers From the Universe, you might wonder: What the fuck were they thinking? This was going to be their commercial break? It's true that the quotient of songs to noise experiments was a bit higher than on previous albums, but the songs themselves are more open-ended, further abstracting the influence of post-punk and no wave into a dream zone where anything at all might happen. And though the mix was cleaner than it had ever been, it only served to reveal Thinking Fellers' inexorable weirdness in sparkling new detail.

They sometimes sound like they're under the impression that they must invent a whole new way of playing together with each song they write. It's the kind of radical naivete you might encounter in Zen Buddhism or the comedown from a powerful psychedelic trip. Who says a mandolin isn't a percussion instrument? Why can't a few staccato blasts of guitar noise serve as a song's hook? Can we both play bass on this one? “February,” with its intricately gnarled figurations of banjo and furious electric guitar, might serve as the basis of an entire subgenre if anyone else could be bothered to pick up the baton, progressive punk for the acid hoedown scene. It's not just the unusual instruments, it's the way they all tangle and spar, at cross purposes one moment and in tandem the next. Paget plays drums like the caffeinated offspring of Can's Jaki Liebezeit, finding deep pockets in a groove that might otherwise sound like so much clattering. Eickelberg's bass bounces and weaves, offering elaborate countermelodies and emphatic punctuations. “Everything's the same, it's just more of the same,” goes the barked chorus, an account of depression that could also serve as an indictment of other bands' complacency.

With “Guillotine,” a tapestry of chiming strings and stoned group chanting, they were nearly to the point of inventing Animal Collective, a band of Feller fanatics so devoted they once convinced their heroes to reunite for a few shows. The song's crisscrossing arpeggios start out pleasantly dreamy but slide here and there into foreboding dissonance. There are no drums. The whole thing feels like it might float away if not for a knotty descending riff that shows up every once in a while to keep things tethered to the ground. At some point, so gradually that you hardly notice it happening, the dissonance takes over. The tether slips, childlike voices chatter insanely at the margins. Without ever losing its sense of hazy reverie, the song becomes genuinely frightening, a good high gone bad.

“Guillotine” first appeared in truncated instrumental form under the name “Firing Squad” on The Funeral Pudding, the 1994 EP that immediately preceded Strangers From the Universe. It was one of the brief and stubbornly abstract bits of improvisation that recur on every Thinking Fellers album, running amidst the more developed songs like a babbling river of the subconscious. Fans affectionately call these pieces “Feller filler.” “Bomber Pilot WWII,” the third track on Strangers, is a typical example: some lonesome guitar ambience accompanied by crunchy low-end sounds of uncertain origin, all drifting nowhere in particular for about a minute before cutting out.

Feller filler occupies a complicated place in the Thinking Fellers canon. On one hand, you could skip it all without missing much. On the other, its persistence across their catalog, even on an ostensibly listener-friendly album like this one, suggests it was a crucial element of the band's self-conception about which they were not willing to compromise. They wrote many of their songs through collective improvisation, and they often jammed onstage; Feller filler both lays bare the inner workings of their process and serves as a gauntlet for any would-be fans who can't hang. They were practically begging Live's crowd to throw basketballs.

Thinking Fellers' surreal humor and penchant for undercutting their own ambition can obscure the fact that they were top-notch musicians. They would expend enormous energy on what might seem like jokes, like a note-perfect three-guitar arrangement of the orchestral theme song to a 1950s variety show, performed live on the Strangers From the Universe tour. The individual members had little if any formal training on their instruments; you get the sense that they learned to play by playing together, honing their group sensibility over what must have been countless hours of rehearsal. Like their shaggy San Francisco forebears in the Grateful Dead, by living together and playing constantly, they all found instrumental voices that were perfect for this particular band, even if they weren't necessarily the kind of professional-grade virtuosos who would thrive in any context they encountered. Rarely is anyone playing lead in a traditional sense—there's simply too much going on—but if you focus on any particular instrumental part, you'll often find a marvel of intricacy. Their songwriting is less a matter of chords and a melody than the architectural arrangement of these gleaming and misshapen riffs, laid at seemingly impossible angles of mutual support, like pillars in an Escher drawing.

The album's crowning achievement is “Cup of Dreams,” a nearly seven-minute agglomeration of childlike synth melodies, spy-movie basslines, mechanized piano runs, and dream-pop guitar hooks that stands as one of the most beguiling creations in all of '90s indie rock. It feels a bit like one of those Paul McCartney medley-songs that involve stitching together the best parts of six different abandoned compositions, one refrain after another. For Thinking Fellers, the equivalent of “If I ever get out of here…” is someone moaning through distortion so thick you can only make out half the words over rainfall sound effects and a keyboard coming in from the next room. And yet—it's fucking beautiful. Beautiful in some fleeting subconscious way, like a memory of an old friend you can only keep on the surface of your mind for a half-second at a time. You can almost imagine the version of Thinking Fellers that did make it big, with legions of freaks pulling out their lighters and singing incoherently along.

There are lots of silly lyrics on Strangers From the Universe: gooey sex jokes, outlandish creatures, bathetic nosedives from the romantic to the juvenile. “My Pal the Tortoise,” the opener, might be cloyingly whimsical if its series of questions and answers about its shell-dwelling hero weren't so funny and oddly poetic. (“What does he file at the hall of records?/A proclamation of tortoise intent.”) But even in its more antic moments, the album is often preoccupied with endings and what comes after them. In “Socket,” martial snare rolls and bee-sting guitar lines soundtrack a story about a childhood near-death experience, followed by a lifelong sense that something went irreversibly wrong in that moment of survival. “Hundreds of Years,” alternately frenzied and sedate, contrasts the petty concerns of people with the peace of trees that will long outlast us. The few intelligible lyrics on “Cup of Dreams” speak of a cleansing flood that will “drown our mouths,” “make our heads explode,” and “wash out our dirty minds.”

“The Operation” is a musically triumphant and lyrically nightmarish account of a surgery that seems to kill its patient. In keeping with the album's prevailing tone, death is experienced not as tragedy but transcendent release. The Fellers deliver the crucial lines in drunken-chorus mode over glorious guitar grind and cartoonishly massive drum fills, the raggedness of their delivery belying the delicate polyphony of the vocal arrangement: “Graceful became my hands, they fluttered away from me/Graceful became my heart as it pumped apart from me/Graceful became my tongue, rhyme and meter running away.”

When writing Strangers From the Universe, “We weren't thinking of going anywhere,” Hageman said. “We were thinking about ending.” Needless to say, the vision of giant clubs filled with adoring freaks didn't come to pass. For Davies, Strangers and the tour that followed represented “a pinnacle of sorts” for the band. Not everyone seems to have felt that way at the time. “This lifestyle and this pursuit seem more and more meaningless to me,” Eickelberg wrote in her tour diary in November '94, at the end of an entry about getting sick without health insurance. “I feel silly, being in a band and touring and hanging out in ugly, boring rock clubs (at my age.) When I look at us I think we are ridiculous sometimes.” “Half of the time on this tour I've thought—I've strongly believed—that we are fooling ourselves and shouldn't be in this business (at OUR ages),” she wrote soon after. Two months after the album came out, Thinking Fellers' final push at making an honest living in indie rock was beginning to sputter.

The entire quixotic notion of alternative rock as a commercial prospect was sputtering, too. Kurt Cobain had died the previous April, but the rock charts were still peppered with bands that had credible ties to the underground. Within a year, Live's Throwing Copper would become the biggest rock album in America, helping to usher in the “post-grunge” era, when the majors stopped pretending to care about ingenuity and focused instead on signing increasingly faded carbon copies of Pearl Jam. The symbolism of Thinking Fellers' opening slot on the Live's 1995 tour is almost too perfect: The freaks get chased offstage and the professionals take over.

Thinking Fellers toured for another year, parted with Matador, made another album, 1996's equally dazzling I Hope It Lands, and stepped back from the band as a career pursuit. They still played the occasional show and labored sporadically for years on their 2001 swan song, whose very title, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, is enough to signal the retreat of whatever aspirations to rock stardom they once held. It's more elegiac than you might expect from the name: “91 Dodge Van,” titled after their old tour chariot, opens with autumnal guitars and Eickelberg sighing the lines “Looking back over our days, I know we've won/Sometimes it feels like that's erased by moving on.” It also has a song called “Boob Feeler.”

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. There's still one song on Strangers From the Universe to discuss, one final daydream before real life sets in. It's called “Noble Experiment,” it closes the album, and it's the only Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 song you'll ever hear played around a campfire or performed by the sorts of indie rock stars the Fellers never became. The words were written by Davies and delivered by Eickelberg, with the other Fellers joining in harmony as the verses go by. “If the sadness of life makes you tired,” it begins, “and the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day.”

“Noble Experiment,” a waltz-time lullaby for humanity's extinction, brings Strangers From the Universe's fixation on finality into clear focus, just as the album itself winds down. The Fellers receive this fate with characteristic jubilation: an opportunity to leave cruel routine behind and be reborn as sparrows chattering in the treetops or weeds busting up through old sidewalks. It would be disingenuous to suggest that Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 experienced a similarly transformative rebirth after calling it a day, that the band received the kind of widespread recognition in death that had eluded it in life. They're not Pavement, or even Duster. There have been well-received reissues—the 2022 pressing of Strangers From the Universe sold out quickly—but they remain a band for the freaks. Still, the records live on, like the trees in “Hundreds of Years” that outlast the squabbling people, monuments to possibility yet unexplored. Or like the heart in “The Operation,” still pumping even as the body passes away.

A
T HIS REGULAR SPOT — the stool with “BG” on the back, way at one end of the bar — the owner of Buddy Guy's Legends scans the hundreds of people packing his club. Tugging off the pandemic-era mask he still wears during public gatherings, he leans forward and looks toward the stage a few hundred feet away. “In an hour,” he says, “I might have a drink and go up there.”


	On some level, this midsummer evening is just another night at the Chicago blues club and restaurant Buddy Guy opened more than 35 years ago. The tables atop the yellow-and-blue checkerboard floor are once more filling up with tourists, tattooed dudes, youngish couples, and blues fans of all stripes. The walls remain lined with photos of Guy onstage and offstage with his disciples (Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan) and his heroes (B.B. King, Muddy Waters). The employees at the merch counter near the entrance are prepping to sell T-shirts, baseball caps, and other souvenirs sporting Guy's likeness or the club's logo.

	











	When he's not on the road, Guy stops into his club regularly, partly to keep an eye on operations, but also to goose the business, since customers sometimes show up hoping he'll take the stage whether he's on the bill or not. But tonight isn't just another booking; as a banner over the bar proclaims, it's his birthday, his 89th at that. Looking at Guy, you'd barely know it: His complexion is smooth, and he appears trim and wiry in his polka-dot jacket over a white T-shirt, topped by one of his trademark white caps. Fans approach to wish him happy birthday and give him a casual fist bump. Guy acknowledges each quickly, then signals to a bartender, who brings over a bottle of his favorite cognac.

	Some of tonight's crowd have likely been fans of Guy's for decades; others might know him as the older incarnation of Sammie Moore in the closing scenes of Sinners, director Ryan Coogler's acclaimed and top-grossing blues-and-vampires hit. “It seems like every time I go to the grocery store, I hear, ‘That looks like that guy in Sinners,'” Guy says with a smile. Easing his way off his stool, Guy makes his way to the merch area to begin signing copies of his just-released album, Ain't Done With the Blues, and pose for selfies with the Guyheads lined up out the door.

	But after an hour, his work for the night has just begun. Called over to the stage, he accepts a birthday cake with candles from some of the eight adult children and several grandchildren gathered around him. As the house band slips into a bluesy vamp, the family members leave the stage, but Guy remains, and the reserved, elderly gentleman at the bar transforms into the wily, suggestive Buddy Guy of legend. “If you don't love me, maybe your sister will!” he growls, to laughter and cheers. After a half hour, he heads back to the merch stand and resumes the autographing and selfies, but the crowd wants more music. When a microphone is passed to his side of the club, Guy picks up where he left off onstage, wandering into the crowd this time, and exhorting more blues. He won't leave until 2 a.m.


	The sight of Guy summoning up the energy of someone decades younger is startling, even to his family. “We're always like, ‘Oh, my God — he's old and is going to fall,'” says his daughter Shawnna Guy, a hip-hop artist since the Nineties. “You look at him onstage, and he's just bopping back and forth and hitting the strings with a face towel, then putting the guitar behind his head and playing it with a drumstick. And you're like, ‘What the hell am I worried about?' I can't even do that!”


	Guy's ongoing livelihood — Ain't Done With the Blues is his 20th studio album, and he's leaving for a string of West Coast shows a few weeks after we meet — is not necessarily the outcome he or anyone saw for himself. For the first few decades of his career, he was often overlooked and undervalued by the music business. But now, the blues pioneers who inspired him — King, Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Guitar Slim, and so many more — are long gone, as are many who learned from him, from Jeff Beck to Vaughan. Guy, the blues stalwart who couldn't catch a break for a long time, has outlasted them all.

	“I'm the last old man still walking and playing the blues,” he says. “That's what we talked about with Muddy [Waters] and Howlin' Wolf before they died. They said, ‘Buddy, please keep the blues alive.' And I'm tryin'.” As youngblood blues guitarist Christone “Kingfish” Ingram puts it, “As far as mainstream blues, he's the last OG.”


	One key to Guy's survival is that he was never a blues purist. Dating back to his earliest 45s and his first album, 1967's Left My Blues in San Francisco, he blended soul, rock power chords, and high-stepping R&B into blues, along with an unrestrained style of guitar playing and vocal blues wail that always threatened to go off the rails but never did. His recent string of albums are packed with cameos from across the musical spectrum (Mick Jagger, Keith Urban, and Kid Rock, among many) and sport a loud, crackling, radio-friendly sound; Ain't Done With the Blues, which was just nominated for a Best Traditional Blues Album Grammy, pairs him with Ingram, Joe Walsh, and Peter Frampton. As Bruce Iglauer of the blues label Alligator says, “Buddy effectively rocked out the blues, while keeping the soul of the blues in the music. I don't know that anybody else has done that. Maybe he feels like he's the last knight in armor, and that part of his job is not repeating the tradition, but bringing the tradition into a more modern context.”


	Thanks partly to Sinners and musicians like Ingram, the blues appear to be in healthier shape than in a while; Ingram has started an independent label to foster new talent in the field. “I've seen a lot of young artists of color coming out and playing this music, or music based on this genre,” he says. “People are craving more music that's authentic.”


	But once we lose Guy, we won't just see the passing of a musician who took blues guitar to new, crazily inventive heights, influenced everyone from the Rolling Stones and Clapton to Vaughan and Ingram, and managed to have a rare second act in the music world. We'll also be losing a vital link to the music's roots and the cultural backdrop from which the blues emerged. Simply put, we will never see the likes of Guy again. “We have to accept that these younger artists didn't grow up as sharecroppers, didn't grow up in the Civil Rights Movement,” says Shawnna. “So their stories are not going to be similar.”


	No one knows all that better than Guy. He has played for or met three presidents, though not the current occupant of the White House, whom he views skeptically. (“The man is a rich man, a rich person, and he got golf clubs here and there and all that stuff,” Guy says. “He ain't with no poor man,” adding sarcastically, “And he's thinking about me and you.”) Guy remembers the night in 2012 when he was in the White House, part of a salute to the blues during President Obama's first term. “You know, I made a joke out of it,” Guy says with a grin. “I said I was picking cotton on the farm with an outhouse, all the way to the White House. Some people laughed at that, but it's true, man. I tell people, ‘Not a lot of you know what an outhouse is.'”

	











	For at least the past three decades, the blues have been good to Buddy Guy, evidence of which is amply on display at his compound in Orland Park, just outside of Chicago. Tucked away in a thicket of trees on five acres, the estate includes a house with five bedrooms, an indoor pool, and a private residence for his groundskeeper. In his kitchen, complete with shelves lined with his favorite spices for cooking, a stash of white birthday roses has arrived from Carlos Santana, along with a card from Coogler and his wife, Zinzi. “Like you see,” Guy says, seated at his skylight-drenched dining room table the morning after his birthday bash at Legends, “I got a pool table out down there. I grew up on the farm. There's no such thing as a pool table on the farm, man. You had a hole where you chopped cotton. That's the only stick I had.”


	As usual, Guy has been up early, since about five in the morning, meaning he's only had three hours of sleep. That schedule is another reminder of the life he had, nearly a century ago, growing up in a cabin on a plantation with no running water and wooden (not glass) windows. Born George Guy in Lettsworth, Louisiana, in 1936, Guy came of age in a sharecropping family that would give half of its proceeds to the landowners, spending his days picking cotton in brutal heat. “It got to 112 every day in June, July, and August, and all we had was a big fucking straw hat,” he says, sporting another white cap and a plaid jacket this time. “When day break, you get your ass out there and come home and get in the tub and be ready to do it again tomorrow.”


	At first, the Guy house had no electricity, meaning no radio nor record player. But Buddy's life began to change when the 13-year-old heard a fieldhand bang out John Lee Hooker's “Boogie Chillen” on a guitar, then taught young Buddy how to play it himself. Soon after, Guy was further drawn into the music after seeing Lightnin' Slim play in a juke joint. Buddy's first guitar, which his father bought for him, had only two strings.


	Moving to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1951, Guy worked on a factory conveyor belt and then as a maintenance man at Louisiana State University while he began playing gigs in roadhouses; another early hero, Guitar Slim, inspired him to pull wrenching notes out of his guitar. Moving to Chicago on Sept. 25, 1957 — a date he remembers so well that he'll repeat it several times over two days of conversation — he found work in clubs and recorded for a local blues label, Cobra. One fateful day, he brought a tape of songs he'd cut at a Louisiana radio station to Chess Records, Chicago's leading blues label.

	











	Guy began logging time as a session guitarist, capable of backing up anyone from Waters to Koko Taylor (check out his contributions on her “Wang Dang Doodle”) and Howlin' Wolf (same with “Killing Floor”). “They would call my house because they couldn't get this guitar player down to play the rhythm they wanted,” he says. “They say, ‘If y'all want it done right, call Buddy Guy.'” But he also began busting out his own moves. Taking a break during a club set one night, he put his guitar down and forgot to turn it off; a customer walking by accidentally brushed her dress against the instrument, making for a joyful noise and leading Guy to experiment with distortion and reverb. His showmanship began ramping up, too. From the stage, he'd often venture out not just into the audience, but also sometimes outside the club and into bathrooms, still playing, his guitar cord trailing behind him. “When everything was so traditional, he came with a different sound, being wild and crazy,” says Ingram. “I like to credit him as being like the forefather of this bluesy, rock-y sound; Jimi [Hendrix] saw that and took it to a whole other level.”


	Chess began releasing Guy singles, like 1960's smoldering “First Time I Met the Blues,” but Guy's tenure with the label proved to be one of several missed opportunities in his career. Leonard and Phil Chess, who ran the company, didn't quite know what to do with the twentysomething Guy. “The dominant sound of blues guitar at the time was the more controlled sound of B.B. King or Albert King, rather than being rocked out,” says Iglauer, who would later release one of Guy's finest and wildest albums, Stone Crazy. “At the time, Buddy was trying to get a little crazier than Chess would let him.”


	Chess pushed Guy to make jazz or novelty records (like “Gully Hully,” which was something like Chicago surf music), but none took, and Guy has said that Leonard Chess thought his guitar sounded like “noise.” Guy also has contended that the Chess brothers wanted to change his last name to “King” to make it sound as if he were related to B.B. or Albert. Marshall Chess, Leonard's son and a veteran music-industry executive himself, admits that the Chess brothers didn't appreciate Guy's approach to guitar and preferred to keep him in the background. “There's a rumor that my dad didn't like Buddy's playing,” he says. “That's not true. My dad was highly superstitious about the backup bands, and he didn't like adding new things when he had hits with the one before. I never knew how brilliant Buddy was. I don't think anyone at Chess did.” Guy was slighted elsewhere, too, like the time he appeared on British television and was introduced as Chuck Berry. He took a job at a tow-truck company to pay the bills.

	











	Those days were trying in other ways for Guy. Tom Hambridge, the drummer and producer who would guide Guy's later albums, once visited Guy in a dressing room and watched as Guy returned an expensive bottle of Rémy Martin XO cognac that was waiting, open, for him there. After he saw Guy do the same thing on other occasions, Hambridge finally asked him what that was all about. In a reminder of the racism that could dog blues artists, Guy told him that a broken seal on a bottle indicated potential danger. As Hambridge recalls, “He said, ‘Because I've been poisoned before. Back in the day, they spit in it or piss in it.' He said he's gotten sick before, so the bottle has to be sealed in the box.”


	As would later happen with artists from Hendrix to Lana Del Rey, it would take another country to kick-start Guy's career. Black radio stations in the States ignored him, but Guy became a hero for a crop of young, blues-loving British musicians, enraptured with his combination of thrash, distortion, and stage presence. Guy recalls once seeing “a white face” at one of his shows and assuming it was a cop; but, he says with a laugh, “it was Eric Clapton!” As Clapton would later write, “He created a huge, powerful sound, and it blew me away.… He was like a dancer with his guitar, playing with his feet, his tongue, and throwing it around the room.”


	Jeff Beck, Keith Richards, Jagger, and more also worshipped at the altar of Buddy. (Many years later, Jimmy Page, another Guy disciple, told Guy's son Greg that Buddy was “the guitar god.”) At first, Guy didn't know what to make of the emerging counterculture that embraced him in the Sixties. “I saw the Stones coming with the high heels on, almost looked like a woman,” he recalls. “I'm saying, ‘What is this?' I got to San Francisco, and I said, ‘Man, look at this.' I didn't know what a hippie was. I saw men with long hair. But they were going crazy [for my music], man: ‘What do you got in that amp?'”


	But the bad breaks continued. As the Sixties drew to a close, Guy and his then-partner, harp player Junior Wells, became a must-see duo and were offered a chance to make an album produced by Clapton. But in the midst of his heroin addiction, Clapton bailed on the project, and the album sat in the vaults for two years before it tumbled out to an indifferent response. By the early Seventies, Guy no longer had a record deal and opted to open a club of his own, the Checkerboard Lounge, on Chicago's South Side. “Without a record, it is getting hard to find places to stay,” he said at the time. He would often perform at the Checkerboard, but friends and customers, even family, were equally accustomed to seeing him sweeping up, doing inventory, or setting up for other artists' shows.

	











	Sometimes, even his kids didn't quite know what their father did for a living, only that he would go on business trips and bring back enough money for piles of Christmas presents. Greg Guy's classmates in high school would ask him if the “Buddy Guy” hanging out with the Stones — who hired him and Wells as an opening act on their 1970 European tour — was his father, and he wasn't sure; to him, his dad was just George. At a block party in the Eighties, Greg remembers hearing loud music blasting out of a speaker and, without knowing what it was, decided to put an end to it. “I took the record off the turntable and threw it,” he says. “I didn't want to hear it.” It turned out to be one of his father's albums. Greg wanted to listen to Prince instead.


	In a rec room at Guy's house, the mementos of his success are on display. Besides his many awards — including eight Grammys and a National Medal of Arts — there's a sign proclaiming part of Highway 418 in Louisiana “Buddy Guy Way”; a thank-you letter Jagger wrote after Guy joined the Stones in New York in 2006 for the filming of the Shine a Light film (“It was so much fun & I can't wait to see the film”); photos of Guy jamming onstage with Clapton, John Mayer, Susan Tedeschi, and others. A sculpture of a nude woman is mounted on the wall in a nearby bathroom.


	A painting of Stevie Ray Vaughan takes up ample space on one wall. In August 1990, Guy, Vaughan, Clapton, and others jammed together at Alpine Valley in Wisconsin, then started to make their way out of the venue. Guy says he took a seat on a chopper meant for Vaughan, who would grab a later flight. “When my chopper come out,” Guy says, recalling the dense fog of the night, “I said, ‘Thank God we got out of there,' because Stevie, Eric, and all of them wanted me to come cook for them the next day.” The following morning, Guy was heading out the door to buy gumbo ingredients when his wife told him there was a call from Vaughan's people: The guitarist had been killed when his helicopter crashed into a ski slope. “Man, I couldn't even …” Guy says, somberly. “I just sit back down. I couldn't even move.”


	Ironically, that period would also mark the beginning of Guy's resurrection. With American roots music back in vogue in the late Eighties — thanks in part to Vaughan, as well as artists like Robert Cray and Los Lobos — Guy finally landed a major record deal, this time with the British label Silvertone. His first album for it, 1991's Damn Right, I've Got the Blues, featuring cameos by Beck, Clapton, and Mark Knopfler, became the then-55-year-old's belated breakthrough, selling half a million copies and garnering him his first Grammy (in the Contemporary Blues category). His daughter Shawnna, who didn't realize her father was a “superhero” until she saw him in concert and watched the reactions to his manic stage act, noticed a change in status. “We moved from a one-car garage to a three-car garage that was the size of the house,” she recalls. “We used to have a Toyota and a van. Then in a flash, we had a Ferrari, a Rolls-Royce, and a Land Cruiser. I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, Daddy, you did it.'”

	











	By then, another generation of blues players were discovering Guy — and his sly charms — for themselves. When she met Guy in the Nineties, Tedeschi was impressed with his musicianship: “His guitar tone was outrageous,” she says. “He could play anything. He was so wonderful to watch.” But she also encountered the seductive side of the tall, strapping musician with the head of curly hair. “He was real cute, and actually was real flirty with me one time,” she says. “Years later, he's like, ‘I knew I should have asked you out.' Then I was like, ‘Yeah, you should have, you would have had a chance back then!'” Guy's reputation as a ladies' man extended even further back: In the Sixties, Marshall Chess asked Guy for one of those mystical mojo concoctions that could supposedly attract women, and Chess recalls Guy giving him a “little pink cloth pouch, hand-stitched, stuffed with weird stuff like pig bristles.”


	After the Checkerboard Lounge, Guy opened Buddy Guy's Legends, which moved from its first location to its current one in 2010. Since January can be a slow month for business at his club, Guy began playing residencies at the beginning of every year. His newfound status was apparent in the fans tailgating outside the club — sometimes in subzero temperatures — to nab a seat to see their hero. The sidewalk outside Legends would be jammed with barbecue and fish cookouts. “There were two guys from Tennessee who were actual moonshiners and made 180-proof liquor,” recalls Mike Illingworth, the so-called Guy superfan and unofficial assistant. But the cold nights outside were, for Illingworth, tolerable. “There are lots of good players coming up, but not on the level of Muddy, Wolf, and Buddy,” he says. “Gary Clark Jr. is a great player, and there are four or five like that. But there's a huge void after Buddy.”


	Guy may not have been creatively or artistically satisfied during his years at Chess Records, but by the time he started receiving recognition, he had gleaned vital lessons from the experience, especially about the way blues musicians of the time were often ripped off or given raw deals. “I knew what was going on,” he says grimly. “I shut my mouth and watched them get fucked over, 'scuse my language.… I always hung around with men 20 or 30 years older than me, because I figured I could learn something from them. I couldn't learn nothing from nobody my age because I knew what they knew.”

	











	When Coogler was talking with Guy about casting him as the older version of Sammie in Sinners — a nod to an uncle of Coogler's who is a big Guy fan — the director remembers Guy telling stories about visiting an older blues player, with eye-opening results. “He talked about going to one musician's house who, in his eyes, was super successful, and sitting down on a couch, and his butt went through to the spring,” Coogler says. “He realized in that moment of pain the unfairness of it, because that musician was still living in poverty.” Guy has worked hard to avoid that fate. He owns his own music publishing, and in 2005 trademarked his own name.


	Guy's life experiences also infuse the records. In order to write songs for Guy, Hambridge would speak with him about his life. One of the results, “Show Me the Money,” from 2008's Skin Deep, was rooted in Guy's history of being exploited. “Buddy told me that back in the day, sometimes [club owners] wouldn't pay,” says Hambridge, who recalls Guy telling him that he went onstage many nights thinking he should play so well that after the show, club owners would say to him, “I wasn't going to pay, but damn it, here's your money.”


	Indeed, a conversation with Guy is a guided tour through blues history. A question about Willie Dixon, the bassist, songwriter, and producer who lorded over the Chicago scene, brings a frown. “Willie Dixon got credit for a lot of things he did not do, man,” he says. “Chess was taking from him, and he was taking from the musicians.”


	But most of Guy's stories are told with the rueful smile of a man who knows his days of being underappreciated and underpaid are behind him. He does an uncanny impersonation of Hooker, stutter included, and loves to recall the time Hooker got into a fight with, of all things, a little person over some women. Or the time Guy was recruited by the State Department to play concerts in East Africa, including one in Uganda under thuggish soon-to-be dictator Idi Amin. Guy says he wasn't aware at the time of how murderous Amin could be. “I didn't know he was cutting their fingers and sucking their blood,” Guy recalls with a laugh. “I [should have been] afraid I played the wrong note!”


	Who does he miss the most? Guy pauses. “Well, I hate to pick one,” he says. “When I came to Chicago, B.B. King was hitting the strings on the gih-tar like nobody has ever done. But I can't separate who I would say. Muddy, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, T-Bone Walker, Lightnin' Hopkins. All them people like that. If I was to make a decision, I would say all of them.”

	











	As the morning crawls along, Guy is stoned. Actually, he's doing an imitation of getting high, recalling the days when he shared bills with the Grateful Dead and similar bands, along with the female fans who flocked to those acts' shows. “Everybody was like this,” he says, closing his eyes and dropping his head back as if he were royally baked. “I'm looking at all these good-looking women. I said [to the musicians], ‘Man, is y'all having a good time? It's a good time looking at that.' I didn't get 'em all. I didn't want 'em all. But I said, ‘I'd love to be looking at this with a straight mind instead of getting high and got my eyes closed.'”


	Guy's survival can be attributed to his business savvy, but also to his lifestyle. He says he would turn to a “little whiskey” because he was shy and the alcohol helped calm his nerves before he'd go onstage. He still sips cognac from time to time, as he did at Legends. But he believes in moderation. Whether he's in the studio or in other work situations, Guy often avoids food altogether. “My longevity is I don't overdo nothin',” he says. “I know how to quit eating when I'm full. If you eat too much, it's going to do something to you. I was brought up like that: When you got enough, you got enough. Wait until tomorrow. You notice I took a couple of drinks last night. But I never been pulled over for drunk driving, and I never run over nobody, because I know when to stop.”


	As Coogler saw for himself, Guy rarely stops. After a long day of production — and no meals — on the set of Sinners, it came time to film the live-performance footage seen at the movie's end, with Guy ripping it up with Ingram and Hambridge. Despite the late hour, Guy seemed recharged. “By the time we wrapped, he just got warmed up,” Coogler says. “He didn't want to stop performing.”


	When Guy himself will quit the road remains a matter of debate. A supposed farewell tour in 2024 was extended into last year, and may continue into this year.


	His family accepts the fact that he refuses to slow down. “We're like, ‘Oh, Dad, don't you want to sit down and enjoy the fruits of your labor?'” Shawnna says. “He says, ‘Is the bills gonna stop?' We say, ‘OK, point taken.' My dad is a country man. He comes from the South. He's a hardworking man, and those core values are instilled in him so deeply. On top of that, when you get to that age, you got to keep moving. Once you stop moving, then everything shuts down on you, and we don't want that to happen. We much rather see him up and smiling and laughing and loving what he's doing.”

	











	Still, Guy and his cohorts know his clock is ticking. “You better see him now,” says Illingworth, who has caught more than 1,000 Guy shows. “It's like watching Pelé's last game. It's now or never.” As he demonstrated at Legends, Guy can get around on his own, slowly but determinedly.


	But warning signs abound. Two years ago, he had to reschedule a string of shows for a medical condition, and at airports, his family has taken to making sure he can be transported around in a wheelchair. “He didn't like it at first,” says Greg Guy, a blues guitarist in his own right. “He told me, ‘What are you trying to say? I'm old?'” Guy begrudgingly admits he has a few more aches and pains these days. “I'm sore today, put on some more [muscle-soreness] patches, and tomorrow it might go away,” he says at his home after the Legends night.


	Then there's the more urgent issue of who will keep the blues going after he's out of the picture. Reflecting on the impact of Sinners, which is steeped in the Mississippi Delta blues of the Thirties, Guy says, “I feel it helps the blues a little bit, because there's a lot of blues in there and [people have tended to] treat the blues like it's a stepchild, especially if you're Black. My grandkids know about it, but what about your grandkids? What worries me most, the young person don't hear it anymore because they don't play it no more.”

	Ingram says he hasn't had any direct talks with Guy like the ones Buddy had from his predecessors, but he knows Guy thinks of him among his successors. “He's definitely mentioned me as one of the ones taking this genre on, and I've thanked him,” he says. Tedeschi says Guy has sat down with her and her husband, guitarist Derek Trucks, to talk about them keeping the music going after he's gone. “It's pretty heavy,” she says. “Those are very big shoes to fill.”


	As the early afternoon approaches, Guy announces he's going to retire — but in this case, just for his regular afternoon nap. His only concern is being awoken by robocalls and scam calls. Of the many hard-earned lessons he's communicated to his kin, Guy is particularly proud to pass on another: about those scam phone solicitations and the way they prey on people for their money. “I told my son, ‘Would they be trying to get your charge-card number?'” he says. “I told him what to tell them: ‘You want my charge card? [It's] F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.'” He laughs loudly and lustily. “When they call like that, they want something. Ain't nobody gonna give you nothin', man.”

Filming is now underway at the atmospheric Woodchester Park Mansion for the BBC's upcoming supernatural comedy The Reluctant Vampire, a fresh and playful adaptation of the beloved books by British comedy icon Eric Morecambe.

Woodchester Park Mansion is the perfect location for this spooky comedy, which is set in a timeless English village, where everything is picturesque, everything, that is, except for the vampires living in the castle on the hill who come out at night for a little drink of the locals.

The series is packed with a raft of stellar actors, including Stroud-based Charlie Cooper, BAFTA winner Lenny Rush, Joe Wilkinson, who recently featured in Celebrity Traitors, Billy Bailey and stand-up comedian Ross Noble.

The show follows Val, the “Reluctant Vampire”, who by day explores with fascination his newly discovered human side with the help of village girl Gertie (Ellie May Sheridan), but can never let his secret be known to the locals. Yet by night there's a coffin-load of expectations from his tradition obsessed vampire dad, Victor, (Tom Davis) his suspicious brother, Vernon, (Gabriel Nagy) and his doting mum Valeeta (Sian Clifford) who is the only one in the family who knows his true self. Val must navigate both worlds without letting his cover be staked.

Lenny Rush says: “How lucky am I to bring to life something from the mind of comedy legend Eric Morecambe? I just love Rob and Neil's interpretation, so many jokes and brilliant ideas. The flying might be a stretch but I'm game for anything!”

Jon Petrie, Director of Comedy, BBC says: “‘The Reluctant Vampire' is exactly the kind of distinctive comedy we're passionate about at the BBC. Rob and Neil Gibbons have brilliantly adapted Eric Morecambe's work into a sharp, character-driven sitcom that delivers both big laughs and genuine emotion. With the incredibly talented Lenny Rush in the lead role, we're confident this will become one of the standout comedies of the year.”

The Army's favorite psychological operation soldiers want you. The Army's 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne), the same group that put out the eerie recruitment video “Ghosts in the Machine” last year, released a new installment on social media this month. And it wants the viewer to know what psychological warfare is. 

See for yourself:

If it seems ominous, that's the point. This is the unit's idea of a recruitment video. The 4th Psychological Operations Group, based out of Fort Bragg, is focused on Military Information Support Operations (MISO), better known as psychological operations, or PSYOP. 

The unit has been putting out striking, montage-filled recruiting ads in recent years. A Department of Defense's Inspector General report last year found that the Army did not have enough PSYOP soldiers in its ranks to help fight an information war against peers such as Russia or China.

As with past recruitment videos, the new one touches on great counterintelligence ploys, Patton's “Ghost Army” from World War II, with video showing the inflatable decoy tanks used for it. “There is another force applied in combat that we generally don't think of as a weapon of war. That weapon is words. Words are weapons,” the voiceover intones. 

Along with old films of subterfuge and surrendering enemy armies, there's plenty of modern video, including drone footage of an eerie masked soldier waving. The unit once again brings in ghost imagery — drawing from Fleischer Studio's iconic ghosts from their Koko the Clown cartoons — but also works in quite a bit of obviously computer-generated imagery that looks just slightly off. The effect is an unsettling montage of footage where there's always something being toyed with. Maybe that's intentional, given the unit's entire mission and methodology. 

In fact, the whole final sections of the ad before “Join PSYOP” is a barrage of subliminal images, with quick frames showing Koko the Clown, snarling ghosts dressed up like modern soldiers, Internet memes including Pepe the Frog and more. “Anything we touch is a weapon,” a subtitle says near the end. 

Last year, after “Ghosts in the Machine” came out, a PSYOP reservist pointed out that the video is more a recruitment piece than an actual example of a psychological operation. This new one fits that same mold, although the imagery is rife with nods to subversion, subliminal messaging and other tools that are useful to psyops. 

The Army has been putting additional resources and attention towards information warfare, including standing up new units meant to counter digital campaigns from adversaries and conduct wider public affairs battles against disinformation, but the 4th Psychological Operations Group, set up more than five decades ago, is a hardened veteran of the information war.

When humans manage to cut enough emissions and eventually reduce global temperatures, new research shows the Southern Ocean could kick warming back into gear.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Consider your morning cup of coffee. Your kettle's heating element — or flame on a stove — warms up water that you infuse with beans and pour into a mug. Maybe you get busy and the cup of joe sits there for a while, releasing its heat into the atmosphere of the room, until it reaches equilibrium with the indoor temperature. In other words: It got cold.

Now consider that the expansive Southern Ocean, which wraps around Antarctica, could one day do much the same thing. Since the Industrial Revolution kicked off, humans have dialed up the kettle to its max, adding extraordinary amounts of heat into the atmosphere, more than 90 percent of which has been absorbed by the sea. (It's also taken up a quarter of our CO2 emissions.) Under climate change, the Southern Ocean has been storing warmth which, like your morning jolt, can't stay there forever, and will someday return to the atmosphere.

New modeling suggests that this ""burp"" of heat — the scientists called it that, by the way — could be abrupt. In a scenario where humanity eventually reduces its greenhouse gas emissions and then goes ""net negative,"" finding ways to remove those planet-warming pollutants from the atmosphere, global temperatures fall. But suddenly the Southern Ocean belches its accumulated heat, leading to a rate of planetary warming similar to what humanity is causing right now. And the thermal burping would continue for at least a century.

Put another way: According to this modeling, at least, humans figure out a way to reverse climate change, only to see the Southern Ocean essentially restart it. While there would be nothing our descendants could do to stop this — since the warming would be driven by already stored heat — the calculations are yet another urgent call to reduce that pollution as quickly and dramatically as possible.

This sudden eructation is not a sure thing, however — it's the prediction of a model. But it's a step toward understanding how the planet could respond as humans continue to manipulate the climate, both warming and cooling it. ""The question is: How will the climate system, and specifically the ocean, react to scenarios where we remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and when we have a net global cooling effect?"" said Svenja Frey, an oceanography PhD student at Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and coauthor of the paper.

The Southern Ocean may encircle the frozen continent of Antarctica, but it's very effective at storing heat: It alone holds around 80 percent of the warmth that's taken up by all the oceans. Some of this comes from currents that transport relatively toasty waters south, but also lots of upwelling in the Southern Ocean brings cold water to the surface to be warmed up.

The skies above the Southern Ocean are also somewhat less reflective than elsewhere around the globe. Cargo ships and industries in the Northern Hemisphere spew air pollution in the form of aerosols, which themselves bounce solar energy back into the cosmos and help brighten clouds, which reflect still more. That cooling phenomenon has vied, in a sense, with the warming that's come from the burning of fossil fuels. ""That competition hasn't been as prevalent over the Southern Hemisphere, because it's this slightly more pristine atmosphere,"" said Ric Williams, an ocean and climate scientist at the University of Liverpool, who studies the Southern Ocean but wasn't involved in the paper.

In the scenario the researchers modeled, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 increases by 1 percent every year until the total amount is double what the planet had before the Industrial Revolution. Then negative emissions technologies reduce the carbon concentration by 0.1 percent annually. (The study didn't look a specific techniques, but one option is direct air capture of CO2, though this remains expensive and limited in scale.) In response, the atmosphere, land, and oceans cool.

But something starts brewing in the Southern Ocean. Its surface becomes colder, but also saltier due to the formation of new sea ice: When sea water freezes, it rejects its salt, which is then absorbed into the surrounding waters and makes the surface layer heavier. ""At the same time, we have these warm, deeper waters,"" Frey said. ""At some point, the water column becomes unstable, and that's when we have the deep convection event.""

—96% of oceans worldwide experienced extreme heatwaves in 2023, new study finds

—Arctic Ocean methane 'switch' that helped drive rapid global warming discovered

In other words, a burp. It's just one way that our planet's extraordinarily complex and intertwining systems might respond to rising and falling emissions in the centuries ahead. ""There's very large uncertainty in the Earth system response to net-negative emissions — we don't understand that very well,"" said Simon Fraser University climate scientist Kirsten Zickfeld, who studies these dynamics but wasn't involved in the new paper. ""We may well encounter surprises along the way, as this paper shows.""

To be clear, in this scenario, removing atmospheric carbon significantly reduces global temperatures, even factoring in the burp. And the faster we move away from fossil fuels, the less CO2 we'll have to remove down the line. ""Doing negative emissions and reducing our carbon load in the atmosphere is a good thing,"" Williams said. ""I would just add that, rather than do negative emissions, it's better not to do the positive emissions in the first place.""

Astronomers using data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) have revealed that the initial ""breakout"" phase of a supernova is elongated, not perfectly spherical.

What it is: An artist's impression of the supernova explosion SN 2024ggi

Where it is: 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

When it was shared: Nov. 12, 2025

On April 10, 2024, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected first light from an explosion of a massive star with roughly 12 to 15 times the sun's mass. Just 26 hours later, astronomers pointed the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile at the supernova, as this early and brief window provided a rare opportunity to study the initial phase of a star's death.

The stunning image is an artist's interpretation, showcasing the supernova explosion as revealed by the VLT data. Thanks to some quick observations, astronomers were able to detect the explosion's shape during its earliest moments — a phase that would not have been seen if observed just one day later.

Known as SN 2024ggi, this supernova explosion took place in the galaxy NGC 3621, which is located approximately 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra. An image captured by the VLT on April 11, 2024 shows the location of this explosion within the galaxy.

A massive star maintains its near-perfect spherical shape due to a delicate balance between the inward pull of its own gravity, and the outward force of the nuclear fusion-powered radiation generated at its center. When this balance is lost, the star dies — gravity finally overpowers the pressure holding its core up, causing it to collapse under its own weight.

This collapse pulls all the outer layers inward. These outer layers then rebound and create a powerful shock wave that rips the star apart. Once the shock breaks through the star's surface, it releases a lot of energy, increasing the supernova's brightness dramatically. But how that shock forms and travels outward has long been one of the most debated fundamental questions.

There is a short-lived window, after the explosion has occurred but before it starts to interact with its surroundings, during which astronomers can catch a glimpse of its initial ""breakout"" shape. Using spectropolarimetry — a technique that sorts light by its wavelengths and reveals the direction in which the light waves vibrate — scientists with the VLT captured this shape for the first time.

Data from the VLT's FORS2 instrument, the only facility in the Southern Hemisphere that is capable of making such a measurement, showed that the first light from the exploding star wasn't emitted in all directions equally. Instead, the initial shock was stretched along one axis, like an olive — meaning the explosion wasn't perfectly spherical.

—Unprecedented radio view of the Milky Way took over 40,000 hours to construct

As the blast expanded, its light began to reveal the supernova's interaction with the gas surrounding the star. Around day 10, the hydrogen-rich outer layers of the star became visible, and these layers were found to be aligned with the same axis as the first-day shock. This means the core explosion had a stable, directional shape from the very beginning, suggesting an underlying mechanism that drives a consistent orientation.

Study of the unprecedented view has ruled out some of the current supernova models while supporting others, and provides new details about the catastrophic deaths of massive stars.

The study was published Nov. 12 in the journal Science Advances.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated.

Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the Washington-backed peace plan aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, at Witkoff's private gold club in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami.

After nearly two hours of talks, Witkoff emerged from the meeting room telling reporters that he evaluated the talks as ""positive,"" without elaborating further. The meeting will continue after a short break.

As the talks continue, a source with direct knowledge of the negotiation told CNN that the conversations were ""tough but very constructive."" The source added that the talks included discussion of some of ""the most sensitive issues"" surrounding a peace deal. ""So far so good,"" they concluded.

""I remain in constant contact with the President of Ukraine,"" Umerov said ahead of the meeting on X. ""We are working to secure real peace for Ukraine and reliable, long-term security guarantees. ""

The talks are built off the recent negotiations in Geneva, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European representatives worked to revise the original 28-point proposal — a plan that initially demanded sweeping concessions from Kyiv in line with Moscow's maximalist demands.

Talking to reporters ahead of the meeting, Rubio said the end goal is to secure a peace deal ""that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.""

Sitting across from Rubio, Umerov expressed gratitude to Trump and the American people for the 10-month effort to end Russia's invasion, adding he is ""looking forward to have a successful, productive meeting today.""

The talks come as Ukraine is grappling with one of the most explosive political crises in recent years, with President Volodymyr Zelensky's top advisor, Andriy Yermak, resigning amid a major corruption investigation.

Yermak, Zelensky's long-term ally and regarded as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine's history, was expected to lead the negotiations before announcing his resignation on Nov. 28.

Ukrainian negotiators also include Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia, Ambassador Olha Stefanishyna, Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov, and Deputy Head of Military Intelligence Vadym Skibitskyi.

Ukraine and the U.S. have not fully disclosed the revised peace agreement reached in Geneva, which is said to have eased some of the harshest conditions imposed on Kyiv, with some issues still to be ironed out in subsequent talks.

The Kremlin has confirmed receipt of the proposal agreed on in Geneva, while Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow early next week to continue negotiations with the Russian side.

An unnamed U.S. official told Axios that the White House aims to resolve two key outstanding issues with Ukraine: territory and security guarantees. Witkoff and Kushner reportedly hope to finalize discussions with the Ukrainian side before presenting the result to Putin on Dec. 2.

Witkoff, who was heavily involved in presenting the original peace plan, faced heightened scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House.

The Wall Street Journal further reported on Nov. 28 that Witkoff and Russian officials have been promoting a ""peace through business"" approach to diplomacy for months, hoping to entice Trump with lucrative mineral deals and investment partnerships in exchange for helping Russia's economy emerge from isolation.

Speaking before the talks in Florida, Zelensky noted that the ""American side is demonstrating a constructive approach, and in the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end.""

The Ukrainian president also held a phone calls with world leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb — who maintains a friendly relationship with Trump.

""We discussed the situation in diplomacy and share a common view on the key issues,"" Zelensky wrote on social media following his talks with von der Leyen. 

Kyiv has repeatedly called for increased international pressure on Moscow to force it to accept a ceasefire. Just hours before the talks began, Zelensky announced Ukraine is synchronizing its sanctions regime with Washington's sanctions targeting Russia's Lukoil and Rosneft energy giants.

Russia, meanwhile, continues to reject a ceasefire and presses its maximalist demands, including international recognition of its occupation of Ukrainian territories and the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas.

Ukrainian delegates began their meeting with U.S. officials in Florida on Nov. 30 to continue negotiations on the latest Washington-backed peace plan on ending the Russia-Ukraine war.



 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers leaked calls showing U.S.-Russia coordination on a controversial peace plan and reports on backlash to Reese Witherspoon's Moscow-set novel. 

According to Bloomberg's sources, Russia and India are expected to discuss the potential purchase of the fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft and the S-500 air defense system.

Nawrocki and Orban were set to meet a day after the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Hungary.

HUR and Ukrainian partisans orchestrated two explosions at a site where Chechen fighters fighting for Russia sold stolen diesel, the military intelligence agency claimed.

Markarova's advisory role will cover topics such as the ""business climate, enhancing our state's financial resilience, attracting investment, and planning reconstruction together with our strategic partners,"" Zelensky said.

The comments come as Zelensky grapples with one of the most politically turbulent moments of his presidency. 

While Ukraine will share its experience and innovations, Norway will provide a ""strong production base, as well as research and development cooperation with leading Norwegian institutions,"" Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported intercepting 104 of the 122 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles from occupied Crimea. 

The attack seriously damaged the mooring point two (SMP-2), prompting port authorities to halt all loading operations and order tankers out of the water area.

The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions.

A Russian drone attack killed a man and injured 19 people in the town of Vyshhorod in Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 30, local authorities reported.

Ukrainian officials will meet with Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Florida on Nov. 30. Zelensky said a final agreement could be ready ""in the coming days."" 

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, resigned from parliament after being accused of helping lure 17 South African men to fight for the Russian military in Ukraine, her party announced on Nov. 29.

Early on Hallowe'en morning, Kash Patel made a big announcement. “The FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack,” he said.

Except there was one problem: criminal charges had not yet been filed and local police were left in the dark.

Catching wind of their impending arrests, two alleged co-conspirators in the Islamic State-inspired plot to blow up a Michigan gay bar brought forward their getaway plans.

One suspect from New Jersey made it to Newark airport, where he planned to fly to Turkey to join IS, before he was detained by police, according to court documents.

The botched statement was not the first time the FBI director had jumped the gun.

In the frantic hours after Charlie Kirk's assassination, when a manhunt was under way, he falsely claimed that the suspected killer was in custody.

And in his latest gaffe, Mr Patel announced on Wednesday that he had “assembled the full force” of the bureau to find the suspect in the alleged shooting of two National Guards in Washington, DC, despite the fact that Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was already in custody.

The director has also been mired in scandal over his liberal use of private jets and Swat protection teams for his girlfriend.

Meanwhile, his re-orientation of the bureau to support the president's tough stance on immigration and decision to fire agents perceived as disloyal have stoked bitterness among the rank and file.

After rumours swirled that the president is lining up a replacement for the embattled agency director, the White House quickly shut them down, branding it “fake news”.

But that did little to assuage the rumours, and fears over the direction of the bureau under its current command have agents on edge.

One former special agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Telegraph: “The mood is miserable. Morale has never been lower among the workforce. There is a feeling that every line agent has a target on his or her back.”

A former podcaster who made his name railing against the Biden administration's “weaponisation” of the FBI, Mr Patel's one-of-the-guys approach has clashed with the straight-laced culture of the bureau.

Rather than the customary suit and tie, the director frequently shows up to press conferences in hoodies and hunting vests, colloquially refers to agents as “cops” and told podcaster Joe Rogan he found the job “effin wild”.

He is said to enjoy the trappings of the job, keeping a selection of luxury whiskey and cigars in his office and handing out personalised “challenge” coins to members of staff.

The medallions, traditionally used by US soldiers to symbolise units or commands, feature an image of the Marvel character the “Punisher”, which has become a symbol of distrust in the justice system, and the number nine. Mr Patel is the ninth agency director.

According to the NBC, Mr Patel has slashed his daily intelligence briefings to two a week and cancelled weekly calls with field office leaders.

An FBI spokesman said the meeting schedule had been slimmed down based on feedback from staff.

Mr Patel has also considered hiring UFC trainers to improve agents' martial arts and self-defence skills, sources told Reuters.

His social media presence has rankled some in the agency who would prefer he quietly get on with the job at hand.

“Staying ready for the mission,” read the caption to a recent photo of him jogging in sportswear alongside new recruits.

A lawsuit filed by three former agents who claimed that they were fired by Mr Patel as part of a “campaign of retribution” depicts the director and Dan Bongino, his top deputy and a former Right-wing influencer, as caricatures more invested in social media likes than running the country's flagship law enforcement agency.

Steve Jensen, whom Mr Patel had chosen to run the agency's Washington field office before firing him in August, said he worried Mr Bongino was spending more time “creating content for his social media pages” than on FBI investigations.

Tensions came to a head in September when Kirk was shot dead by a sniper during a talk at Utah Valley University.

Four hours after the attack, Mr Patel said the gunman had been arrested, only to admit an hour-and-a-half later that the man in question had been released.

The announcement sowed chaos during the early stages of the investigation and caused even Trump loyalists to question whether Mr Patel was up to the job.

“We would be wise to take a moment and ask whether Kash Patel has what it takes to get this done,” said Christopher Rufo, a prominent Republican commentator.

In its biggest test since Mr Patel was handed the reins of the bureau, the FBI failed to trace the alleged gunman over the course of a two-day manhunt, which only came to an end when suspect Tyler Robinson's father handed him in.

Mr Patel flew to Utah after the shooting, but instead of speaking up, he stood sheepishly to the side of a televised press conference as Spencer Cox, the state's governor, spoke to reporters.

Reports later emerged that Mr Patel described the manhunt as a “Mickey Mouse operation” and accused employees of keeping him out of the loop in an expletive-laden rant.

“That was strike one with an awful lot of the retired guys,” a former special agent told The Telegraph.

Addressing well-wishers at a cocktail party in February celebrating his successful Senate confirmation hearing, Mr Patel joked: “All the people in this room have private jets, and the only way I was gonna get mine was becoming the director of the FBI.”

The remarks have since come back to bite Mr Patel amid allegations of using taxpayer-funded jets for personal travel, including to see his country-singer girlfriend perform and for a golfing holiday with friends.

In October, Mr Patel took the FBI's private plane to Pennsylvania, where his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, was singing the national anthem at a freestyle wrestling event.

Two days later, he flew to San Angelo, Texas, where the Wall Street Journal reported that he visited a luxury hunting spot, Boondoggle Ranch, owned by a Republican donor friend.

The flights took place at the height of the government shutdown, when much of the FBI workforce was not getting paid.

They also came against a backdrop of Mr Patel endorsing a White House plan to slash the FBI's budget by around half a billion dollars, despite initially requesting additional funding.

Chief among his critics was Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent turned conservative podcaster, who accused the agency chief of using the jet to hang out with his “chick” during the shutdown.

Angered by the disclosures, Mr Patel fired a senior bureau official whom he blamed for not obscuring the plane's tracking number, the New York Times (NYT) reported.

The jaunt came on top of a trip to Scotland in late August, when Mr Patel reportedly flew on a government jet to Inverness for a getaway with friends at the Carnegie Club, a private golf resort.

During the trip, 24/7 security personnel known as “ravens” were tasked with guarding the plane, according to the NYT.

The FBI director's jet-setting lifestyle has fuelled allegations of hypocrisy, given he criticised Christopher Wray, his predecessor, for exactly the same reason.

“Maybe we ground that plane,” Mr Patel said. “Fifteen thousand dollars every time it takes off. Just a thought.”

Although the FBI director is legally obliged to travel on a government jet to have access to secure communications equipment, if taking a personal trip, they must reimburse the government for the cost of a commercial flight. Mr Patel has done so for each trip, a spokesman said.

He has taken only about a dozen personal trips since assuming the role in February and has taken steps to cut down on travel costs, a spokesman told WSJ.

Perceptions of Mr Patel criss-crossing the country on the taxpayer dime to see his girlfriend have not been helped by reports that he has also ordered Swat teams to protect her.

The specialised agents, trained to storm barricaded buildings and rescue hostages, were assigned to watch over Ms Wilkins during a performance in Atlanta this spring, the NYT reported.

However, seeing that the event was secure, they left, drawing the ire of Mr Patel, who grilled the team's commander for what he deemed a failure to communicate their movements.

The unusual security setup has raised eyebrows among Maga supporters. Grace Chong, a conservative commentator, questioned why Ms Wilkins was entitled to the perks when she was not Mr Patel's spouse.

Christopher O'Leary, a former marine and ex-FBI special agent, told the NYT that Mr Patel's use of tactical teams to protect his girlfriend is “indicative of his lack of leadership experience, judgment and humility”.

And following Kirk's killing in late September, agents from the Salt Lake City bureau who had worked long hours on the case were tasked with protecting Ms Wilkins at a Turning Point USA event amid concerns that she could be targeted.

A spokesman for the agency chief told the NYT: “Ms Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel.”

Having first entered the president's orbit in 2018, when, as a House staffer, he revealed that the FBI had targeted a former Trump campaign adviser, Mr Patel has since made it his mission to root out enemies of the president within the bureau, former agents said.

Since being sworn into office, he has fired at least 30 agents, including those who took the knee during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and one man who claims he was targeted after hanging a pride flag on his office wall.

Several others who worked on Operation Arctic Frost, the investigation that led to the president being indicted for attempting to overturn the 2020 election, have also been removed.

“You're darn right I fired those agents,” Mr Patel told Fox News.

Three former bureau officials have accused the director of “politicising the FBI” and claimed that they were fired for their “failure to demonstrate sufficient political loyalty”, according to a lawsuit.

The case – brought by Brian Driscoll Jr, Steven Jensen and Spencer Evans – accuses Mr Patel of failing to stand up for agents when faced with pressure from White House officials.

At the heart of the pressure campaign was Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, and Emil Bove, a former department of justice (DOJ) appointee and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, according to the lawsuit.

“Bove stated that he was receiving pressure from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to see ‘symmetrical action at the FBI as had been happening at DOJ',” it read.

“Bove made clear that he and Miller wanted to see personnel action like reassignment, removals and terminations at the FBI.”

The president has long held a grudge against the agency over its investigation into Russian connections to his 2016 election campaign, Operation Arctic Frost, and the raid it carried out on his Mar-a-Lago home in 2020 to search for classified documents.

Mr Driscoll earned cult status among staff for pushing back against Mr Bove's demands, which allegedly included drawing up a list of all the agents who worked on the Jan 6 investigation.

When challenged by Mr Driscoll, Mr Patel supposedly acknowledged that his own job “depended on the removal of the agents who worked on the cases against the president”, according to the court documents.

Heightening the atmosphere of suspicion, Mr Patel is said to have subjected senior FBI employees to polygraph tests in which they are asked if they have ever said anything negative about him, according to the NYT.

The firings have contributed to an exodus of top agents choosing to take early retirement, a former FBI agent said.

There is also concern among employees about Mr Patel's shifting of the bureau's priorities to focus on violent crime and immigration.

Nearly a quarter of all agents have been assigned to immigration enforcement, according to data obtained by the Democrats in October, which Mr Patel has said is part of letting “good cops be cops”.

A former agent said: “FBI agents are not cops. They're involved in complex investigations, not doing foot patrols.

“The bureau has an awful lot of critical missions that may be going unaddressed when manpower is being used for these efforts.”

Speculation has been rife that Mr Patel could be on the chopping block in the new year.

Mr Trump has allegedly complained in recent months about his bureau chief's handling of the Epstein files investigation, his haphazard media appearances and the perceived sluggishness with which he has carried out firings, according to the WSJ.

However, the two are now said to be on better terms and the White House dismissed claims that the president is lining up his successor as “completely made up”.

In pole position to replace Mr Patel is Andrew Bailey, a former Missouri attorney general who was appointed in October to serve as Mr Bongino's co-deputy.

“I think he was brought in with that specific task in mind, but because of all this misfiring on the behalf of Patel, there might be reevaluating and seeing him as a go-to guy for the top job,” a former agent said.

With the administration on the backfoot for the first time, a cabinet shake-up is rumoured to be in the offing.

If the president decides that heads must roll, Mr Patel may well be the first member of his cabinet to fall.

A White House spokesman said: “The president's top priority is that the FBI has all the tools and resources necessary to ensure the safety of the American people. The White House will continue to coordinate with all executive agencies and protect our national security.”

Mr Patel and the FBI were contacted for comment.

            A mass shooting at a child's birthday party inside a banquet hall in Stockton, California, left at least four people dead, 11 others wounded, and the suspected shooter remains at large, officials said.
    


            The violence in Stockton adds to a growing list of American communities whose everyday spaces – schools, shopping centers, bars and office buildings – have experienced gun violence.
    


            Children and adults were among those shot, according to Heather Brent, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office. Officials did not immediately release the conditions of those taken to area hospitals.
    


            “Early indications suggest this may have been a targeted incident,” Brent said at a news conference. “This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited,” she said.
    


            Those killed were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21, Brent said Sunday. Authorities have not released the names of the victims.
    


            The shooting occurred just before 6 p.m. in the northern part of the city, according to the sheriff's office. The banquet hall, which shares a parking lot with several businesses, including a Dairy Queen, was hosting a family celebration that investigators were told was a birthday party for a young child with 100 to 150 people in attendance, Brent said. Stockton is about 40 miles south of Sacramento.

            The suspected shooter fled and remains at large, Brent said. Officials are urging the public for help with information as detectives work to determine a possible motive. “Investigators are exploring all possibilities,” Brent said.
    


             The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation.
    


            “My heart goes out to the families of those killed, the injured, and the survivors,” said former Rep. Gabby Giffords, herself a survivor of gun violence and founder of the gun violence prevention organization GIFFORDS.
    


            “While we await for more information on the shooting, what is painfully obvious is that we need our federal leaders to act to stop gun violence.”
    


            There have been at least 380 mass shootings in the US so far this year – defined as when at least four people are shot, not including the shooter – according to the Gun Violence Archive.
    


            In January, a shooting at Martin's Super Market in Elkhart, Indiana, left two people dead and two police officers injured. In August, a man walked into the lobby of a Park Avenue skyscraper in New York City, killed a police officer, then opened fire on other innocent strangers. The next month in Colorado, a shooting at Evergreen High School left two students critically wounded after a fellow student allegedly opened fire during their third week of classes.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the shooting, according to his office. Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi said in a statement that the governor has “offered the full support of the state of California” to assist the community.
    


            “Tonight our city is facing a heartbreaking and painful situation,” Fugazi wrote. “Please keep the victims, their loved ones, and our first responders in your prayers.”

Travelers at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday on Sunday were finding hundreds of flights delayed and canceled in Chicago following a winter storm in the Great Lakes region, while a wintry mix of rain and snow developed in the Northeast.

In Wisconsin, utility crews worked to restore power to thousands of people while the airport in Des Moines, Iowa, reopened by midday on the critical travel day after a Delta Connection flight landing from Detroit slid off an icy runway. No injuries were reported, and passengers were transported to the terminal by bus.

Hundreds of churches in western Michigan told worshippers to stay home or watch services online. Up to 12 inches (about 30 centimeters) of snow has fallen since Saturday in areas close to Lake Michigan.

Over 250 flights into and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had been canceled by about 1 p.m. while over 900 had been delayed, according to the tracking site FlightAware. 

In Wisconsin, We Energies reported more than 6,000 power outages, with more than half in Milwaukee and South Milwaukee. Mark Paladino said on Facebook that he was shoveling snow Sunday when his apartment complex lost power in Fredonia. Others said power lines were sagging under heavy, wet snow. 

Elsewhere in Iowa, gusty winds Sunday were blowing snow back onto roads, extending hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said.

“We did have areas of Iowa and Illinois that saw over one foot of snow,” including 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Fort Dodge, Iowa, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison.




He said snow in the Great Lakes region was tapering off, but a new storm was heading to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with up to a foot of snow by Tuesday.

“It's going to be the first snowfall of the season for many of these areas, and it's going to be rather significant,” Orrison said. “The good news is that it does not look like the major cities at this point are going to be looking at any significant snowfall.”

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Auburn hired South Florida's Alex Golesh as its next coach on Sunday, counting on him to revitalize an offense that has ranked in the bottom half of the Southeastern Conference each of the last six years.

The 41-year-old Golesh, who was born in Russia and moved to the United State at age 7, is signing a six-year contract that averages more than $7 million annually to replace Hugh Freeze. Freeze was fired in early November after failing to fix Auburn's offensive issues in three seasons on the Plains. Freeze lost 12 of his last 15 SEC games.

Golesh went 23-15 in three seasons with the Bulls, a tenure that culminated with USF ranking second in the country in total offense (501.7 yards a game) and fourth in scoring (43 points a game).

“He has produced wins and record-setting results throughout his entire career, including over the last three seasons at USF,” Auburn athletic director John Cohen said. “Alex is known nationally for his player development prowess, ability to shape creative and explosive offenses, and his relentless approach to building winning programs.

“In our conversations, he showed the determination and edge that this program demands of its head coach.”

Golesh becomes Auburn's fourth football coach in seven seasons. The Tigers fired Gus Malzahn in 2020, Brysan Harsin in 2022 and now Freeze in 2025. Together, the school will end up paying $52.5 million in buyout fees.

Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll.

The Tigers owe Freeze $15.8 million, with no mitigation, from a six-year, $39 million deal he signed to replace Harsin in 2022. Freeze got the boot at 15-19 overall and 6-16 in the conference. The last five losses included more offensive woes.




Golesh could be the answer. His Bulls upset Boise State and Florida — both ranked — in September and lost road games at Memphis and Navy by three points each to miss out on the American Conference championship game and a potential berth in the College Football Playoff.

He previously worked as Josh Heupel's offensive coordinator at UCF (2020) and Tennessee (2021-22) before taking over at USF, and he implements an up-tempo style that can be taxing on defenses.

His offenses have consistently been among the nation's most productive and highest scoring, averaging more than 35 points and 450 yards during his time with the Bulls. USF ranks in the top 25 of 20 national statistical categories, including 11 offensive, seven defensive and two special teams statistics.

“Auburn Football is one of the proudest, most tradition-rich programs in all of college football and my family and I could not be more excited to join the Auburn Family,” Golesh said. “This will be a player-driven program, and no one will outwork our staff.

“Auburn has won, can win and will win championships. Let's get to work.”

Police confirmed multiple arrests Saturday after hundreds of anti-ICE agitators were caught on video throwing trash cans and debris at officers near a government building in New York City.

The incident happened during an ongoing crackdown on illegal immigrants in Chinatown, which has spurred protests in the area for more than a month.

Officers responded to Centre and Howard streets, near the U.S. General Service Administration building in Lower Manhattan, just before noon on a report of disorderly protesters, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) told Fox News Digital.

When police arrived, they found people blocking the street and exits at different locations, the NYPD said.

Video footage showed rioters pushing large potted plants in front of ICE vehicles, throwing trash at officers and screaming obscenities.

They were also spotted hurling trash cans and recycling bins and pushing barricades against officers.

Police said the protesters were told multiple times to disperse but did not comply.

Multiple people were taken into custody, according to the NYPD. The total number of arrests has not yet been released.

ICE Public Affairs Assistant Director Emily Covington told Fox News that the protest was coordinated on social media, and organizers called agitators to ICE's location in New York City.

""Individuals dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers including by blocking the parking garage,"" Covington wrote in a statement. ""When individuals broadcast the location of ICE, they are putting a target on the backs of officers.""

She added ICE officers are facing a 1,150% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats as they make lawful arrests of criminal illegal immigrants.

""We are grateful for the NYPD officers that responded to these violent agitators and stopped the lawlessness that ensued,"" Covington wrote. ""We will never apologize for enforcing the law and removing criminal illegal aliens including murderers, pedophiles, rapists, gang members, and terrorists from our communities. We won't let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins ‘Fox News Live' to break down President Donald Trump's warning that Venezuelan airspace is now closed as his cartel crackdown intensifies.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a sharp warning Saturday about President Donald Trump's posture toward Venezuela, accusing him of edging the U.S. ""closer and closer to another costly foreign war"" without congressional approval.

In a blistering statement, Schumer criticized Trump's recent escalation toward Venezuela and argued that the president had upended the Constitution.

""President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,"" Schumer stated. ""Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war — not the President — and Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela.""

The minority leader cautioned the president to avoid entering into another overseas conflict, writing that ""Americans are tired of endless foreign wars that cost the lives of countless American service members and drain precious resources.""

SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO HALT MILITARY ACTION, DRUG BOAT STRIKES IN THE CARIBBEAN

""This is not an America First policy,"" he added.

Schumer called for bipartisan pushback, urging his colleagues in Congress to ""come together to return the power to declare war back to the people.""

The New York Democrat's comments came after Trump wrote on Truth Social that Venezuela's airspace should be considered ""closed in its entirety.""

SENATORS LOOK TO BLOCK TRUMP FROM ENGAGING IN ‘HOSTILITIES' IN VENEZUELA

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a sharp warning on Nov. 29 regarding President Donald Trump's posture toward Venezuela, accusing him of edging the U.S. ""closer and closer to another costly foreign war."" (Reuters)

""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,"" he wrote.

That post came a week after the Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of a ""worsening security situation"" in the area.

While speaking to U.S. service members on Thanksgiving, Trump said the U.S. will ""very soon"" begin stopping suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers ""by land.""

""In recent weeks, you've been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many,"" Trump said. ""Of course, there aren't too many coming in by sea anymore. Have you probably noticed that?""

The president added that drug traffickers kill ""hundreds of thousands of people a year"" in the U.S. from the ""poisons"" they bring in.

Trump has not dismissed the idea of sending American troops into Venezuela, stating on Nov. 17 that he hasn't eliminated the possibility.

Asked whether he ruled out troop deployments, Trump responded, ""No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.""

On Friday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea.

""As we've said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,'"" Hegseth wrote on X. ""The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.""

Hegseth's statement followed reports from multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post and CNN, that claimed the U.S. military ordered a second strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean on Sept. 2 after the initial attack left two survivors.

""As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland,"" Hegseth added in his post.

House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., issued a joint statement Saturday reiterating that the committee is ""committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense's military operations in the Caribbean.""

""We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Despite a brief pandemic-induced recession, higher inflation and rising borrowing costs since 2020, the wealthy have gotten considerably wealthier.

The threshold to be in the top 10% of U.S. households by net worth grew from about $1.3 million to roughly $1.8 million over the last five years, largely due to rising stock and home values, according to a recent Visa analysis of 2024 U.S. Census Bureau survey data. That figure reflects the value of what households own — homes, vehicles, savings, retirement accounts, investments and other assets — minus any debts.

In absolute terms, households already in the top 10% by net worth saw their wealth grow more than any other cohort over the last five years, according to the Federal Reserve's distribution of wealth data.

The income needed to be in the top 10% also increased, climbing from about $170,000 to roughly $210,000 over the same period, Visa's analysis shows. For comparison, the U.S. median income is $83,730 as of 2024, per U.S Census Bureau data.

Visa defines ""affluent"" households as those who either earn at least $210,000 or have a net worth of about $1.8 million, a level that places them above 90% of U.S. households.

About 12.2 million U.S. households qualify under that definition, and Gen X makes up 57% of them, compared with 12% for boomers, the analysis shows. Millennials and Gen Z together account for the remaining 31%.

It may not be surprising that Gen X leads the affluent group, given they're in their peak earning years, while many boomers are retired.

The last five years were unusually good for households that already owned a home or had money in the market. Even through the Covid-19 pandemic and a spike in inflation, the job market stayed strong and consumers kept spending, which kept the economy on solid footing.

Home prices surged beginning in 2020 on tight supply and cheaper mortgage rates, which stayed near historic lows until the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in 2022, the first increase since December 2018.

Major stock indexes also rebounded quickly from the early 2020 crash and went on to hit new highs, buoyed by a massive federal stimulus and a fast economic recovery, as measured by gross domestic product.

Those trends pushed wealth up much faster than incomes. Paychecks rose, but at roughly half the pace. Between 2020 and 2024, the threshold for the top 10% of net worth grew about 40%, compared with about 23% for income, according to Visa's analysis.

Broader indicators tell the same story: the U.S. median home price rose about 25% over the last five years, per U.S. Census data, and the S&P 500 gained roughly 109%.

Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.

As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.

Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:

Before your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.

Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.

Before asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: ""You matter more than the morning rush.""

This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.

Integrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.

These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.

Even in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.

Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.

Before diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: ""How's your heart this morning?"" or ""What's one thing you're looking forward to today?""

These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.

A morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.

Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.

Make mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.

This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 

Children live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.

When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child's natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.

Instead of rushing out with a quick ""Let's go,"" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.

Then add a ""connection bridge,"" or something to look forward to later: ""I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,"" or ""Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.""

Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) Stock: New CEO, Dividend and 3% of Ethereum Supply After 80% Crash","https://ts2.tech/en/bitmine-immersion-technologies-bmnr-stock-new-ceo-dividend-and-3-of-ethereum-supply-after-80-crash/","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 03:49:55 GMT","

BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) has become one of 2025's wildest stories on Wall Street: a former bitcoin miner that morphed into a massive Ethereum treasury vehicle, briefly rocketed 3,000% in a week, attracted billionaire backers – and then crashed more than 80% from its summer peak. [1]

As of the close on Friday, November 28, 2025, BMNR stock changed hands at $33.12, up around 4% on the day, after yet another burst of Ethereum buying and a flurry of November headlines that included record earnings, the company's first dividend, and a new CEO. TS2 Tech

This article summarizes the key developments in BitMine Immersion Technologies stock as of November 30, 2025, and explains why the name is now central to the debate over so‑called “digital-asset treasury” companies. It is for information only and does not constitute investment advice.

BitMine remains one of the most actively traded and volatile crypto‑linked equities in the U.S.

A weekend wrap‑up from TechStock² notes that despite Friday's bounce, BMNR shares are still down about 46% over the last 30 days, even after a gain of more than 300% over the past year. TS2 Tech

Put simply, BMNR has traded less like a typical tech stock and more like a leveraged options bet on Ethereum, with wide intraday swings and rapid shifts in sentiment whenever crypto markets move.

BitMine's current profile is the result of a dramatic pivot in 2025.

By August, BitMine had already become one of the world's largest disclosed corporate holders of ether. An August analysis from Investopedia highlighted that the company held over 833,000 ETH at that point and openly aimed to acquire up to 5% of the entire ETH supply – a goal management branded the “Alchemy of 5%.” [6]

Since then, the numbers have grown far larger.

The most important data point for BMNR today is what sits behind the ticker on BitMine's balance sheet.

In a November 24 press release, the company reported that as of the evening of November 23 it held: [7]

In total, BitMine's self‑described “crypto + cash + ‘moonshots'” holdings amounted to roughly $11.2 billion. Management estimates that 3.63 million ETH represents about 3% of the Ethereum network's circulating supply, making BitMine the largest Ethereum treasury holder in the world and the second‑largest corporate crypto treasury overall, behind only Strategy's bitcoin stash. [8]

CoinDesk's coverage of the same announcement underscores how aggressive the buying has been: BitMine acquired 69,822 ETH (≈$195 million) in just one week, even as crypto prices and its own share price were falling. [9]

A subsequent on‑chain‑driven report from CoinGape adds that on November 28 BitMine purchased a further 14,618 ETH (≈$44.3 million) via a BitGo wallet. The site estimates BitMine now holds around 3.6 million ETH and pegs the firm's enterprise value near $12.2 billion versus crypto holdings of about $11.2 billion, implying a market‑to‑NAV multiple (mNAV) of roughly 1.08. [10]

The takeaway: BMNR functions less like a traditional operating business and more like a publicly‑traded Ethereum mega‑treasury with modest operating revenue attached.

Despite the brutal drawdown in the stock, BitMine's headline earnings numbers for fiscal 2025 (year ended August 31, 2025) were striking.

In a November 21 earnings release, the company reported: [11]

Data from StockAnalysis confirm those figures and show a trailing price‑to‑earnings ratio near 2.5x at recent prices – an unusually low multiple that mainly reflects the way unrealized gains and losses on the crypto portfolio flow through the income statement. [12]

Most of BitMine's reported earnings are mark‑to‑market swings in digital assets, not recurring cash flows from operations. That distinction is critical for investors trying to compare BMNR with more conventional tech or financial stocks.

Alongside earnings, BitMine declared its first annual dividend, a move it has promoted heavily in investor communications.

According to the earnings release and subsequent dividend notices: [13]

Management describes BitMine as the first large‑cap crypto company to declare an annual dividend, presenting the move as a signal of commitment to shareholder value even amid extreme volatility. [14]

In dollar terms, the yield is negligible at current prices, but for a sector dominated by growth‑and‑speculation narratives, the optics of a dividend‑paying Ethereum treasury vehicle are unusual and potentially important for attracting certain institutional investors.

To move beyond mere balance‑sheet speculation, BitMine is planning to monetize its ETH holdings via staking.

The company's 2025 earnings release introduced MAVAN – the “Made‑in‑America Validator Network” – a dedicated Ethereum staking infrastructure platform scheduled to launch in Q1 2026. [15]

Key points from BitMine's disclosures:

If fully implemented, MAVAN could transform BMNR from a pure mark‑to‑market proxy into a yield‑generating Ethereum platform, though the eventual impact on cash flows will depend on:

Amid the financial fireworks, BitMine has also undergone a leadership overhaul.

On November 14, 2025, the company announced that Chi Tsang had been appointed Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board, succeeding long‑time CEO Jonathan Bates. [18]

The same announcement added three independent directors: [19]

A profile on IQ.wiki and coverage by CoinDesk emphasize Tsang's background in traditional finance and venture capital: over 20 years of experience at firms including HSBC and Lehman Brothers, founder of venture fund m1720, and a venture capital lecturer at Fordham's Gabelli School of Business. [20]

The market reaction, however, was muted to negative. Coindesk and other outlets reported that BMNR traded lower on the day of the announcement amid a broader crypto sell‑off, highlighting how sentiment‑driven the stock remains. [21]

BitMine's aggressive Ethereum accumulation has required substantial external capital.

A September 22, 2025 SEC filing shows the company priced a $365.24 million registered direct offering at $70 per share, selling about 5.22 million shares alongside 10.4 million warrants with a strike price of $87.50. The offering price represented a 14% premium to the stock's prior close, and management indicated the proceeds would be used primarily to acquire more ETH. [22]

While raising equity at a premium is superficially shareholder‑friendly, the overall strategy has still been highly dilutive over the course of 2025, as multiple offerings increased the share count while the stock later fell far below those issue prices.

Analysts cited in a late‑November CCN deep‑dive argue that this “issue equity to buy crypto” model works only as long as the stock trades at a meaningful premium to the value of its underlying assets; once that premium collapses, new issuance erodes existing shareholder value and can contribute to severe drawdowns. [23]

The volatility in BMNR is not just about daily swings; it's about the shape of the entire 2025 arc.

By late November, though, the mood had reversed.

CCN estimates that BMNR has fallen roughly 81% from its peak, even as BitMine continued buying ETH and amassed roughly 3.63 million tokens (about 3% of supply). The article cites several factors behind the under‑performance versus ETH itself: [26]

CoinDesk's treasury update echoes this, noting that BMNR shares are down more than 80% from their July peak and that many digital‑asset treasuries now trade at or below the value of their underlying holdings. [27]

BitMine is part of a broader group of companies now referred to as digital‑asset treasury (DAT) firms – public companies that hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets and effectively trade as proxies for those tokens.

A late‑November Reuters report highlights that at least 15 bitcoin‑treasury companies are now trading below the net asset value of the tokens they hold, as crypto prices fell and risk appetite waned. [28]

The Financial Times has also described a broader “crypto treasury reckoning”, noting that the total market capitalization of such firms has plunged as some have been forced to sell tokens to fund share buybacks or service debt, reversing earlier accumulation strategies. [29]

BitMine is one of the few DATs still aggressively increasing its holdings instead of selling, which amplifies both the upside potential if ETH recovers and the downside risk if the digital‑asset bear market persists. [30]

Analyst coverage of BMNR is still relatively thin given its size, but it has grown rapidly in recent months.

Data aggregated by StockAnalysis and MarketBeat indicate that: [31]

At the same time, third‑party valuation platforms disagree on whether BMNR trades at a premium or discount to NAV, depending on how they treat unrealized losses, warrants, and non‑ETH assets. Some show the stock below book value, while others suggest it sits above their modelled fair value, reflecting just how polarizing the name has become. TS2 Tech+2Investing.com India+2

BMNR's volatility is being amplified by the rapid growth of derivative products linked to the stock.

According to StockAnalysis and associated press releases: [32]

These instruments don't change BitMine's fundamentals, but they do increase trading velocity and can magnify flows into and out of the stock around news or macro events, further contributing to its reputation as a high‑beta trading vehicle rather than a stable long‑term compounder.

Given the sheer complexity of BMNR's story, investors following the stock into December 2025 are paying attention to a few core themes:

BMNR remains tightly correlated with ETH, often moving more than the underlying coin on big up or down days. [33]

BitMine's strategy is explicitly to keep buying ETH, targeting 5% of total supply. [34]

Investors will be watching whether:

Each route has different implications for dilution and risk.

If MAVAN launches on time in Q1 2026 and successfully stakes a meaningful portion of BitMine's ETH at competitive yields, BMNR could start to look less like a one‑way bet on price and more like a yield‑plus‑upside vehicle. [35]

The key unknowns:

The entire DAT sector sits at the intersection of crypto regulation, interest‑rate expectations and ETF flows.

Recent coverage from Reuters and others notes that risk appetite in crypto has been dented by concerns over expensive tech valuations and uncertainty about U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, contributing to sharp drawdowns in bitcoin, ether and DAT shares. [36]

Any new rules affecting corporate crypto holdings, staking, or token accounting could materially change BMNR's risk‑reward profile.

As of November 30, 2025, BitMine Immersion Technologies stock sits at the crossroads of multiple powerful narratives:

For bullish Ethereum investors, BMNR offers a high‑octane, equity‑market way to gain exposure to ETH plus potential staking yield – but with added layers of corporate, financing and sentiment risk. For skeptics, it exemplifies the dangers of leveraged single‑asset strategies in a still‑maturing asset class.

If this widely touted growth driver peters out, it could spell big trouble.

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchains are likely to be one of the crypto sector's biggest growth drivers over the next five years or so. As more of those assets are managed or traded on blockchains, more value touches the networks in question, which supports the prices of their native tokens.

But recently, the giant bucket of real-world assets that use blockchains mostly as a glorified record-keeping system has started to shrink, even as the smaller bucket of assets that actually live and move on-chain is now barely inching forward after a big growth spurt over the last 12 months. The implications of this shift are significant for the chains most exposed to the RWA segment, specifically Ethereum (ETH +1.38%), Solana (SOL +2.09%), and XRP (XRP +0.05%).

It's worth being a bit more cautious about buying them than before. Here's what you need to know.

Image source: Getty Images.

Tokenization is the process of representing ownership of an asset as a crypto token on a blockchain, so that transfers and updates can be handled by the chain's rules instead of a pile of spreadsheets and databases. As an example, think of a tokenized U.S. Treasury bill or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) share. The token on the blockchain stands in for the physical piece of paper you could get from the bank or your broker if you asked for it, but the economic rights conferred by controlling the asset are the same whether they're represented as a physical item or as a digital entity.

In practice, there are two very different flavors of tokenized RWAs, and, as the entire field is still emerging, the nomenclature to describe them isn't entirely standardized just yet. With ""distributed"" assets, the token itself is meant to move around blockchain networks, plug into smart contracts, and be held directly in crypto wallets or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. With a distributed tokenized real-world asset, you could potentially do something like sell your car by transferring the token representing its ownership to someone else in exchange for cryptocurrency.

The other type is ""represented"" assets, which are tokenized assets where the blockchain is mostly used as a record-keeping system under the hood rather than as a way of moving the asset's value around. With represented assets, the assets themselves are still locked in a traditional custody stack that needs to be activated to actually transfer them or modify who owns them.

The problem is that the sum of represented RWA value across all networks is about $390.9 billion, down by roughly 2% in the last 30 days. Distributed RWA value is far smaller, at around $17.8 billion, and is also down by about 1% over the same span. For a segment that was one of 2025's favorite narratives, watching hundreds of billions of dollars in value parked in RWAs edge lower isn't great.

Ethereum is still the biggest home for tokenized assets by value, with distributed RWAs totaling $11.4 billion, down 8.3% from 30 days ago, and with another $272.8 million counted as represented RWAs, excluding its vast pool of stablecoins. While its RWA holder count climbed 13.7% in the same period, the sharp decline in distributed value is problematic because it means value is leaving the chain.

Solana, in contrast, has about $807.8 million in RWA value and it is all in the distributed category, with no represented value at all.  What's more, Solana's RWA pool grew by 14.4% in the last 30 days, so even as there's general weakness in the strength of inflows across the crypto sector, the network seems to be bucking the trend and continuing to grow its base of tokenized capital, which is a positive sign.

On the XRP Ledger (XRPL), there are about $394.6 million of RWAs, with roughly 34% distributed and 66% represented. And both of those categories are still growing, with on-chain distributed asset value climbing by 6.1% and represented value rising by 7.6%.

So it looks like Ethereum is the most likely to experience capital outflows due to the crypto sector's RWA growth leveling off. That means investors should probably be the most cautious about buying it if this trend continues or intensifies. And, if sector-level RWA outflows really start to pick up, be aware that neither Solana nor XRP will escape unscathed.

Even with the current outflows, investors should treat RWAs as one source of upside out of many others in play for these three coins. The cooling in RWAs is just a nudge to be more disciplined in evaluating trends affecting assets you're thinking of buying, so be sure to pay close attention before taking the plunge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","How Milk Mocha's $HUGS Token Combines NFTs, 60% APY Staking, and 1000x Promise at Just $0.0002","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/how-milk-mochas-hugs-token-combines-nfts-60-apy-staking-and-1000x-promise-at-just-00002","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Every crypto cycle starts with a quiet phase, the moment before attention builds, before social media buzz, and before prices move out of reach. That moment is here for Milk Mocha ($HUGS), a project positioned as the best presale crypto for those who recognize early potential.

Now live in Stage 1, $HUGS combines emotional branding, staking rewards, NFTs, and charitable giving into a single, community-driven project. The question isn't about when it will rise, but whether you'll already hold a position when it happens.

Stage 1 of the $HUGS presale is that rare calm before the growth phase begins. At just $0.0002 per token, this is the lowest possible entry price before weekly price hikes take effect. The presale has already surpassed $30K in early support. History shows that early stages often define future winners, and this setup directly rewards early conviction.

Each stage in this best presale crypto introduces rising token prices, burns leftover supply, and includes leaderboard rewards for top buyers. This deflationary model not only builds scarcity but also encourages steady competition within the community. The earlier participants act, the greater the reward potential. Once Stage 2 launches, prices rise, and that early 1000x potential starts to narrow for those who wait too long.

Most meme coins rely on jokes and viral trends. Milk Mocha ($HUGS) is different. It's backed by one of the internet's most loved bear duos, known globally for spreading kindness and joy through millions of followers. The project converts that emotional reach into a working on-chain ecosystem.

This isn't just another trend-driven token; it's a fandom-powered asset. Holders gain access to staking at 60% APY, limited NFTs, and future metaverse games, while also contributing to a charity pool controlled by the community. That mix of heart and utility positions $HUGS as one of the best presale crypto options for 2025. While others chase short-term hype, $HUGS builds lasting emotional and functional value, blending community warmth with structured growth potential.

Most tokens create hype through speculation, but $HUGS builds FOMO through purpose. Holders can stake their tokens at a fixed 60% APY, receive daily returns, and even auto-compound to grow faster. At the same time, staking lowers the active supply, helping to strengthen long-term token stability.

Inside the Milk Mocha ecosystem, both the NFT and mini-game systems drive active demand. NFTs, available only through $HUGS purchases, give access to exclusive digital items, merch discounts, and metaverse benefits. The mini-games use $HUGS as the main currency, where players spend tokens to play, and part of those tokens are burned to maintain a deflationary model. This steady loop of earning, using, and burning keeps $HUGS moving while maintaining scarcity, making it one of the most talked-about options among the best presale crypto projects this year.

While many meme coins only focus on quick gains, Milk Mocha Token ($HUGS) brings deeper meaning through its Charity Pool and HugVotes DAO. These features let holders vote on which global causes to support, such as clean water, food security, and education programs. Each donation is recorded on-chain, allowing full transparency and aligning the project with values of kindness and care.

This blend of finance and emotion makes $HUGS stand out in a market filled with speculation. It links purpose with growth, building both community and long-term potential. With its unique mix of charity and governance, it is emerging as one of the best presale crypto projects combining real-world impact and smart tokenomics.

Crypto often rewards those who act before the crowd. Right now, Milk Mocha's $HUGS token sits at that early point where emotional appeal meets financial design. Stage 1 is still open at $0.0002, offering one of the most appealing entry levels of 2025. The project brings together 60% APY staking, NFT collectibles, mini-games, and a transparent charity pool, creating a well-balanced ecosystem of purpose and growth.

Many overlook emotional IP-based projects until their value skyrockets. This time, it might be different. $HUGS shows that love, humor, and loyalty can translate into digital worth, making it one of the best presale crypto stories shaping up for 2025. This could be the right moment to understand how emotion and blockchain are starting to merge into something much bigger.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A backwards Bible map that changed the world","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251129044502.htm","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 14:03:13 GMT","

The first Bible to include a map of the Holy Land appeared in 1525, exactly 500 years ago. The map had a major flaw: it was printed the wrong way round, showing the Mediterranean to the East. Despite this error, a new Cambridge study explains that the map's appearance in print helped set in motion ideas about territory and borders that still influence thinking today.

""This is simultaneously one of publishing's greatest failures and triumphs,"" says Nathan MacDonald, Professor of the Interpretation of the Old Testament at the University of Cambridge.

""They printed the map backwards so the Mediterranean appears to the east of Palestine. People in Europe knew so little about this part of the world that no one in the workshop seems to have realized. But this map transformed the Bible forever and today most Bibles contain maps.""

How a Renaissance Map Reframed the Bible

In research published on November 29 in The Journal of Theological Studies, MacDonald argues that the map created by Lucas Cranach the Elder and printed in Zürich did more than update biblical layouts for the Renaissance. It also helped shape early thinking about territorial organization.

""It has been wrongly assumed that biblical maps followed an early modern instinct to create maps with clearly marked territorial divisions,"" MacDonald says. ""Actually, it was these maps of the Holy Land that led the revolution.

""As more and more people gained access to Bibles from the 17th century, these maps spread a sense of how the world ought to be organized and what their place within it was. This continues to be extremely influential.""

Rare Survivors of the 1525 Edition

Very few copies of Christopher Froschauer's 1525 Old Testament still exist. Trinity College Cambridge's Wren Library holds one of the remaining examples (see image).

Inside this edition, Cranach's map presents the stations of the wilderness wanderings and the division of the Promised Land into twelve tribal regions. These divisions were a distinctly Christian interpretation, expressing a claim to the sacred sites of both the Old and New Testaments. Cranach's work drew on medieval mapping traditions where Israel appeared as long, narrow strips of land, reflecting earlier reliance on the 1st century AD Jewish historian Josephus, who simplified conflicting biblical descriptions.

According to MacDonald, ""Joshua 13-19 doesn't offer an entirely coherent, consistent picture of what land and cities were occupied by the different tribes. There are several discrepancies. The map helped readers to make sense of things even if it wasn't geographically accurate.""

Mapping the Bible in the Swiss Reformation

A literal interpretation of scripture was especially important in the Swiss Reformation, which is why, MacDonald explains, ""It's no surprise that the first Bible map was published in Zürich.""

MacDonald, a Fellow of St John's College Cambridge, notes that as interest in literal readings increased, maps became a tool to show that biblical events unfolded in identifiable places and real time.

In a Reformation context where certain religious images were restricted, maps of the Holy Land became acceptable visual aids and took on devotional significance.

""When they cast their eyes over Cranach's map, pausing at Mount Carmel, Nazareth, the River Jordan and Jericho, people were taken on a virtual pilgrimage,"" MacDonald says. ""In their mind's eye, they traveled across the map, encountering the sacred story as they did so.""

A Turning Point in the Bible's Long Evolution

MacDonald argues that the addition of Cranach's map was a major milestone in the Bible's development and deserves more recognition. Other key moments include the shift from scrolls to bound books, the 13th century creation of the first portable one-volume Bible (The Paris Bible), the introduction of chapters and verses, new Reformation prefaces, and the 18th century recognition of prophetic writings as Hebrew poetry. ""The Bible has never been an unchanging book,"" MacDonald says. ""It is constantly transforming.""

How Biblical Maps Helped Create Modern Borders

In medieval maps, the tribal divisions of the Holy Land symbolized spiritual inheritance for Christians. By the late fifteenth century, however, the lines originally drawn in biblical maps began spreading into maps of the wider world. These lines came to represent political borders. At the same time, these new ideas about political authority were read back into biblical texts.

""Bible maps delineating the territories of the twelve tribes were powerful agents in the development and spread of these ideas,"" MacDonald says. ""A text that is not about political boundaries in a modern sense became an instance of God's ordering of the world according to nation-states.""

""Lines on maps started to symbolize the limits of political sovereignties rather than the boundless divine promises. This transformed the way that the Bible's descriptions of geographical space were understood.""

""Early modern notions of the nation were influenced by the Bible, but the interpretation of the sacred text was itself shaped by new political theories that emerged in the early modern period. The Bible was both the agent of change, and its object.""

Why These Ideas Still Matter

""For many people, the Bible remains an important guide to their basic beliefs about nation states and borders,"" MacDonald says. ""They regard these ideas as biblically authorized and therefore true and right in a fundamental way.""

MacDonald points to a recent US Customs and Border Protection recruitment film in which a border agent quotes Isaiah 6:8 -- 'Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ""Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?""' -- while flying above the US-Mexico border in a helicopter.

Professor MacDonald is concerned that many people continue to treat modern borders as if they were clearly defined in scripture. ""When I asked ChatGPT and Google Gemini whether borders are biblical, they both simply answered 'yes'. The reality is more complex,"" he says.

""We should be concerned when any group claims that their way of organizing society has a divine or religious underpinning because these often simplify and misrepresent ancient texts that are making different kinds of ideological claims in very different political contexts.""

Most people don't want to spend over $100 on a mouse for gaming, and the SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 makes you think you shouldn't even need to. The wired model is on sale for only $24, which is $15 off the retail price. You'll probably want the wireless version though, which is $45. That's still a huge discount over the standard wireless gaming mouse. And yet, it still comes with high-end performance and features, such as the 18K optical sensor. The main compromises are the fact that it runs on batteries and is a bit heavier than other mice, weighing 156 grams.—Luke Larsen

If I could thank Gen-Z for anything, it would be pimple patches. There used to be a time when zits meant pore-clogging makeup. Nowadays, if you have a pimple, slap a shiny yellow star on it. Call it the beautification of acne. Starface has triumphed in this industry, offering colorful star-shaped stickers that almost feel like an accessory. Do I color-coordinate with whatever outfit I'm wearing? Yes. Does that mean all my Starface stickers are black? Also, yes. But for $7 off, maybe I'll start wearing yellow. —Boutayna Chokrane

These patches sit well under makeup, are effective at drawing out gunk, and act as a protective barrier, so you're not tempted to pick at your skin.

Finland's weather is notoriously unfriendly; but even so, your food order might be delivered by a drone.

On a rainy day after Helsinki's annual Slush conference, Finnish entrepreneur Ville Leppälä took TechCrunch behind the scenes of a three-party partnership between Irish drone delivery company Manna, DoorDash-owned food delivery platform Wolt, and his own startup, Huuva.

Huuva, whose name means kitchen hood, raised a seed round led by General Catalyst in 2022 with the promise of bringing good food to the suburbs. While it branched out of its cloud kitchen origins, its business still relies heavily on delivery tech — now including drones.

“If available, we'll send your order with a drone.” That's how Wolt has been notifying customers ordering from Huuva's Niittari location in Espoo, which is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, but which Leppälä sees as particularly well suited for this concept.

While European suburbs aren't as sprawling as those in the United States, people who work, study, and live in places like Espoo still lack the variety of options they can find in the capital. Huuva lets them order popular items from partner restaurant brands — and drones help those orders arrive faster, Leppälä said.

Building upon Manna's track record of completing more than 50,000 deliveries in Dublin, operations in Finland started quickly once the appropriate permits were secured. After a pilot phase from February, the drones have been fully operational for the last two months in Espoo, where they depart from a launchpad that's shared with delivery-only grocery store Wolt Market.

For the end users, this means that they can order different food styles from Huuva's partner brands, and add some groceries, too — each drone can carry around 4.4 lb, and Manna can send two of them at once. 

This adds another layer of convenience, but also speed. Unlike drivers, drones won't get stuck in traffic at lunch time. According to Leppälä, this is key to making sure the food arrives fresh; and it doesn't hurt if unit economics are more sustainable for Huuva, too. 

Huuva's team estimates that regular deliveries currently cost €5-6 each (approximately $6-8), while drone deliveries could get down to €1 ($1.16). That's not accounting for the extra costs that Manna may be incurring from setting up its Finnish operations, although the weather wasn't as challenging as it might have been for a newcomer.

Coming from Ireland, Manna's drones were already thoroughly tested for wind and rain, in such quantities that snow also falls under the same umbrella. Icing does present an extra challenge, but according to local operations and maintenance lead Makar Nalimov, in those cases they'll just use other delivery methods, especially since using chemicals for de-icing is also out of the question when food is involved.

These fallback options highlight that Manna's drones are part of a fast-expanding range of last-mile delivery solutions. Wolt itself is already using sidewalk robots from Coco and Starship in Finland, and its parent company DoorDash even built its own, Dot, which started performing deliveries in Arizona earlier this year.

Amid rumors that DoorDash may be building its own drone delivery program, in addition to collaborating with Alphabet-owned Wing, direct partnerships could be beneficial to companies like Manna and Huuva. The food startup is considering an expansion to another Espoo location where Wolt Market would be out of the equation, which would make it possible for the launchpad to be close enough to the kitchen for deliveries to be handed over through a window.

In the current process, Manna's launchpad sits within a short distance; delivery workers on e-scooters pick up the orders from the kitchen in a heat bag, then carry it over to Manna's operators. Under maintenance lead Nalimov's supervision, they put the orders on a scale and balance the weight if needed before placing them into special bags approved by regulators.

Resistant bags are only one of many safety measures that Manna follows to comply with regulations and its own procedures. For instance, batteries are systematically swapped so that drones always fly with a full charge. According to Nalimov, there's also redundancy at all levels, plus preparedness for different incident scenarios — and a parachute as a last resort.

Although Manna has staff on the ground, Mission Control sits in Ireland. There, operators assess the LiDAR maps, review the planned flight itinerary and drop a pin for the drone to deliver within a short radius of the customer's location. If conditions aren't met, the order falls back to a courier. If approved, the drone captures an image of the landing spot for final human confirmation before lowering the package with biodegradable rope. 

This process has now become routine for Manna's local staff, which is getting busier. According to Nalimov, he and his team are now handling double-digit deliveries a day, and are confidently gearing up for their first operational winter in Finland. As for Huuva, it is now ready to double down on drone deliveries in Espoo, with one extra wish: being allowed to put its logo on those regulator-sanctioned bags.

The CAN traffic is unencrypted. It was pretty easy to MITM this module with a cheap arm Linux board and a can transceiver to enable writing a two way filter capable of blocking the traffic that didn't raise any DTCs (that I observed) and could be turned on/off by the user. I preferred this approach to complete disconnection of the module (which is noticeable via errors at the diagnostic port) or trying to faraday cage or disable the antennae on the TCU so it can't remotely send/receive. I can also turn off my module or completely remove it before I sell it.I fear the next version of Miata will be an encrypted CAN like most other cars have moved to and even with my expertise I won't be able to access the latest safety features from new cars without surrendering what little privacy I've been able to claw back.

I do know that the CFAA essentially gets interpreted to mean whatever the corpos want it to mean - it's basically an anti-witch law - so it's best to steer clear. And this goes double with with the current overtly pay-to-play regime. But just saying.(Awesome description btw! I really wish I'd find a buying guide for many makes/models of cars that detail how well they can be unshackled from digital authoritarianism. A Miata is not the type of vehicle I am in the market for (which is unfortunate, for several reasons))

TURN YOUR PHONE OFF. Your phone does more than track you - the Bluetooth and wifi beacon scanners are always running. When you come across another person, most phones track the intersection of your beacon with theirs making a new data point that compromises both individuals privacy.

All phones nowadays have bluetooth/wifi mac address randomization, so it's basically useless for tracking, not to mention google/apple conscripting every phone into a wardriving network will kill battery life. Moreover all this effort in avoiding being tracked doesn't really mean much when all cars have a very visible and unique identifier that's mandated by law (ie. license plate).

Falling back to an attitude of not needing automation and instrumentation is a cope, and often a poor cope at that. The problem isn't the dash warning lights of the past several decades, it's the built in corporate surveillance hardware of the past single decade (and the corresponding violation of user trust in favor of corporate control).

The automotive example shows how even ""non-tech"" products now collect and transmit data. Each service creates another attack surface, another set of credentials to manage, another potential breach vector.What's frustrating is that breach response still falls on individuals. When one of these services gets compromised, it's users who have to scramble to change passwords across potentially hundreds of connected accounts. The ""change your password"" advice is good but wildly impractical at scale.

As much fun and helpful as cannabis can be, every drug has its potential tradeoffs. Case in point, a study out this week finds that more Americans are coming down with a stomach-churning side effect of long-term use.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago examined emergency department visits from across the country. They found evidence that ER visits for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)—a condition characterized by constant, painful bouts of vomiting—have noticeably risen in the last several years, especially among younger adults. The researchers say that more doctors need to be aware of this debilitating, but ultimately treatable, health problem.

“Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is real, and it's becoming a more routine part of emergency medicine in the U.S.,” lead author James Swartz, a professor at UIC's Jane Addams College of Social Work, told Gizmodo.

People with CHS will experience cyclical periods of intense cramps, nausea, and vomiting. An acute episode can last one to two days, and the experience is often so intolerable that people will scream out in pain as they're vomiting—a phenomenon that's been given the charming nickname “scromiting.”

CHS typically happens in people who have been using cannabis chronically for at least several years. Scientists aren't sure why it develops, but it might be caused by the overstimulation of native cannabinoid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. It's thought to be a rare complication, but recent research has suggested that cases of CHS have been increasing in the U.S. and other places where cannabis legalization has expanded.

Can't Sleep Without Cannabis or Booze? You're Not Alone

In this latest study, the researchers analyzed data from a nationwide sample of ER visits in the U.S. between 2016 and 2022. Until recently, doctors couldn't diagnose CHS as a distinct medical condition for record-keeping and insurance purposes. So the researchers instead looked for diagnoses related to cyclical vomiting syndrome (severe, sudden vomiting that can't be explained by other known causes) and cannabis use; cases where both diagnoses were present were used as a proxy for CHS.

During the study period, roughly 100,000 cases of suspected CHS were documented. Prior to the covid-19 pandemic, they found, annual rates of CHS were steady. Starting in 2020, however, suspected cases of CHS seen in the ER surged. And though cases did decline in 2022, they were still above the pre-pandemic baseline. Importantly, cases of cannabis-related health problems in general also rose during that same period, while cases of cyclical vomiting syndrome without any cannabis link did not, further suggesting a real rise in CHS.

The team's findings were published Monday in JAMA Network Open.

Though this study can't directly answer why CHS is becoming more common, the timing of this surge indicates that covid-19 probably played a role. At the same time, ongoing factors like the growing legalization of cannabis in the U.S. and perhaps the increased amounts of THC in today's cannabis strains are also likely important, the researchers say.

“The COVID-19 pandemic likely catalyzed the rise in CHS through stress, isolation, and increased cannabis use,” the authors wrote. “After peaking in 2021, CHS incidence declined but plateaued above prepandemic levels, suggesting sustained structural or clinical drivers.”

CHS is a horrific experience, but it's one that we know how to effectively manage and treat.

For some reason, hot baths and showers can temporarily relieve an acute episode. The only way to truly keep it from happening, though, is to stop using cannabis altogether. It might take weeks, but the symptoms will eventually stop.

And while the rate of CHS may be climbing, it's still a relatively rare side effect, the authors say.

“Our findings shouldn't be interpreted as a reason to panic, but they do reinforce that cannabis is not risk-free, especially at higher doses and with long-term, heavy use,” Swartz said.

Cannabis Can Help Relieve Chronic Low Back Pain, Major Trial Finds

Earlier this year, CHS was officially added to the latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the codebook that's used worldwide for diagnostic and billing purposes. So it's now much easier for doctors to diagnose the condition and for researchers to track its prevalence. That said, doctors and hospitals will still need to know that CHS exists in order to make a timely diagnosis, the study authors say.

“Given frequent misdiagnosis and costly, unnecessary testing, greater clinical awareness is needed,” the authors wrote. They also argue that more research is needed to figure out the exact causes of CHS and why only some long-term users develop it.

Days like these, I'm glad that I only occasionally indulge in the sticky icky.

Thomas Müller knows exactly what it is like to face Lionel Messi with a trophy at stake — and he knows what it takes to win in those moments, too.

The 2025 MLS Cup final — Messi and Inter Miami vs. Müller and the Vancouver Whitecaps — is going to draw a few comparisons from a personnel standpoint to the 2014 World Cup final and 2010 World Cup quarterfinal matches between Argentina and Germany.

Germany, with Müller, won both times. Messi played in those matches for Argentina, as did Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano. They'll all meet again on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, with Müller surely knowing that facing Messi doesn't automatically mean a loss.

""It's not about Messi against Thomas Müller,"" he told reporters after Vancouver's 3-1 win over San Diego in the Western Conference final on Saturday night. ""It's Miami against the Whitecaps.""

Then he added, ""Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group.""

What Messi thinks of the matchup — he has gone head-to-head with Müller 10 times in various competitions, and his side has won only three of those — is a bit of mystery and likely may stay that way. Inter Miami rarely makes Messi available for interviews.

This much, however, is known: Messi came to Inter Miami midway through 2023 with the goal of winning an MLS Cup, something that seemed far-fetched at the time considering when he joined the club it was at the bottom of the league. A win on Saturday would fulfill his quest and would cap a season when Messi also won MLS' Golden Boot as the top scorer — plus, more than likely, a second consecutive league MVP award.

""Even though he's the best in history ... it's unfair to believe that he's going to win every game,"" Mascherano said after Inter Miami's 5-1 romp past New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final on Saturday night. ""Everybody has raised their level.""

The MLS final comes as part of a huge week for soccer in North America. The FIFA World Cup draw for next year's men's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is on Friday in Washington along with the initial awarding of that organization's peace prize. MLS, if past form holds, seems likely to announce its MVP award winner this week. 

It's not like either Messi or Müller needs a win on Saturday to get some sort of validation. Their résumés and legacies were secured long ago: Both are World Cup winners, Champions League winners and Club World Cup winners.

But like Messi, Müller came to MLS — he joined Vancouver four months ago — seeking a title in that league to add to the list. The chance has arrived.

""I enjoy watching him,"" Müller said in an on-field interview for Apple TV following Vancouver's win Saturday night. ""I have the feeling Miami's a very strong team. We saw them beating New York in quite a really strong manner. It's a big final. I wished for this final. And here we go. I think it's great for everyone.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool player ratings vs West Ham: Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz FINALLY turn up as Reds stop the rot while Mohamed Salah stews from the bench","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/liverpool-player-ratings-west-ham-alexander-isak-florian-wirtz-mohamed-salah/blt3d3be46e7bfd5992","Sun, 30 Nov 2025 16:00:05 GMT","

Mohamed Salah was left on the bench as much-maligned summer signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz helped Liverpool to a vital three points in Sunday's 2-0 win over West Ham. The Swedish forward scored his first Premier League goal for the club since his big-money switch to Anfield this summer, while the German provided the heartbeat for the Liverpool attack.

Reflective of their respective sluggish starts to the Premier League campaign, West Ham and Liverpool failed to set the London Stadium alight from the off. The hosts, set up by Nuno Espirito Santo to absorb pressure and attack on the break, were pinned back by the Reds who were unable to press home their dominance on the ball in the first half. Alphonse Areola did well to produce a fine stop from an Isak spectacular and cut out a dangerous Joe Gomez cross, but was otherwise untroubled by a blunt Reds attack in the opening exchanges.

Wirtz had impressed in the first half and looked most likely to make a difference for the Reds in the second period. On the hour mark, the German jinked to his left and, with the outside of his boot, threaded the ball through a compact Hammers defence to Cody Gakpo, who cut back to Isak to fire first-time into the bottom left corner.

The Reds continued to keep hold of the ball and stifle any West Ham attacks, and despite only holding onto a one-goal advantage, the Reds never looked like forfeiting maximum points, and did not even have to bring on Salah to strengthen their grip on the game. A ridiculous red card from Lucas Paqueta only snuffed out the chance of a possible Hammers recovery, before Gakpo fired home from a Gomez cross in the 92nd minute to seal a vital victory.

GOAL rates Liverpool's players from the London Stadium...

Alisson Becker (6/10):

The Brazilian had little to do, but will be pleased with his clean sheet.

Joe Gomez (7/10):

The England defender, playing on the right of the defence, had a strong performance and offered a real threat going forwards.

Ibrahima Konate (6/10):

A much-needed uneventful day for the Frenchman who bounced back from recent struggles to hold firm.

Virgil van Dijk (6/10):

A dominant presence in both boxes, the Dutchman helped lead the defence in the closing stages.

Milos Kerkez (6/10):

Still not quite at the level he showed at Bournemouth last season, but the left-back was solid for the Reds.

Ryan Gravenberch (7/10):

An understated, but impressive performance at the base of the Liverpool midfield as the visitors dominated.

Alexis Mac Allister (7/10):

Helped the Reds take the majority of possession and provided composure in the middle of the park.

Dominik Szoboszlai (7/10):

We have become accustomed to Szoboszlai's relentless running and he was everywhere in east London. A great help for Gomez down the right-flank too.

Florian Wirtz (8/10):

Arguably the German's best performance in a Liverpool shirt so far, he played a crucial role in the Reds opener.

Cody Gakpo (8/10):

Worked tirelessly for Slot's side and provided the all-important assist for Isak, before sealing the win late on.

Alexander Isak (7/10):

After some wayward finishing in the first-half, the Swede finally ended his 381-minute goal drought with a fine finish.

Hugo Ekitike(5/10):

Replaced Isak, but did not offer too much of a threat.

Curtis Jones (6/10):

Had demanded his team-mates raise their levels earlier in the week and they responded. A late cameo appearance in midfield.

Andy Robertson (N/A):

A late substitute to see out the win.

Arne Slot (6/10):

His decision to leave Salah on the bench proved successful and the Dutchman will be delighted with three points.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

Just 12 points separates Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in the title battle after the Red Bull driver's win in Qatar.

Max Verstappen claimed a crucial victory in the Qatar Grand Prix from Oscar Piastri, with the title battle set to go down to the final round as championship leader Lando Norris could only finish fourth.

Verstappen's unlikely win was courtesy of McLaren's alternative strategy which came as a consequence of an early Safety Car intervention and an enforced 25-lap maximum stint length on all Pirelli tyre sets.

The Red Bull driver jumped Norris on the run to the first turn from P3 on the grid and shadowed poleman Piastri in the opening laps before a clash between Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly at Turn 1 several laps later turned the race on its head.

While all drivers pitted for the first of two mandatory pit stops in the 57-lap race, both Piastri and Norris remained out on track, which ultimately put them behind Verstappen in the final order.

Piastri was able to comfortably rejoin in a net-P2 after his final pit stop having shown strong pace out front all race, but Norris was unable to clear the chasing Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli after his pit stop.

The Drivers' Championship leader passed Antonelli on the penultimate lap as the Mercedes driver ran wide, and means a 22-point margin ahead of the race has been reduced to just 12 points from Verstappen with Piastri 16 adrift ahead of the final race.

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS QATAR GRAND PRIX 2025

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season for Williams, having jumped Antonelli through the opening pit stop phase, while Antonelli ensured Mercedes moved closer to P2 in the Constructors' Championship with P5.

Behind Antonelli, Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls was on course for P6 before a left-front puncture three laps from the end, which promoted George Russell, the Mercedes driver having lost three positions on the opening lap.

The top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso, via a full 360-degree spin for the Aston Martin driver, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull).

Alex Albon (Williams) was P11 from Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine).

Esteban Ocon finished P15 as the Haas driver was handed a five-second penalty for a false start, finishing ahead of Gasly. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end.

Ollie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly.

As the lights went out Norris from P2 suffered the slightly worse start amongst the title challengers, allowing Verstappen to move ahead before the long-right of Turn 1 and slot in behind Piastri, who comfortably held the lead from pole.

The Australian had already broken DRS range by the end of the opening lap and put his head down as the gaps between the leading runners began to expand almost immediately, with following proving extremely difficult through the high-speed corners.

Further back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners.

Gasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre.

The German had passed Leclerc into Turn 1 in the opening laps and tried the outside line with Gasly shortly after, but the Sauber driver was left in the gravel on the exit with his right-rear tyre hanging off.

The left-front of the Alpine had made contact with the Sauber, the stewards investigating but taking no further action as Gasly resumed.

The incident brought out the Safety Car just inside the window which would allow drivers to run the remaining 50 laps with just the need for one more pit stop, with a 25-lap limit imposed for all sets of tyres by Pirelli.

Critically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders.

Ocon had also initially stayed out but was handed a five-second penalty for a false start and entered the pit lane after the majority of the field and rejoined at the back.

Racing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10.

The McLarens began to lap more than 1s a lap faster than the rest of the field, all of whom would be required to stop on Lap 32 to make the end on a two-stop strategy.

In turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6.

Norris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris.

Piastri soon caught the back of Antonelli and immediately dived up the inside at Turn 1 on the start of Lap 30, but Norris was unable to pass Antonelli at the same spot two laps later.

The McLarens found themselves back at the front as the the majority of the field made the pit lane a hive of activity on Lap 32, with Verstappen rejoining in P3 on the hard tyre but only 7.6 behind Piastri.

Norris ran wide at the high-speed right of Turn 14, running over the kerb and nearly spinning, asking his team over the radio to check for damage as he began to fall into the clutches of Verstappen.

Piastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind.

Piastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44.

Rejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead.

With Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi.

Sainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6.

The top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points.

The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees.

""This was an incredible race for us,"" said Verstappen. ""We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car. That was smart. Of course, I'm super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end. Incredible.

""I think [the pace] was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where it was a little bit tough. We still won the race and that was the most important thing.""

F1 will travel straight to Abu Dhabi for the final race of the season from December 5-7 where the 2025 Drivers' title will be decided. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action from the Yas Marina Circuit.

Russell confident Mercedes can clinch P2 in the Constructors' battle in Abu Dhabi

Tsunoda ready to help Verstappen ‘as much as possible' in Abu Dhabi title fight

On a tense opening lap at the Lusail International Circuit, Oscar Piastri clung onto the lead while Lando Norris lost a position.

Oscar Piastri confidently held onto the lead of the Qatar Grand Prix on the opening lap, while his McLaren team mate Lando Norris lost a position to title rival Max Verstappen.

The three frontrunners all seemed to execute a good launch at lights out, but the Red Bull driver's determination to pass Norris saw him improve to P2 as they reached Turn 1, demoting the Briton to third place on a day when he needs to win in order to seal the championship.

Norris unsuccessfully tried to come back at Verstappen, allowing Piastri to charge away from their battle and open up a gap over Verstappen. Just behind, the Mercedes of George Russell had a similarly poor start at the first corner as he dropped back three places to P7, promoting Kimi Antonelli to fourth.

While everyone in the top 10 bolted on the medium tyres for the first stint, Lewis Hamilton made the most of a set of the soft compound to surge from P17 to P13 as he sought to return to the points-paying positions.

Russell confident Mercedes can clinch P2 in the Constructors' battle in Abu Dhabi

Tsunoda ready to help Verstappen ‘as much as possible' in Abu Dhabi title fight

Oscar Piastri continued his superb run of form in Qatar as he claimed pole position to set the stage for a crucial Grand Prix.

In what could be an important moment for the championship, Oscar Piastri snatched pole position for the Qatar Grand Prix from Lando Norris, with fellow title contender Max Verstappen settling for third place.

A tense ending to Qualifying saw Norris abort his final attempt, allowing Piastri to charge to the top spot with a rapid time of 1m 19.387s, just over a tenth clear of his team mate. With Verstappen just behind, Norris' challenge of winning the race to secure the Drivers' Championship has been made that little bit harder.

Outside of the top three, the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli took P4 and P5 respectively, beating two impressive laps from Isack Hadjar and Carlos Sainz.

The Spaniard was involved in one of two unusual incidents that happened in quick succession during Q3 – Charles Leclerc suffered a massive spin, and Sainz was sent onto the track with a sticker on his right-rear tyre, which fell off onto the circuit. The session was temporarily halted to recover the debris, giving the drivers a brief pause before their final laps.

Leclerc's spin was just one part of a frustrating Qualifying for Ferrari as Lewis Hamilton was once again knocked out in P18, the same position he claimed in Friday's Sprint Qualifying.

Weekend Editor


	Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph is many credits removed from her once-nascent career — which began with breakout roles in Dolemite Is My Name and continued with Hulu‘s Only Murders in the Building — but there's one early project she keeps revisiting alongside co-star Zoë Kravitz: High Fidelity.


	When asked if she would ever want the series to return after its abrupt cancellation, Randolph told Rolling Stone: “Absolutely. We all feel the same way. Zoë and I talk about it all the time, like, ‘How can we figure this out?' Give it back to the people, but really give it back to us, because we just really love it.”

	She continued, noting the difficulty of revitalizing a project: “But it's a really tricky one, because you're trying to recapture lightning in a bottle. Sometimes you have to just let things be what it is organically and trust in the process to find the next thing.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2020 series offered a modernized, gender-swapped take on the John Cusack romantic comedy classic (starring Kravitz's mother, actress Lisa Bonet, and itself based on Nick Hornby's 1995 novel); it centers on Robyn “Rob” Brooks (Kravitz), a young music-obsessed record store owner in Brooklyn, as she reflects on the ups and downs of her previous failed relationships. Randolph starred as Cherise, an employee at Championship Vinyl and one of Rob's closest friends. 


	Though critic and audience reviews were overwhelmingly positive, the series was canceled on Hulu after one season. To make matters worse, the finale ended on a cliffhanger of sorts, with Rob choosing to be Jake Lacy's Clyde after being torn between him and Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Toward the closing moments of the show, Clyde said he believes there's only a dismal “9%” chance the relationship rekindling will work.


	Kravitz has often discussed her disappointment with the conclusion of the series, telling Elle earlier this year, “That's where I really learned about producing and editing and writing, and man, I'm sad. I keep on going back to Hulu and trying to get them to re-up it, but they won't. They're not interested.”

On December 4, the IndieWire Honors Winter 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for crafting some of the year's best films. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers.

The great Nina Hoss doesn't need to work herself up into crying onstage or onscreen if the moment is right and she's really feeling it.

 










Earlier this year, in spring 2025, the Berlin Silver Bear-winning actress (2007's “Yella”) starred onstage at St. Ann's Warehouse in Dumbo, New York City, as melancholy matriarch Lyubov Ranevskaya in Benedict Andrews' “The Cherry Orchard,” an adaptation of the Anton Chekhov classic. Seated two rows from the theater-in-the-round-style stage at St. Ann's, I observed Hoss actually weeping during a key emotional scene.

In her latest exquisite performance in a long career of them already, as Eileen Lovborg in writer/director Nia DaCosta's gender-swapped Henrik Ibsen adaptation “Hedda,” Hoss also lathers herself up into gamut-spanning stages of emotional distress. Whether wasted out of her mind after Hedda Gabler (Tessa Thompson) coaxes Hoss' imperious literature professor off the wagon, or a sobbing, heaving wreck of herself when the pages of her latest book go missing at a 1950s mansion party. It's another extraordinary, unmannered, and deeply felt performance from one of Europe's best working actors.

“It's slightly weird to talk about that because, in a way, I don't even think of [how to make myself cry]. When I put myself in this situation, in this moment, that's just what happens,” said Hoss, who will receive this year's Spotlight Award at the 2026 winter IndieWire Honors ceremony on Thursday, December 4. “I don't have another part of my brain going on to push me into creating tears, like a technique. Some [actors] can, when they go, ‘OK, I can cry like this,' I could potentially. But I don't see it as a competition in ‘can I cry on the spot or not?' I need the situation that the character's in to put myself into that moment, and then that's what happens. That happened every show [of ‘The Cherry Orchard'] because I find it genuinely sad in that moment.”

 










Hoss, who starred as Cate Blanchett's watchful partner in “TÁR” and on TV's “Homeland” for three seasons, is best known for her alchemical collaborations with director Christian Petzold across six films: There was “Yella,” but also “Barbara,” “Phoenix,” and more, though Hoss has not worked with the director since 2014's devastating post-World War II drama “Phoenix,” where she played a Hitchcockian Auschwitz survivor whose husband does not recognize her after facial reconstructive surgery. And the story of how Petzold discovered Hoss for his 2001 film “Something to Remind Me” is Hitchcockian in itself, much the way Hitch discovered Tippi Hedren in a TV commercial for diet soda.

This was after Hoss broke out in the 1996 period drama “A Girl Called Rosemary.”

“I was aware… that I could be put into a certain kind of drawer when I did my first big role, which was huge in Germany. Eight million people saw it, and that was the part of a prostitute, a woman who really existed,” Hoss said. “It was a criminal story, and I looked a bit like Marilyn Monroe, so you could think, ‘Oh, my God, she's the new sex-bomb blonde thing.' Luckily enough, you have to go on talk shows to promote the film. Obviously, I said things that didn't sound too dumb, and that's why Christian Petzold saw one of these talk shows and said, ‘Oh, she's completely different from what I thought she would be.' We met, and we worked on six films together after that. That hindered me [from] falling into that kind of trap, or having to work myself out of that perception [as a sex symbol].”

 










“Then it was over with being a sex bomb — when I started working with Christian,” Hoss laughed. “There was one headline that I actually thought was amazing. It was like, ‘The pin-up girl for intellectuals.'”

In “Hedda,” Hoss plays a role originally written for a man, flipped for the first time here into a bisexual woman who Thompson's disaffected and devious social climber once loved. Hoss had previously spent six years onstage in a German repertory theater production of “Hedda Gabler” in various roles, including as Hedda herself. “She's a destructive person, but she's not a psychopath,” Hoss said of Hedda.

“We have this repertoire system, which means I'm part of the ensemble, which I was for like 25 years,” Hoss said. “I played different characters each night. So I played Medea the evening before I play a comedy. After that, then I play Hedda, then I play Emilia Galotti. Sometimes, I had six plays running at the same time. That's how the repertoire system is in Germany. You get to revisit Hedda, sometimes after having a break of two weeks, or sometimes even a month. It's still fresh and new and vulnerable because you try to remember the text, and at the same time, you want to push yourself and find something new. Then, you grow older with the character … and there's always one moment [where] there's something that could be better. All of a sudden, it clicks, because you had an experience, and you say, ‘Oh, that's why she said that' or ‘I need to change that.' You have little revelations because you spend so much time with the character.”

 










Hoss shot “Hedda” in early 2024 in the United Kingdom, where she said playing Ibsen's Ejlert part as the female Eileen was “easy for me, in a way, because just by the fact that she's a woman, it made it so much more dangerous for Hedda, and I think that's what I was always looking for. While playing Hedda, I thought it would be so interesting — and I was never quite sure — it comes with the play that Ibsen wrote that these two men that Hedda is framed with [including her husband George] are not really on her level. Here with Eileen, there is someone on her level, and they meet eye to eye, and all of a sudden, Hedda is in danger because there is someone who really knows her, and knows how manipulative she is, and finds that exciting but is also aware of what she's capable of doing.”

Hoss ultimately had to confront her feelings about Ejlert circa her days on the stage by stepping into his very shoes for this gorgeously sinuous film: “That came somehow with just being a woman at the time because it's still [Ibsen's] text. I'm saying a man's words. There was no discrepancy. The fight is the same. Because of the patriarchal structure Eileen is under, that makes it so much more of an existential struggle for her than it is for Ejlert. That was just phenomenal to explore and work on.”

 










Something I always like to ask actors who play characters in various states of inebriation: What's the secret to playing a good, old-fashioned sloppy drunk? By the end of “Hedda,” Eileen is properly sauced despite showing up to her former protégé's party newly sober. Shooting out of order, Hoss had to teeter quite literally between different registers of sobriety and not.

“That was the main thing I always [asked] Nia, ‘So where am I now? What state am I in? How drunk is she?' At a certain point, I also thought there are some moments, like when you go into water, that sober you. If you have this existential moment that she knows she probably lost her manuscript, after that, you're not that drunk anymore. It's as if it flushes all the alcohol out of your system. These were the things I had to be very precise with, and then you just have to rein it in. It's such fun playing drunk, but it's not very interesting to watch,” she laughed. “It's always more interesting to see someone struggling, trying to keep it together, because that's what drunks do. They pretend they're not drunk.”

Hoss' character in “Tár” — Lydia's (Blanchett) partner but also the first violinist of the Berlin symphony — is more emotionally restricted and always watching. In “Hedda,” Hoss gets to unleash emotionally, though onscreen breakdowns never take a piece out of her the way they might other actors.

 










“I'm good at switching off because, at the end of the day, I experience it in this moment. I just try to live it in that moment, and then when it's over, it's over,” Hoss said. “You have to hold it at a certain energy level because you know you probably have to do it several times. So I know I can't relax, but I don't stay in it because I'm not living it then. Once the scene is over, I have a little break, and then I go back in, but I don't carry it. It's not intervening in my life.”

But, Hoss said, it depends what you're working on. “If it's continuously dark, like when I did ‘Medea,' that puts you into a slightly depressive mode. To motivate what she's doing, and what she's going through, to put her in that moment, is so dark and heavy that it's hard [not to] get into a bad mood about the world and life, everything, relationships. It does trickle into your life, the material you work on. But when we talk about Eileen, I go full in, and then I have to go out to regain some energy again. If I would stay in it the whole time, I would be completely depleted.”

The most potent moment in “Hedda,” for Hoss and the audience, is the scene in which Eileen arrives at Hedda's party, with Thompson affixed, Spike Lee-style, on a floating dolly as she's drawn amorously toward her former lover. Eileen stands there, domineeringly, in a position of power and seduction.

 










“I had no idea up until that moment, even though we had rehearsed. Tessa had always just walked up to me, which I found quite strong, also. So I thought, OK, that's what we're doing. Nia didn't talk to me about that,” Hoss said. “When I came down to the room and saw Tessa being strapped on this dolly, I said, ‘What are we doing? What's happening?' But then it just made so much sense, and I felt very appreciative that, in a way, my character and therefore also me, the actress inhabiting this character, gets this huge present of an entrance like that. I can't act that as the others have to do. This moment is there, where time stands still.”

”Hedda” is now streaming on Prime Video.

T
his past summer, when FKA Twigs stepped offstage after playing a giant festival in the Netherlands, the first thing on her mind was heading to a techno haven she'd heard had the best electronic music in the area. The British artist — known for her genre-bending sounds and gravity-defying dance moves — made her way there straight from her set, dressed in the same bright-red leather jacket and leather pants she'd worn while performing.


	“Onstage, it looked incredible, but when you leave the stage, I kind of look like a Power Ranger,” she remembers, laughing lightly. When she got to the club, the woman at the door was far from impressed. “She was like, ‘Have you been here before?' And I was like, ‘No,' in my Power Rangers outfit.” The doorwoman asked if Twigs knew who was DJ'ing that night — another no. “And she was like, ‘Well, you're going to have to stand to the side and read the club rules and memorize all the DJs.'” 


	Twigs did as she was told, and stood outside until the woman came back. “I got in, but it was funny because she looked at me, and she was like, ‘You've never been out before.' I wasn't going to do the whole, ‘I was just headlining this festival.' I was like, ‘I'll just take it on the chin and do the work.'”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's stories like that — about moments outside the club, the euphoria of the dance floor, the hours late in the night at the afterparty — that shape Eusexua, from January, and Eusexua Afterglow, which came out in November. Those two standout albums are a big reason Rolling Stone named Twigs one of our Voices of the Year for 2025. Together they mark an inventive new chapter in Twigs' decade-long career, which has already made her one of pop's most wildly imaginative stars, known for her futuristic vision and boundless imagination.

	











	But Twigs has also bared it all for fans throughout her career, speaking up about the traumas and tribulations she's gone through, and pouring her most vulnerable thoughts into her music while opening up about everything from complex sexual dynamics to dealing with racism to having fibroid surgery. Outside of music, she's also come forward about being in an abusive relationship, and had to manage herself after a “touring disaster” — her team at the time didn't secure visas and paperwork in time, leading her to cancel Coachella and reschedule multiple shows — that nearly derailed her career.

	Despite all of it, Twigs has had a breakthrough year, after a long time working her way to the top. During her Rolling Stone Interview, she opens up about her identity, her approach to vulnerability, and all she's had to overcome to get to where she is today. 


You just released Eusexua Afterglow, which is a continuation of your 2025 album Eusexua. What was it about this era of your music that made you think, “Okay, I'm not quite done. There are more stories to be told here?”I've always been curious about the type of artist that I am, because I'm always discovering that. In the beginning, I thought maybe I was a visual artist or a performance artist. It's been interesting for me, trying to fit my music into a traditional album release structure. It's something that I've always struggled with. After all of my projects, there has always been this burst of creativity afterwards.


	The majority of the [Afterglow] songs were brand new, so I'd say a good 80 to 85 percent I made in a two-month period. A couple of them were ideas I had for a long time. For example, “Wild and Alone,” I began to write that 10 years ago, and that actually leaked. I had this huge leaking disaster where I had 85 demos leak, and that was one of the ones that leaked. So, then I reimagined it, so it sounded different. When it was finished, I was like, “Oh, I think PinkPantheress would sound incredible on this”.

	“Stereo Boy” is from something that I started a few years ago, but everything else was in this incredible, six-week period of purging and inspiration and being very free and meeting some incredible new collaborators. I met this amazing artist producer and quite underground and respected techno DJ called Manni Dee, and we linked up through an artist friend of mine. Manni and I just went on this crazy music-making … it was just weeks and weeks of us being in the studio. I felt like we took over each other's lives for six weeks and started creating. It's all just been very natural. I'm just going with the flow.

	











Tell me a little bit about the experiences that inspired these songs, especially the club experience that's central to both Eusexua and Eusexua Afterglow.I have two sides of my personality. One side is I'm an absolute purist and very serious, and I take my craft very seriously and I like to practice. If I discover something, I want to pay homage to the roots of where it came, and I have to study and go deep into the very seed of the art. For me, that's Eusexua. I've always said it's not exactly a dance album. It's a love letter to the way that dance music makes me feel and is influenced heavily by dance music. It kind of has this crystal quality, and everything's very HD, and everything feels very, for me, present. 


	And then there's this other side of my personality which is like, “I will rile up a party, I will make everyone go out I'll make everyone stay out till the early hours of the morning.” Afterglow, it's about when you leave the club, and you don't want to go home. It starts with “Love Crimes,” and then it goes into this fun kind of sexy stage of the music. Like, “Whoa, I'm feeling fucked up now.” It's at that moment where you start questioning everything in your life, and people start leaving. You know, when you're just out and you're like, “I'm having such a good time,” and then you move rooms and you're just like, “Whoa, I shouldn't have left that room.” People join the room, and you're like, “Now the energy is changed,” or people leave the room, and you're like, “No, I need those people. I need to stay with these people. We have to stay together all night.” The second third of the record is that when you're reckoning with yourself, and it's wavy.


You've described Eusexua as “finding a euphoric space where you can transcend your physical human form.” Why was it important for you to do that?Because life can be so hard, and it can be so stressful. There's so much tension all the time. I really feel for young people growing up online and all of the pressures that holds. If someone said, “10 million pounds to go back to being 16!” I'd be like, “Absolutely not.” 


	I can't even imagine what that's like now for young people, just to have the pressure of creating this self online that is imprinted from when you're 12, 13, to then when you get your first job, and every political stance that you have, every idea that you had at 16, every person that you dated, every person that you were friends with, the way that you dressed, the ideas that you were starting to form as a young person, all of that is just tracked. And you can be ridiculed for it or torn apart or judged at any second. I have felt that pressure as well.

	











	When I think about Eusexua, it's about accepting yourself and accepting other people. It's about tolerance, and it's about presence, and it's about realizing that we're so much more than our vessels. We're these beautiful lights. I always talk about the light inside my chest. I'm not FKA Twigs. I'm not even Tahliah. I'm a tiny light inside my chest, which is filled with endless love and possibilities. I want to connect with other people as well. It's about realizing we're so much more than the pressure, so much more than our ideas of who we think we are. I'm not the first person to have this idea. It's just maybe the first time I believed it.


Eusexua was shortlisted for Mercury Prize and earned you a Grammy nomination. How do you feel about the reaction?It's been confusing at times. I don't know whether it's because Eusexua was maybe more popular than some of my other albums. At times, I saw stuff online, and I'd be like, “What? People don't like it?” And I think some of my fans, they can be hard on me, which I get. It's just part of the job that I have. But then it has been confusing because sometimes I've thought like, “Oh, maybe people don't like it,” and then I'll go and play a festival with 80,000 people, and they're all screaming the words back at me.


	Sometimes I just learn from my younger self. There's a song that I wrote called “Figure 8,” and it says, “Can you touch it? Is it real?” Sometimes the reaction you get to things, it doesn't really matter because you can't touch it. All you can go off is the intention that you had when you made it and the joy that it gives you in performing it or sharing it.


It has been hard to categorize you throughout your career. Do you feel like now people have started to understand your artistry?That's a difficult question, because I'm the center of it, so I can't see it. I've always said I want to do every single step. I feel for artists that have a huge hit, and all of a sudden they have to go and perform in front of huge crowds, and they don't have their sea legs yet. 


	When you're performing, you have to get your sea legs. And I did when I was younger, when I was the house singer at [London cabaret] the Box, which was raucous. I had people throwing drinks at me and screaming, and everyone is naked and running around. But I feel like it really made me very tough onstage. I actually love it when things go wrong onstage because I'm like, “Oh, how can I overcome this?”

	











When did you know that you wanted to be a performer? You started incredibly young.I've never really spoken about this, but I can't explain it. All the kids would do a dance competition, but in my imagination, I wasn't doing a dance competition. I did a character dance where I was Thumbelina. When I was onstage, I thought I was Thumbelina. In my mind, there were giant mushrooms and huge butterflies. If I was doing a dance step, it wouldn't be like, “Oh, you're doing a step-ball-change there.” It would be like, “You're going there because the grass is huge, and you need to push through it.” It was this quite magical moment where I got to create a world. [Starts to tear up.] It makes me emotional because I just want to be there all the time. That's what I want to do with my music: to create a world that people can dive into. That's all I ever want.


You danced in music videos for different artists, including Kylie Minogue. What do you remember about that time?I kind of loved it and I hated it, but I learned a lot, and it kind of got me set ready. Any dancer can relate, just the constant audition and casting circuit. One day, it will be, I don't know, like “Looking for four sexy girls that do Bollywood dancing,” and you're like, “Maybe.” And the next day, it will be, “Looking for classically trained dancers of this age,” and you're like, “Okay, yeah, I guess I'll try and do that.” As a dancer, was always trying to fit into something that was almost it. Because I was mixed race, I was assimilating into something that wasn't 100 percent what I was, but almost.


	I'd literally be in tube toilets, going into public bathrooms, for my next act. I was always felt slightly frustrated. But in the end, I carved out something quite special for myself, and I got to work with incredible directors very early on in my career, like Romain Gavras and Daniel Wolf. Romain Gavras cast me in this adidas advert, and Little Simz was in it as well. It was a few thousand pounds, and it was like a lifeline. I remember doing this dance audition and praying, “Please, God, if you give me this adidas advert, I'll just be the best person ever. I'll be so kind and generous and sweet.”


Do you have other favorite music videos or on-set experiences during that time?Kylie [Minogue] was fab. She didn't come to a lot of the rehearsals, and then she turned up the day before, so sweet, so present, such a little cutie. Just came in, and she was like, “OK, where have I got to stand? What's the move?” She's like, “OK, got it.” I was like, “We've been rehearsing for a week, and I barely have it.” And then we went and we did a run of it, and she did every single step perfect. Years later, I saw her at a party. I was like, “Oh, I was your back-end dancer.” She was like, “Oh, I know. I'm so proud.”

	











How did your songwriting evolve, particularly in how vulnerable it has been? On Magdalene, you talk about surgery and physical pain and things that are really raw. I just love telling the truth. I just have to tell the truth. When I was in my teens, I really struggled with who I was and where I was from and where I was brought up. I grew up in a very white area, and my upbringing was very, very confusing for me, just being a mixed-race person. I didn't know my biological dad until I was older, but I had a stepdad who raised me, who was Black. Everything, it made sense, but it didn't quite make sense.


	I found it very difficult because my family is from very working-class Birmingham, but then my mum really encouraged me with my education and pushed me to get into a private school in the Midlands in England. She would literally make me do practice tests every single day. I got into this really good private school, but I got in on a scholarship. And all the other kids, they had so much money. They were so privileged. We lived in a tiny flat, and my mum was on benefits, and we just didn't really have anything.


	I had this good education, and a lot of the emphasis was on talking properly and using your words and writing well. They instilled a lot of confidence in the students, which was amazing, but ultimately, for me, it wasn't real because I wasn't white and I wasn't middle or upper class. When I moved to London, it was confusing for me because then I'm a brown girl who's working class, who speaks well, who's had this amazing education, but now I'm at Croydon College. I would never want to say to my friends at Croydon College, “Oh, actually I got a scholarship to go to a private school in the country.” I'd never want to say, “I don't know my dad.” I'd never want to say, “We can't afford food this week.” My teens and my twenties were just very guarded with information in terms of me trying to fit in anywhere and then fitting in nowhere. So, by the time I got into my early twenties, and I started to discover alternative scenes, queer scenes.


Spaces where you could be yourself.Oh, my God, what a relief for me, where you meet other people that have had a similar upbringing, or look more similar to you, or think the same as you. And then, randomly, when I was about 23, I was riding with this cabbie. I was like, “Oh, what are you doing now?” He was like, “I'm going to a life-coaching seminar.” I'm like, “What's a life-coaching seminar?” He's like, “When someone talks to you about how to live your life and how to make your life better.” I was like, “OK, I'll go. Why not? I'm not doing anything.” It was incredible. This guy was talking, and he said, “Vulnerability is sexy.”

	











	It really changed my songwriting. I was like, “Oh, I can write about complicated sexual dynamics, or I can write about finding my sensuality in my early twenties on LP1, [the song] “Kicks” at 23, writing about masturbation or something. It became this thing of “What can I tell the truth about?” So, when it comes to Magdalene, I had fibroids, and I'd gone through this incredible amount of pain and operations and dealing with it. I was just like, “Yeah, apples, cherries, pain, that's where I'm at.”


As you've become more public, has that relationship to vulnerability changed at all? Do you ever find yourself not wanting to share things?I'm coming back around to it, but in some ways, yeah, because there are a lot of things that happened during Eusexua. I had an insane touring disaster, and it was hard because I think my fans thought that one thing was going on, but it was the opposite. With Eusexua, I experienced people thinking they know everything about me, but they don't. I made a decision at a certain point where I was like, “Do you know what? It's actually no one's business, and I'm just going to have to deal with this and put on my big-girl pants and suck it up and make this better.” I did, and I was so proud of the way that I was able to handle that situation and come back from the brink of destruction. 


That situation inspired you to take the reins and run your own career. What has that meant for you?If I had any advice to any artist, it would be to understand all of that stuff yourself from the beginning. Especially as a young woman of color. When I started out, there's this idea that, like, “Click your heels and do the thing and make everyone clap. Get a little slap on the ass as you go onstage.” You're just there doing this dance routine and not actually understanding that you have a monster, amazing business, that the world is your oyster, and what you can create yourself is limitless. And everyone's just making so much money off you.


	It's been amazing closing that gap. My stepdad has been amazing, because he worked in finance and he's explaining things and checking up and getting involved. With my boyfriend, as well. My partner has helped me feel really safe and understand things. I'm still learning. I have no idea what I'm doing. In my heart, I'm still that seven-year-old onstage, creating giant mushrooms in my head and skipping around in imaginary huge grass fields, but now the stakes are so high.

	











You also have film projects, like The Carpenter's Son, with Nicolas Cage. Any Nick Cage stories? When we were on set with Nick, I was talking to the makeup artist about going out. We were in Athens, and we were like, “I wonder if we can find a rave or something at the weekend to go to.” Nick, he's a cool guy. I wanted to talk to him more, but he's quite stoic, so I was like, “I'm just going to respect his space.” He was overhearing our conversation. He was like, “Are you girls going out?” I was like, “Yeah, we want to go out this weekend.” He was like, “You going to go and get the ya-yas out?” And I was like, “Get the ya-yas out?” Oh, my gosh, that's just stuck with me now. Whenever I'm out, I'm always like, “Going to go and get the ya-yas out.”


Did you convince him to go out at any point or to join the rave?Absolutely not. No, I think Nick has got the quickest de-rigging situation that I've ever seen. De-rigging is basically when you take off your costume. So we cut, and he is back with his family. It's inspiring. Nick really locks in before a scene. You really see him go into himself before a scene. He's on from when it's take one.


You got North West to rap in Japanese on Eusexua. How do you approach collaborations?In this interview, if you were like,“I played clarinet as a kid,” I'd be like, “Well, girl, let's go.” I'd be like, “What time should I pick you up?” I'll literally be thinking to myself, like, “Oh, I should have a child on this song,” and then, somehow, Kim [Kardashian] will message me out of the blue.


Is that how that happened, she messaged you out of the blue?To be honest with you, Ye actually helped set it up through a friend, in the beginning. And then Kim was very helpful and sweet and helped finish it all off. When we were on set, we were just cheering North on. In the video, it's one of the first times I really saw her let go a tiny bit. She's so cool, and she's so sweet, and she's so grounded, as well. She was very playful and sparkly, and I'd not seen that side of her. It's something so incredible about that age, from like 10 to 15, to be encouraged to do something that you love no matter who you are. I was grateful to have collaborated with her. It's also strange because I wrote that song when I was like 12, 13 as well.

You're going to play Coachella next year after you had to cancel the last time. What are you looking forward to, being able to have that second opportunity?It's going to be a crazy 10-day span because I perform at Coachella, which is obviously such a dream for any artist, and I'm going to perform with Martha Graham at their annual show. Then I'm going to fly back and do Coachella. It's two different sides of who I am, on one side playing Coachella and in L.A., and this incredible sort of hyped up magical, fun festival, and then coming to New York to a theater to celebrate 100 years of Martha Graham and perform one of their original pieces. Then back on the plane back to Coachella to go and complete the weekend. It's funny. I'm really curious about how I'm going to feel in that two weeks because, yeah, it's such an intersection of who I am.

	











What do you want to do next?I've been thinking a lot about operas. I'm really looking forward to getting older because I want to dance more, but as an older woman. I want to leave some of the more obvious sexualization that comes with being a woman in a certain age bracket behind. I'm really looking forward to having wrinkly skin and wearing a dress and flailing myself around.

The phone rang. I answered it. 

“Psychics-R-Us. This is Taliesin,” I said into the receiver. “How can I help you?” 

“This is Dwayne,” the man said. “I need to get rid of a curse.” 

“A curse?” I said, trying to buy a little time. I had no idea how to respond, but my minutes were down, and I needed to think of something. 

“Yeah,” Dwayne said, “this lady, she put a curse on me, and I gotta get rid of it.” 

I recalled reading a science magazine article about curses. 

“Research shows curses only work on people who believe in them,” I told him. “Don't believe in it, and everything'll be fine.” 

There was a long silence. 

“Yeah,” Dwayne said, sounding unconvinced, “I just need to know how to get rid of this curse, man.” 

***

It's true. I once worked for a psychic hotline in the late '80s. I'm not a psychic (I knew you were wondering), but that didn't matter. 

It was a paying job that didn't require me to expend any physical effort. I was tired of kitchen work. On my feet for eight hours, low pay, driving home late smelling like bleach and garlic. It sucked. I was done. 

I wrote for the college arts paper for a short time. That was much better than filling five-gallon buckets with sliced onions. I needed another job like that one, and my only other marketable skill was reading tarot cards. 

I remember being in bookstores as a kid and seeing the signs for the “occult” section. Something about that word always interested me, and I liked to look at the artwork in the books. The decks of tarot cards reminded me of Dungeons & Dragons. 

When I was older, the mother of a friend gave me a reading. Some of what she said made sense to me, and the whole thing appealed to the fantasy- and comic book-reading part of my brain. I was surprised to find that people said my readings were accurate. 

I didn't learn until later in life that this can be attributed to a psychological phenomenon called the Barnum effect. Vague language, which can apply to anybody, seems tailored to us when we are told that it is. There's a viral video that shows people reading and agreeing with astrology descriptions that they were told were for their sign but which were actually for a different one. They still found the descriptions accurate. 

As a 19-year-old, I didn't know about any of this. All I knew was that Psychics-R-Us was hiring. My friend Dave got a job there, and he said it paid well. The people who I'd been giving readings to for free said they found them helpful. I didn't see a problem with it. 

***

I put Dwayne on hold. 

I turned to Glenda, a more experienced psychic who sat next to me in The Golden Obelisk Room. It was an ordinary room in an office building with acoustic ceiling tile and fluorescent lights. There was a large poster on the door of a golden obelisk, though, covered in hieroglyphics. All the rooms had half-assed themes like this. 

“Do you know how to get rid of a curse?” I asked. 

“No,” she said. “I'd ask Oswyn.” 

That made sense. If there was anyone who'd know how to get rid of a curse, it would be our resident druid. 

I headed to The Sage Garden Room to find him. 

***

Psychics-R-Us was an information service. Information service phone numbers arrived in the U.S. in the 1980s. Phone companies billed their customers on behalf of the information service providers and kept a cut of the charges. Those customers were legally protected from losing phone service over nonpayment for these services if they otherwise paid their phone bills in a timely manner. 

I felt pretty good about this. No matter what, I wasn't the cause of anyone going broke. It seemed harmless. 

To get the job, I had to pass an audition by demonstrating my ability to talk to people convincingly about their problems. I gave an in-person reading to a Psychics-R-Us employee while the manager, Cassandra, observed. 

I failed the first audition. My lack of experience giving readings to strangers showed, and my performance wasn't credible. Cassandra told me to practice and return in a couple of weeks. 

I took her advice, and the second time I passed. I gave a reading to Sarah, another psychic who worked there, and we talked about her love life. It was the kind of conversation I'd have with any of my friends. I didn't think it was such a big deal, but that didn't stop Cassandra from fawning over me. 

She told me how blown away she was by the psychic abilities I had at such a young age. She couldn't imagine how powerful I'd become as I got older. I was going to be of great service to all the callers out there who needed my guidance and wisdom, most of whom wanted to know, “Does he love me?” 

Turns out “most” was a bit of an exaggeration. Most of the calls, by far, were lotto calls. 

Psychics-R-Us's ads portrayed lotto winners getting their winning numbers from psychics like me. The cost of the call was $4 per minute, but the first five minutes were free. Our goal was to convert free lotto calls into full-length readings. 

We were offered tips to maximize call times. “Sit in silence for a few moments with the caller to tune into their energy,” for example. We were also told to try cobbling together a reading by drawing tarot cards for the lotto numbers. 

Psychics-R-Us did its best to preempt any development of remorse by playing to our vanity. This meant lots of assurances that we were “incredibly powerful psychics” helping people in need. 

Cassandra held weekly meetings with us to go over our numbers. She emphasized there was a reason why those particular callers reached our phones. We needed to explore that psychic connection, to help solve the real problem driving them to call. 

Most callers just wanted numbers and would disconnect before five minutes passed, no matter what. But there were some who wanted to talk. In a country without universal health care, a psychic was the closest thing many of these callers had to a therapist. 

Callers with serious problems were directed elsewhere. Abused women were directed to women's shelters in their area. Suicidal people were directed to hotlines. There were binders in every room with these numbers. Fortunately, these calls were rare. 

Some of the calls could even be fun. 

One guy called because he was a professional who liked to smoke pot, and he wanted someone to tell him that was OK. I was happy to take 12 minutes to oblige. 

The funniest call I had was the elderly woman who called on a busy Sunday morning. 

“Are you really a psychic?” she demanded. 

I affirmed that I was. 

“Then I denounce you, and I denounce what you do, in Jesus's name,” she declaimed. 

“Ma'am, thank you,” I said, feigning contrition. “It really means a lot to hear that from you. I think my co-worker needs to hear this, too.” 

“Put him on,” she said. We got her to spend 20 minutes denouncing several of us in the room. 

We were expected to humor the callers provided they weren't pulling pranks, like the young woman who called wanting to know about her boyfriend. 

“I see the Death card,” I said, drawing from the deck. “Things may be going well now, but there could be an abrupt change soon.” 

“Well, you're wrong, 'cause I'm doing him right now!” she crowed as she hung up on me. 

Cassandra overheard my end of that call and asked me what happened. When I told her, she insisted I let her clean my aura. I tried to refuse, but she was implacable. 

She led me to her office. Long sheets of blue and aqua rayon draped the room, tucked under the ceiling tiles. A tabletop water fountain burbled. She had me stand in the center of the room, arms outstretched, eyes closed. I peeked from behind squinted eyelids. 

Cassandra vigorously pantomimed a wiping motion with her hands, a few inches from my body, breathing deeply, exerting great effort. I tried to stifle my laughter. After a few seconds of this, she said I could open my eyes. Beaming, she told me my aura was clean. She sent me back to the phones. 

***

Oswyn was finishing a call. I waited. 

A large man in his late 40s, he had a red beard, a round face and wore his jeans tucked into knee-high moccasins. His desk was decorated with dreamcatchers and wolf drawings. He had encyclopedic occult knowledge. He hung up the phone and turned to me. “What's up,” he asked. 

“I have a caller wanting to get rid of a curse,” I said. “Can you help him?” 

“Of course!” he exclaimed, bolting out of his chair. Oswyn was always happy to show off. I filled him in on the few details I had as he followed me back to my phone. 

***

The office park where Psychics-R-Us was located had seen better days. It was wedged between two interstate highways near a corridor of auto body shops and fast-food restaurants. The buildings needed paint jobs, and the parking lot needed repaving. 

Somehow I hadn't noticed on my audition days what a dump it was, but now I was an employee and nervous time was over. I arrived for my first day of work and the new hire orientation. I was sent to a conference room where the other newbies had gathered. I bought some Sun Chips from the vending machine. 

There were six of us scattered around the room munching our snacks in silence. Cassandra entered and stood in front of the whiteboard with a serious expression on her face. 

“Before we start,” she said, “there's something you all need to know. This office park is in the center of an incredibly powerful psychic vortex.” Her eyes widened and she scanned the room, making sure we had internalized the gravity of her statement. The sound of crunching had stopped. 

“If it's 50 miles an hour out there,” she said, pointing toward one of the highways, “it's 150 miles an hour in here!” Her spiel seemed absurd to me, but when I looked around the room, everyone looked to be taking it seriously. 

“At the end of your shift,” she said, “take time to pause and center yourselves before leaving. After all, you don't want to be going 150 miles an hour when everyone else is going 50!” 

“We also suggest,” she said, “that you keep something in your car to help you stay grounded. Corn is a really grounding influence, so it's a good idea to just keep a bag of corn chips in your car.” 

Someone raised their hand. 

“Go ahead,” Cassandra said. 

“What about corn muffins. Do you think those would work?” 

“Oh, definitely,” Cassandra replied. “Corn of any kind is really effective.” 

***

Oswyn picked up the phone. 

“Hi, Dwayne. This is Oswyn,” he said. “Tell me about this curse.” 

Oswyn listened solemnly, slowly nodding along. After a few moments, he responded. 

“Here's what I want you to do,” he said. “Light a candle, put it in front of a mirror facing your front door ...” 

Oswyn had it under control. I went outside for a smoke. 

***

Cassandra took a trip to Egypt. Before departing, she went around the office soliciting orders for mystical scarabs. As a child, I loved looking at pictures of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Given the prices Cassandra quoted, I expected these to be elaborate amulets made from turquoise and copper. 

When she returned, she went around the office to deliver everyone's scarabs, fishing them out of a brown paper lunch bag. They were about 1/2-inch long, fashioned from clay and resembled pinkie toes, lumpy with poorly applied pottery glaze. But very powerful spiritual energy! You could just feel it! That was the word around the office, anyway. 

It was a new-agey scene, and Dave and I never quite fit in. We were a pair of smart-asses, and the earnestness of our co-workers paired with the cynicism of the call-lengthening strategies gave us a case of cognitive dissonance. 

Though most of the people working there were true believers, there were some who seemed to understand that things were not quite what they seemed. The ones who worked there the longest got their start at Psychics-R-Us's sister business, a phone sex line. They had no illusions about what the job was. 

One of them, Millicent, came by The Golden Obelisk Room on one of my first nights of work. She stood in the doorway, introduced herself and asked me what my sign was. She was wearing stretch pants and a tank top, sipping from a Big Gulp. I detected a whiff of her armpits. I meekly answered, and then she asked me to guess hers. 

“Cancer?” I said. 

“No,” she said, “Sagittarius, but I'm as horny as a Cancer.” She rubbed her crotch against the door frame, leering at me. Fortunately, the phone rang, interrupting the moment. I was never so grateful to have to do my job making up lotto numbers. 

What a thing to be paid to do. 

They say that free-market capitalism is the most effective system at allocating resources, yet here I was being paid decent money to make up lotto numbers for callers who were so broke that gambling seemed like their only way out of poverty. 

When I read books on how to give tarot readings, much of the guidance was about the importance of the human connection and making a good-faith effort to connect with the questioner. This job turned all that on its head, and I didn't fully come to grips with what that meant until I worked at an in-person psychic fair. 

The fair was organized by one of my co-workers, Florence, a grandmotherly septuagenarian, and her husband, Bill. He cut quite a figure in the drab community center where the fair was held. He looked as though he stepped out of a Dickens novel, wearing a feather in his trilby, a bow tie and a woolen waistcoat. He walked with the aid of a crystal-topped black cane. 

Bill told me that he and Florence met in England, where they were carnies. His English accent and courtly presentation gave him the air of a gentleman, but something about the look in his eyes made me feel as if he was sizing me up to spot my weaknesses. I spoke to him as little as possible, assuming that pickpocketing was just one of the many dark arts he had mastered. 

Bill worked the room, identifying marks and bringing them to Florence, who effortlessly separated them from their money with a smile. 

That day was a sobering experience and was the beginning of the end of my time at Psychics-R-Us. I only talked to one person at the fair, a very nice man who seemed to have some kind of cognitive impairment. I did my best to make him feel good, and he left the table grateful and happy, but when it was over I felt like I needed a shower. Talking to disembodied voices on the phone is one thing ― sitting across the table from someone giving you $20 of what little money they have is another. 

The job became a lot less amusing to me, and I started having trouble keeping my minutes up. Whether it was guilt or boredom, I couldn't say. 

I started volunteering for nightshifts when the call volume was low. I was often by myself in The Golden Obelisk Room, lying on the floor with the lights turned off, zoning out to Music for Airports. I told people I was meditating. More than once I was jolted awake by someone coming in to see why I wasn't answering my phone. 

I was eventually fired. I didn't even last a year.

Oswyn came outside to let me know he had finished up with Dwayne. 

“I gave him some stuff to try,” he said. “Curses can be tricky.” 

“I tried telling him curses weren't real,” I said, snuffing out my beedi. 

“Unless you believe in them,” he said. 

I thanked him for his help as we walked back into the office. On returning to my desk, I saw the call with Dwayne went 25 minutes. Not bad, I thought. It'll definitely bump up my minutes for the week.

Meghan Trainor decided to quit drinking coffee after a psychic told her husband, Daryl Sabara, that her caffeine intake was causing her to “crash out.”

“The psychic never met me. My husband was gifted a session with her and she said, ‘Your wife is using coffee like speed. She's non-stop and it's not helping her and she's just crashing out,'” Trainor, 31, told People in an interview published on Saturday, November 29.

“I was like, ‘How does she know that?' And he came home and told me, and I immediately stopped,” she added. “Cold turkey just stopped because I was drinking it all day to just survive and be steady and then I would crash and be buzzing at night to sleep.”

Trainor married Sabara, 33, in 2018 and the couple share two sons, Riley, 4, and Barry, 2. The “All About That Bass” singer admitted that she was relying on caffeine to keep up with her grueling tour schedule and motherhood demands.

“I wasn't feeling great. And I was like, ‘I don't understand. I eat so healthy, I work out. Why do I feel like this?' And I realized I was overworking myself,” Trainor said, adding that she realized her “adrenals were shot” and her hormones were “so off.”

Although quitting cold turkey was “tough,” Trainor said her new no-coffee routine has been “life-changing” and she has “more energy than ever.”

Trainor recently opened up about her health journey via Instagram in March after she lost 60 pounds.

“I've worked with a dietician, made huge lifestyle changes, started exercising with a trainer, and yes, I used science and support (shoutout to Mounjaro!) to help me after my 2nd pregnancy,” she said of GLP-1 injections, which are primarily prescribed to help people who have diabetes with weight management. “And I'm so glad I did because I feel great.”

Earlier this month, she admitted to Entertainment Tonight that the comments about her body have affected her, adding that she doesn't understand why her weight bothers people so much.

“I'm literally, for the first time ever, after having babies, taking care of my health to the highest level. I've never felt better, and I look incredible. I feel great,” Trainor said. “And that's when people attack me.”

She continued, “I was like, ‘Wait a second. I'm taking care of myself. You don't like it?' So what am I supposed to do? I have to find a way to not be affected by that.”

Trainor said her new song, “Still Don't Care,” released on November 12, is a response to people scrutinizing her appearance.

She sings: “Said I was too thick, then I got way too thin / And I try to stand out, but I wanna fit in / ‘You're a little too loud,' ‘Stretch marks on your skin' / ‘Can't believe you're still here, girl, where have you been?' / Oh, let me take a moment, think it over / Does it touch me at all? / Nope, I still don't care.”

Trainor is set to head out on the Get in Girl Tour next year in support of her forthcoming album, Toy with Me, which will be released on April 24, 2026.

Of how she plans to manage the hectic routine, Trainor told People, “No sleep, power through and thrive.”

“We get up at 7 a.m. because the kids get up at 7 a.m., and then we go find an amusement park or a museum. They love children's museums … then we eat lunch together, I do a soundcheck, we have early dinner so that I don't burp on stage,” she said. “And after soundcheck, I'm in full glam, like pop star outfit, and I'm helping our incredible nanny Leslie, who helps us out and my husband and my mom. There's four of us on two kids trying to get them in a bath that we unfold to put in this shower. It's chaos.”

Trainor explained that once the kids are settled on the tour bus, she heads off to her show and hopes to get to bed by midnight.

“And then we get up and it's Groundhog Day and we do it all over again,” she concluded.

LUSAIL, Qatar (AP) — Max Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix on Sunday to send a tense Formula 1 title fight into the season's final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

Championship leader Lando Norris would have clinched his first F1 title with a win but finished in fourth place, with his McLaren teammate and title rival Oscar Piastri placing second. 

All three title contenders have won seven races this season. Verstappen is aiming for a fifth straight F1 title, with Piastri and Norris chasing their first.

“That's a very lovely race,” Verstappen said on team radio after his 70th career win. “Great job everyone.”

Norris can still become the first British driver to win the championship since Lewis Hamilton clinched the last of his seven titles in 2020. But having entered the Qatar GP weekend with a 24-point lead over both his rivals, Norris is now 12 points ahead of Verstappen and 16 clear of Piastri, who dropped to third overall.

“Speechless. I don't know any words,” a dejected-sounding Piastri said. “It is a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.”




Piastri started on pole position ahead of Norris, with Verstappen starting from third.

Although Verstappen overtook Norris heading into Turn 1, Piastri made a clean start and took a comfortable lead early on.

A strategy error cost McLaren after an early safety car prompted a flurry of tire changes, but both McLarens stayed out on track when Verstappen and the others came in.

“Clearly we didn't get it right tonight,” Piastri said. “I think in hindsight, it is pretty obvious what we would have done. I am sure we will discuss it as a team.”

The decision played into Verstappen's hands and the elated Dutchman climbed out of his car and jumped into the arms of his mechanics and engineers after winning.

“This was an incredible race for us, we made the right call as a team to box under that safety car and yeah that was smart,” Verstappen said. “Super happy to win here, we stayed in the fight until the end. Incredible.”

The safety car came out after Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sent spinning off the track on Lap 7 after being clipped by Alpine driver Pierre Gasly.

The decision to stay out on track was questioned over team radio by Norris, in a race where drivers had to take two mandatory pit stops over the 57 laps — a measure imposed on safety grounds due to a high risk of tire degradation at the Lusail International Circuit.

Changing tires behind the safety car constituted the equivalent of a free change, with no time lost. The McLaren team gambled on holding track position, leaving them at risk later on.

Norris seemed calm before the race, standing with his arms folded and looking into the distance. Piastri chatted to McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown moments before getting into his car.

Former England soccer star David Beckham watched the race from the McLaren motorhome, flanked by his former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville.

Because drivers were restricted to a maximum of 25 laps on the Pirelli tires at this race, those who already pitted had to change again on Lap 32.

After the McLarens made their first tire changes, Norris was in fifth place behind Piastri in fourth. That left Verstappen out in front and with several laps to build his lead before having to change tires again.

McLaren pitted Piastri on Lap 43 and Norris soon after, but when Norris came back out on Lap 45 he was fifth with Antonelli and Sainz barring his way.

Desert battles seem to suit Verstappen, who clinched a third straight win in Qatar and has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. Norris may take hope from the fact he won there last year.

But the McLarens head to Abu Dhabi with a hard-charging Verstappen looking to repeat history by clinching a championship in the last race at Abu Dhabi, having done so when he overtook Hamilton on the final lap after a controversial finish in 2021.

“It's possible now but we will see,” said Verstappen, who had written off his chances earlier this season. “I don't really worry about it too much.”

ByAJ Dhaliwal,

Contributor.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has taken an important step toward bringing blockchain activity into the regulated banking system. In Interpretive Letter 1186, the agency confirmed that national banks may hold small amounts of crypto-assets, not for trading or speculation, but to pay blockchain network fees (“gas fees”) tied to otherwise permissible activities. The OCC also made clear that banks may hold limited tokens to test digital-asset platforms before launching them.

It's a narrow clarification on paper, but it resolves a practical bottleneck that has held back tokenization, digital-asset custody, and blockchain-based settlement for years.

Every blockchain requires users to pay a fee, in the network's own token, to validate or record a transaction. This is foundational to how distributed ledger networks function and protect themselves. But banks were in a bind: without the authority to hold native tokens, they had to ask customers to supply them, purchase small amounts before every transaction, or route activity through a fee provider. Each of these workarounds created timing delays, pricing uncertainty, and counterparty risk.

The OCC acknowledged these operational drawbacks directly, noting that reliance on intermediaries “can add costs and significant risks.” The new letter removes that friction. Banks may now hold only the amounts “reasonably necessary” to cover anticipated network-fee needs, and such holdings must remain de minimis relative to capital.

The OCC framed this authority as an extension of longstanding incidental bank powers and not a departure from them. Under 12 C.F.R. § 7.1000(d)(1), an activity is permissible if it helps deliver bank services, improves efficiency, or avoids waste. Paying mandatory network fees satisfies all of these criteria.

The letter situates this clarification within the OCC's broader digital-asset framework, including previous guidance on crypto custody, stablecoin reserves, and the use of distributed ledgers for payments. It effectively removes a final operational constraint that prevented banks from implementing activities the OCC already deemed permissible.

The OCC also addressed an issue that has quietly slowed bank development of digital-asset platforms: the inability to test systems using native tokens. Banks cannot responsibly deploy custody, settlement, or wallet infrastructure without validating transfers, controls, cybersecurity safeguards, and compliance workflows. Requiring third parties to provide tokens for testing introduces cost and risk, and in practice discourages thorough testing. The letter confirms that banks may hold the small amount of crypto-assets required to test systems safely.

This finding was supported by the requesting bank's detailed risk and compliance program, which emphasized controls across cybersecurity, illicit finance, liquidity, cryptographic protections, and operating procedures.

In addition to issuing the interpretive letter, the OCC published information demonstrating how similar requests have been evaluated, providing much-needed transparency into a process that had historically been opaque. This gives institutions clearer insight into supervisory expectations and signals a more open regulatory posture toward blockchain activity.

Although IL 1186 does not authorize investment activity or speculative crypto holdings, it finally gives banks and the fintechs that partner with them a practical way to operate directly on blockchain networks.

For banks, the impact is substantial:

Fintechs also see meaningful benefits:

Interpretive Letter 1186 moves blockchain activity inside the traditional banking perimeter in a practical, incremental way. The OCC even noted that banks may hold crypto-assets for other permissible purposes, such as foreclosing on crypto collateral or hedging certain customer-driven derivative exposures, suggesting that additional clarifications may follow.

For now, banks and fintechs finally have the green light to build on-chain products without operational workarounds. The conversation has moved past whether blockchain has a place in banking and now centers on how quickly, and compliantly, institutions can roll it out.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

Lando Norris has responded to Max Verstappen's claim that, if he had been in the same position as the McLaren drivers, he would have secured the Drivers' Championship much earlier.

Lando Norris has responded to Max Verstappen's claim that he would have wrapped up the title far earlier if he had the opportunity himself to enjoy McLaren's 2025 dominance, labelling the Dutchman's remarks as “talking nonsense”.

Ahead of the season's penultimate round, in which Norris could seal the championship if he wins the Qatar Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver was asked whether he thinks about the possibility of going into 2026 with five titles – he has a 25-point gap to overcome in order to remain in the fight beyond this weekend.

“Five is better than four,” he answered candidly. “If it doesn't happen, it's not going to change my life. Fine, great if I win another one, but to be realistic, we are still in this fight because of other people's failures, not because of – if you look at the whole of the season – what we did.

“Yes, we did really well. We have really maximised pretty much all of the races. If we had been in the position of how dominant a car they [McLaren] had, the championship would have been over a long time ago.”

As a team, McLaren blew their rivals away this year, securing the Teams' Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix with six rounds still to go. And despite Mercedes and Red Bull's recent stronger performances, the Woking outfit's early dominance means they still have over 330 points more than both of their nearest competitors.

However, the battle for the drivers' title has unfolded differently, with the lead changing hands after Oscar Piastri's form fell away in the second part of the season. What was a deficit of over 100 points for Verstappen after Zandvoort rapidly decreased, leaving him mathematically still in contention.

However, Norris was nevertheless quick to dispute Verstappen's claim that in another world where he had the same performance as McLaren, he would have already won his fifth title.

Speaking after the Sprint, in which Norris kept the Dutchman behind him to take P3, he said: “Max is very welcome to say everything he wants, to be honest. He's kind of earned the right. You know, he's won four World Championships. I have a lot of respect and I think that gives anyone a lot of credit.

“He's achieved an incredible amount – more than anyone generally dreams of achieving. So, you know, Max generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there's also a lot of things he doesn't have much of a clue about.

“It's also Red Bull's way of going about things, this kind of aggressive nature and, yeah, just talking nonsense a lot of the time. So it depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it – like you love to – or you do what we do as a team, which is just kind of keep our heads down, keep focused. So maybe he would have done, but he hasn't so far, and he keeps trying.”

Norris could win his first World Championship in Sunday's Qatar Grand Prix – and there are a myriad of ways he could do it, but the most straightforward is taking the chequered flag first.

That task has been made more difficult after Piastri took pole position for Sunday's race as Norris aborted his final attempt and settled for second place, with Verstappen set to start third. Overtaking is not the easiest around the Lusail International Circuit, so the opening lap represents the Briton's best chance of taking the lead.

Asked what happened on his second lap in Q3, he said: “I don't know. I just got a bit of understeer and I was going to go off so I had to abort which is a shame, but it's the way it is. Oscar did a good lap and drove well and has been driving well all weekend. Nothing to complain about, just didn't do the lap. I'm still P2 for tomorrow.

“The first couple of laps are always opportunities for everyone, but after that I think it's probably going to be pretty straightforward for everyone.

“Tonight we'll review some things and see what I can do better than I did this morning. Otherwise, I think we're in a good position. The car's been feeling good and I was much happier today than yesterday, so that's progress but it's a long race tomorrow.”

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

Lewis Hamilton will start the Qatar Grand Prix from 18th, with Charles Leclerc further up the grid in 10th.

Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were once again knocked back by their performances in Qualifying for the Qatar Grand Prix, with neither driver able to keep up with their frontrunning rivals in the highly competitive session.

While McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull all seemed to be in the fight for pole position at various points in the session, Ferrari were significantly off the pace and failed to find any improvements after the earlier Sprint.

The 19-lap event ended with Leclerc and Hamilton crossing the line in P13 and P17 respectively, with the Briton gaining one position after he started behind Lance Stroll in the pit lane.

Although he was keen to put himself in a better place for the Grand Prix, Hamilton was knocked out in Q1 and will start from 18th on the grid. With overtaking a challenge at this venue, he will have an uphill battle on his charge to return to the points.

He previously said in the Sprint that the car felt even worse than it did in Sprint Qualifying, where he was similarly eliminated in P18, but after a bitterly disappointing Qualifying he admitted: “I was generally feeling better. We made changes and I was feeling better, but just wasn't quick.”

Hamilton has struggled to find his rhythm in his first campaign with Ferrari, adding that he is “incredibly grateful for the support” and he “wouldn't have made it through this year without” his fans.

His Monegasque team mate was equally despondent after he wound up P10 in Qualifying, more than a second adrift of Oscar Piastri's pole lap time. A massive spin in Q3 was the result of the oversteer that he has struggled with all weekend, and he has no belief that it will improve before the race.

Asked to sum up Qualifying, he replied: “Incredibly difficult day, incredibly difficult weekend. I don't really know what to say. It's been extremely difficult to drive this car, to keep it on track. I'm trying absolutely everything to extract anything I can from that car, but at the moment this is the only thing that's possible for now.

“It's frustrating. The best thing I can do is reset for tomorrow and try to come back to the track motivated and try to do something special. Am I optimistic for tomorrow? I am not, which is quite rare. Normally I'm a very optimistic person but I have to say that this weekend, there's zero performance in this car.”

Leclerc added that he tried to reset for the Sprint, but “it didn't work out” as he lost four positions and was seen veering wide off the circuit multiple times.

“I hope it will work better tomorrow, but nothing that I've felt with this car makes me think that I will have a better feeling tomorrow,” he said. “I'll wait and try to maximise whatever is possible tomorrow. With Safety Cars, hopefully we can get a little bit lucky – that's probably my only hope for tomorrow.”

Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year'

Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Qatar Grand Prix.

What more could you ask for? The three title protagonists filling the first three positions on the grid – on a day in Qatar when one of them could clinch the championship, and another must beat him to stay in the fight.

McLaren's Lando Norris – the driver who will be crowned this evening if he wins the Grand Prix – starts second, but with team mate Oscar Piastri ahead of him on pole. And immediately behind is the Red Bull of reigning champion Max Verstappen, who has to finish ahead of Norris to remain in contention.

Of course, there are plenty of others who could come into play into Turn 1 after the lights go out. First among them are the Mercedes of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli in P4 and 5 respectively. And don't discount the drivers in sixth and seventh: Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Williams' Carlos Sainz.

Completing our top 10 on the grid we have Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, the Alpine of Pierre Gasly and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc – whose team mate Lewis Hamilton again failed to make the Q2 cut in Qualifying and starts down in 17th.

On the back row is Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, who was penalised five places for causing a collision last time out in Las Vegas, while the second Alpine of Franco Colapinto starts from the pit lane after set-up changes.

Leonardo Fornaroli sealed the 2025 Formula 2 title, matching the likes of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto in becoming a back-to-back Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion.

Victor Martins put in a superb performance to win this weekend's Feature Race in Qatar, leading home Leonardo Fornaroli in second place, a result that saw the Italian become the 2025 Formula 2 Champion.

Fornaroli started from pole but a slow getaway allowed Martins to take the lead heading into Turn 1, an advantage the ART Grand Prix driver would not relinquish.

The Williams Driver Academy member did not have it all his own way though, as he was forced to hold off Fornaroli's charge in the closing stages. However, Martins did just enough to take a first win of the season.

With results going in his favour, Fornaroli's second place saw the Invicta Racing driver follow in the footsteps of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto by becoming a back-to-back Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion.

Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne finished in third, beating Campos Racing's Arvid Lindblad to the final spot on the podium.

Sebastián Montoya was fifth for PREMA Racing, ahead of MP Motorsport's Richard Verschoor and Campos debutant Nikola Tsolov.

Roman Stanek was eighth for Invicta, ahead of the charging Hitech TGR pairing of Dino Beganovic and Luke Browning in ninth and 10th respectively.

That takes us to Abu Dhabi for the final round and while the Drivers' Championship has been decided, the battle for the Teams' title between Invicta Racing, Hitech TGR and Campos Racing looks set to go down to the wire.
