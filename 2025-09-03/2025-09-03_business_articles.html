                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Eagle said Wednesday its partnership with Sydney Sweeney has been its "best" advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The company's splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the "Euphoria" star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift's new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday. "The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales," CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. "We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value." The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. Here's how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. So far this year, American Eagle's performance has been marred by merchandising missteps, tariffs and an uncertain consumer that's being more selective when spending money on products like clothes and shoes. To turn things around, American Eagle launched its campaign with Sweeney ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season, but in some ways, that also backfired when it incited outrage from some customers. The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans" — led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre and a nod to eugenics. More widely, the campaign also faced pushback from some who said the ads were overly sexualized and out of touch, leading them to wonder what type of consumer the company was targeting. American Eagle said it's gained 700,000 new customers and that traffic across channels has been "consistently positive" throughout August, despite some news reports indicating the contrary. The Sweeney campaign has led to denim sellouts, double-digit traffic growth and increased awareness and engagement, the company said. The Sydney Jacket sold out in one day and The Sydney Jean, a custom style that donated 100% of proceeds to the Crisis Text Line, which provides mental health support, sold out in one day. Many of the items, specifically ones worn by Kelce and his fellow athletes, sold out. It's also facing stiff competition from peers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap and Levi's. Recently, Gap launched its "Better in Denim" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit "Milkshake." Meanwhile, Levi's has had an ongoing campaign featuring Beyoncé while Abercrombie has taken a sports focus and partnered with the NFL. Compounding American Eagle's challenges is the uncertain tariff environment. American Eagle has been working to reduce its reliance on China to under 10% this year but it also has a heavy manufacturing presence in Vietnam and India, which have been the subject of reciprocal tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florida plans to end all state vaccine mandates, including for children to attend schools, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, a prominent immunization critic, announced Wednesday. The rollback could result in fewer school children getting immunized against deadly viruses such as polio and measles, and comes as Florida leads the Southeast in nonmedical vaccine exemptions among kindergartners. "The Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law, all of them. Every last one of them," Ladapo said during a news conference, adding that the state has "maybe half a dozen" shots mandated in the state. All states currently have vaccine requirements to attend public schools, though exceptions vary by state. Florida is among the states that already allow parents to object to vaccines on religious grounds. Ladapo said vaccine mandates "drips with disdain and slavery," even though they are intended to protect public health. Vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans $540 billion in direct health-care costs over the past three decades, according to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in August. Ladapo has long stoked fears about vaccines, and his stances on shots and other measures have drawn criticism from the public health community. Last year, he called for a halt to using mRNA Covid-19 shots, citing false claims that the jabs could contaminate a person's DNA. The move comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S., gutting a key government immunization panel, canceling funding for mRNA shot development and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dollar Tree is seeing benefits from branching out into products that cost over $1.25 each. The dollar store chain has spent the last couple of years adding items that cost more than its standard $1.25 price point. Dollar Tree has added items that cost $3 and $5 each, for instance, and experimented with items that cost as much as $7. The strategy is paying off, executives said on Dollar Tree's latest earnings call on Wednesday, especially when it comes to serving new customers at its stores. "Expanding our assortment to include items at a variety of price points is fast becoming the standard Dollar Tree model," CEO Michael Creedon said on the call. He said the chain's wider range of prices lets it sell larger packs of some consumable goods and higher-quality items. Such customers drove a "meaningful portion" of Dollar Tree's second-quarter sales growth, Creedon said. Dollar Tree largely beat analysts' expectations for the period, including with 6.5% growth in same-store net sales. Dollar Tree used to offer hammers for $1.25 each, but they sold poorly, CFO Stewart Glendinning said on Wednesday's call. Then, Dollar Tree started selling a more expensive version of the tool. Those kinds of items are "creating more interest for consumers in a way that is very positive to the shopping experience and also to our revenue line," Glendinning said. For instance, shoppers have been buying $5 backpacks, which can cost more at other stores, as their kids head back to school, he said. Last year, Dollar Tree saw many customers turn to its stores to shop around the holidays, CEO Creedon said on Wednesday's call. Earlier this year, the chain took a hit from tariffs. It's still unclear how much duties on imports from some countries, especially China, will be in the long-run, Creedon said. Then, there's the lingering effect of inflation on Dollar Tree shoppers' budgets. "If you look over the last four or five years, prices have increased significantly across the entire retail landscape," Creedon said. "As a result of that, we're cautious" about the future, he said. Do you have a story to share about Dollar Tree or another major retailer?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newsmax filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing conservative media giant Fox News of acting as a monopoly and suppressing its right-leaning competitors. "Fox has sought to protect and expand its monopoly power in the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market by engaging in a suite of anticompetitive behaviors," attorneys for the outlet wrote in the federal suit in southern Florida. The lawyers allege that Fox News coerces distributors into "exclusionary and restrictive agreements," and that it has used "intimidation tactics" to hurt Newsmax — including hiring "private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives." "But for Fox's anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier 'critical mass' for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property," they wrote in the suit. A Fox News spokesperson curtly replied, "Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers." Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy is a former reporter for the New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who created Fox News. "Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over," Ruddy said in a statement. It also seeks a judgment for three times the amount of damages that it has allegedly sustained by Fox, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest "at the highest legal rate." The suit alleges that Fox, which has long been the most-watched cable news network on television, uses multiple strategies to "coerce distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels." Fox either explicitly or tacitly makes access to its content conditional on distributors agreeing not to carry those channels, the suit alleges. If they do, Fox imposes financial penalties on those distributors, by requiring them "to carry and pay high fees for Fox's little-watched channels like Fox Business," according to Newsmax. Fox also allegedly "inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing." "These tactics constitute unlawful restraints of trade and flow directly from Fox's unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market," the suit alleges. The antitrust complaint is the latest legal headache for Fox News, which has been the target of multiple high-profile and pricey lawsuits in recent years. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to settle a defamation suit over false claims said on its air about Dominion Voting Systems rigging the 2020 presidential election. A similar suit filed by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, is currently headed for trial. — CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge just ruled that Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser, and Googlers seem pretty happy about it. On Tuesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down penalties to Google after ruling its search business a monopoly. Google employees have been lighting up the company's central internal message board, filling it with jokes about the soaring stock and how Google no longer has to part with its beloved browser, per messages and memes reviewed by Business Insider. Another played on an iconic scene from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street," with Chrome — rather than Leonardo DiCaprio — announcing, "I'm not ******* leaving." Several other posts celebrated Chrome's remaining part of Google. One employee took a photo of a sign from one of the offices that read, "You belong here," adding the word "Chrome." A Chrome sell-off could have been very painful for Google. The browser has become a huge distribution channel for the company's search advertising business, sucking up vast amounts of useful data. Google's stock popped more than 6% in after-hours trading — something that Googlers also joked about inside the company. Several employees who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said they didn't think the outcome would affect them much and that it would be business as usual for most Googlers. "I think people are mostly happy about the stock," said one of them. The list of remedies handed down to Google on Tuesday included a ban on any exclusive deals to make its search engine the default, though it stopped short of banning payments to partners completely. Google was also ordered to share some of its search data with rivals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday called demands that his administration release the Jeffrey Epstein files a distraction from his successes, as a group of victims of the notorious sex offender called for those documents to be publicly disclosed. "This is a Democratic hoax that never ends," Trump told reporters at the White House when he was asked about the Epstein files. Despite Trump's claim, his fellow Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has been leading a renewed charge in Congress to force the release of documents about Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. Massie has filed a so-called discharge petition in the House of Representatives, which, if passed, would order the Department of Justice to release all documents related to Epstein. Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., held a press conference on Wednesday on Capitol Hill with a group of victims of Epstein and Maxwell. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

These nimble, off-road e-scooters can hit 62 mph, cover up to 186 miles on a single battery charge, and weigh just 163 pounds, making them easier to handle than heavier bikes. Ašmanis said they can make deliveries to the front lines, do reconnaissance in Russia-held territory, and quickly evacuate lightly wounded troops, among other missions, and Ukraine is putting them to work. These atypical combat vehicles offer quiet mobility across varied terrain, but there aren't many of them in Ukraine, at least for the time being. Ašmanis said Ukraine now has 11 of the scooters and that units have asked for more. Business Insider reached out to the Latvian defense ministry but did not receive a response on plans for future deliveries. The scooters were initially designed for use on military bases, border patrol, and reconnaissance, but their use in Ukraine showed the company they had even more uses in real war. Ukrainian soldiers brought them to the front lines and inside occupied territory held by Russia. Ašmanis said the scooters offer advantages over other vehicles being used in this war. For instance, they are smaller and lighter than traditional vehicles, they don't drown out the buzzing sound of drones, they're easier to quickly bail out of in an emergency, and the scooters don't require risking a car, truck, or other vehicle that could be packed with gear for other missions on quick, daring dashes. The combat scooters aren't unique to Ukrainian forces. The Russians have employed e-scooters in fast-moving, dispersed "scooter assaults." Ukrainian officers have said these tactics make it harder to take out large numbers of troops at once with drones or artillery, though they're far from unstoppable. Ašmanis said his vehicles are better suited to conflict than typical e-scooters, describing them as "in the middle between scooter and motorcycle" because it has much larger wheels, like motorcycles do, than regular scooters. Scooter use reflects a broader shift in the war: both sides are scrambling for small, fast, flexible vehicles to supplement traditional combat machines. Troops have been turning to alternatives to systems like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, though those are still used, and heading into battle in civilian pickup trucks, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, scooters, and more. Riders are exposed, offering little to no protection beyond their personal kit from shrapnel, small-arms fire, or harsh weather. Electric scooters are also highly dependent on batteries, which may not perform as well under certain conditions. These multi-million-dollar systems have been wrecked by cheap drones throughout the war. Ukraine has been using whatever vehicles it can, from Western tanks like the American-made M1 Abrams to civilian pickup trucks equipped with .50 caliber machine guns. One Ukrainian unit created a motorcycle attack company earlier this year that is designed to quickly break through Russian positions. There's a constant demand for vehicles, both military and civilian, on both sides of the war, which is chewing through weaponry. Like small drones, militarized pickups, and other improvised gear, they underscore how Ukraine and Russia are adapting anything they can to survive this grinding fight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a financial planner in the early 90s, William "Bill" Bengen confronted a question that still puzzles aspiring retirees today — "When I get to retirement, how much can I spend?" In October 1994, he published his findings in the Journal of Financial Planning, and what is now known as the 4% withdrawal rule for retirement was born. Bengen created the 4% rule during a stretch of relatively low, stable inflation. Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. With his new book, "A Richer Retirement: Supercharging the 4% Rule to Spend More and Enjoy More," Bengen is urging retirees to consider their entire financial circumstances when identifying their withdrawal strategy. Despite the 4% rule's popularity, some investors get it wrong, Bengen said. That rate is then adjusted for subsequent years to account for inflation, much like Social Security benefits get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, according to Bengen. That COLA withdrawal approach is not the only strategy. Some people may choose to withdraw a fixed percentage or withdrawal amount. Others may prefer to take more money out early in retirement and cut back later, Bengen said. "There's so many ways you can do it," Bengen said. However, all retirees would benefit from keeping all of their financial circumstances in mind when identifying their personal strategy, he said. Today, the maximum safe withdrawal rate is 4.7%, according to Bengen's calculations. Notably, Bengen's historical data shows some retirees may be able to take those withdrawals even higher, with the average Safemax rate at about 7.1%. To be sure, because that 4.7% maximum safe withdrawal rate is based on past performance, it is not guaranteed that it will hold true for future retirees. Whether new retirees should rethink that withdrawal rate has been a subject of debate among experts. In his book, Bengen provides tables to help prospective retirees roughly gauge their own personal maximum safe withdrawal rate. To gauge their "Safemax," retirees need to estimate their average inflation rate for their early retirement years as well as the expected Shiller CAPE (or cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings) ratio, a measure of stock market valuation that takes inflation-adjusted earnings into account. A bear market — where stocks fall more than 20% — or high inflation early in retirement can affect the longevity of retirement portfolios, according to Bengen. Higher inflation during retirement can be "scary," Bengen said. While the record 8.7% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment that went into effect for 2023 may have seemed nice, the extra money was mostly claimed by higher prices, he said. Retirees should be prepared to deal with inflation "immediately and strongly if it occurs," Bengen said. For most people, that comes down to reducing their expenditures, he said. Nearly two-thirds of retirees — 63% — worry that tariffs will push inflation higher than what Social Security cost-of-living adjustments may cover, according to a June Nationwide Retirement Institute survey. While the latest government data shows there has been an uptick in inflation, with the Consumer Price Index at 2.7% on a 12-month basis as of July, that is still lower than the 9% rate that inflation gauge posted in June 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Wednesday criticized the Trump administration's decision to take a 10% stake in embattled chipmaker Intel, calling the investment "a step towards socialism." Intel announced last month that the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, purchasing 433.3 million shares at a price of $20.47 per share, giving it a 10% stake in the company. Paul said government ownership is "a bad idea." "It's always a mistake to say, 'Well we have this one bad policy, all right, we'll tolerate a little socialism, but we don't want anymore," Paul told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. President Donald Trump said on Truth Social last month that the government's stake in the chipmaker is a "great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL." Trump has taken an increasingly heavy hand in the private sector, raising concern among conservative lawmakers like Paul, who have long opposed big government. In August, the Trump administration said the government would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials. It also took a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant. Among the most vocal supporters in Congress of Trump's Intel deal has been Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont. Sanders, a longtime and vocal Trump critic, told news outlets last month that, "Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return." "I worry that the free market movement, the movement that was a big part of the Republican Party, is being diminished over time," Rand said. WATCH: Sen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The term "agent" refers to an AI tool that can carry out tasks in the background in response to user prompts. It can responds to natural langauge commands from a users. DeepL Agent can be used in various teams from human resources to marketing, the company added. Agents or agentic AI have become buzzwords in the technology industry, underscoring how companies see how these digital assistants automating more mundane tasks. Companies such as Microsoft with Co-Pilot and Anthropic's Claude are products focused on the enterprise customer. The move is a step beyond what DeepL, which is valued at $2 billion, has focused on since it was founded in 2017. It potentially pits the company against major AI players like Anthropic, OpenAI and Microsoft, which are targeting enterprise customers. DeepL CEO Jarek Kutylowski told CNBC on Wednesday that the company's agent was a natural extension of its translation product. "All of those tedious tasks in your office when you have to switch between different systems and take some data from one system, put it into another one, AI, and those autonomous agents, and the DeepL Agent in particular, can help solve so much better." DeepL's translation product is based on its self-developed large language models. Kutylowski said DeepL Agent is based on its own models, as well as on those available "externally" from other providers. While there are a large number of companies advertising AI agents, the market is still in a very early stage. Overall investor interest in AI companies is meanwhile still high. Technology listings appear to be gathering steam, with both fintech firm Klarna and crypto exchange Gemini this week unveiling details of their upcoming initial public offerings. Against this backdrop, CNBC asked Kutylowski if DeepL was considering an IPO, to which he responded: "That's not a short term plan that we would be considering right now."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Klarna has paid more than $16 million to nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO. Klarna has paid Nina Siemiatkowski's nonprofit Milkywire $2.75 million for its services since 2022, and a further $1 million to purchase carbon credits, which are permits to offset a portion of its greenhouse gas emissions through supporting projects that remove the equivalent amount of emissions. It has also contributed $12.8 million to date to the WRLD Foundation, another nonprofit founded by the Klarna chief's wife, which channels donations to organizations identified and vetted by Milkywire on Klarna's behalf, the filing shows. According to the WRLD Foundation's website, the climate impact-focused nonprofit was established in 2021 to raise awareness around sustainability, run educational programs, and support other nonprofits. Klarna's F-1 filing also notes that it allows customers to choose to make donations to the WRLD Foundation through its app and website as part of its environmental, social, and governance initiative. Founded by Nina Siemiatkowski in 2018, Milkywire's website says it delivers climate impact solutions in areas including carbon removal, nature restoration, and protection. Klarna's F-1 filing also states that Milkywire provides it with other services and tools, including "product development, digital integrations, websites, campaigns, content creation and other digital solutions." Klarna said in the filing that it underwent a thorough screening process before engaging Milkywire for its services and that it believes the fees paid to it are competitive. It added that the partnership was approved by its board of directors, but that Siemiatkowski recused himself from the process, in line with its conflict of interest policy. Google has previously invested in genetics firm 23andMe, which was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, who was married to Google cofounder Sergey Brin at the time. Klarna's disclosure comes as it readies for its IPO next week, seeking to raise up to $1.72 billion in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
