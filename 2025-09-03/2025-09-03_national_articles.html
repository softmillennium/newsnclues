Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday defended President Donald Trump's strike on a drug cartel-operated vessel off of Venezuela and vowed the U.S. will no longer "sit back" when it comes to "nacro-terrorism." In response to questions about the Marine strike Tuesday that hit a vessel in the southern Caribbean Sea while allegedly carrying members of Tren de Aragua smuggling narcotics headed for the U.S., Rubio said, "We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise." The strike apparently killed 11 members of the group, which was designated a terrorist organization in February, and marked a significant shift from the U.S.'s previous seize-and-apprehend policy when countering international gang networks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a press conference at the Secretaria Of Foreign Affairs Building in Mexico City Sept. 3, 2025. I don't need to explain to you why," Rubio said, noting that the group is known to traffic not only drugs, but arms and people. These are not real estate agents who, on the side, deal a few drugs. These are organized, corporate, structured organizations who specialize in the trafficking of deadly drugs into the United States of America," Rubio said. "They pose an immediate threat to the United States. In speaking to reporters from Mexico, where he was also hashing out counter arms and narcotics agreements, Rubio argued the previous policy of seize and apprehend was ineffective. Venezuelan vessel destroyed during U.S. military strike. The secretary further pointed out that the arms groups like Tren de Aragua are apparently getting a hold of unconventional weaponry, including drones, and continue to pose an increasingly serious threat to international security. "We are increasingly concerned that these cartels are now in possession, not just of landmines and grenades. We're now seeing the deployment of drone technology by narco-terrorist groups operating out of Venezuelan territory," he added, noting that they are being used to threaten security forces in neighboring states like Columbia. The video also showed the suspects getting their hair shaven and walking with their hands behind their necks as they are being transported from the U.S. to El Salvador in March 2025. Rubio confirmed the strategy employed on Tuesday is how the U.S. will continue to counter international narcotics and arms smuggling. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department arrested an Alabama man who deputies said showed up armed with brass knuckles, knives, high-capacity magazines and body armor after allegedly making threats against a Catholic monastery in California. The Orange County Sheriff's Department said deputies detained Joshua Michael Richardson late last month following reports of threatening emails he sent to St. Michael's Abbey. Investigators said the emails, reported on August 28, contained language interpreted as threatening. The situation escalated when investigators said Richardson drove from Alabama to Southern California and showed up in person at the abbey, where deputies said he made additional threats. Authorities said a man drove from Alabama with weapons to threaten an Orange County abbey. Deputies said they quickly located and detained Richardson. A search of his vehicle uncovered weapons and tactical gear, including large-capacity magazines, body armor, knives, and brass knuckles. On September 1, the Orange County District Attorney's Office formally charged Richardson with several offenses, including possession of brass knuckles, carrying a concealed dagger, possession of a large-capacity magazine and making criminal threats, according to KTLA. In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Jarryd Gonzales, spokesperson for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, confirmed the incident and thanked local law enforcement for their prompt action. An Alabama man was arrested by Orange County, California deputies on suspicion of making criminal threats against a Catholic monastery. Local law enforcement responded swiftly, and a suspect has been apprehended," Gonzales said. "We are grateful to the authorities for their quick action in ensuring the safety of our parish community." Gonzales noted that the diocese is taking the incident seriously in light of rising threats against churches nationwide, pointing to the recent shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, where a gunman opened fire during Mass. "In today's environment of increased threats against churches, and particularly mindful of recent events in Minnesota, our parishes and schools continue to strengthen security efforts and remain vigilant to help protect our parishioners, students and staff," Officers set up barriers after a shooting at Annunciation Church, which is also home to an elementary school, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Aug. 27, 2025. Sheriff's officials stressed the importance of community vigilance. "While incidents like this can feel unsettling, they also highlight the power of community," officials said. Trust your instincts and report suspicious activity, whether it is a strange message, unusual behavior, or something that does not sit right. Your call could stop a crime before it happens." The investigation remains active, and authorities urged anyone with relevant information to contact the Orange County Sheriff's Department at 714-647-7000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says he could deploy the National Guard to fight crime in New Orleans after previously saying troops might be going into Chicago and Baltimore amid his ongoing federal crackdown in the nation's capital. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard to fight crime, potentially expanding the number of cities around the nation where he may send federal law enforcement. Trump has already said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore following his administration deploying troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month. “So we're making a determination now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.” Trump now frequently boasts about turning Washington into a “safe zone.” The White House reports more than 1,760 arrests citywide since the president first announced he was mobilizing federal forces on Aug. 7. Trump's latest comments came a day after he declared “We're going in” and suggested that the National Guard might soon be headed for Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and Baltimore. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks,” Trump said. Shortly after Trump's comments, Landry said on social media, “We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” But city leaders immediately balked at the idea. “Crime is down in New Orleans,” City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, who is also a mayoral candidate, said via text message. “That would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!” Councilmember Jean-Paul Morrell said it is “ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it.” “NOPD is doing a great job with the existing resources they have. Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.” The City of New Orleans issued its own more conciliatory statement, saying “our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events” and that local officials “remain committed to sustaining this momentum.” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted last month on federal fraud charges and is set to be arraigned in the coming weeks. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly railed against Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for not requesting that the National Guard be deployed. In Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott and Maryland Gov. In Washington, Mayor Muriel Bowser has said Trump's decision to take over her city's police force and flood streets with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in reducing violent crime — but she's also argued that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more city police officers in service.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Survivors and accusers of Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, gathered on the Capitol lawn along with hundreds of supporters to demand the Trump administration provide transparency and accountability for what they endured as teenagers. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to quash the effort by putting forward his own resolution and arguing that a concurrent investigation by the House Oversight Committee is the best way for Congress to deliver transparency. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the matter as a “Democrat hoax.” The head of the FBI was in Cincinnati on Wednesday to help prosecutors and investigators announce a recent grand jury indictment targeting 22 Chinese suspects and four Chinese companies for allegedly shipping to the U.S. chemicals used to prepare fentanyl for sale. FBI Director Kash Patel said he was in southern Ohio “to break the wheel of fentanyl trafficking in the United States of America.” Authorities allege three people in Ohio were involved in obtaining several pounds of illegal cutting agents, which are used to increase the weight and potency of fentanyl. Indictments in the drug and money laundering case were handed up Tuesday. It is unusual for an FBI director to travel outside of Washington to announce criminal charges, but Patel's presence was meant to underscore how the fight against drug trafficking has emerged as a top law enforcement priority for the Trump administration. “We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” Landry said in an X post. Landry has not responded to questions from The Associated Press about whether he requested that Trump send in federal troops. New Orleans city council leaders and several mayoral candidates have rejected the need for federal troops, pointing to the city's plummeting crime rate this year. “Our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events for a world-class city,” the statement said. “The City of New Orleans and NOPD remain committed to sustaining this momentum, ensuring that every neighborhood continues to feel the impact of these combined efforts.” Soon after President Donald Trump's inauguration, federal health officials deleted information on topics like pregnancy risks and opioid-use disorder. “We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. The House has rejected a Republican resolution to censure Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey and remove her from the House Homeland Security Committee. McIver has pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside the facility in Newark in May. But, Rubio went on to defend the operation, saying that previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked. “We have seen those numbers drop historically, and that would not have been possible without the close cooperation between our two governments,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday. The positive tone and complimentary language toward Mexico reflects a shift for the Trump administration as it escalates its efforts to target drug cartels. Eleanor Holmes Norton, 88, has made very few public appearances during the surge of federal law enforcement authorities and the National Guard although her office has been active in introducing legislation to end the use of military personnel and surge. At a time when the city's authority to govern itself has been threatened, public pushback by its officials has been one of the few recourses to challenge Trump's move. She said the move has turned residents into “props in a political play to showcase his own power.” She has been visibly slower in her public appearances this year. It is expected to produce a report of its investigation by Dec. 31, 2026. While in Mexico City, Rubio said he was happy to see “the level of commitment” between U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime after meeting with President Sheinbaum. “There are no other governments cooperating more” than the U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime,” Rubio said during a press conference Wednesday. It comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was visiting Mexico City, meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and holding a news conference with Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente. The leaders stopped short of initially announcing a formal agreement, which Sheinbaum has spent weeks pushing for. The governments said they established a “high-level implementation” to make sure new commitments were fulfilled. They said their relationship is “based on the principles of reciprocity, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, shared and differentiated responsibility, as well as mutual trust.” A White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump was referring to Zelenskyy earlier. Trump in the Oval Office told reporters, “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly,” regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, but it wasn't clear if he meant Zelenskyy or Putin. “It's ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it,” said City Council President J.P. Morrell. “Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.” Jeff Landry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, Landry established a state police force to operate in New Orleans. He also convened a special legislative session focused on combating crime, leading to harsher penalties. New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch says she was “very direct” with the attorney general about her opposition to an enhanced federal law enforcement presence in the city. We don't want or need the help of the National Guard in New York City,” Tisch said in an interview on a local ABC station Wednesday. Tisch added that a federal deployment “creates real safety problems for us at the NYPD” and that “our National Guard are not trained to handle street crime in New York City.” While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year. Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.” Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement. Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted. “President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.” “And it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said. Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks at a news conference, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025 in Washington. Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service. “We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico. Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case. The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be. “Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.” The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga along with victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's abuse, speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment. Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty. Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power. “We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. “There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.” Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.” He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. “Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.” Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.” Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation. The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.” To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.” The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly. Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke. Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.” Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, another proponent of the petition, along with Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. House Speaker Mike Johnson says when Trump called him recently to discuss the novel idea he thought: “That's genius.” Republicans are struggling to hold onto their majority in Congress. Besides, the speaker added, Trump “loves a big show.” They're working with Senate Republican Leader John Thune to make it happen. Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a social media post by Trump on Wednesday that said he was conspiring with the leaders of North Korea and China against the United States. “Over these four days, during negotiations of all kinds, both in formal and informal settings, no one has ever expressed any negative judgments on the current American administration,” Putin said. Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a four-day visit. He took part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, held extensive talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with other leaders, and attended a military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also present at the parade. The Russian leader also said everyone with whom he had spoken during his visit to China had “supported our meeting in Anchorage,” and expressed their hope that negotiations would end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. “We're so excited about that,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting.

The images from China offer a striking, maybe even sinister, message that there could be a new reconfiguration of rising power in Eurasia, an “Axis of Upheaval,” as one U.S. analyst has called it.

Two days earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping huddled together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. At the very least, they offered yet more evidence of a burgeoning shift away from a U.S.-dominated, Western-led world order, as Trump withdraws America from many of its historic roles and roils economic relationships with tariffs. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump posted in a social media message to Xi. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that layoffs rose slightly, and that the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was almost unchanged from June at 3.2 million. The economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023. A political clash is unfolding in the House over how Congress should proceed in a matter that has rattled both House Republican leadership and the Trump administration. “Our demands are clear,” said Sky Roberts, whose late sister Virginia Giuffre was an outspoken survivor. “Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Obviously, they won't be doing it again,” Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. President Nicolas Maduro gives a press conference in Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, meets with Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, right, at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City, Wednesday, September 3, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday justified the lethal military strike that his administration said was carried out a day earlier against a Venezuelan gang as a necessary effort by the United States to send an unmistakable message to Latin American cartels. “There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said while hosting Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. Tuesday's strike was an astonishing departure from typical U.S. drug interdiction efforts at a time when Trump has ordered a major Navy buildup in the waters near Venezuela. Later Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that such operations “will happen again.” Rubio said previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked in stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and beyond. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on “Fox & Friends” that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was running his country “as a kingpin of a drug narco-state.” Hegseth said officials “knew exactly who was in that boat” and “exactly what they were doing.” But the Republican administration has not presented any evidence supporting Trump's claim that operators of the vessel were from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were trying to smuggle in drugs. “President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not seen,” said Hegseth, who declined to detail how the strike was carried out. The president on Tuesday repeated his claim — contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment — that Tren de Aragua is operating under Maduro's control. Unlike its counterparts from Colombia, Brazil and Central America, Tren de Aragua has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, which last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research. “We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,” said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime, referring to the Venezuelan gang by its initials. Still, with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for Tren de Aragua to one day delve deeper into the drug trade, he said. Meanwhile, the rhetoric from officials in Washington who would blame TdA as a proxy for all Venezuelan drug traffickers assures it will remain a target of intense U.S. government focus. “Deportations and statements from the United States suggest that TdA is now being used as a catch-all description for Venezuelan criminals acting abroad.” “Intentional killing outside armed conflict hostilities is unlawful unless it is to save a life immediately,” said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an expert on international law and the use of force at the University of Notre Dame Law School. The U.S. announced plans last month to boost its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. Maduro's government has responded by deploying troops along Venezuela's coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia. “This is a United States that sees security differently,” Berg said.</p>

A man has been arrested after police said he placed incendiary devices near a local fire station in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Slater Chaia of District Heights, Maryland, has been charged with possession of a destructive device and possession of incendiary material with intent to create a destructive device, both felonies, stemming from incidents of littering Capitol Heights Fire Station 805 with what a criminal complaint called "makeshift Molotov cocktails." He also faces a reckless endangerment charge. Surveillance video shows him walking up to the fire station's property with two plastic bottles, and putting both on the ground next to a flagpole. Slater Chaia is accused of placing a makeshift incendiary device in the mailbox at Capitol Heights Fire Station 805 on Aug. 13, 2025. Neither of those were caught on video. Police posted photos of the distinctive Tom and Jerry cartoon-themed Members Only jacket Chaia was wearing in the footage. The bottles reportedly contained an incendiary liquid and a wick. Slater Chaia, accused of placing an incendiary device in the Capitol Heights Fire Station 805 mailbox on Aug. 13, 2025, walks away from the scene. According to NBC 4 Washington, police believe that the fire station was specifically targeted, but they do not know why. A Prince George's County police cruiser is seen on Monday, April 15, 2019.

"The last device we had at this location could have been something, potentially, that would have harmed someone if it was able to be activated." Peter D'Abrosca joined Fox News Digital in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live as Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, visits the White House to strengthen ties with President Donald Trump and make the case for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in his country. Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, arrived at the White House on Wednesday, looking to strengthen his relationship with President Donald Trump and make the case that the United States needs to maintain its robust military presence in his country. The visit to Washington is Nawrocki's first overseas trip since taking office last month. While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year. Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.” Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement. Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted. “President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.” Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said. Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks at a news conference, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025 in Washington. Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service. “We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico. Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case. The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be. “Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.” The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans. “I've never done a press conference with Marjorie before.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga along with victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's abuse, speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment. Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty. Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power. “We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington. “There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.” Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.” He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. “Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.” Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.” Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation. The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.” To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.” The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly. Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke. Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.” Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep.

Trump will greet Polish president Karol Nawrocki at 11 a.m. for a bilateral meeting and lunch. At President Trump's news conference Tuesday, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked something that surely baffled those who avoided social media over Labor Day: “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Doocy referred to questions about Trump's health that swirled through social media over the weekend. With a 50-minute appearance, Trump certainly put to rest rumors that he was dead or seriously ill. But for the news media, it quickly renewed questions about whether they were being diligent enough in investigating questions over a president's health, a year after they dealt with the same issues with his predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president. Pictures showing him with bruises on his hands and apparent swelling in his legs circulated online recently, as did clips of misstatements in public, such as mistakenly referring to Michigan Gov. ▶ Read more about how the press is covering Trump's health AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a member in good standing of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, I am simply appalled by our beloved organization's resolution declaring the conflict in Gaza a “genocide.” Our elite association of academics, researchers, and randos, which costs upward of $125 to join yearly, has allowed its once-sterling reputation to be forever tainted. Apparently, an impressive-sounding organizational name is all one needs to get into the papers. Take the Jew-baiting “human rights” activist Agnes Callamard, of Amnesty International, who contends that an “overwhelming majority of members of the world's leading genocide scholars” backed a resolution that finds what is happening in Gaza “meet[s] the legal definition of the crime.” That is not true. A week ago, I could have voted on the genocide resolution, and my expertise is predominantly in '80s and '90s indie rock. Indeed, according to our dear former two-term IAGS advisory board member Sara Brown, only 128 of the association's approximately 500 members participated. There was no “consensus” on the resolution despite our communications officer Emily Sample falsely claiming so to the Washington Post. We should really have a meeting about her future at our organization. While we typically debate controversial resolutions in “a virtual town hall” (or so I hear), leadership declined to hold any discussions on this matter, according to Brown. As a member in good standing, I have access to the organization's LISTSERV, which shows there were zero comments on the resolution before its passage. The resolution itself is an embarrassing collection of half-truths and lies. It reads like the work of an earnest college freshman who believes hyperlinking a bunch of biased sources is tantamount to research. We repeat a litany of uncorroborated accusations made by Hamas and others. Hamas, for instance, has said that 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including 17,000 children. We contend that Israelis murdered 50,000 children alone, a completely concocted number. But, like Hamas, we don't bother making any distinction between combatants and innocents. As highly respected scholars, we should be better than the Gaza Health Ministry. We then cite organizations that have altered their definition of “genocide” for this conflict to place the burden of proof on Israel rather than those making the accusation. The war, which started when Hamas sent an army into Israel to murder, rape, torture, and kidnap civilians, including children, is tragic. But our organization has now created a precedent that makes virtually every conflict a “genocide.” If Israel wanted to commit genocide, it would not be sending hundreds of thousands of metric tons of food and supplies to Palestinians in Gaza. It would not provide clean water and move the population away from war zones. Israel has gone out of its way to avoid civilian casualties while fighting combatants who hide behind noncombatants (something that we never mention). If a handful of unnamed members of our organization are willing to distort reality, not to mention decency, to spread the propaganda of a terrorist state, what is our scholarship really worth?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Epstein files: On Capitol Hill, some Jeffrey Epstein survivors spoke publicly for the first time at a news conference, urging lawmakers to protect abuse victims. It comes as GOP leadership faces pressure for more transparency on the late convicted sex offender's case without going against the wishes of President Donald Trump, who has attempted to tamp down the political firestorm over Epstein. • Trump teases talk with Putin: During a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin “over the next few days.” Putin joined the leaders of China and North Korea in a show of force at China's military parade today. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she's encouraged President Donald Trump to meet at the White House with victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. I also encouraged him, already this morning, that he should have these women in the Oval Office. They deserve to be there,” Greene told CNN after today's bipartisan press conference with 10 survivors. Greene said she told Trump that she would be happy to put him in touch with the victims' attorneys to set up a meeting, but hasn't gotten an answer back. “I am continuing to encourage him that these are the people that deserve to be in the Oval Office, not any of Jeffrey Epstein's rich, powerful friends that allowed this to happen to them, or anyone that may have been a part of it,” Greene said. Greene said it was an act of “cowardice” for a White House official to say it would be a “hostile act” to the administration for GOP lawmakers to support Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna's effort to force a House floor vote on their bill to release the full Epstein files, while the Justice Department is already cooperating with the House Oversight Committee. “Everyone knows I've fought harder for President Trump for years now, and that person has their job because I fought so hard to help him get elected. And this isn't a hostile act towards the administration. The hostile act has been against these women for so many years now,” she said, adding that those who covered for Epstein committed the “real hostile act.” Meantime, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser is defending her move to extend the district's collaboration with federal law enforcement. Asked by a reporter about the Department of Justice interview Helm said: And that same calm, manipulative voice that she had, so polite there that day with Todd Blanche was the same, polite, coercive, manipulative voice that I heard as she was grooming me to then send me off to home of Jeffrey Epstein where he would assault me.” I sat there and listened to this woman's voice lie.” The feelings that come up listening to this woman's voice is repulsive. We all work very hard on healing and it's still gets to us after two decades,” she said. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Maxwell. President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended a US military strike on what he described as a drug-laden boat off Venezuela's coast, addressing the operation a day after US officials confirmed that 11 people were killed aboard the vessel. The president emphasized the threat posed by the boat and claimed it was carrying “massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that.” And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again,” Trump added, issuing what appeared to be a broader warning to other trafficking groups. “But Venezuela has been very bad, both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country,” Trump continued. Trump said earlier this week that the United States had conducted a deadly military strike against an alleged drug boat tied to the cartel Tren de Aragua. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie warned that blocking his efforts to circumvent party leaders and force a vote on his bill to release all Jeffrey Epstein-related files would be “really bad for Republicans.” “I care most about the policy here, not the politics of it, but politically it's really bad for Republicans,” he told CNN's Manu Raju. “They should just have this vote and put it behind them. It's not just Independents and Democrats who want these files released. Massie confirmed that House Speaker Mike Johnson, in a closed-door meeting, urged House Republicans not to support his discharge petition, to instead support a resolution backing the House Oversight Committee, “and he assured them he would give them political cover, that they would have it by voting for the rule.” He later told CNN that his “message was to my colleagues. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday appeared supportive of Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer subpoenaing other government agencies for Epstein-related records. I think the Oversight probe is going to be wide and expansive, and they're going to follow the truth wherever it leads,” he told reporters Wednesday. He, again, argued that GOP Rep. Thomas Massie's discharge petition “has been made moot and unnecessary” because of the Oversight Committee's work and last night's release of DOJ documents. “What we're going to do is effectively deputize the Oversight Committee, which is the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, to go do a deep dive on this. And I think they're going to uncover things that have never been uncovered before,” he said. “There's a couple of different ideas on the table and we have to build consensus on that, ‘cause you got to do it responsibily. But we have lots of different opinions on that in the conference and in Congress, so we got to work through it,” he told reporters. And what we have to do to sell it is tell the truth, and that's the beauty of it,” he said. US President Donald Trump welcomed Polish President Karol Nawrocki, a former historian and populist firebrand, to the Oval Office on Wednesday, after he endorsed the conservative politician earlier this year. “Polish-American relations are very important, very strong,” Nawrocki said from the Oval Office, adding that relations are stronger than ever. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse PiS's illiberal reforms have become challenging since Nawrocki's election, in part because the Polish president enjoys far-reaching veto powers over bills passed by parliament. Last week, Nawrocki blocked a bill that would extend social welfare payments to Ukrainian refugees living in the country. Nawrocki also gave a shoutout to the large Polish diaspora in the United States, claiming that most of them voted for Trump. Brad Edwards, a lawyer for numerous victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Wednesday that Donald Trump helped him with his investigation of the case back in 2009 as he implored the president to back survivors' current-day push for transparency. For his part, Trump called the latest push from lawmakers and victims of the disgraced financier a “Democrat hoax.” But Edwards said that was not Trump's posture more than a decade ago. At the time, Trump was not in public office and Epstein had just been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison for his crimes as part of a plea deal that has since faced criticism for being too lenient. “So at this point in time, I would hope that he would revert back to what he was saying to get elected, which is, ‘I want transparency. Both active in the Palm Beach social scene, Trump and Epstein flew together on a private jet and partied side by side at Mar-a-Lago. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Edwards assertion. President Donald Trump issued a warning Wednesday when asked about his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other,” Trump said from the Oval office. “Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it or unhappy, and if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen,” the president added in what appeared to be a veiled threat. Trump grew visibly agitated when questioned about the administration's actions – or lack there of – so far against Russia. Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside of China, they're almost equal. “If you remember two weeks ago, I did, I said, if India buys, India's got big problems, and that's what happens. So don't tell me about that,” Trump added. Despite repeated threats, the Trump administration has so far been reluctant to slap further sanctions on Russia in its continued efforts to reach a peace deal. President Donald Trump insisted Wednesday that he would avert a government shutdown later this month, even as he predicted no Democrats would back the GOP's funding measure. “We won't have any Democrat votes,” he said, adding that even if he devised the “greatest budget ever,” Republicans “wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats, because they've lost their mind.” Trump offered no explanation of how he plans to pass a funding bill along partisan lines, since the GOP doesn't hold the necessary 60 Senate votes to approve legislation on its own. Democrats have said that they plan to demand concessions from the White House in exchange for supporting a bipartisan measure before government funding expires at the end of September. Trump officials, however, have signaled little willingness to negotiate. Trump did appear to acknowledge his remarks could make those talks more difficult, attacking Democrats even as he acknowledged that “I don't want to burn the Republican Party with it.” “No matter what we did, no matter how good, you could give them everything that they've ever dreamed of and you wouldn't get one vote,” Trump said of Democrats. President Donald Trump said he would talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “over the next few days” when a reporter asked about the US leader's two-week deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart. “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said without specifying which leader he meant while taking questions in the Oval Office. A White House official later clarified that Trump was referring to Zelensky. “I'll be speaking with him over the next few days and we're going to see,” Trump added. Trump said on August 22 that he would give Putin “a couple of weeks” before enacting potential consequences against Moscow, after urging Putin and Zelensky to meet directly in hopes of ending the war. Meanwhile, momentum around peace talks has stalled, with no sign that the Putin-Zelensky meeting the White House has pushed is happening. Putin this week floated a meeting in Moscow, which Kyiv has dismissed as an unserious proposal. President Donald Trump floated the possibility of a federal crime crackdown in New Orleans, pointing to support from the state's Republican governor. “We're making a determination now: do we go to Chicago, or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland. He continued, “So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. Trump has repeatedly floated Baltimore and Chicago as the next cities his administration could target following his deployment of the National Guard to Washington, DC, and a federal takeover of the DC police department. Wes Moore, both Democrats, have strongly pushed back against such intervention. DC is also significantly different from other cities because the federal government has more authority. Trump later again pointed to Baltimore as a city the federal government could “straighten out.” Moore wanted me to go and walk through Baltimore with him. … We'd go into Baltimore, straighten that out very quickly, too,” he said. “This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday. The president's remarks came as a group of Epstein abuse survivors gathered on Capitol Hill to speak out publicly in favor of releasing all the documents related to the investigation with appropriate redactions for privacy. One of them, Haley Robson, took direct aim at Trump's assertion, saying “there is no hoax. But Trump bristled at the fresh effort to get the files released, which has been spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, arguing that it's distracting from his administration's successes. “We're having the most successful eight months of any president ever, and that's what I want to talk about. That's what we should be talking about, not the Epstein hoax. An attorney for numerous Jeffrey Epstein survivors said they will hold Speaker Mike Johnson and lawmakers accountable related to the Epstein case. “I can tell you that in the Oversight Committee meeting yesterday, they indicated that they were all for transparency, releasing the files, and asked us to hold them accountable. … So we intend to hold them accountable,” Brad Edwards said at the news conference today. “I understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching – and I was watching,” Trump said of the event, where Chinese President Xi Jinping stood with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. “My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland. Trump hosted Putin in Alaska last month to discuss an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, followed by a meeting with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. But frustrated with the pace of peace talks since, Trump has weighed how involved he should personally be. Meanwhile, Putin has been embraced on the world stage this week. The show of force in China caught the attention of Trump, who posted on social media Tuesday telling Xi to give his “warmest regards” to Putin and Kim as they “conspire against” the US. Trump said he thought it was a “beautiful ceremony” and “very impressive.” “Us Epstein survivors have been discussing creating our own list. Many of us were abused by them,” Phillips said at today's news conference on Capitol Hill. “Now together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know who were regularly in the Epstein world. Phillips told reporters at the news conference to “stay tuned for more details.” Haley Robson, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse, pushed back against President Donald Trump's previous comments calling the firestorm around the Epstein case a “Democrat hoax.” Asked by reporter about the president's past comments, Robson said: However, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax. Sky Roberts, Virginia Giuffre's brother, made an emotional plea to lawmakers to make the right choice and seek justice for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse. “But here's my one ask: Look these survivors in the eye and tell them why. Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Epstein's sex crimes, who also alleged Britain's Prince Andrew abused her when she was a teenager, died by suicide in April at age 41, her family said. Roberts said that the issue is not a political one. “Whether you're a dad, a mom, a brother or a sister, look your young ones in the face, look them in the eye and tell them you didn't stand against the very people who raped, molested and preyed upon children and young women. Tell them you were willing to negotiate a deal. Money should never be what makes something right or wrong. If you vote no, your stance will be clear,” he said.

The only reason that I am here is because it feels like the people who matter in this country finally care about what we have to say,” Lacerda said, speaking from Capitol Hill alongside other victims and members of Congress. Lacerda said she was a 14-year-old immigrant from Brazil working three jobs to support her mother and sister when she was introduced to Epstein and told that she could make $300 to give massages. Lacerda said she had to be at Epstein's New York City apartment so often that she dropped out of high school before ninth grade. “It went from a dream job to the worst nightmare,” she recounted. “The worst part is that the government is still in possession right now of the documents and information about … that could help me remember and get over all of this maybe, and help me heal. They have documents with my name on them,” Lacerda said. “We could have saved so many women,” Lacerda said. “Why didn't they let me testify to help stop him?” If you need help, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), text HOPE to 64673 or chat through its website.</p>

Novak Djokovic, a fan favorite at the U.S. Open, blew kisses to an unusually hostile crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium late Tuesday night after he defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets to advance to the semifinals. Novak Djokovic argues with the chair umpire during his quarterfinal match of the U.S. Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sept. 2, 2025. Fritz supporters continued to cheer for faults by Djokovic, and in the third set, when the match had surpassed 10:30 p.m., the Serbian tennis star had had enough. "What are you going to do?" The crowd booed as Djokovic mocked Dumusois' attempts to silence the crowd: "Thank you. Dumusois appealed to Djokovic that, regardless of his interjection, "It's not going to help, Novak." Novak Djokovic gestures to the crowd during a match against Taylor Fritz (not pictured) on day 10 of the U.S. Open at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sept. 2, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un stood together publicly for the first time at a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II. In reaction, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US. • The parade showcased hundreds of advanced weapons and featured more than 10,000 troops, revealing China's growing military power under Xi's push to modernize the world's largest standing army. After a busy few days hosting foreign leaders from around the world, China rounded out events on Wednesday with an enormous military parade, followed by an elaborate musical gala. For the first time, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood side-by-side publicly, watching the military parade roll by in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Xi greeted a number of World War II veterans who were also in attendance before the spectacle began. “Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, working tirelessly to comprehensively advance China's development and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization,” it said. A total of 26 foreign leaders have traveled to China in the last few days, with some attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Sunday and Monday, and others arriving for the country's military parade in Beijing that took place on Wednesday. Here's some of the other officials who were in attendance: Retired Navy Admiral and CNN military analyst, James Stavridis, weighed in on the united front presented by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at today's parade. “If I were advising Vladimir Putin I would say, be careful what you wish for with China,” Stavridis told John Berman on CNN News Central. “Because you are ultimately going to end up as a very junior partner in that relationship.” The former naval officer believes the display of solidarity between China's President and Putin is an orchestrated move, part of Xi's wider effort to establish an alternative world order that can challenge the US and its Western allies. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said that Donald Trump claiming there is a “conspiracy” against the United States shows that the US president has a “sense of humor.” After the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea met in China, Trump wrote Tuesday on Truth Social to Chinese leader Xi Jinping: “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” Speaking Wednesday in Beijing, Putin said “the US president does not lack a sense of humor.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is willing to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Moscow. “Donald asked me if it was possible to hold such a meeting. In the end, if Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow. Earlier in his speech, the Russian leader stressed that he “never ruled out” meeting Zelensky, but questioned whether there is “any point” in such a meeting. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukrainian authorities say they have foiled multiple alleged Russian plots to assassinate Zelensky. Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking to the media in Beijing now after attending China's military parade, where he appeared alongside leader Xi Jinping and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un. Russian President Vladimir Putin is enjoying another moment in the international spotlight on his visit to China, using the occasion to showcase his partnership with a key military ally: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The massive military parade in Beijing Wednesday was Chinese leader Xi Jinping's show, but Putin also met on the sidelines with Kim, who has sent both soldiers and ammunition to support Russia's war on Ukraine. Putin praised Pyongyang on Wednesday for sending troops, saying North Korean soldiers “fought courageously and heroically” on the front lines against Ukrainian forces. After a two-and-a-half hour meeting with Kim following the parade, the two leaders shared a hug, and Putin was heard extending an invitation to his North Korean counterpart to visit Russia. Western officials estimate around 4,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting on Russia's side from a contingent of around 12,000, deployed primarily to Russia's Kursk border region to help repel a Ukrainian incursion. Kim recently publicly mourned his country's casualties and North Korea has released a propaganda video glorifying the soldiers fighting on Russia's side. It's a not-so-subtle display of military resolve by Putin just weeks after meeting US President Donald Trump in Alaska to talk about a possible end to the war. According to a Kremlin translation of Cuong's remarks, the Vietnamese leader told Putin that “every Vietnamese citizen values ​​the great and kind assistance that the Soviet Union and Russia provided us before, when we fought for our freedom, and now, when we are building our country.” We believe (in it) and wish you success,” he continued, according to the Kremlin. More than 50,000 people gathered at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Wednesday to witness Xi Jinping's staggering show of military might. Moscow hopes US President Donald Trump's claim that Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping are conspiring against America was meant “figuratively,” the Kremlin has said. As China's military parade got underway in Beijing, Trump posted on Truth Social: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” Speaking to journalists on the sidelines following the Putin-Kim summit Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “no one is plotting any conspiracies” and expressed hope Trump's statement was meant “figuratively, not literally.” Peskov also added Russia's relations with partners in the East, especially with China and North Korea, as well as meetings within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and other summits, are carried out for the good of their nations, and not against anyone. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said earlier Wednesday: “I want to say that no conspiracies have been arranged, no one has been conspiring, no conspiracies at all, and moreover, none of these three leaders have even entertained such thoughts.” Turning our attention back to China's military parade for a moment and let's take a look now at some of the most standout images of the weapons showcased on Wednesday. China introduced its newest intercontinental ballistic missiles in years, wheeling the massive DF-61 weapons around on mobile platforms. Air-defense lasers were displayed, including one large laser that state-run TV said would be mounted on warships. A land version of the weapon was also shown to spectators. Two extra-large undersea drones also debuted at the parade, with images showing them dwarfing nearby soldiers. Chinese leader Xi Jinping's unveiling of advanced weapons at Wednesday's military parade, which included an intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs, was a way of sending a message to the West, a leading military analyst told CNN today. “China is moving much more rapidly in this critical military technology area than the United States is.” Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in an interview with Rosemary Church earlier. Davis sees Xi's showcase of weaponry and display of solidarity with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a warning to the West, particularly regarding Taiwan. “China is saying to Taiwan, we will impose unification on Taiwan, against the wishes of the Taiwanese people, through military force at a time of our choosing and we're building up the military capabilities to do that.” Davis added. For context: At Wednesday's parade, Xi presented a united front alongside Putin and Kim. Xi Jinping staged a staggering show of China's military power today, rallying some of the world's most powerful authoritarian leaders behind his vision for a new world order as US President Donald Trump wages a global trade war and reshapes American alliances. Military spectacle: The parade showcased a mix of conventional weaponry and advanced technologies, including air-defense lasers, stealth fighter jets, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs – highlighting China's significant investment in modern warfare capabilities. It was a clear statement of unity between the strongman leaders, who share a vision for an alternative world order that can counter the US and its Western partners. Putin invites Kim to Russia: After the parade, the two leaders held closed-door talks for more than two hours, and Putin invited Kim to visit Russia. Before those talks, Putin thanked North Korean troops for fighting for Moscow against Ukraine, and Kim said his country would support Russia “as brothers.” Trump weighs in: US President Donald Trump wrote a sarcastic social media post as the parade got underway, saying: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” A Russian presidential aide responded by saying: “No one has been conspiring.” A Kremlin pool reporter captured some behind-the-scenes color from the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after attending China's massive military parade Wednesday morning. After the meeting, Yunashev added, “Putin and Kim left the office very satisfied and went to drink tea in a more relaxed atmosphere.” Let's take a look back at some of the most striking images from the parade - those featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The three leaders stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing on Wednesday, in what marked the first time they have been pictured publicly together. The speaker of South Korea's parliament, Woo Won-shik, shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before the two watched a Chinese military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, marking the first known contact between Kim and a South Korean official since June 2019. In that year, Kim met with then-US president Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in at the Panmunjom, located within the Demilitarized Zone.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A roundtable discussion among leading MAGA intellectuals suggests they might be suffering from success. What happens when you put four of the Trump right's leading intellectuals together in a room? You see what it looks like when a political movement gets high on its own supply. The conversation in question is a recently published two-hour video roundtable hosted by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an organization dedicated to educating and connecting young conservatives. The panelists are tech monarchist Curtis Yarvin, “postliberal” political theorist Patrick Deneen, the culture war activist Chris Rufo, and globetrotting journalist Christopher Caldwell. Since, however, each has become a defining figure in the pro-Trump coalition. Deneen is a major influence on Vice President JD Vance. Yarvin is opposed, repeatedly suggesting that the US take lessons from French autocrats like Louis XIV and Napoleon. The other panelists disagree, arguing that it's possible to build a better America by making the current system more right-wing. But what's actually important is how much all four of them agree about what a “more right-wing” America should look like. “We all have strong opinions — agreements, disagreements — but it all seems like we're moving in the same direction,” Rufo says near the roundtable's end. Yarvin's authoritarian provocations aren't immediately dismissed or scorned by his co-panelists, but serve as a conversational focal point that permits the others to indulge their own radicalism. Their shared ambition is explicitly revolutionary, aiming not merely to transform the government but also to remake the very souls of American citizens. “And not just replace the government, but replace the America that — in some ways — fostered and brought it into being.” To understand not just how radical, but how weird the pro-Trump right has become, take these three moments from the conversation: On the one hand, Yarvin says, you have “modern” Americans who flourish in a society that gives them control over the direction of their own lives. On the other hand, you have “pre-modern” Americans who “cannot take care of themselves in a civilized society.” He picks, as an example of the latter, “a gangbanger in Baltimore” — and proceeds to propose a flagrantly illegal scheme for putting their entire life under control of a local church: What he's describing, in short, is the government turning Black men who it labels “gangbangers” into serfs whose lives are fully managed by state-blessed churches. This isn't a call to reinstitute slavery, but it's pretty damn close. Not one person says, “Hey, what you're talking about is both a gross violation of human rights and quite a bit racist.” In fact, the rest of the panel takes Yarvin's ideas and runs with them. The state of Maryland cannot legally turn the population of Baltimore into church property because that would effectively establish a religion. After pointing this out, Caldwell then suggests repealing the 14th Amendment. It's not exactly clear if he thinks that's a good idea, or suggesting it's a big problem for Yarvin that his plan would require something as big as repealing an amendment. Before Caldwell can fully clarify, Deneen interjects with a different proposal: for the Supreme Court to un-incorporate the First Amendment. He wants, quite explicitly, for the Court to allow states to make certain religions official and privileged — describing this as a way that people can live together in a divided country. “Religion, in the original Constitution, was officially established,” Deneen declares (dubiously). It is that Yarvin's bizarre ramblings about Baltimore, which should be dismissed by any sensible person, were instead used as a jumping-off point for various other radical schemes designed to transform the American social compact. Ron DeSantis — whose tenure, nearly everyone agreed, prefigured the aggressive use of political power Trump is currently deploying. Rufo worked closely with DeSantis, particularly his attempt to impose state controls on higher ed, and spent much of his conversation singing the governor's praises. His biggest critique, in fact, was that DeSantis erred strategically by running against Trump. “He would have been better off saying, ‘Hey, I'm very popular, Florida should repeal term limits and I will rule Florida for 25 years,'” Rufo moots. Not to be outdone, Yarvin proposes that DeSantis should have ramped up his “heresies” against American liberalism “by 10x” or even “100x.” He suggests DeSantis should have established “a branch of the Boy Scouts, where they're the Florida Scouts, where they wear Florida uniforms.” As with the Baltimore discussion, nobody is willing to directly attack Yarvin on the obvious grounds: In this case, that totalitarian youth indoctrination shouldn't be a model for policy in 21st-century America. Remarkably, Rufo tries to defend DeSantis by arguing that he actually did something like what Yarvin wanted — specifically by reviving the Florida State Guard, a state militia that had been inactive since 1947. Caldwell did challenge Yarvin somewhat, arguing that “not every reform benefits from being deptupled.” But note that his objection was not the direction of change — authoritarian — but rather the size and speed of the change. Nearly an hour and a half into the video, the panelists get into an argument about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Their debate was about the wisdom of using “efficiency” as window dressing. Caldwell argues that Musk's talk of efficiency was a “necessary smoke screen” to hide its true purpose from the public. Had the Trump administration been honest about DOGE's true purpose, which is firing anyone who disagreed with it, they would have faced significant mass resistance. Rufo, largely backed by Deneen and Yarvin, takes exception. He claims that Trump and Musk should have openly claimed that they had a mandate to remove liberals from the state, to conduct a “systematic extirpation” of anyone in the federal government who might have qualms about their agenda. So he gets to determine who is in his administration,” Rufo says. There are moments, in the conversation, where it appears as if Caldwell is willing to question this premise. “It's a corrosive thing to say that you can't work in the federal government if you believe this-or-that,” he says. But challenged by Rufo, who explicitly endorses such a political test for public employment, he reverts back to the public relations argument — saying the problem with Rufo's position is that “it doesn't command majority support.” He has repeatedly written favorably about foreign right-wing authoritarians, like Viktor Orbán and Narendra Modi. In his book on civil rights, he writes that white people “fell asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.” His willingness to give on the DOGE question reflects the fact that he is, in fact, no moderate — he is a radically aggressive culture warrior, just one who is somewhat less open about his authoritarian means than Yarvin or Rufo (who explicitly describes himself in the conversation as producing “propaganda” professionally). I would call it a mask-off moment for the right's intellectual cadres. But I think the mask has been off for quite some time. Bronze Age Pervert is an influential voice on the extreme right. Now he's trying to change the administration's economic approach. Lawrence Dennis predicted America would fall to fascism in the 1930s.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography,” Noem said in a statement, noting at least one FEMA official consumed “racially charged” pornography that “involved bestiality.” The Washington Examiner contacted DHS for confirmation on how many workers were fired for consuming pornography on the job. “Under President [Donald] Trump's leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” Noem added. In July, the DHS Insider Threat Operations Center first identified an employee who used sexually charged language on a chatbot website that read the comments back in an accent. One month later, the DHS center determined a government contractor stationed at the FEMA location accessed Reddit nearly 600 times over the course of a month and engaged in sexually explicit conversations online. Some of the content accessed included sexually graphic photos and videos, according to DHS. Following its investigation, the department also noted that nearly half of FEMA employees frequently log into social media platforms while working. Since taking office, Noem has been winding down operations at FEMA as Trump threatened to dismantle the agency. Just last week, DHS announced that she had fired two dozen employees in FEMA's IT department who “brazenly neglected basic security protocols.” Their ineptitude was said to have caused “massive cyber failures,” including an agency-wide lack of multi-factor authentication when logging in. A new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found roughly 2,500 FEMA employees have left the agency between January and June, a 10% decrease in its workforce.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California lawmakers are racing to push through dozens of new bills over the next two weeks aimed at stopping President Donald Trump's agenda, including efforts he has made to restrict abortion access, limit LGBT rights, and carry out mass deportations. The bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D-CA), is in direct response to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication. “[Assembly Bill] 260 is about ensuring Californians have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from political agendas,” Majority Leader Aguiar-Curry said. Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have enacted strict abortion bans. “AB 260 positions California as a bulwark against these changes, ensuring state-level protections remain intact amid federal uncertainty,” Aguiar-Curry said, adding that the bill would also shield abortion medication providers from civil penalties, criminal prosecution, and professional discipline. Newsom called Kennedy's plan to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication “another attack on women's reproductive freedom and scientifically-reviewed health care.” AB54, called the Access to Safe Abortion Care Act, would reaffirm that it is lawful to mail, ship, take, receive, or otherwise transport any drug, medicine, or instrument that can be designed or adapted to produce an abortion that is lawful in California. California Democrats are also taking aim at Trump's immigration policies and his plan to carry out mass deportations. Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled Trump had broken federal law when he turned nearly 5,000 soldiers into a national police force. Senate Bill 627, for example, would prohibit law enforcement agents from covering their faces to obscure their identity, carving out exceptions for SWAT teams and undercover officers. Another bill, SB805, would require officers to display their IDs with their name and badge numbers and limit the instances in which bounty hunters can get involved with immigration enforcement. “In a normal world, this legislation would be unnecessary and unheard of,” state Sen. Sasha Renée Péres (D-CA), the bill's author, said in a statement. “With the rise in impersonation claims and the ensuing fear and confusion being created, there is a clear need for strong, more consistent standards for law enforcement identification. This legislation is not just raising the issue; it aims to directly address it by reaffirming the state's role under its policing powers.” There is also a heavy emphasis in the state legislature to protect schools from handing over information to federal immigration authorities unless they have a court order or warrant. Other bills require schools to inform parents that their children are entitled to free public education regardless of immigration status and that the schools must notify them when immigration officers are on site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Protecting astronauts in space — and maybe even Mars — will help transform health on Earth. One day, Mars might become a home to humans. There's a problem, though: The typical person can't get to space safely. That throws a wrench into the whole “let's move to Mars” plan in the face of extreme climate change and other existential risks on Earth. “Once upon a time, kids being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the doctor's office would be told, ‘Well, you could still be anything, except an astronaut. Here are some of the common reasons why you might be medically disqualified from becoming an astronaut: Astronauts inherently aren't representative of the broader population — they're selected for being in very good health. Astronauts face heightened risks of early-onset osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and significant muscle mass loss. Naturally, government space agencies want people whose bodies are more resilient to such pressures, and who can perform necessary duties without a ton of medical intervention. According to Haig Aintablian, director of the UCLA Space Medicine Program, “just as pregnancy causes the body to undergo complex and unique changes, spaceflight also produces distinct and significant physiological changes.” It also requires its own medical specialty to manage (aptly called space medicine). That's a problem — for the future of science, space travel, and maybe even human existence at large. As the most similar planet to Earth in our solar system, Mars may have once harbored life, or may even currently. And in the future, we may even need it to support us. Decades ago, seriously engaging with the idea of moving to Mars was extremely fringe for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a lack of technical feasibility to the desire to put scientific resources toward solving problems on Earth. Musk, who is currently worth around $410 billion, claims that he is only accumulating assets for the purpose of Martian space settlement. NASA experts, biologists, academics, futurists, disaster resilience researchers, and physicians are seriously considering the possibility of making humanity an interplanetary species. “I don't think there's a better solution than Mars.” — thinks that settling Mars on Musk's timescale will be catastrophic. She argues that we shouldn't rush to set up shop before understanding — and mitigating — the risks, even if this takes centuries rather than decades. But many advocates for settling Mars are much more impatient. The only way to get there safely would be to unlock significant advances in space medicine, a nascent field that has just barely scratched the surface in its approximately 75-year history. “So much in our development as a civilization has been difficult, and the reason why we're able to live such comfortable lives now is because of the extremely difficult challenges that humans have had to solve in the past.” NASA researchers have identified some key ways that time in space can impact human health — radiation exposures, isolation, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and environmental consequences like an altered immune system. But we're still lacking many specific examples of how these different dynamics play out in real life. One of the best studies we have is NASA's famous 2019 twins study. Twin studies allow researchers to separate the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental influences on health outcomes. Scott's telomeres — the bits of DNA at the end of our chromosomes — lengthened while he was in space and (mostly) reverted to normal once he returned to Earth, possibly indicating radiation-induced DNA damage and potential increased cancer risk. Scott also lost body mass, developed signs of cardiovascular damage that were not present in Mark, and experienced some short-term cognitive changes after returning to Earth. While survivable with the right training, equipment, and precautions, the twin study demonstrated how space's unique environment can have significant consequences for gene expression and overall health while in orbit. Aintablian is very excited about the prospect of civilian access to space increasing, which will inherently mean people with medical issues are also flying. Earth's global magnetic field protects our planet from harmful radiation, and the Martian counterparts are localized, not planet-wide. Mars is usually around 140 million miles from Earth based on its orbital path around the sun, with up to a 20-minute communication delay one way. If they experienced a medical emergency, astronauts likely wouldn't be able to access telemedicine instructions in time, and they couldn't turn back around for treatment. Getting to Mars is only part of the challenge. We are making educated guesses at what Mars is like for living things. Earth analogues aren't able to truly replicate the closed, hostile conditions of the space environment, which can wreak havoc on astronauts' mental health. Desert research stations have an atmosphere, while the moon barely has one — and setting up that modest base was a huge mission in its own right. Weinersmith told me that scientists at polar research stations are isolated in remote, inhospitable environments, but they can “still open the door, take a deep breath, and not die.” We're still pretty far from being able to breathe in Mars' atmosphere — but it would be nice to get there one day and simply not die. Programs dedicated to figuring out how to get humans safely into space for long periods of time are popping up, and non-physician health care providers are getting in on the action too. SpaceMed is a European master's program focused on human health in spaceflight and other extreme conditions. Today, astronauts receive most of their care from Earth-based aerospace medicine physicians called flight surgeons through telemedicine. Aintablian envisions a future where health care providers directly accompany astronauts on their expedition-class missions, like to the moon or Mars. Artificial intelligence can act as a resource for the on-board flight surgeon, he predicted, and aid in the development of other technologies that will bring us closer to Mars. Google recently collaborated with NASA to develop an AI system that could guide astronauts in diagnosing and treating medical conditions that arise in-flight when they lack access to telemedicine. AI can help with just-in-time training for medical emergencies and diagnostics, but the data requirements would be massive. Since extremely few people end up in space — and the ones who do are overwhelmingly male — models might be trained on an unrepresentative dataset that could lead to inaccurate predictions of physiological changes in space. Right now, there's a gendered gap in the research — so much so that Weinersmith told me there's never a line to the women's restroom at space settlement conferences. Human reproduction and development in space, as a result, is wildly understudied. As far as we know, no human being has ever been to space while pregnant, and we don't know of any humans who have been conceived in space. Ideally, you want to have an idea of what will happen to someone giving birth in space before they actually go through it. “What we're arguing is that we should do the research to understand those risks before we go out there because if there are massive risks, there usually are technological solutions for some of these,” Weinersmith said. NASA will begin its second Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog this October, a year-long “mission” to Mars in a 3D-printed habitat at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it will collect behavioral health data on the effects of isolation and confinement. Scientists are conducting bed rest studies, which simulate the physiological effects of altered gravity and weightlessness. Maedeh Mozneb, a biomedical engineer and project scientist in the Sharma Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told me that the ultimate goal is to send “avatars” of astronauts to space by taking their stem cells and creating 3D tissue cultures called organoids that represent different parts of their body — yes, miniature hearts, kidneys, and even brains made from Earth-dwelling humans. From there, scientists can determine personalized countermeasures such as workout plans or supplements tailored to each astronaut's needs, before they actually end up in space. The hope, for those space medicine physicians like Pandya, is that in a spacefaring future, all medical disciplines — from neurology to radiology — will be represented in space medicine. “I often get asked,” said Pandya, “‘Why are you spending money on space health when we have all of these problems on Earth? '” But that's the wrong way to think about it, she said. Research conducted in space has already improved health on this planet. Advances in digital imaging for moon photography during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission later played a crucial role in CT scans and MRIs. This could eventually allow diabetics to check their blood sugar in space. It has implications for current astronauts, who can develop insulin resistance and pre-diabetes symptoms in longer-duration spaceflights. The child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes who wants to be an astronaut may actually have the chance to live out their dream now, and studying how the body metabolizes glucose in space helps us better understand health on Earth. Then there are the diseases that take decades to unfold. Muscle loss in space can help scientists better understand how to treat conditions like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. On Earth, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's often aren't apparent until a person is in their late 60s. In microgravity, said Shelby Giza, the director of business development at Space Tango, a company that facilitates automated research and development in microgravity conditions, “you can see that kind of disease output in a matter of weeks.” Research on these conditions can be conducted much faster — and hopefully accelerate the pace of medical breakthroughs. According to former NASA astronaut and biologist Kate Rubins, most astronauts are healthy people in their 30s and 40s, an age when cancer typically doesn't develop. Scientists must track astronauts for decades after their last spaceflight to see if cancer or other adverse health conditions occur. NASA's Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health program, which is voluntary for former astronauts and not specific to cancer alone, monitors the health status of people like Kelly and Rubins for the rest of their lives. One of the next big things in space medicine “is probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,” Aintablian told me. “I do believe that with the amount of emphasis being placed on radiation protection, we're going to figure out ways to actually protect against significant amounts of radiation for the general public for multiple uses.” While it's still relatively early days for the space pharma industry, life science companies are taking note, seeing microgravity as a platform for better drug discovery. Like fiber optic cables used for telecommunications, some pharmaceuticals are better synthesized in microgravity conditions. Raphael Roettgen, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of space biotech startup Prometheus Life Technologies, told me that organoids — those 3D cell models replicating human organs — grow more cleanly in space without Earth's gravity weighing them down. Derived from non-embryonic stem cells, these miniature organ models have tremendous potential for personalized medicine. Eventually, he hopes that new organs could be regenerated for patients needing transplants. Since the new tissue would be derived from the patient's own stem cells, there would not be a risk of immune rejection, saving transplant patients astronomical costs and immense suffering. He estimates that liver regeneration and transplants from these organoids could become a reality in patients within the next 20 years. Microgravity is an “expensive tool,” but an important one nonetheless, said Mozneb, who studies the effects of low earth orbit on stem cell differentiation. She hopes increasing commercialization and new technologies will significantly decrease the cost of launching experiments into orbit over the next 10 years. What we already know about space medicine is a drop in the ocean of what we will discover as more people — astronauts and otherwise — venture into space. “It's like if you were studying genetics back in the '90s,” Mozneb said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is escalating his tough-on-crime campaign against Democrats, particularly those considering 2028 presidential bids, ahead of an expected illegal immigration crackdown in Chicago on Friday. Trump's pressure campaign comes as his federalization of the California National Guard this summer was deemed illegal by a federal court judge on Tuesday. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson last weekend for their inability to decrease crime, as Pritzker complained about the lack of communication between his office and the federal government amid reports of the prospective illegal immigration raids and Johnson signing an executive order directing the Chicago Police Department not to help its federal counterparts. Pritzker needs help badly; he just doesn't know it yet. During his first public appearance in days, Trump on Tuesday confirmed plans to surge federal law enforcement to Chicago but downplayed when. To that end, Trump has implored Pritzker to welcome the National Guard, in part because of legal restraints underscored by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's decision on Tuesday finding that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law, the Posse Comitatus Act, by federalizing the California National Guard and deploying U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in June to respond to anti-illegal immigration raid protests. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits presidents from using the military for domestic law enforcement, with Trump aides emphasizing that any federal law enforcement operations in Chicago would be immigration-centric. “President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in,” Kelly said. “While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the president is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.” Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump's appeals based on high crime rates in Democratic-led cities. Trump's focus on crime is similar to his crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border when he first came into office, according to Matt Dole, a GOP strategist in Ohio. “He did not come in and say: here's the 10-year road map to fix illegal immigration. He came in, he said: Start arresting and deporting people today, and take whatever resources you need to do it,” Dole said. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) has distinguished herself by deploying the New Mexico Guard in Albuquerque and Española in April to counter crime emergencies, including regarding fentanyl and juvenile offenses, by providing non-law enforcement assistance. Regardless, she has criticized Trump's federalization of the National Guard in California and Washington, D.C. by arguing her troops are unarmed, dressed in plain clothes, and do not undertake police-like responsibilities, such as riot control. Trump's tough-on-crime campaign started last month after former Department of Government Efficiency engineer Big Balls was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Dupont Circle, a wealthy Washington neighborhood. That 30-day public safety emergency is poised to expire next week, and Trump has previewed the prospect of extending it, though that would require congressional approval, which he is unlikely to obtain because it will need 60 votes in the Senate. The White House on Tuesday promoted how federalized law enforcement in Washington has so far resulted in 1,669 arrests, including 16 accused members of gangs such as MS-13 and TDA. The White House added that five missing children had been found and 50 homeless encampments had been removed, with as many as 3,200 federal employees deployed across 22 agencies. “President Trump's efforts to crack down on crime in DC have yielded tremendous results in such a short time – violent crime has plummeted and dangerous criminals are being removed from the streets every single night,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. The mayor's fellow Democrats should take note, working with President Trump means safer communities and less crime – no one in their right mind could seriously oppose that.” In a weekend pitch to Democratic governors concerning the National Guard, Trump cited Bowser's approval ratings, asserting they have improved because she endorsed his federalization of Washington's law enforcement. Bowser, however, has been scrutinized for not being more adversarial with Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll published last week found that 56% of registered voters opposed Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington. “The left's opposition to these efforts are driven purely by Trump Derangement Syndrome, because anyone who cared about the safety of American communities would look at the outstanding results in DC and want to replicate it nationwide,” a third White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, told the Washington Examiner. Trump signaled last month that Chicago, another city led by a Democratic mayor, would be the next federal target after the success in Washington. But he has not ruled out taking his crackdown on crime to other blue cities, including Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco, and New York City, following through on his yearslong attacks on urban enclaves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The potential for a showdown over crime in Chicago – not just between law enforcement and crooks but between the federal government and city leaders – is escalating. With US troops patrolling Washington, DC, after a similar National Guard deployment in June to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump is ramping up his rhetoric against predominantly Democratic cities, with a direct target on the nation's third-most populous. “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,” Trump said with typical hyperbole Tuesday morning on Truth Social. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Still, the White House refuses to coordinate with local law enforcement, Pritzker said this week, saying cooperation is a necessary step for fighting crime. And the state is ready to fight a troop deployment: “We will do everything possible to ensure that agents operating inside the confines of this state do so in a legal and ethical manner.” Pritzker's clash with Trump offers political test for Illinois governor Meanwhile, some residents – and at least one Democrat on the Chicago City Council – argue the National Guard could ease stress on police after a violent Labor Day weekend and say public safety “shouldn't be this partisan.” With no specific plans announced to send the US military to Chicago, here's what we know about violent crime there and what Trump could do soon: “We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,” Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson said Saturday. For now, a ramped-up immigration operation is the one thing the feds have confirmed: “ICE has informed our Illinois State Police Department that they are going to begin operations sometime later this week,” Democratic Lt. Gov. “First, Donald Trump is positioning federal agents and staging military vehicles on federal property, such as the Great Lakes naval base,” Pritzker said Tuesday. Residents should expect “unidentifiable” agents in unmarked vehicles with masks planning to raid Latino communities in the name of targeting “violent criminals,” despite a very small percentage of those targeted fitting that bill, Pritzker said. Sometimes they will detain, handcuff and haul away children,” he said. Any National Guard troop deployment in Illinois to fight crime is “not sustainable,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. “National Guard troops are not trained to do local law enforcement,” Raoul said. I would prefer more resources on that end than sending the military illegally into the streets of American cities against American citizens.” The back-and-forth followed a Labor Day weekend of deadly violence in Chicago worse than in the previous two years, with seven people shot to death, according to preliminary Chicago Police Department reports. In all, 56 victims were hit by gunfire, according to police reports. An eighth homicide victim recovered over the weekend from Lake Michigan died by drowning, the Cook County Coroner's Office told CNN; police have not said when they believe he was killed or why the case was classified as a homicide. These Chicago residents welcome extra help fighting crime but don't want Trump to send the National Guard Overall, violent crime is down 21.4% this year, city figures show. You have an incompetent mayor – grossly incompetent – and we'll straighten that out probably next,” he said in the Oval Office in late August. While the president has direct power over the DC National Guard and some authority over that capital city's police department because they are in a federally controlled district, he does not have the same power in states. “There's very little stopping this president from doing what he wants to do,” said Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and CNN senior law enforcement analyst. “But he'll find the legal environment and trying to replicate the same sort of surge of federal agents and the presence of National Guard troops very, very different in every city in this country that is not Washington, DC.” The National Guard played a limited security role, providing security to federal buildings and agents in a square-mile section of downtown where protests had become unruly. Local police, not guard members, responded when people violated a curfew declared by the mayor. Judge says Trump administration's use of US military in Los Angeles violated federal law Gavin Newsom mounted a challenge in court, and a federal judge agreed Tuesday the situation in Los Angeles did not rise to the sort of emergency that would give Trump power to federalize the National Guard. “President Trump and (Defense) Secretary (Pete) Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into service in other cities across the country … thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” wrote US District Judge Charles Breyer, a nominee of then-President Bill Clinton. “In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,” he added, a 19th-century law that generally prohibits the use of troops for domestic law enforcement purposes. Although Breyer issued a court order preventing that sort of National Guard action from being repeated in California, it does not apply to other states, so there's nothing in the decision that directly stops the president from activating it in Illinois. They can't sit in the living room or at the kitchen table because a bullet may come through,” said Rochelle Sykes, who lives in a neighborhood with the city's highest number of shooting victims per capita this year. Indeed, Chicago last year ended its contract with ShotSpotter, whose sound equipment is designed to detect shots fired even if police are never called. “There's a lot of things that go unreported,” Sykes said, “and these are things that us living in the neighborhood see every day.” “We are currently allowing officers to spend their eight-hour shift babysitting these locations when they could actually be in the neighborhoods, answering 911 calls,” Lopez told CNN. Others, however, say calling in the National Guard could make things worse. “The presence of military, for me, would put our communities in a situation where they feel like they are incarcerated,” said Cedric Hawkins, a resident of the southside Pullman neighborhood who has had nine relatives killed by gun violence. And many state and local officials are warning that the idea of using the military to deal with crime in US cities is not a precedent they want to set.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stepped off his armored green train in Beijing on Tuesday, greeted by Chinese officials shaking his hand and leading him down a red carpet, many observers noticed a young girl walking behind him, smiling politely, dressed in black with her hair tied in a bow. This is believed to be Kim Ju Ae, the leader's mysterious daughter. She's has made various public appearances over the years, mostly at military-related events, prompting speculation about why she's in Beijing and whether Kim could be preparing his future successor. The young girl's first public trip abroad is one of massive significance, at a parade where Chinese leader Xi Jinping will flaunt his military forces, and where her father will stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow autocrats including Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin – partnerships she may very well need to navigate one day. Little is known about Kim's daughter, whose first public appearance in 2022 confirmed her existence, after years of speculation. American basketball star Dennis Rodman revealed Kim had a baby called Ju Ae when he visited Pyongyang in 2013, telling The Guardian afterward, “I held their baby Ju Ae and spoke with (Kim's wife) as well.” There are varying reports about her exact age and birth year; it's widely estimated she's now a preteen or early teen, though that's largely based on Rodman's testimony, and it's not clear how many months old she was when he met the family. Kim's daughter was introduced to the world in true Kim style in 2022, accompanying her father as he oversaw the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Several more public appearances came in 2023 – mostly at military events, such as a military parade where she gazed out at rows of ICBMs in the capital Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un's daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, made her first public appearance outside North Korea, sparking speculation about her potential future as a leader. North Korea has been ruled as a hereditary dictatorship since its founding in 1948 by Kim Il Sung. Some have pointed to the way she's covered in North Korean state media – described as “beloved” and “respected” – as a sign that she may have special status. Bringing her to military events from an early age could be a way to prepare her for the realities of leading 1.3 million armed forces personnel, as well as cultivating trust and respect from those troops, experts have said. But others are skeptical – saying they've long believed that Kim's two other children would be chosen as successors instead. Her public appearances could also be a PR move to cultivate an image of Kim as a “family man” or “fatherly” figure, said Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of the center's Korea Program, in a 2024 interview with CNN. She pointed out that it would make sense for Kim to use his daughter for that purpose instead of his sons, because Rodman had already revealed her existence to the world – whereas even less is known about her siblings, who can still grow up out of the limelight.</p>
