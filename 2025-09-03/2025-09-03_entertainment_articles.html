Speaking about vaccine mandates on Wednesday, Ladapo said: “Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” adding: “Your body is a gift from God. DeSantis additionally announced the launch of a state MAHA Commission, named after the “Make America Healthy Again” slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary and one-time brain-worm haver Robert F.

It's been three years since Will Smith, on the night he won his first Academy Award for his performance in “King Richard,” changed his career forever (and for the worse) by slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage. Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and their company Westbrook have now signed a first-look deal with Paramount that will see Smith starring in and producing multiple features, ones the studio is labeling “global, four-quadrant theatrical movies.” Under the pact, Paramount has already announced two projects that are meant to star Smith and that the studio also hopes could be the start of new franchises. Westbrook will also get some fancy office space on the Paramount lot. Related Stories ‘Men of War' Trailer: Doc About a U.S. Merc Trying to Overthrow the Venezuelan Government Captures the Craziness of Our Times ‘Duse' Review: Valeria Bruni Tedeschi Is an Actress Possessed in Pietro Marcello's One-Note Biopic The film was previously set up at Universal but Paramount has acquired all rights and have it in development, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire. Hogan is the author of “Prince of Thieves,” which later became Ben Affleck's “The Town,” and “Devils in Exile,” originally published in 2010, is the story of an Iraq War veteran who begins running jobs ripping off drug dealers in Boston. And the second project is “Rabbit Hole,” which is an original screenplay being written by “Dune” scribe Jon Spaihts, though no details on that one just yet. It's a major opportunity and major shift in the industry perception of Smith, who did star in 2024's “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and has still proven to be a bankable star with that film (it made $404 million worldwide), but between a few films put into development with old collaborators like Michael Bay and some other notable projects set up at Westbrook, saying he's taken a step back is an understatement. It won a bid for a James Mangold project that would reunite him with Timothée Chalamet, it recently wrenched the Duffer Brothers away from Netflix to produce and direct films, series, and streaming properties, and it also this week inked a deal with video game developer Activision to bring the massive “Call of Duty” franchise to the screen. Smith is just another feather in their cap and proof that David Ellison and company aren't going to be shy about taking a few big swings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount Pictures continues its streak of high-profile deals, sealing a first-look, multi-picture deal with Will Smith and his company Westbrook. The terms encompass a first-look deal with a development commitment to franchise-starters positioned as starring vehicles for Smith, which include the thriller Sugar Bandits and Rabbit Hole. Westbrook will be based on the Paramount lot in Hollywood. Based on the book Devils in Exile by Chuck Hogan, Sugar Bandits follows a former Special Forces soldier who runs an elite vigilante squad working to wipe out the drug trade in Boston. Rabbit Hole will be penned by Dune scribe Jon Spaihts; plot details are unknown at this time. The deal marks another huge win for Paramount, which has been on a streak of luring big-time talent under new boss David Ellison. Last month, the Duffer brothers, who had a strong relationship with Netflix going back to the debut of Stranger Things, signed a four-year deal with Paramount last month that stunned the industry. Smith and Westbrook previously had their deal with Sony for decades. Paramount has also been busy on the content front, recently acquiring the rights to adapt a feature film based on the Activision video game series Call of Duty.

The Amazon-owned streamer has confirmed that Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner will play Lara Croft in its Tomb Raider series from creator, writer and co-showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As THR previously reported, Turner emerged as the frontrunner for the coveted role late last year from a short list of actresses that also included Mackenzie Davis, Emma Mackey and Lucy Boynton. Jonathan Van Tulleken (Dope Thief, Shōgun) has also signed on as director and executive producer. Taylor Kitsch Unpacks the Anger and Redemption in His 'Terminal List: Dark Wolf' Origin Story Peacock Coming to Prime Video in Wide-Ranging Deal Between Comcast and Amazon Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander took on the role in previous feature films. “I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said in a statement. Said Turner, “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.” Inside the business of TV with breaking news, expert analysis and showrunner interviews</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took awhile but Prime Video's Tomb Raider series is finally going to production. And Sophie Turner, who entered negotiations last November after testing for Lara Croft, is confirmed for the high-profile role previously played on the big screen by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander. 'Motorheads' Canceled By Prime Video After One Season, Looking For A New Home Amazon Shakeup: Head Of Sports Jay Marine Adds U.S. Business Oversight; Albert Cheng Takes On New AI-Focused Role That is exactly three years after word first emerged that Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Waller-Bridge had been tapped to write a Tomb Raider TV series under her overall deal with Amazon MGM Studios. That was followed by months of no new updates amid speculation about creative issues on the series which reportedly went through two writers rooms that didn't result in approved scripts. Hodge, creator of such series as Runaway, The Playboy Club, Wayward Pines and Good Behavior, was brought in as a consultant in the second room, sources said. That led to his appointment as executive-producer and showrunner. Meanwhile, Turner's schedule started filling up, putting a 2025 production start in doubt. “I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said. “It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Tomb Raider is based on the popular video game franchise, which follows the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft (Turner). We are thrilled to have the wonderfully talented Sophie Turner bring this character to life who is defined by her courage, strength, and unshakable resolve,” said Vernon Sanders, Head of Global Television, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios. “Led by the brilliant Phoebe Waller-Bridge, this series will honor the beloved Tomb Raider legacy while delivering fresh adventures to fans worldwide.” Turner, an Emmy nominee for her first major role as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones, recently headlined the British crime drama limited series Joan and the thriller movie Trust and next stars in another British show, The Dreadful. “I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”Waller-Bridge is represented by UTA, Independent Talent, McEwan & Penford, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Turner is repped by CAA and Independent Talent Group. Van Tulleken is repped by WME, Untitled, and Independent Talent. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Painting an attractively-composed picture of Italian theater legend Eleanora Duse (1858-1924), festival favorite Pietro Marcello has for his latest feature swapped an underdog striving to achieve — as seen in 2019's “Martin Eden” — for an achiever striving to maintain. In a post-war landscape where everything is uncertain, the decades-strong and since-retired actress Eleanora Duse (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) announces her return to the stage, signaling the start of a singular rise and a simultaneous fall; an ever-tightening grip on her passions whilst her relationships with those she loves and is loved by disintegrate around her. Related Stories We Want Filmmaker Chandler Levack to Be Our New Best Friend — Her ‘Mile End Kicks' Shows Why Hollywood Welcomes Back the Fresh Prince: Will Smith Has a New First-Look Deal with Paramount Hardly anything was recorded of her acting or voice, which is why Marcello — who has equally worked in documentary forms over the years — has opted for a fictitious exploration of her life. Bruni Tedeschi, who has a striking resemblance to historian Mary Beard in this role, plays Duse with a perpetually raised voice and wild-eyed fervor for theater that is, at first, uncomfortably parodic. When the stage is finally set for a rehearsal, doubts about Marcello's approach escalate. “I did not learn how to shout without losing my voice just to be told to lower it” yells Gabriele D'Annunzio (Fausto Russo Alesi), creative and romantic partner of Eleanora Duse, as he intimidates and educates a new member of the company. For the first act of Marcello's film, you would believe the director had imbibed this idea as a mantra for himself. It is hard to understand someone or grow sympathy for them when they won't stop yelling at you, and when all the world's a maximalist stage for the ensemble of “Duse,” an emotional response is hard to elicit. Stepping into this equation like a salve is Noémie Merlant, the film's standout performance and true emotional core, playing Eleanora's soft-spoken daughter, Enrichetta. Frequently pictured getting in and out of boats, the clear blue sea lapping behind her, she never stays long. In an almost-stirring early scene, she is denied entry to Duse's new play, forced to walk away tearfully with her kids in tow. It's a shame that the film's screenplay, penned by Marcello and co-writers Letizia Russo and Guido Silei, sidelines her just as Eleonora does. There's a real sense that “Duse” has been structured the wrong way around. The rise of fascism encroaches on her like a disease, culminating in a personal invitation from Mussolini himself, but we're dealt countless scenes of Eleonora's psychosis before we're granted a contextual explanation of what feeds it. Archival footage appears to be spliced between scenes in place of exterior establishing shots, but, if anything, these glimpses are frustratingly intriguing, allowing us to wonder what a deeper delve into the world surrounding Eleonora might have elucidated about her life and the theater she strives to perform. All this is presented in a continuous stream, where characters will note the passed time to each other, their conversations stretching across years in a matter of minutes to a disorienting effect which becomes poignant in the film's final act. Bruni Tedeschi is in a one-woman play for too long, and the film finally has a chance to sing as Merlant re-enters the picture. A cursory post-screening internet search of Eleonora Duse reveals that she dabbled in film acting, and almost worked with D.W. Griffith. In her later life, she was the partner of Lina Poletti, one of the first out lesbian women in Italy. But neither of these absent episodes fit the overly-neat, tried-and-tested narrative arc found in Marcello's film. There's an intriguing thread to pull on in the mother-daughter relationship, which could have been expanded on earlier — ultimately it is too little too late.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If that's high on your list of phobias, Jordan Peele and Universal have a scare in store for you. As is typical of Peele's work, there are no known details about the film's plot or cast. A source close to the project did tell Variety that Peele was at work on the film, so it seems like it's still happening—just a little later than originally planned. Cameras reportedly haven't rolled yet, so it could be a while until we hear anything definitive. Like Peele's prior films, this one is being described as a “horror thriller.” The director also spoke about it—albeit vaguely—on the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast in 2024. Peele has been keeping busy as a producer in the meantime. Last year, he helped rescue Dev Patel's Monkey Man from Netflix obscurity. Later this month, Universal will also release Justin Tipping's Him, a film he produced starring Tyriq Withers and Marlon Wayans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It all began with the 2013 original, depicting the exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. That indomitable duo is back for one last go-around in The Conjuring: Last Rites, and it must be said that they look tired. Not to mention that Ed suffered a heart attack in the last one, from which he is still recovering. As this installment set in 1986 begins, the couple are semi-retired, reduced to giving talks in virtually empty lecture halls to young people who are much more excited about Ghostbusters. The Warrens Face Their First Demon and Annabelle Doll Returns in 'Conjuring: Last Rites' Final Trailer Release date: Friday, September 5Cast: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Mia Tomlinson, Ben Hardy, Steve Coulter, Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Beau Gadson, Kila Lord Cassidy, John Brotherton, Shannon KookDirector: Michael ChavesScreenwriters: Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick It begins with an unnecessary prologue set in 1964 depicting the birth of the couple's daughter Judy, who nearly doesn't survive. When the action shifts forward 22 years, it resembles an old-fashioned television show, with the now-grown Judy (Mia Tomlinson) and her boyfriend Tony (Ben Hardy) arriving for a family get-together that includes much comic banter, a lively game of ping-pong, and Tony nervously asking Ed and Lorraine for their blessing before he proposes to their daughter. It soon becomes clear that Judy has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, leading her to become aware of the Smurl family's plight. Also aware is her parent's old friend Father Gordon (franchise veteran Steve Coulter), who goes to see a bishop to request help for the beleaguered family. Cue the predictable spooky mayhem as everyone battles a series of evil manifestations, including dolls, that by now feel all too familiar in their jump scares. This is the kind of haunted house movie in which everything seems to happen in dark rooms, the characters armed only with flashlights, as horrific storms rage outside. The Conjuring: Last Rites trades heavily in nostalgia, with numerous callbacks to past adventures and frequent visitations to the Warren's “Artifact Room,” where Annabelle still resides in her locked cabinet. And since we've been watching the Warrens battle demonic entities for 12 years, they now feel like old friends. The stateliness of it all feels even more old-fashioned in light of such recent audacious and original horror films as Sinners, Weapons, and everything directed by Jordan Peele. Despite its title and final moments informing us of what happened to the real-life Warrens in their last years (complete with archival clips and photographs), the family tradition may live on, cinematically at least. Tomlinson delivers a terrifically intense performance as the psychically gifted Judy, leading one to think she could easily headline yet another Conjuring offshoot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROAM represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent booking agency worldwide. Two of independent music's most respected booking agencies, North America-based Arrival Artists and U.K.-based ATC Live, have merged to form ROAM, a new global booking agency with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris and Glasgow, Scotland. The combined agency represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent and fifth-largest music booking agency worldwide (behind WME, CAA, Wasserman Music and UTA). According to ATC Live co-founder Alex Bruford, ROAM will “provide a genuine alternative in the global booking agency landscape.” Arrival co-founder Ali Hedrick adds that early on, the two companies had twice-weekly talks and realized they had a “shared identity, a shared culture.” Hedrick says this was a deliberate choice: “Neither one of us wanted to own each other. We wanted to be a true partnership.” This structure allows the agency to remain partner-owned, which Berlin says offers “a sense of pride in being able to run our own company that bleeds into the work that we do every day.” The name ROAM was chosen to reflect the agency's mission, explains Bruford, noting that it “gravitated towards the meaning of traveling with curiosity and purpose,” while foreshadowing “how we wanted to work with our artists and build road maps with them exploring opportunities and making journeys together.” Bruford also notes the work ATC Live has done with established artists like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, who joined ATC Live in 2018 as an arena headliner and saw a “50% increase in ticket sales” on the band's most recent tour. He emphasizes that “growing artists from day one is such an important part of our business, but also adding value to established artists is key as well.” Sarah Joy, who started as a coordinator at ATC Live and worked her way up to partner, says the company is “keen to champion homegrown agent talent” and is putting “a lot of energy into nurturing diversity across the workforce”. She proudly notes that ROAM has a gender split of “59% female and 41% male across its workforce,” bucking the male-dominated agency business. Joy and Coors that was involved in the band's sold-out Madison Square Garden show. “Their approach is incredibly artist-focused and tailored to each artist,” says Joy. The goal of combining resources into a unified company means “creating an agency where artists can grow careers without compromise, uniting scale with agility and execution with creativity,” Bruford tells Billboard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After meeting with the president's 2024 campaign team, Republican lawmakers are now calling their law a “working families tax plan.” This latest name, of course, is a misnomer: The law's tax cuts are designed to disproportionately benefit the wealthy and will do little to nothing for poorer Americans. Trump's top campaign advisers held a workshop Wednesday with House Republican lawmakers and their staffers. According to an invite published by Punchbowl News, Team Trump said it would track attendance at the event, conveying that “at least one staffer per office” was expected to attend. “I'm told House Republicans are being told by the WH to start calling TRUMP's Big Beautiful Bill the ‘Working Families Tax Cuts' Plan in order to message it to voters better ahead of midterms,” a Fox News reporter posted on X during the meeting. As the event ended, a New York Times reporter noted that Republican lawmakers were now describing Trump's signature legislation as a “working families tax plan.” “So we are discussing the Working Families Tax-cuts Plan!” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) posted on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven years after her explosive debut, the superstar is back with a new album and ready to prove she doesn't just talk a good game — she's still at its top. It's well past midnight at New York's Daylight Studio, and Cardi B is fighting to stay awake. Five hours into her Billboard photo shoot, a slight wardrobe malfunction with her black dress is prompting a quick timeout. But like a true New Yorker, she toughs it out — chewing ice and cracking jokes like she's headlining her own late-night set. Clutching a Chick-fil-A cup, she rattles off a story about the fast-food chain botching her order. Then she seamlessly swerves into her recent social media spat with WWE's Naomi. A couple of days earlier, Cardi had hosted SummerSlam at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium — and in the run-up to the event, she'd threatened on X to shave Naomi's head and use her hair as a wig. “I just be talking s–t because I know these b–ches can really fight,” she gags, eyes gleaming. Cardi's jokes and swagger never clock out. But behind the antics, she's focused — and eager to reassert her hip-hop dominance. Seven years after her Grammy Award-winning, multiplatinum-selling, culture-shifting debut, Invasion of Privacy, she's finally ready to launch her next act with her long-awaited second album, Am I the Drama? “I'm really one of those artists that people ask for their albums the most every year,” Cardi says matter-of-factly. “I wouldn't be confident if nobody asked me for my s–t. Imagine nobody asking for an album of yours? Imagine nobody asking for your music? She has only released one album, but Cardi B already boasts a Hip-Hop Hall of Fame-caliber résumé. She has five Billboard Hot 100 No. She's also the first female artist to have every track on an album certified platinum or higher by the RIAA. Along the way, Cardi evolved into one of music's most sought-after collaborators, partnering with pop giants Bruno Mars and Maroon 5 for Hot 100 chart-toppers, as well as hip-hop upstarts such as Latto and GloRilla. “What's special about Cardi is that she knows her audience, her fan base and how to stay relevant,” says Shawn Holiday, her manager at Full Stop Management. “She hasn't put out an album in seven years, but she knows how to stay current because she knows how to do features that keep her in the marketplace. “GloRilla was a new artist at the time [they collaborated],” he continues. She was really trying to empower other females in hip-hop. It wasn't about the money for Cardi; she did it because she loved the song and knew she could add value to it.” While her music wins are undeniable, it's Cardi's triumphs outside of the studio that have solidified her legacy. Since releasing Invasion of Privacy, she has become a global brand force, securing partnerships with Fashion Nova, Reebok and Whipshots; her deal with NYX Professional Makeup culminated in a Super Bowl commercial in 2024. It's hard to believe, given all this enormous cultural influence, that she still has yet to embark on her own headlining tour. “A lot of people say I got comfortable because I make money, but the most money I make is when I go and do shows,” says Cardi, who tweeted in 2022 that she'd netted $1 million for a 35-minute show at a private event during Miami's Art Basel. “I could rush and put out music like it's nothing and then pick up millions of dollars per show, but it's not about that. I want the music to be great. I want it to be amazing.” With 23 tracks set to appear on Am I the Drama?, including two Hot 100 No. 1s — 2020's “WAP” and 2021's “Up” — Cardi's aiming to prove it was worth the wait. Slated for release on Sept. 19, Cardi's second act features a tougher storyline: Expectations are sky-high, her divorce from rapper Offset is pending, she's raising their three kids on her own and she's navigating the new Atlantic Music Group (AMG) regime under CEO Elliot Grainge. “Cardi B is synonymous with the excellence that has made Atlantic Records a historically significant record label,” Grainge tells Billboard. “She is a real vanguard and a groundbreaking career artist who continues to push hip-hop and popular music culture forward in surprising and inspiring ways. There is no one like her. We are fortunate to be in her orbit.” In June, Cardi released the album's first single, “Outside,” a trunk-rattling track where she defiantly shakes off the shackles of her marriage and steps into singlehood. But if “Outside” was Cardi coming out swinging, it's the René & Angela-sampling “Imaginary Playerz,” released in mid-August, where her pen first draws blood. Jay-Z famously flipped the R&B duo's 1982 single “Imaginary Playmate” for his own “Imaginary Players” in 1997, and on her version, Cardi makes the beat her own as she fires shots with sniper-like precision. “My flop and your flop is not the same/If you did my numbers, y'all would pop champagne,” she snaps. “Cardi remains at the top of her game,” AMG COO Zach Friedman says. “She released a great record with ‘Outside,' marking another exciting milestone for her. It's 2 a.m. when Cardi finally steps off-set, the 11-hour shoot behind her. She exhales, eager to trade couture for pajamas and finally fix that pesky wedgie. These marathon days, the kind that test your patience and prove your stamina, are the grind she has been craving — the same grind that helped her become an overnight icon. This time, she's walking straight into the drama, daring anyone to even match her smoke. It has been seven years since Invasion of Privacy. How have you grown since then? Since then, I've experienced a lot. I've learned to control my emotions and understand how life works and how to play chess better. I don't love listening to my own music. Did you ever have a moment where you questioned whether this second album would actually come together? My fans be like, “Oh, you should have put a project together when ‘WAP' and ‘Up' was out,” but I only had four records that I liked. I didn't have an album done around that time. I'm not the kind of person that's going to lock in in two months and complete an album. I'm very picky with my music. But in this era, you can drop one-off singles like you did with “WAP” and “Up” and be OK. Yeah, but I want to put out this whole project because I have a lot of songs. My team is always like, “I hope you don't change your mind about your songs.” I'm like, “Nope. Since you broke out, the world of talented female rappers has become more competitive than ever. How do you stay confident and clear in your lane amid all that? So many girls come and go. They're great, but yet [the fans are] asking for my product. Every year there's a debate on social media about when is my album dropping. They're not saying that about other people, so y'all need to ask them. Why do you think people are fascinated with women MCs feuding? Is there a world where everyone can coexist peacefully, or does the game thrive off competition? You can't prevent a b–ch from being shady. Sometimes b–ches want to see what you're about. A lot of the b–ches will come in this game and feel like they can challenge you. People often refer to you, Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion as the “Big Three” women in rap. Even without an album in seven years, why do you still feel like you belong in that tier? But it's something you'd have to ask the fans. You can downplay my accent, but I put a lot of thought into my work. What does success look like for Am I the Drama? Or is the win just in finally delivering it? Winning a Grammy, the most prestigious award, you can never take that from me. Success for me will be people saying, “She put out a great album.“ If [at] 3 a.m. people are talking about the album, that's going to be success for me because people can't wait to downplay it. I even want the people who don't like me to be like, “Yo. That s–t is fire.” Yeah, eat your f–king fruits, n—a. SZA said she owed you a verse for the album. Did she ever send it in? I feel like she's been really tired because she's been on tour and then on top of that, I don't know. Maybe she did do the verse. Nah, I don't want to share it. You just got to hear it. What went into the decision to include “WAP” and “Up” — both several years old — on the album? Because my fans asked for it. My fans always be like, “B–ch, you better not [leave them off the album].” My fans do not stop reminding me of the fact that I didn't submit “WAP” for the Grammys. I'm not always going to submit [my music to the Grammys], but on top of that, people are crying about that like, “Oh, it's about numbers.” Those two records are not going to count for the first-week numbers, which everybody cares about. [Editor's note: Any activity generated by “WAP” and “Up” before Sept. 19, when the album is to be released, will not count toward the album's weekly chart performance.] [“WAP” and “Up”] are going to be at the end. Other artists do the same thing. You only care because of me. If I'm really doing it for the numbers, I could put “Money” [released six months after Invasion of Privacy] because “Money” is [multiplatinum]. Hold on, I got a lot of successful f–king records. How would you compare your relationship with Atlantic now versus when you first started in your career? S–t, I feel like I had a disagreement on a song with them because I didn't really want to put it out, but it still worked out in my favor. Maybe I can trust y'all a little bit with that.” It's never like, “Oh, I hate my label. I'm [bumping heads] with my label,” and stuff like that. It is a little sad not being with the same people that you started off with, but the new bosses, they're cool. Be direct, say what you want, be direct to me and that's just that. Your connection to fans, especially through Spaces on X or Instagram Live, has always been strong. How much did those bonds keep your spirit up through the album process? We have a relationship where I love them. Just like how you love your family and friends, you are going to get into arguments with them. They could be a little bit annoying, like, “Aight. Now y'all doing too much,” but I really love them. It's so weird because I have somebody new in my life and explaining that type of relationship to my fans [can be weird], but they know me. I don't go by people's approvals, but I do take my fans' approval for certain things into consideration. Why do I want my fans' approval?” But that's because they care about me a lot. You've built one of the strongest feature runs in rap. In your eyes, what makes a Cardi B verse so special? First, I got to really like the song. I'm going to put my 100% on it. If you're putting me on your stuff, I'm going to show love to it. I'm not just going to be like, “Oh, here's the record,” promote it for one day and goodbye. You've never officially hit the road for a full tour. What would a Cardi B tour look and feel like? But no, I think my personal tour is not going to be like any other performances that I've ever had. From the aesthetics to the look to even the way I perform, I'm going to be doing things that I don't normally do, like work out, because I want to be the best. I've been going to so many different tours. You know Beyoncé doesn't drink water onstage, right? If she does, it's only a sip. My fans know I got asthma. A right one because I'm going to give it my all. This is going to be one of the greatest tours. I'm going to make it the best. Is performing at halftime something you see in your future? I'm going to be more experienced and I'm going to eat that up. It turned me into a real woman. I was like, “What makes a woman? This summer, I haven't even put my feet in a pool. I do everything for my kids. I'm the only provider and you know what? Ain't no complaining about it. I love them so much and they ground me. My mom used to be a freakin' cashier and she used to work every single day. To this day, I still talk about how hard my mom worked. I had a very rough childhood, but my mom always made sure we ain't go to no shelter. Friendship has always been at the core of your relationship with Offset. Despite the ups and downs, do you envision a lasting friendship with him? You're dating NFL star Stefon Diggs. Was it tough at first to not only date again, but go public, especially with someone who's also in the spotlight? It's tough dating in your 30s, too, but I like him. How has he inspired you to be a better version of yourself creatively or personally? I don't really have a sleep schedule. I don't ever like to map out my day. I don't even like to schedule my month. The one thing I've been learning is to be more organized and not complain. He has to do two different things: learn his playbook and get physical. He has to be in bed at a certain time and wake up at a certain time. I can lay back and I don't have to be running, but it's very inspirational to see how hard somebody works. You should be proud of yourself.” You've inspired a generation of new female rappers. Do you see yourself as a mentor now, and is that a role you embrace? She cut a b–ch — or some s–t like that — then they let her out to go to her mom's funeral. Let her learn on her own.” Sometimes you got to let b–ches learn on their own. I have to because there were so many b–ches that I've sat down and given advice from the heart. Like, if I see people bullying you because of whatever the f–k, I'm going to go in your DMs and give you advice. But sometimes I got to really hold myself [back] and say, “No, b–ch. Don't do it,” because these b–ches turned their backs on me, f–ked my man, talked about me and somebody told me about it. After your first album, you became a force in fashion, beauty and branding. Fashion is something I really love. I like putting things together well. I have an amazing team and we always get a thrill about putting amazing outfits [together]. It's really a sport to us. Even when it gets intense, like this Fashion Week that just passed. There were tears shed, but we loved those end results so much. This is why we do it all the time. Imagine somebody f–king you on the first date. You want people to say that's the best p—y they ever had. You don't want to give people drunk p—y. I want it to be good all the time. You've always immersed yourself in politics. Is that something that you hope to pass down to your kids when they get older? I hope they take that trait from me. You always have to be aware of what's happening to the world and what's happened before, because things really do repeat themselves. Maybe not something drastic like a world war, slavery or the Holocaust, but there's always shady s–t going on. I just want them to always be aware of what's going on and what could happen. But there's something about politics that gets me in a rabbit hole. I have to bite my tongue. I really, really had to bite my tongue, but you know the reason why I've been so silent about politics? It's because when I used to complain the past four years, I know for a fact that people watch my stuff. I know the White House watches my stuff. There's a president that knows I've never supported him and it's like if I say something, he's not going to care. I was like, you know what? I had to pick the lesser evil. People made fun of my accent. People made fun of my speech [at a Kamala Harris rally days before the 2024 presidential election]. S–t is really rough out here for everybody. No matter who's in charge, it's going to stay like that because we're paying for bad karma. Why [are we] paying for bad karma? I'm not going to speak about it. All I'm going to say is we're going to be paying for a very long time because there's no bigger leader than God. We've been supporting and endorsing immoral, evil things. Not one person is going to pay for it; the whole country is going to pay for it. If you could pick one word to title this chapter in your life, what word would that be and why? At first, I was going to say “confusing.” I'm resetting again in my career. I'm about to be heavy on tour and I haven't been heavy on the road in a long time. Then, it's a reset on my personal life. So I guess we should say a reset. This story appears in the Aug. 30, 2025, issue of Billboard. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

According to the outlet, Greene wanted to speak with Costner and show his appreciation for giving indigenous people a chance to be represented in media over the years. The late actor's team tried their best to get in touch with Costner, but were unsuccessful, TMZ added. A post shared by Kevin Costner (@kevincostner) However, on Tuesday, the “Yellowstone” star paid his tribute to Greene on social media, and it's clear that the admiration between them is mutual. Costner honored Greene by posting a scene from their iconic film “Dances With Wolves,” which they starred in together in the 1990s. “A few things come to mind when I think of Graham Greene and our time together on ‘Dances With Wolves,'” Costner captioned the post. “I think of how willing he was to learn the Lakota language. I think of my joy when I heard that his work on the film was recognized with an @theacademy Awards nomination. And I think of this scene in particular, when he was able to establish so much about the relationship between Dunbar and the natives with so few words. One fan wrote, “The most iconic movie in my eyes! Another pointed out, “This film was the first time I ever heard my language in a movie outside of my family circle. Someone also praised Greene for his contribution to the native community. A trailblazing talent who gave so much exposure to the Native American artists.” A fan added, “The most famous and underrated Native American actor in film history. No matter what role he did, he always caught your attention and added to the quality of the film. Greene passed away on Monday, after a “lengthy illness,” TMZ reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams' daughter, Matilda Ledger, made a rare public appearance in New York City last Thursday, her first in nearly seven months. As per photos published by Page Six, for the outing, Matilda wore a blue-and-white striped sweater with an A-line denim midi skirt and bright red flats. For that outing, she wore the same pair of red flats, this time styled with black tights to keep warm. She completed the look with a green puffer jacket and baggy jeans. The actor, known for roles in “The Dark Knight” and “Brokeback Mountain”, died on January 22, 2008, at age 28 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Williams welcomed Matilda in October 2005, a year after she met Ledger on the set of Brokeback Mountain. The couple ended their relationship in 2007, a year before his passing. She also spoke about the challenges of being young while navigating love and loss, saying, “I suppose maybe a good thing about being young is that you don't have so much life experience that you can contextualize things.” Alongside Matilda, Williams is also mom to three younger children with husband Thomas Kail: son Hart, 5, and two more children, including one welcomed via surrogate earlier this year. “They couldn't be happier to expand their family, and Matilda has been doting on her younger siblings,” the insider said. Williams publicly thanked her surrogate during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August, saying, “Thanks to Christine, I have three under 5 at home.”</p>
