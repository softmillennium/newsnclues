                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their final friendly of the calendar year will take place Nov. 18, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The U.S. Soccer Federation reportedly was in talks with Brazil, but couldn't come to an agreement on a time and place. It'll be the first time since July 2024 that these two countries face off against each other. The USMNT met Uruguay to conclude Copa Am√©rica Group C play with La Celeste emerging victorious. Gregg Berhalter was subsequently relieved of his duties and in came former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino. The high-profile coach has delivered mixed results so far. While there have been some positive wins in friendlies, a Concacaf Gold Cup final loss to Mexico and a fourth-place exit in the Concacaf Nations League earlier this year stain his first year in charge. The team is looking for momentum any way possible. There are no more competitive matches before the World Cup, so friendlies are the best opportunities Pochettino and his team will get. Also included in the September squad are MLS standouts Max Arfsten, Matt Freese, Tristan Blackmon, Alex Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna. Abroad, the likes of Tyler Adams, Damion Downs, Tim Weah, Josh Sargent and Chris Richards return. Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie were not named to the squad. Before Uruguay, they'll also face Ecuador and Australia in October. Max Mallow is an editor for Sports Illustrated FC. Somehow, he has just enough time every matchday to tweet when an Arsenal player scores a goal. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update before international matches come thick and fast. Wednesday, Sept. 3üåé CWCC: Washington Spirit vs. Vancouver Rise, 7 p.m. ‚û°Ô∏è CBS Sports Network, Paramount+üá∫üá∏ USL Championship: Hartford Athletic vs. Indy Eleven, 7:30 p.m. ‚û°Ô∏è ESPN+ U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino may have billed this international break as the last chance to vet inexperienced players before the World Cup, but the latest roster is headlined by a few familiar faces, and a years-old quandary -- who exactly is going to be the USMNT's starting forward at the World Cup? The competition is likely down to four players -- Patrick Agyemang, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi and Josh Sargent -- and while Agyemang recovers from hernia surgery and Pepi is in the early stages of a return from a knee injury, Balogun and Sargent will shoot their shot this month. Sargent has five goals in four matches to start the season with Norwich City, sticking around at the Championship club after drawing interest elsewhere over the summer, including from Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The task in front of him now is translating that form to the national team ‚Äì Sargent enjoyed a 15 goal season with Norwich last campaign but saw his USMNT opportunities come and go, missing out on this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup roster in what Pochettino described as a "football decision" at the time. This month's friendlies, then, are the latest in a dwindling number of chances for Sargent to break an international goalscoring drought that dates back to November 2019. A handful of teams could book their spots at the 2026 World Cup this month as qualification tournaments continue, with many of the world's national teams targeting the 35 spots at next summer's competition that are still up for grabs. South America's qualification tournament comes to a close this month, with three teams still in the mix for one guaranteed spot at the World cup and an additional berth in the intercontinental playoff. Colombia are the favorites to take that guaranteed spot and could get across the finish line as soon as Thursday, when they host fellow contender Bolivia in Barranquilla. That would leave Venezuela and Bolivia to duke it out for a spot in the playoff when CONMEBOL's qualification run concludes, each with an uphill battle of their own to climb ‚Äì Venezuela will host Colombia, while Bolivia will welcome Brazil in the qualification finale. Meanwhile in Africa, there are still four games to go in the first round of qualification but two regulars could get the job done this month if all things tilt in their favor. Egypt could join them on Tuesday if they win the two games on their plate this month against Ethiopia and Burkina Faso. No spots are up for grabs in Europe or North America, though each continent kicks off major stages of qualification this month. In North America, the third qualification round will begin this month and end in November with three teams booking their spots at the World Cup and two more playoff spots up for grabs later. After the three hosts, Costa Rica target back-to-back World Cup trips while Concacaf Nations League finalists Panama and regional heavyweights Jamaica are among the favorites to finish the job by November. üèüÔ∏è Chicago Stars' new home: The NWSL's Chicago Stars will play their home games at Northwestern Medicine Field next season, moving away from SeatGeek Stadium. : The Premier League season may be just three games old but with West Ham and Nottingham Forest already in crisis mode, it's time to ask ‚Äì are respective managers Graham Potter and Nuno Espirito Santo on the hot seat?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Balogun, after starting or appearing in all nine A-team games for the USMNT in 2024 under former head coach Gregg Berhalter and interim Mikey Varas, missed camps in October, November and this past March due to injury. He was initially named in Pochettino's pre-Gold Cup squad, but also withdrew from that camp due to an ankle ailment. ‚ÄúIt was a tough period, but I think every athlete goes through that at some stage,‚Äù Balogun said. Another ankle issue in August cost him a preseason game and Monaco's Ligue 1 opener. But when Brian White withdrew due to injury, U.S. Soccer contacted Balogun, who'd made his 2025-26 debut that past weekend, playing 90 minutes in a 1-0 loss to Lille. ‚ÄúI got the call ‚Äî I can't remember the date, exactly, but it was a bit late,‚Äù Balogun acknowledged Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt was important for me to be back with the team.‚Äù Several days later, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3-2 win over Strasbourg. Then he jetted across the Atlantic, to New Jersey, where he was one of the last to arrive at U.S. camp. Now, he will get his chance to make a delayed first impression. ‚ÄúAnd I think that's just natural, with such a big competition coming in 10 months, it's important to leave your mark.‚Äù That ‚Äúbig competition,‚Äù of course, is the World Cup. ‚ÄúThat's part of the psychology, to not overdo it, because things will just become more complicated,‚Äù Balogun said. But Balogun is comfortable searching for and finding a middle ground, and pushing for a potential place in the U.S. starting lineup come next June. He'll compete with EFL Championship leading scorer Josh Sargent and new Southampton signing Damion Downs for the prime minutes at striker in this camp, which also includes a friendly against Japan. ‚ÄúIt's something I've been doing all my career, fighting for my position and fighting to get in teams,‚Äù the former Arsenal academy product said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Start of sales process for tournament will begin next week The system was also used for this year's Club World Cup and, in the UK, drew widespread complaints from fans buying tickets for Oasis's comeback tour. The use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed around ticketing for the World Cup one week before sales open, including the first collection of prices. Fifa did not provide any price points in between those two. Dynamic pricing means that those starting prices can, and probably will, rise significantly. Ticket companies have benefited significantly from dynamic pricing as its usage has risen over the last ¬≠decade . Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation broke its record for revenue in 2024, with dynamic pricing thought to be a significant factor. The practice has also attracted complaints from fans priced out of events ‚Äì including in high-profile cases surrounding Oasis's tour and last season's FA Cup final. One official added that Fifa couldn't pass up the additional revenue that would be generated by dynamic pricing, citing the 211 Fifa member nations that could benefit from a more profitable World Cup. According to the officials, Fifa never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing ‚Äì suggesting the topic was never really up for debate. The pricing structure is expected to be put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales, which begins on 10 September. Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on, meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others before the World Cup draw has even begun. Fifa used dynamic pricing at the 2025 Club World Cup, with mixed results. However, demand at the World Cup is almost certain to be significantly higher than at the Club World Cup, and a Fifa official said that this time around prices would not go lower than $60. It had been standard practice for a seat's placement in relation to the pitch to affect its categorization: a seat along the sideline, for example, was far more likely to be considered Category 1, while a seat at the same level but located behind the goal might be Category 2 or lower. From 10-19 September, Visa cardholders worldwide may submit an application on Fifa's website, and by 29 September the randomly accepted applicants will be notified and given a date and time window in October, during which they can buy tickets. A Fifa official said that application data would be screened to prevent the influence of bots, and that the randomized draw would be made in the presence of a public notary in Zurich. As in past World Cups, fans may buy single-game tickets, or packages that give access to every game at a certain venue, or every game played by a specific team. Tickets will only be sold by category, with seats assigned at random within those categories until the final phase of sales, in which fans can buy specific seats on a first-come, first-served basis, many months after dynamic pricing has gone into effect. Fifa said it would operate a resale marketplace in an effort to avoid scalping.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's everything you need to know about the first wave of ticket sales. On Sept. 29, applicants will be notified if their application was successful. From Oct. 1 to Oct. 21, ticket buyers will be issued a dedicated date and time slot to purchase their World Cup tickets. Ticket buyers will be issued a ticket in a category seating range, based on the 16 different World Cup venues across the three countries. You know already when and where they'll play. Get your tickets early, because anything can happen,‚Äù FIFA World Cup 26 chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi said during a Sept. 2 media briefing. Mexico (Group A) will play in the World Cup opening match at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, 2026. The World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026. Here's everything you need to know about the FIFA World Cup presale draw Prospective World Cup ticket buyers need to sign up for a FIFA account, and have a Visa payment card. After Oct. 21, fans will be able to buy World Cup tickets with other payment methods. FIFA will have approximately 1 million tickets for sale during the Visa Presale Draw phase. FIFA says the lowest price ticket for group stage matches will be $60 USD, while the most expensive ticket price for the World Cup final will be set at $6,730 through each ticket purchasing phase. Fans will be able to purchase three different types of tickets: There are four categories of World Cup tickets available to purchase, reflective of the level seating areas in World Cup venues. FIFA will provide maps of each stadium venue, explaining the ticket categories. FIFA says a ticket buyer can purchase up to four tickets per match, for up to 10 matches, 40 tickets in total. FIFA will also launch its own resale platform for ticket holders to safeguard fans against invalid or unauthorized resale tickets. Note: Ticket resellers outside of Mexico will be able to set their own resale prices. ‚ÄúWe are not capping the FIFA resale platform in terms of ticket prices. Obviously, people would go to other resale platforms and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want,‚Äù Schirgi said. FIFA is in discussion with the three host nations to see ‚Äúif and how‚Äù they can give domestic customers priority to buy tickets in their home countries.</p>

NEW YORK - The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament in international soccer, but its list of champions is a very exclusive club. The most recent winner is Argentina, which won its third title in 2022. The match ended 3-3 after extra time and was decided in a nail-biting penalty shootout. Argentina won the shootout 4-2, and Messi lifted his first World Cup at 35 years old. Argentina's captain and forward Lionel Messi holds the FIFA World Cup Trophy upon arrival at Ezeiza International Airport after winning the Qatar 2022 World Cup tournament in Ezeiza, Buenos Aires province, Argentina on December 20, 2022. Will a new country surprise us in 2026 and make it to the list of champions? The Source: Information in this article was sourced from FIFA's website.

The U.S. Men's National Team is prepping for two September friendlies against World Cup-bound opponents Korea Republic on Sept. 6 in Harrison, New Jersey and Japan on Sept. 9 in Columbus, Ohio.

TNT soccer analyst and 10-year MLS veteran Brian Dunseth joins the U.S. Soccer Podcast to talk about what he's looking for out of Mauricio Pochettino's group this camp (3:20), what he's hoping to see out of Christian Pulisic (8:30), which uncapped players could get some playing time (29:00), and what to expect from the two World Cup-qualified opponents Korea Republic and Japan (39:30).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid's Gonzalo Garcia has admitted that his rapid rise into the spotlight, capped by a starring role at the FIFA Club World Cup, still feels surreal. The young forward, who has been a key figure in Xabi Alonso's project, especially at the Club World Cup, sat down with AS to reflect on his journey so far and the challenges ahead. As it would be for any other player.‚Äù He also revealed how limited his contact has been with Spain boss Luis de la Fuente, explaining, Just one training session, and we said hello on the field. Furthermore, when reminded of comparisons with former Madrid striker Joselu, he was quick to downplay them. ‚ÄúI appreciate it, but let's be clear, there's a big gap between me and Raul or Joselu. I'm just starting out, and hopefully I can get close to the numbers they've achieved with Madrid or the national team.‚Äù Gonzalo Garcia was Real Madrid's top scorer at CWC. Speaking about the similarities between Xabi Alonso and Alvaro Arbeloa, Garcia noted, ‚ÄúWith Ancelotti, last year, I came on at very specific moments. It's not like I was there long enough to have an opinion. Gonzalo Garcia has been a revelation for Real Madrid. Perhaps the most defining moment of his young career came when he was told he would start against Al Hilal in the Club World Cup. That tournament ended with Garcia winning the Golden Boot, something he is still processing. ‚ÄúThere, as the World Cup goes on, you don't realize it. Far from feeling overwhelmed by Madrid's galaxy of stars like Kylian Mbappe, Garcia remains grounded. ‚ÄúIn the end, it's true that you go from playing for Castilla and watching your idols on TV to training with them, and that, of course, impresses you. ‚ÄúI am just very grateful to be able to share a locker room with them, with the best players in the world.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's the dream of any youth player, and for me it was very special after so many years at the club. Finally, reflecting on his Santiago Bernabeu appearance against Mallorca, he added, I was lucky enough to play there for a year, as I had to move there for family reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preparations are underway in Arlington for next year's FIFA World Cup. Arlington Deputy City Manager Jennifer Wichmann said the city is also encouraging local business owners to get excited about the event, saying the opportunity to market to visitors will be key. "That kind of creativity is what we're trying to help our business see and understand. It most likely won't be a direct contract with FIFA, but it might be a way to attract visitors to your restaurant or enhance a hotel. Applications to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held in North Texas, are set to open on Monday. Council members also dug into the next steps for thousands of volunteers. The applications opened in August and FIFA will reach out to every person who applied this month and next. FIFA said once approved, volunteers will work several eight-hour shifts. They will get merch in exchange for their time. People who speak multiple languages are in the highest demand. The teams in each group play each other and the top two will advance to a knockout stage. The eight best third-place teams will also advance. The FIFA World Cup is set for its biggest change in a generation. The United States will host games in Arlington, Texas; Atlanta; East Rutherford, New Jersey; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Houston; Inglewood, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami Gardens, Florida; Philadelphia, Seattle; and San Jose, California. Two Canadian cities will have World Cup games: Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. The tournament will be played through June and July in 2026 and will begin at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on June 11, with the final held on July 19 at MetLife Stadium, which will be called the New York New Jersey Stadium during FIFA's tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arlington is encouraging residents to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as the world's largest sporting event grows nearer. Anyone who is selected as a volunteer would work eight to 10 shifts of about eight hours, she said. In return, they will get World Cup gear like hats, backpacks and T-shirts, along with possible access to the games while volunteering. Multilingual volunteers will be in especially high demand since around 54% of visitors, including non-ticket holders, are expected to be international. The city is looking for ways to get those international visitors to stick around Arlington when they're not attending games or FIFA events, some of which are expected to be held in the entertainment district on non-game days. The World Cup is expected to have ‚ÄúFan Activation‚Äù events in the Arlington Entertainment District and at Fort Worth's Sundance Square, according to Wichmann. The city includes information for residents, visitors and businesses. It offers guidance on volunteering, the match schedule, short-term rentals like Airbnb and the match schedule for residents. For visitors, the city has compiled information on lodging options, travel information and things to do around the city between matches. Business owners can also use the website to learn more about commercial regulations and permitting guidelines. That will open the door for teams to pick basecamps ‚Äì with six possible locations identified around North Texas including in Mansfield, Dallas and Fort Worth. Another town hall with a yet-to-be-determined focus will be held Oct. 23 at the same time and place. KERA News is made possible through the generosity of our members.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking ahead of France's opening 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Iceland, Kounde said the relentless pace of fixtures was taking a toll. "It's not just about the players," he told a press conference on Wednesday. I also think about all the people who work around football and who are sometimes victims of this relentless pace." Kounde, who plays for Barcelona, did not feature in this year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which ran from June 14th to July 13th in the United States, but the 26-year-old still hinted at the tournament's impact on the already packed season. Manchester City's Rayan Cherki and Arsenal's William Saliba have pulled out of the double header with injury, while Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele missed training on Tuesday because of a thigh injury. "That's what's happening with football - it's overconsumption." The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup added 63 matches to the summer schedule, prompting criticism from players and clubs over fatigue and injury risks. Kounde urged football's governing bodies to reflect on the long-term sustainability of the current model. "These are things we need to put into perspective," he said. "And I think they need to change."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Cucurella has revealed a behind-the-scenes incident that occurred during the Club World Cup, which was held in the United States of America. The Spanish defender even reveals that Trump had taken a medal with him during the awards ceremony, in addition to the trophy, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino had previously given him. "It was an experience, that's clear. But, on the other hand, we said we wouldn't celebrate until he left. And, the fact is, Trump didn't want to leave. He even got a champions' medal, which I saw in his office in the White House," the left-back told Spanish media outlet AS. "I hope things improve at the World Cup, because it was difficult to play in those conditions, with such great heat. I hope things improve next summer," the Spanish footballer further underlined. Let's see if we can close the qualifiers in the best possible way and arrive at the World Cup in good shape," concluded Cucurella.
