                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses that affect both males and females, but research in Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica indicates that sex may influence the characteristics and course of these conditions. Several differences between groups and sexes were identified in age at diagnosis, age at treatment, illness duration, illicit drug use, and smoking. For example, females in the schizophrenia group were older than males at first outpatient treatment compared with females in the bipolar disorder group. Moreover, those who were older at first outpatient treatment presented a longer duration of illness. Regarding substance use, the highest rates were observed in males with schizophrenia. Among individuals with bipolar disorder, females reported better performance in verbal memory and psychomotor speed than males. Both females and males with serious mental illnesses showed higher rates of thyroid alterations than healthy controls. Our findings reveal a clear message: sex-sensitive treatment is essential for improving clinical outcomes, promoting healthy habits, and managing comorbidities." Serra-Navarro, M., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has developed a human vascularized liver cancer-on-a-chip model to evaluate vessel remodeling and cell death in response to embolic agents. This novel platform reflects the microenvironment of liver tumors, particularly a functional and perfusable microvasculature that can be embolized. This powerful in vitro tool aligns with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) efforts to reduce animal testing and promote alternative methods, including microfluidic devices that mimic human organs. Embolic treatment for liver cancer is a minimally invasive therapy delivered through a catheter into the hepatic artery to block tumors' blood supply and starve them of oxygen and nutrients. This approach can be combined with chemotherapy or radioactive beads to enhance its effect. However, the development of novel embolic agents is often optimized in animal models, which differ significantly from humans at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels. To bridge this gap, Dr. Jucaud's lab developed a vascularized embolization-on-a-chip model that replicates the microvascular networks of liver cancer. The efficacy of embolic agents is easily measured through the quantification of tumor cell death, vessel regression, cytokine release profile, and cell-surface marker identification. "By integrating functional blood vessels into a liver cancer-on-a-chip system, we can replicate the unique vascular dynamics that drive hepatocellular carcinoma growth and response to embolic therapies, something traditional cell cultures and animal models cannot achieve," said Dr. Huu Tuan Nguyen, first author of the publication. "This platform allows us to deliver embolic agents directly into microengineered tumor vessels, closely mimicking the clinical procedure and providing unprecedented insight into how tumors respond at the cellular and tissue level," said Dr. Vadim Jucaud. "Beyond therapy testing, the vascularized model provides a powerful tool to study how embolization alters tumor hypoxia, immune infiltration, and angiogenic signaling, all of which are critical to advancing precision oncology." This innovative model provides insight into embolization dynamics and opens the door to next-generation embolic agents, potentially accelerating translation of discoveries into clinical treatments for liver cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, deepfakes, and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don't know seeking to profit from your behavior. But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations. Doctors and public health officials have been fielding questions on this topic for years. A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations. Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off vaccines is counterintuitive. It costs money to stock, store, and administer a vaccine. “Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Pediatric Workforce. When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and its administration, Hackell said. Many pediatricians also participate in a federal program that provides vaccines free of charge to eligible children whose parents can't afford them. Participating in that program isn't profitable because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don't cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it's valuable for patients, Hackell said. Terk's practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn't lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice's patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. “The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said. Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics' or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended vaccine schedule. Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases. “I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine. “Don't get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.” In this interview, Jonathan Ferguson discusses how knowledge of an emerging public health concern identified at Pittcon 2024 has evolved a year on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an Aug. 7 executive order, President Donald Trump announced that political officers would have the power to summarily cancel any federal grant, including for scientific work, that is not "consistent with agency priorities." Senior officials should not "routinely defer" to recommendations from peer reviewers, who have provided the backbone of federal science funding for eight decades. NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya reinforced the message in an Aug. 15 internal memorandum stating that political priorities may override the scoring system provided by outside experts appointed to hundreds of review panels. "While the score and critiques an application receives in peer review are important factors in determining the scientific merit of a proposal," his memo stated, NIH institutes and centers should not rely on the scientific merit rankings "in developing their final pay plans." By downgrading its peer review process, the NIH could allow political appointees who now occupy key positions to stop grants that typically would be funded, and to fund grants they prefer that don't necessarily meet rigorous scientific standards, a dozen current and former NIH officials told KFF Health News. "Peer review is fundamental and makes sure we're doing the best science," she said. NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine said that peer review would continue to be the cornerstone of the NIH's funding decisions but that funding would become less dependent on reviewers' rankings of grant proposals. This will "ensure consistent, transparent, and strategic funding decisions that align with the agency's mission, maximize public health impact, and responsibly steward taxpayer dollars," she said. Trump's executive order said peer reviews would be "advisory" only. Grants to scientists at universities and other research centers make up about 80% of the NIH's $48 billion budget, with the rest funding internal NIH research. Since 1946, the NIH has doled out funds based mainly on merits established by a scientific review process that ranks each proposal based on innovation, importance, and feasibility. The peer review process, in which grant proposals scoring above a certain percentile generally receive funding, has always had its critics. Many a Nobel Prize speech has described failures by reviewers to recognize work that would end up leading to pathfinding discoveries, said Carrie Wolinetz, a former NIH chief of staff. About half of the NIH's 27 centers and institutes provide leeway to raise or drop grants on the priority list because of factors like institute-wide research goals, Fine said. Nakamura's successor, Noni Byrnes, retired last week after overseeing changes aimed at reducing one frequent target of peer review critics: the awarding of multiple grants to well-placed scientists from top-tier universities. Career scientists, who have long run the NIH, have in some instances been replaced by political appointees playing critical roles in scientific decisions, staff scientists say. New political appointees under Bhattacharya include chief of staff Seana Cranston, a former aide to conservative Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and former Department of Government Efficiency manager James McElroy, Cranston's deputy. The position of chief operations officer was created and filled by Eric Schnabel, a political appointee — since fired — who previously had been in charge of business development for a company that sold fitness programs. Bhattacharya's deputy, meanwhile, is Matthew Memoli, an infectious disease scientist who emerged as a sharp critic of covid-19 vaccine mandates. The Department of Health and Human Services stunned vaccine experts in May when it awarded Memoli and colleagues a $500 million grant to develop an influenza vaccine using older technology, with no explanation other than a superlative-filled news release. While a minority of workers speak out in protest through documents like the “Bethesda Declaration,” others keep their heads down and their mouths shut. Most grants must undergo new levels of review by senior NIH employees and the White House, program officers say. Staff members painstakingly police all grant applications for language — such as "diversity" or "climate change" — that might trigger scrutiny by higher-ups, according to four program officers, two of whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they feared retaliation. "Bhattacharya has been saying that program officers are making up banned-words lists," Norton said. But we do notice that when a grant says 'health equity,' it gets terminated." "After we approve them, they go to the grant management office and sit there. Then they send them back and say, 'What about this word?'" "It's a level of absurdity, but I wanted to avoid more delays." The peer review process itself is "starting to break down" because highly scored grants haven't been funded for sometimes obscure reasons, Chou said. The NIH picks hundreds of deeply experienced external scientists to serve on its review panels. While screened to avoid conflicts of interest, many reviewers are themselves NIH grant recipients. "We're finding that people are more likely to decline to serve on review panels because their own grants are frozen, or out of protest at what's happening at NIH," Manier said. Another review officer described approaching a Brown University scientist with a request to serve on a panel recently: "They said normally they would do it, but they've lost three grants and need to figure out how to keep their lab running." "If the government cancels your grant for no good reason, you can't expect a good-faith effort anymore." "It's death by a thousand paper cuts, anything they can do to gum up payments, to gum up the decision-making, to wrest control of grant decisions from the career scientists," said Elizabeth Ginexi, an NIH program officer for 22 years who took early retirement in April. Although in-house NIH research isn't subject to the same review process as external grants, Memoli's grant left officials aghast. Trump's executive order says the grant review process "undermines the interests of American taxpayers," leaving many good proposals unfunded while supporting "too much unfocused research of marginal social utility." "We make sure taxpayer money goes to the most high-impact research." "Alignment" is a word the Trump administration frequently uses to explain why an official got fired or research was rejected. "The Chinese Communists call it 'harmonization,'" she said, and now her colleagues speak routinely about grants that are "clean" because they've "gone through alignment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study suggests women having a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy have higher risks of stroke compared with those who did not have surgery. Therefore, ongoing prevention efforts that address modifiable risk factors are essential to reduce the burden of this disease. Both hysterectomy and oophorectomy significantly affect estrogen levels. An oophorectomy can reduce premenopausal serum estradiol by up to 80% and androgen levels by about 50% in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Although multiple studies have previously been conducted around the relationship between surgery and stroke risk, results have been mixed. This latest study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included more than 21,000 women, with an average of 8.3 follow-up years, documenting 193 stroke-related deaths. A pooling analysis of this study's results with other cohorts, however, revealed an 18% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, and a 5% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy alone. Although the new study lacked surgical indication data, meta-analysis studies show that there is no connection between a benign or malignant diagnosis when determining the associated risk of surgery. Similarly, current evidence does not differentiate the amount of risk based on specific indications (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, or other rare conditions). Additional studies with a large sample size and longer follow-up period are needed to address the disparities of type of stroke, age at surgery, surgical techniques, and menopause status on the association between stroke risk and hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. Survey results are published in the article "Stroke risk in women with or without hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy: evidence from the NHANES 1999-2018 and meta-analysis." The results of this study demonstrate increased stroke risk related to hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, highlighting that these common procedures carry longer-term risks. They also call attention to an opportunity for more careful assessment of cardiovascular risk and implementation of risk reduction strategies in women who undergo these surgeries." Shao, C., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Faced with a worsening drug crisis, policymakers in recent years have made it much easier for doctors to prescribe the highly effective opioid addiction treatment buprenorphine. However, many patients may still struggle to find pharmacies carrying the treatment, finds new research led by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics. But disparities in who can access the treatment have persisted. Because these treatments are milder opioids and considered controlled substances, they historically have been subject to tight prescribing and dispensing rules. However, dispensing rates have changed little, suggesting that pharmacy regulations aimed at preventing opioid (and buprenorphine) diversion, abuse and misuse continue to discourage pharmacies from carrying the treatment, particularly in minority neighborhoods and some areas hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. Relaxing buprenorphine prescribing rules was an important step in making this critical treatment more accessible, but too many patients lack a nearby pharmacy that carries it. Federal and state policymakers must reduce barriers that make it difficult for pharmacies to stock buprenorphine, especially in some of the more vulnerable communities." Researchers said states should consider easing tight controls on buprenorphine dispensing, which can restrict access to the treatment in several ways. Some pharmacies carry the medication but refuse to dispense it for fear of running afoul of the federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state pharmacy regulations and laws, which require pharmacists to ensure that prescriptions for controlled substances are valid. The researchers said state and local governments should consider requiring pharmacies to maintain buprenorphine stock, noting that some have issued similar orders for the overdose reversal treatment naloxone and emergency contraception in an effort to improve access. "If policymakers fail to introduce policies that increase equitable access to buprenorphine at local pharmacies, existing racial and ethnic disparities in opioid use disorder treatment and recovery will likely worsen," said first author Jenny S. Guadamuz, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Progress in life-saving treatment for opioid-use disorder with the medication has stalled in the past several years, according to a Rutgers Health study. However, researchers added that while some states were able to achieve substantial improvement, others lost ground. Specifically, states that have expanded access to Medicaid insurance coverage since 2018 saw increases in prescriptions for opioid-use disorder treatment, according to the study, while states that haven't expanded Medicaid experienced declining treatment rates after 2022. Researchers found that state Medicaid policies were key drivers of population-level treatment rates. The study, published in Health Affairs, examined trends in national retail pharmacy claims by Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance across states between 2018 and 2024, a period of rising fatal overdose rates and national policy changes aimed at increasing treatment. We were impressed by the success stories in some states, such as those with recent eligibility expansions. Several of these states, like Virginia, Utah and Missouri, doubled or tripled Medicaid-paid prescribing, driving strong population-level improvement. These successes point to opportunities for improvement even when the overall national rate of progress is disappointing. Nevertheless, wide disparities between states remained, as shown in maps and state comparison tables in the paper and its appendix." In addition to the disease of addiction, there are a number of policy and financial barriers preventing people from accessing medication, the researchers said. Because people with opioid-use disorder tend to be low-income single adults, Medicaid is the most important payer for buprenorphine, a highly effective medication used to treat opioid-use disorder. However, Medicaid policies covering opioid-use disorder treatment vary state to state, resulting in vastly different uptake of treatments that can dramatically lower the risk of overdose and support recovery. New Jersey is among the states that have implemented important initiatives that have aided access to Medicaid-paid treatment, including Medicaid expansion, elimination of buprenorphine prior authorization, and increased reimbursement for treatment, with improvements in Medicaid and all-payer buprenorphine prescribing during the study period. States that recently expanded the eligibility criteria to qualify for Medicaid insurance experienced a 27.3% increase in buprenorphine prescribing rates. But in states that didn't expand Medicaid, overall prescribing lagged, with declines after 2022. Researchers said expanding Medicaid eligibility and minimizing disenrollment from Medicaid during eligibility redeterminations are critical steps in increasing access to opioid-use disorder treatment across the country. "Translating evidence into consistent practice has been uneven across the country for multiple reasons, including the stigma surrounding people with addiction," said Crystal. "But progress is possible when states take action to help residents access and afford effective medication. Maintaining the progress that has been made in opioid-use disorder treatment through state Medicaid policies will be challenging under the financial pressures created by recent federal legislation, but it is vital in maintaining progress on preventing overdoses and supporting recovery."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A father's exposure to passive smoking as a child may impair the lifelong lung function of his children, putting them at risk of COPD-a risk that is heightened further if they are childhood passive smokers themselves-finds research published online in the respiratory journal Thorax. Several factors throughout the lifespan may increase the risk of poor lung function and subsequent COPD, and attention is now beginning to focus on the potential role of intergenerational factors, they explain. While previously published research showed that passive smoking during a father's childhood may be linked to a heightened risk of asthma in his children by the time they are 7, it's not clear if compromised lung function may extend into middle age and beyond, they add. To explore this further, the researchers drew on 8022 child participants in the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS), all of whom had tests to assess their lung function (spirometry). Further check-ups ensued when those children were 13, 18, 43, 50 and 53. These included spirometry to assess 2 measures of lung function (FEV1 and FVC) as well as questionnaires on demographics and respiratory symptoms/disease. Among the 5097 respondents with complete data, 2096 were fathers. More than two thirds of the fathers (nearly 69%) and more than half of their children (56.5%) had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhoods. After adjusting for potentially influential factors, including the father's lifetime history of asthma/wheeze and his age, his passive smoke exposure as a child was associated with 56% higher odds of below average FEV1, but not FVC, across the lifespan of his children. This was statistically significant even after adjusting for potentially influential factors. And paternal exposure to passive smoking as a child was also associated with a doubling in the risk of COPD by the age of 53 in his children, although this was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for potentially influential factors. But children whose fathers had been exposed to passive smoking as a child were twice as likely to have below average FEV1 if they, too, had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhood. The observed associations were only partly mediated through smoking and respiratory illnesses in fathers and their children (each contributing less than 15%). And the researchers acknowledge that TAHS lacks data on paternal lung function and genetics, preventing assessment of familial aggregation as a potential mechanism. And their children's childhood passive smoke exposure was defined as at least one parent smoking 6 days a week, which might have misclassified moderate/light smokers as non-smokers, they add. But the period before puberty is especially critical for boys, when exposure to harmful substances may change gene expression and modify repair mechanisms, which may then become heritable, say the researchers by way of an explanation for their findings. "Our findings are novel as this is the first study to investigate and provide evidence for an adverse association of paternal prepubertal passive smoke exposure, rather than just active smoking, on impaired lung function of offspring by middle age," they write. "This is of importance from a public health perspective, as passive smoke exposure affects about 63% of adolescents, which is significantly higher than the approximately 7% affected by active smoking." They conclude: "These findings suggest that smoking may adversely affect lung function not only in smokers but also in their children and grandchildren…Fathers exposed to tobacco smoke during prepuberty may still reduce risk for future generations by avoiding smoking around their children." Paternal prepubertal passive smoke exposure is related to impaired lung function trajectories from childhood to middle age in their offspring.

Study: Ageing modifies the oral microbiome, nitric oxide bioavailability and vascular responses to dietary nitrate supplementation. In a recent study published in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine, researchers investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) deficiencies, a common aspect of human aging, could be mitigated by consuming nitrate-rich beetroot juice. The study leveraged data from a randomized crossover trial comparing the impacts of beetroot juice consumption on young and older adults. Study findings revealed that beetroot juice consumption substantially lowered blood pressure (BP) scores in older adults, while having no statistically significant impact on their younger counterparts. The Prevotella-dominated group included taxa capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), which may divert nitrite away from NO production. These findings support the notion that dietary nitrate may enhance blood pressure regulation in older adults, with microbiome shifts potentially mediating this effect. Decades of research have elucidated some of the routine processes associated with aging, with the body's deteriorating ability to produce nitric oxide (NO), a key molecule for cardiovascular health, well-documented. Conventional interventions often involve the use of pharmacological supplements; however, a significant number of patients respond poorly to these interventions, prompting the search for newer, naturally derived, and physiologically safe alternatives. Recent research has also established robust links between oral health and systemic disease. However, the biological mechanisms governing these benefits remain largely unknown. One of the few well-documented pathways involves the conversion of dietary nitrate, abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot, into nitric oxide (NO). Studies have shown that this process entirely depends on specific oral bacteria (living on human tongues) that process the machinery to convert (enzymatically reduce) nitrate to nitrite. Unfortunately, aging substantially hinders this process, as the body's primary mechanism for producing NO, via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), becomes less efficient. The present study aimed to address the knowledge gaps by conducting a placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover trial involving 39 young adults (aged 18–30) and 36 older adults (aged 67–79), to investigate the impacts of different oral solutions (beetroot juice and mouthwash) on participants' oral microbiome and vascular responses. Individuals with known medical histories of pulmonary, metabolic, or cardiovascular diseases were excluded from the sample cohort. Exclusion criteria also included oral diseases, smoking, high BP (> 140/90 mmHg) at baseline, and recent (<3 months) antibiotic use. The study intervention lasted two weeks (each treatment), separated by additional two-week 'washout' periods. Data collection involved the collection of tongue swabs (before and after each period) for oral microbiome analysis via high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, participants' key cardiovascular health markers (brachial and central BP) and endothelial function (using flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) were recorded at the same frequency. Finally, Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were measured as proxy biomarkers of NO bioavailability. The latter cohort had higher baseline BP (mean arterial pressure of 95 vs. 87 mmHg, P < 0.001), but when provided the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, demonstrated a significant reduction in brachial mean arterial pressure (4 ± 4 mmHg [P = 0.003]). Young, healthy adults, however, did not see any such change. Post-nitrate BP was lower than after mouthwash, but not lower than after placebo beetroot juice, which itself increased plasma nitrate and nitrite and had a modest effect on BP in older adults. The use of antiseptic mouthwash was also associated with reduced oral microbial diversity (Shannon index, P = 0.004) and impaired vascular function in the young group. Conversely, nitrate supplementation altered the oral microbiome in older adults, leading to increases in specific nitrate-reducing genera, including Neisseria and Rothia. Notably, Neisseria exhibited a proportionally greater increase in older adults compared to the young group. The present study reveals that dietary nitrate may serve as a potent tool for enhancing cardiovascular health, particularly in older adults. This research opens a new frontier for targeted nutritional and probiotic strategies to support cardiovascular health, especially in our aging global population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with learning disabilities progress faster to severe type 2 diabetes and are at greater risk of dying from their condition than people without these disabilities, suggests research published in the open access journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Control. This is despite having better overall blood glucose control and similar risks of vascular complications, the findings indicate. Around 1.5 million people (950,000 adults) in the UK have a learning disability, which includes conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, note the researchers. Type 2 diabetes in those with learning disabilities can be challenging as it requires a substantial amount of monitoring and management, which they may not always be able to do, potentially compromising their blood glucose control, explain the researchers. Macrovascular complications refer to stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or amputation more than 6 months after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers extracted anonymized medical records for 352,215 adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in primary care between January 2004 and January 2021 from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD. They tended to be younger (average age 51 vs 64) and have a shorter monitoring period. Even after adjusting for these potentially influential risk factors they were 19% less likely to have poor blood glucose control than those without learning disabilities 5 years after diagnosis. But they were 20% more likely to progress faster to severe disease and the need for insulin therapy than those who didn't have learning disabilities. And they were around twice as likely to die from any cause and specifically from diabetes despite having similar risks of vascular complications as those who didn't have learning disabilities. This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause and effect, and the researchers acknowledge that large numbers of values for the outcome variables for blood glucose control were missing among those with learning disabilities. Complication rates may therefore have either been underdiagnosed or under-recorded, they suggest. "Our finding of higher rates of insulin initiation in those with learning disabilities warrants further investigation into whether this is due to poorer glycemic control at presentation (and therefore faster advancing type 2 diabetes) or due to having a greater degree of clinical surveillance," say the researchers. "Future research into the mechanisms behind this could help reduce health disparities for people with [type 2 diabetes] and learning disabilities," they add.
