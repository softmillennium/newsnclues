            We don't know why the Trump administration suddenly reversed itself this summer on its promises to release extensive new documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


            What we do know is that the administration has responded to a bipartisan outcry over its handling of the matter by repeatedly doing things that might seem on paper like significant steps toward transparency, but have proven to be far less than meets the eye. Many of them point to what a judge recently suggested was the “illusion” of transparency.
    


            The situation appears to be coming to a head. On Wednesday came an emotional press conference featuring Epstein victims pleading with Congress to agree to an effort led by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, which the Trump administration opposes, to force the Justice Department to release the documents.
    


            “To be clear: The only motive for opposing this bill would be to conceal wrongdoing,” Epstein accuser Anouska de Georgiou said.
    


            The scene followed yet more evidence of the administration's reluctance to cede to those demands.
    


            That began on Tuesday with the official launch of Massie's effort, called a discharge petition, to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, which Speaker Mike Johnson also opposes.
    


            As the administration faced the prospect that a small number of House Republicans could join with Democrats to force the issue, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee suddenly released an initial tranche of 33,000 pages of Epstein documents it had subpoenaed from the Justice Department. It seemed like an effort to mollify the Republicans who might support Massie's measure, which is being co-led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna.
    


            But like the binders of Epstein documents the White House gave right-wing influencers earlier this year, the documents were overwhelmingly old news. House Oversight Democrats and Massie estimated that 97% of the documents had already been released, while the rest were heavily redacted. No media outlet has found anything revealing in them.
    


            Massie claimed it amounted to about 1% of what the Justice Department has.
    


            “They've given us the sleeves off their vest,” the Kentucky Republican said.
    


            The White House adopted a threatening posture, distributing a statement to multiple media outlets labeling any Republican support for Massie's discharge petition a “hostile act.”
    


            “Helping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration,” a White House official said.
    


            But if the administration is okay with full disclosure on Epstein – as it has insisted it is – why would it oppose Massie's effort?
    


            The most oft-stated reason is the need to shield Epstein's victims. But Massie's measure includes a provision on that. It allows the DOJ to redact or withhold documents that “contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files and similar files,” if those files would violate their personal privacy. What's more, as of Wednesday morning, many Epstein victims have now publicly endorsed Massie's measure.
    


            You could be forgiven for thinking the Trump administration just doesn't want to give up control over this process. Better to filter the documents through a GOP-controlled committee than to have your hand forced by the discharge petition.
    


            (That discharge petition currently has the support of four House Republicans. If all Democrats support it, it would need six Republicans to get to the required 218 votes.)
    


            The other olive branch Johnson has offered critics is a vote this week essentially affirming the House Oversight Committee's investigation of the Epstein matter.
    


            But the effort is only symbolic. Massie dismissed it as an effort to “provide political cover” to Republicans who don't back his discharge petition but are still feeling pressure from their base.
    


            And there's been plenty other mirages of transparency.
    


            The administration's first two big moves to quell the Epstein furor in July were to interview Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and to push for the release of grand jury materials in the case.
    


            But its handling of Maxwell's interview with the deputy attorney general was a mess. The transcripts that were ultimately released told us next to nothing. And predictably, Maxwell seemed more interested in protecting her own interests – including in ongoing appeals – than blowing the whistle on anybody who might have been involved in her and Epstein's crimes. She wouldn't even admit to knowledge of Epstein's crimes, which she was convicted of participating in.
    


            The grand jury effort was even more telling.
    


            Even when the administration began this push, experts were skeptical it would lead to much. And they were right.
    


            We soon learned that the grand jury materials generally contained little new information. It was often law enforcement personnel recounting allegations secondhand – claims that were later aired publicly in court by the actual witnesses.
    


            By the end, multiple judges rejected these efforts. And two of them explicitly said the administration appeared to be pulling the wool over people's eyes.
    


            US District Judge Paul Engelmayer said the public “might conclude” the administration's real purpose “was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.”
    


            A week later, another judge also used the d-word.
    


            US District Judge Richard Berman said that the administration's move “appears to be a ‘diversion' from the breath and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession.”
    


            Crucially, Berman repeatedly noted that, to the extent the administration wanted to inform the public about such matters, it had much better and more fulsome information it could provide.
    


            “The Government's complete information trove would better inform the public about the Epstein case,” Berman wrote. He called the administration “a logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein files.”
    


            And that's the rub here. If the administration wants to get this stuff out, it can. But it has repeatedly had to be dragged into taking steps toward disclosure that have looked more like messaging exercises than anything else.
    


            The increasing question for House Republicans is whether they're mollified by all of these apparent diversions and symbolic moves – or if they see them as efforts by an administration to avoid full disclosure.
    


            The early indications Tuesday were that at least some Republicans who have flirted with signing Massie's discharge petition were at least temporarily satisfied, despite the lack of new disclosures.
    


            The pull of partisanship is strong, as are threats of blowback from Trump. But the administration's mishandling of all this makes it hard to believe its goal is the same as those Republicans and influencers who have pushed for years for more information on Epstein.

            New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker announced his engagement to girlfriend Alexis Lewis this week, telling reporters he'd surprised her with a proposal in Hawaii.
    


            Booker, 56, sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 — and his record-setting, 25-hour Senate speech warning that the “country is in crisis” earlier this year sparked talk of another potential presidential run in 2028.
    


            Booker told reporters Tuesday that he and Lewis were in Kauai, Hawaii, and that one of his friends told Lewis that they wanted to surprise Booker with a “traditional Hawaiian greeting.”
    


            “She thought we were going down just to have leis put over us. And we walked out and there was a hula dancer, a Hawaiian dancer, a Polynesian dancer, and a guy with a ukulele. And then after their second song, other performers came up and sang a song that's really meaningful to her, that she told me since one of our early dates, that she wants at her wedding,” he said.
    


            “And she was so overjoyed, dancing and singing along with the singers. And then she runs over to them and says, ‘Oh my god, this is the song that I wanted to be played at my wedding. Thank you so much.' And then I interrupt her and said, ‘Honey, this is actually the song being performed at your engagement.'”
    


            Booker added, “She said that that's when she blacked out. I had to show her pictures of me on my knees to tell her I got on a knee.”

            Lewis is a vice president of investments at Brasa Capital Management, a real estate investment firm, according to the company's website. She previously worked as an economic development aide in the Los Angeles mayor's office.
    


            Booker has never been married, and his personal life has long been the subject of scrutiny. During his first Senate run in 2013, the then-Newark mayor responded to his opponent's insinuations that he might be gay by saying he had affirmed his sexual orientation many times, but also arguing that it did not matter.
    


            “The question really should not be whether I'm gay or straight, the question should be why the heck are you asking the question in the first place? It doesn't make a whit of difference at what kind of senator I'm going to be or not,” Booker said in a 2013 interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes.
    


            During his run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Booker's relationship with actress Rosario Dawson was in the news. The two split several years later, and social media commenters responded to the news of his engagement Tuesday by comparing Lewis' looks with Dawson.
    


            “Love Love! Congratulations you two!” Dawson commented on Booker's engagement announcement on Instagram.
    


            Booker could soon be in the spotlight in Washington, where he vowed to “stand and fight” during this month's upcoming budget battle, as the clock ticks down toward a government shutdown.
    


            “I can't speak to other senators' consideration, but I'm going to say it as loud as I can, as often as I can, this is a time to stand and fight. This is a time to draw a line. We should — I am not giving my vote away to Donald Trump on a budget that's going to hurt people,” Booker said.
    


            “I'm telling folks, this is a crossroads,” he said. “I am standing and fighting against any kind of budget proposal that's going to hurt Americans or hurt people in New Jersey. I believe there comes a time when everyone should stand up and fight for what's right, and that's what I intend to do.”

            Tens of millions of years ago, an apex predator resembling a giant crocodile stalked the humid freshwater floodplains of southern Patagonia. Measuring up to 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) long and weighing about 550 pounds (250 kilograms), it ate whatever it could catch. Including some dinosaurs.
    


            Near the southern tip of South America, in Argentina, scientists recently discovered a skeleton — including the skull and jaws — of this hypercarnivore, an animal whose diet is at least 70%      meat. They named it Kostensuchus atrox and described the reptile as a new species of peirosaurid crocodyliform, an ancient relative of modern alligators and crocodiles. This is the first crocodyliform found in Argentina's Chorrillo Formation, which dates to about 70 million years ago, toward the end of the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago); it is the most complete fossil ever found for this group.
    


            The second-biggest extinct predator found in the region to date, K. atrox is also one of the largest of this type of crocodyliform, researchers reported on August 27 in the journal PLOS One.
    


            “It is equivalent to a lion among felids,” the study's lead author, Dr. Fernando Novas, a paleontologist with the Félix de Azara Natural History Foundation at Maimónides University in Buenos Aires, said in an email.
    


An ancient ‘terror crocodile' became a dinosaur-eating giant. Scientists say they now know why



            Other fossils previously found in the Chorrillo Formation indicate that K. atrox lived in a diverse habitat, home to dinosaurs, other reptiles, amphibians and even a Cretaceous ancestor of the modern platypus. With its giant head, powerful jaws and large teeth, K. atrox could have easily hunted plant-eating dinosaurs and defended its kills against carnivorous theropod dinosaurs, making crocodyliforms an important part of terrestrial ecosystems, according to Novas.
    


            Discovering K. atrox so far to the south greatly expands the known range of this ancient and fearsome reptile group, suggesting that peirosaurid crocodyliforms were “not only restricted to warm and dry regions in Brazil and northern Patagonia, but also to temperate environments,” Novas said.
    


            Novas was among the team of paleontologists who found the K. atrox skeleton in March 2020 while excavating the fossil of a large plant-eating dinosaur, and they were immediately struck by its superb preservation. The skeleton was nearly complete, missing only the tail and some limb bones, and the skull was in such good condition that its teeth still bore a coating of enamel, Novas said.
    


            The teeth were pointed with serrated edges that would have been used for “puncturing and slicing through the flesh of sizable prey,” the study authors reported. Though the animal's posture was more upright than that of modern crocs, the position of the forelimbs suggest           it may have been semiaquatic.
    


            “It is a really interesting animal, partially in that it looks so similar to many other croc relatives,” said paleontologist Dr. Keegan Melstrom, an assistant professor at the University of Central Oklahoma who was not involved in the new research. Such similarities are examples of convergent evolution, when species that are not closely related evolve to have similar traits.
    


            “This may seem counterintuitive, but crocs from this time often look different and have different ecologies from modern crocs,” Melstrom told CNN in an email.
    


            “What this fossil shows is different groups of crocodile relatives repeatedly and independently evolving a modern croc-like look and lifestyle,” Melstrom said. “They (crocodyliforms) keep going from terrestrial carnivores to semiaquatic predators and evolving similar shapes while doing it. The authors do a lovely job of telling this story.”
    


I tried to find out if the dinosaur tooth I bought online was real. It didn't go as expected



            Still, K. atrox differs from modern crocodilians in some important ways. Its nostrils were forward-facing, and its eyes were positioned on the sides of the skull. By comparison, the eyes and nostrils in modern crocodiles sit higher on the skull, enabling them to lie in wait for prey while keeping most of the body underwater.
    


            “The anatomical evidence indicates that Kostensuchus searched for prey on land, where medium-sized herbivore dinosaurs were present,” Novas said.
    


            Being a massive meat eater helped K. atrox dominate its floodplain habitat, but it also may have been a factor in what doomed these ancient crocs. While K. atrox and other large crocodyliforms did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, other croc groups did, perhaps in part due to their smaller size and more varied diets, said Melstrom, who studies how crocodilians' eating habits shaped their evolution.
    


            “I hypothesized earlier this year that being a hypercarnivore made a group more likely to die off in a mass extinction than a smaller species,” he said, “and that appears to happen here.”
    


            Next, to learn more about the animal's diet, and where it lived and hunted, scientists want to recover isotope information from the fossil's teeth. Imaging the internal structure of its bone tissue could reveal more about its growth rate and age. And abnormalities in the vertebrae also “need to be investigated with participation of veterinary pathologists,” Novas said, adding that the “skeleton of Kostensuchus may reveal more secrets in the years to come!”

North Koreans view Russians as their brothers and see it as a fraternal duty to help the neighboring country in any way they can, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told President Vladimir Putin Wednesday.

Putin and Kim met for bilateral talks in Beijing during the Chinese celebration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Imperial Japan and the end of World War II.

The Russian president reiterated Moscow's appreciation for North Korean military assistance in repelling a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Region, describing the struggle as a “joint fight against present-day neo-Nazism.”

“As I mentioned during our previous meeting, if there is any way we can help Russia, we will certainly do so and consider it our fraternal duty,” Kim responded.

In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed a comprehensive cooperation treaty that includes provisions for mutual defense. Kiev launched an attack on Russia's Kursk Region in August 2024, claiming that the offensive would help secure territory for leverage in peace talks with Russia.

The Russian military reported the full expulsion of Ukrainian troops in April, also acknowledging for the first time the role of North Korean troops in the operation. Russia has vowed to erect a monument in Moscow for the soldiers deployed by Pyongyang who were killed defending Russian territory.

Russia has identified the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine as a key objective in the conflict, aiming to disempower radical nationalist groups that have embraced far-right ideology and Nazi iconography.

The current government in Kiev has glorified historical nationalist figures, including those who collaborated with Nazi Germany during its invasion of the USSR in the hope of creating a Ukrainian national state allied with Berlin. Ukrainians who fought for the Nazis committed atrocities against civilians in occupied territories.

“There won't be a war, but the struggle for peace will be so intense that not a stone will be left standing.”

This old Soviet joke, born in the 1980s, captured the absurdity of that final Cold War decade: endless ideological cannon fire, nuclear arsenals on hair-trigger alert, and proxy wars fought on the margins. Between détente in the early 1970s and perestroika in the late 1980s, the world lived in a state of permanent tension – half-theater, half-tragedy.

The Soviet leadership was old and exhausted, barely able to maintain the status quo. Across the ocean, the White House was run by a former actor, blunt and self-confident, with a taste for gallows humor. When Ronald Reagan quipped during a sound check in 1984 that he had “signed legislation outlawing Russia forever” and that “bombing begins in five minutes,” the off-air joke was truer to the spirit of the times than any prepared speech.

The official Soviet slogan was “the struggle for peace.” In Russian, it carried a deliberate ambiguity – both a promise to preserve peace and an assertion of global control. By the 1980s it had lost all meaning, becoming a cliché mouthed without conviction. Yet history has a way of circling back. Today, the “struggle for peace” has returned – and this time the stakes are even greater.

By the late 1980s, both superpowers were tired. The USSR was struggling to carry the burden; the US, shaken by the crises of the 1970s, was looking for renewal. Leadership changes in Moscow – above all, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise – triggered the most dramatic shift in world affairs since 1945.

Between Geneva in 1985 and Malta in 1989, Reagan and Gorbachev held summit after summit. Their aim was to end confrontation and build a “new world order.” In reality, Washington and Moscow understood that phrase very differently. The Soviet Union's growing internal weakness tilted the balance of power, leaving the United States and its allies to design the order in their own image. The result was the liberal international system that has dominated ever since. 

That struggle for peace was, in Western terms, a success: the military threat receded, the Cold War ended, and the United States emerged as global hegemon.



Four decades later, the cycle has turned. The Alaska meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in August 2025 carried faint echoes of Reagan and Gorbachev's first encounters. Then, as now, two leaders with little mutual understanding recognized the need to keep talking. Then, as now, the personal factor mattered – the chemistry between two men who respected each other's strength.

But the differences outweigh the parallels. Reagan and Gorbachev were unwitting midwives of the liberal order. Trump and Putin are its gravediggers. Where the earlier summits opened the Cold War's endgame, today's dialogue marks the close of the post-Cold War era.

The resemblance lies only in timing: both moments represent turns of the historical spiral. The 1980s saw exhaustion on both sides. Now it is the United States, not Russia, that shows fatigue with a world order it once dominated. The demand for change comes above all from within America itself, just as it came from Soviet society in the 1980s.



Trump consciously borrows Reagan's slogan of “peace through strength.” In English it is straightforward; in Russian the phrase can also mean “peace maintained reluctantly, against one's will.” Both shades of meaning suit Trump. He makes no secret of his obsession with winning the Nobel Peace Prize, a vanity project that nevertheless reflects a real instinct: his method of diplomacy is raw pressure, even threats, until a deal is struck.

Reagan's legacy was to put America on the neoliberal path and to preside over the Cold War's end, unintentionally becoming the father of globalization. Trump's ambition is to roll globalization back and replace it with what he sees as a stronger America – not isolationist, but a magnet pulling in advantage from all directions. To achieve that, he too needs a world order – different from Reagan's, but just as central to his sense of national interest.

Putin's outlook is the mirror opposite. Where Trump sees America first, Putin sees the necessity of reshaping the global order itself – of ending the period of US dominance and forcing a multipolar settlement. To him, the issue of world order is not cosmetic but existential.



What stands out in 2025 is the return of the Moscow-Washington axis as the world's nerve center. This was not supposed to happen. For years, analysts proclaimed that China would replace both as the defining rival. And Beijing is indeed central. Yet the dialogue between Trump and Putin, however fraught, once again is setting the tone of global politics.

The pace is quicker than 40 years ago. The war is not cold but hot, and there are no long pauses between meetings. The process begun in Alaska will move faster than the one that began in Geneva.

If it continues, the outcome will be the reverse. Reagan closed the Cold War on Washington's terms, crowning America as sole superpower. Trump and Putin are bringing that period to an end. The unipolar era is finished, even if its defenders in Brussels or Washington cannot yet admit it.



The irony is that both cycles – the 1980s and today – were framed as struggles for peace. In the first, peace meant ending confrontation and disarming rivalry. In the second, peace means preventing one power from dictating terms to all others.

The military threat today is at least as grave as in the 1980s, perhaps greater. But the real battle is for the shape of the order itself. The fight for peace, once again, risks leaving no stone standing.

The Cold War ended with Reagan's victory and Gorbachev's surrender. This time there will be no surrender, only a reshaping of the stage. The United States is still strong, but it is no longer willing or able to bear the costs of global hegemony. Other powers – Russia, China, and others – are strong enough to insist on their place.

The struggle for peace is back, and like its predecessor it will define an era. But this time the script is different: it will not end with one side dictating terms, but with a new balance hammered out by force and necessity.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his gratitude to North Korean soldiers who helped Moscow's forces defend Kursk Region from a Ukrainian incursion. Putin made the statement during a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in China on Wednesday.

Following the ceremonial reception to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, Putin and Kim sat down for bilateral talks at the Diaoyutai state guest house in Beijing.

Putin began the meeting by stating that relations between Russia and North Korea had taken on a “special, trusting, and friendly character,” pointing to the participation of Pyongyang's forces in the liberation of Kursk Region earlier this year.

“I would like to point out that your soldiers fought courageously and heroically… we will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen,” Putin told Kim, thanking him on behalf of the Russian people for his country's participation in the “joint fight against modern neo-Nazism.”

Kim responded by stating that relations between Russia and North Korea have significantly developed in all aspects since the signing of the bilateral treaty in June 2024, which includes mutual defense clauses.

The North Korean leader said Pyongyang considers it to be its “brotherly duty” to help Russia in every way possible and will wage “a joint struggle” with the fraternal Russian people and army, in accordance with its obligations under the bilateral agreement.

The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement, effective since December 2024, has facilitated increased military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Kim had previously emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship, expressing confidence in Moscow's ability to achieve victory in its “just and sacred cause” to defend its sovereignty and security interests.

TOKYO, September 3. /TASS/. Japan suspects that Russia and China may establish a new world order as it views Beijing's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Victory over Japanese Aggression as a symbol of divisions deepening globally, senior Japanese diplomats told Kyodo.

""China and Russia are seeking to lead a new world order,"" the Japanese news agency quoted an official at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying. Another high-ranking Japanese diplomat called the parade that was held in Beijing earlier on Wednesday ""a symbol of global divisions"" amid world instability caused by the policy course pursued by the administration of US President Donald Trump and its trade tariffs.

However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry highlighted the absence of the South Korean president from festivities in Beijing, even though he attended similar events a decade ago. Meanwhile, Japan's MFA described as unexpected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to China, since Tokyo believed that a rift was widening between Beijing and Pyongyang over the latter's rapprochement with Moscow in recent years. Also, the Japanese MFA stressed it would monitor how the situation develops and how it may impact the international community.

A military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War was held today on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Alongside Xi Jinping, Putin and Kim Jong Un, the heads of state and government from 24 other countries attended the event.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Donald Trump calls clamor over Jeffrey Epstein files a ‘Democrat hoax that never ends' as bipartisan group of lawmakers try to force vote on legislation

Trump can't use Alien Enemies Act, court rules

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna says the House will be compelled to vote on legislation to release the Epstein files if two more Republicans sign on to a petition he has introduced along with Republican congressman Thomas Massie.

“We need just two more signatures to force the release,” Khanna said. So far, they have received the signatures of 212 Democrats and four Republicans: Massie, Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.

Those lawmakers are some of the most conservative in their party, but Khanna praised their support of the discharge petition, which can force a vote on legislation in the House if it is signed by a majority of lawmakers.

“We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue. This is an issue where they both have shown real courage and leadership, and I appreciate them joining us today,” Khanna said of Greene and Massie.

Vice president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance have arrived in Minneapolis, where they will meet with the families of the victims of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting that killed two schoolchildren and injured nearly two dozen people last week.

“They will hold a series of private meetings to convey condolences to the families of those affected by the tragedy,” the White House said in a statement.

Trump's attorneys are asking the US Supreme Court to reverse a $5m sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against him in the civil lawsuit brought by E Jean Carroll, Bloomberg News has reported.

According to a new filing, the president's lawyers are asking the justices to extend the deadline for him to formally ask the court to toss out the verdict.

In 2023, a civil jury trial concluded that Trump had sexually abused Carroll, a former magazine columnist, in the 1990s, before he embarked on his political career, and then defamed her in 2022 when he denied the allegations as a hoax and said that she was “not my type”. Carroll was awarded $5m in damages.

The petition was due on 11 September 11, but Trump's legal team has asked for an extension, until 10 November, Bloomberg wrote.

Here's a look back at what's gone on today so far:

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna said only two more Republican signatures are needed for the success of a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation compelling the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Donald Trump slammed the push for the files' release as a “Democrat hoax that never ends” and mulled deploying federal agents into New Orleans to fight crime.

Republican congressman Thomas Massie criticized how House GOP leaders handled the Epstein issue.

At a separate press conference outside the US Capitol, Epstein survivors detailed abuse they suffered at the disgraced financier's hands.

The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said that the US would carry out more strikes like the one that targeted a suspected drug trafficking boat and killed 11 people on Tuesday off the coast of Venezuela.

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that Donald Trump unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans he alleged were part of a criminal gang.

Donald Trump teased the possibility of deploying federal resources into New Orleans to fight crime.

“We're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks. It'll take us two weeks,” the president said.

New Orleans has a homicide rate that is among the highest in the nation, but lies in a Republican-governed state – unlike Los Angeles and Washington DC, where Trump deployed federal troops earlier this year.

Trump also confirmed that he was still sending federal agents into Chicago, saying: “We could straighten out Chicago”.

Asked at the White House about the push in Congress to release the Epstein files, Donald Trump again accused Democrats of orchestrating the controversy, and attempted to change the subject to his own purported accomplishments.

“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said. Referring to the recent release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, he said: “Nobody's ever satisfied.”

“They're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been president,” Trump said. He went on to claim credit for making Washington DC a “totally safe zone” with “no crime, no murders, no nothing” – though crime, including murders and robberies, have continued since he deployed the national guard and took control of its police department.

Another boast from Trump: “I ended seven wars, nobody's going to talk about it because they're going to talk about the Epstein whatever.” It's unclear which seven he is referring to, though his claims of having quelled recent fighting between Pakistan and India played a part in souring the relationship with New Delhi. He also has notably not ended the war in Ukraine – something he boasted, on the campaign trail, that he could do right after taking office.

The White House has referred to signing the discharge petition to release the Epstein files as a “hostile act”, and discouraged Republicans from supporting it.

Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman who introduced the petition and is one of four lawmakers from his party who signed it, replied:

I don't know if that's precedented in this country to have a president call legislators to say that they're engaged in a hostile act, particularly when the so-called hostile act is trying to get justice for people who've been victims of sex crimes.

He also said that the fact that there was little new in the case documents released yesterday may spur more lawmakers to sign the petition:

What people are waking up and discovering right now is the folks who stayed up all night to go through the 34,000 individual pages have found that they're so redacted as to be useless and that many of them were already available.

A reality check on the discharge petition that could force a vote in the House on legislation to release the Epstein files.

The petition needs two more signatures – which will probably have to come from Republicans – to reach the majority threshold to compel the vote. But even if the petition receives that support and the bill passes the House, the legislation will still need to be approved by the Senate, where Republican majority leader John Thune has given no indication he will put it up for a vote.

Should it pass the Senate, it faces another obstacle: Donald Trump. He's condemned the furor over the Epstein files as a distraction created by the Democrats, and could veto the legislation. That would punt the issue back to Congress, where the bill would need two-thirds majority support to overcome his veto – a tall order.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is among the most outspoken conservatives in Congress, but has made a rare pact with the Democrats by signing the discharge petition that could force a vote on legislation to release the Epstein files.

“This is an issue that doesn't have political boundaries. It's an issue that Republicans and Democrats should never fight about. As a matter of fact, it's such an important issue that it should bring us all together,” she said at the press conference convened by the petition's sponsors outside the Capitol.

“The truth needs to come out, and the government holds the truth. The cases that are sealed hold the truth. Jeffrey Epstein's estate holds the truth. The FBI, the DoJ and the CIA holds the truth. And the truth we are demanding comes out on behalf of these women, but also as a strong message to every innocent child, teenager, woman and man that is being held captive in abuse. This should never happen in America, and it should never be a political issue that divides us.”

Republican congressman Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the Epstein files, criticized how speaker Mike Johnson has handled the issue.

Yesterday, Johnson backed a resolution that will direct the House oversight committee to continue its investigation of the government's handling of the investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“The speaker of the House just offered a fig leaf to my colleagues. They're going to vote on a non-binding resolution today that does absolutely nothing,” Massie said.

He also downplayed the effectiveness of the oversight committee's investigation, which is being led by Republican chair James Comer:

I appreciate the efforts of my colleague James Comer, who's leading the Oversight Committee. They may find some information, but they're allowing the [department of justice (DOJ)] to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them.

If you've looked at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted, and 97% of this is already in the public domain.

Massie said the best way to bring transparency to the case is for lawmakers to sign his discharge petition and allow a vote on his bill to release the files:

I'm calling on my colleagues to be one of the next two who sponsors this discharge petition. I think it's shameful that this has been called a hoax. Hopefully today we can clear that up. This is not a hoax. This is real.

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna says the House will be compelled to vote on legislation to release the Epstein files if two more Republicans sign on to a petition he has introduced along with Republican congressman Thomas Massie.

“We need just two more signatures to force the release,” Khanna said. So far, they have received the signatures of 212 Democrats and four Republicans: Massie, Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.

Those lawmakers are some of the most conservative in their party, but Khanna praised their support of the discharge petition, which can force a vote on legislation in the House if it is signed by a majority of lawmakers.

“We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue. This is an issue where they both have shown real courage and leadership, and I appreciate them joining us today,” Khanna said of Greene and Massie.

The bipartisan press conference from representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna just started.

They'll be providing an update about their petition to get a resolution, urging the release of the Epstein records, on the House floor for a vote.

The area outside the Capitol, known as the House Triangle, is packed with reporters and demonstrators. Signs calling Donald Trump “a pedophile” are raised alongside placards that accuse the Republican party of a cover-up.

The House oversight committee yesterday released about 30,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, but, as the Guardian's Dani Anguiano reports, most of the information in them was already public:

The US House of Representatives oversight committee on Tuesday released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from the department of justice.

The release comes as the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its decision not to release additional files in the case. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges and was alleged to have abused hundreds of girls.

The 33,000 pages included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as what appears to be bodycam footage from police searches and police interviews. The files appear to contain information that is already public knowledge.

The records were posted online as the Trump administration was facing renewed attention on the investigation into Epstein. With Congress back in session this week, Democratic and Republican representatives had planned to hold press conferences to demand greater transparency from the administration in the case.

Donald Trump, a longtime friend of Epstein and part of his rich and powerful social circle, has, in recent weeks, tried to avoid the subject. Earlier this year he sued the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on his relationship with Epstein on a birthday note Trump was alleged to have written to him. The president has called the recent Epstein controversy a hoax.

This “Stand with Survivors” outside the Capitol today rally aims to center those who suffered at the hands of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's separate from the bipartisan press conference by lawmakers calling for the complete release of the Epstein files that is scheduled to begin at 10.30am.

“We are here to say, we see you, we believe you and we will not stop until justice is served,” said Skye Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year after years of speaking out about the abuse she experienced at the hands of Maxwell and Epstein.

“Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her sentence. No leniency, no deals, no special treatment,” he added. “The Epstein documents must be unsealed. Every name, every detail, no more secrets, no more protection for those who preyed on the vulnerable.”

Signs at the rally are dotted among the crowd, many echoing messages of support for survivors: “We love you” and “we believe you”. While others are more pointed, reading “guardians of the pedophiles” under pictures of Donald Trump and Epstein together.

Teresa Helm, who was trafficked and groomed by Ghislaine Maxwell, told the crowd here that change was a foot. “Systems built with a root of corruption, violence and deceit always crumble,” she said. “Now is the time to sift through and get rid of the perpetrators and bad actors.”

Survivors of abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and their advocates are rallying outside the Capitol to push for the release of documents related to the government's investigation of the disgraced financier and alleged sex trafficker.

“Our call to action is crystal clear,” said Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, who called to “release the files” related to the case.

Liz Stein spoke at the rally to describe the abuse she faced by Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell:

I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved people and people genuinely enjoyed being around me, but after meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul. Instead of pursuing my dream of going to law school after graduation, overcoming the terror and the trauma that was inflicted on me by these sex traffickers, overcoming that, became my decades long, full-time career.

The rally came as a bipartisan group of House lawmakers attempt to force a vote on legislation to release files related to the case, over the objections of Donald Trump, who was once friendly with Epstein, and Republican speaker Mike Johnson:

Hundreds of current and former employees of the department of health and human services are calling on secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr to quit, the Guardian's Richard Luscombe reports. Here's why:

A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers of the health and human services department (HHS) has demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health secretary's attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans.

The hard-hitting letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of the agency's chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.

It comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote in a New York Times guest essay that Kennedy's leadership, and ousting of the CDC director, Susan Monarez, months after he appointed her, was “unacceptable” and “unlike anything we have ever seen”.

The letter posted on Wednesday by a group calling itself Save HHS assails Kennedy for “endangering the nation's health by spreading inaccurate health information”.

It cites the resignations of other leading health officials, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC's national center for immunization and respiratory diseases; Daniel Jernigan, the agency's director for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; and Debra Houry, its chief medical officer.

The Democratic vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee Mark Warner said the Trump administration cancelled his visit to a government facility after pressure from far-right activist Laura Loomer.

Warner said he was going to visit the headquarters of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in his home state of Virginia, but the administration disinvited him after Loomer launched “a campaign of baseless attacks” against him and the agency's director, Trey Whitworth.

“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security. Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe,” Warner said in a statement.

“This should concern Republicans as well as Democrats: if routine oversight can be obstructed for political reasons, no member of Congress is immune.”

The Trump administration's deployment of warships towards Venezuela prompted concerns in the country that the United States was planning an invasion. Here's more, from the Guardian's Tom Phillips and Patricia Torres:

As US warships carrying cruise missiles and marines powered towards Venezuela's coastline this week, supporters of the South American country's president, Nicolás Maduro, warned a dastardly imperialist plot for an Iraq-style invasion was afoot.

“No one will lay their hands on this land!” Maduro thundered, calling on patriots to help repel the supposed regime change operation by joining his “Bolivarian militia”.

Donald Trump's allies posted incendiary social media messages, warning the Venezuelan autocrat the end was nigh. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump's former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, proclaimed, urging Maduro to buy “a one-way ticket to Moscow”.

Another Trump supporter, Congressman Carlos Gimenez, celebrated “the largest military presence we have ever had off the coast of Venezuela” and told Maduro to accept “his time is up!”

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that the US will continue to use force against suspected drug traffickers, hours after the military destroyed a boat in the Caribbean that was thought to be carrying drugs from Venezuela.

In an interview with Fox News this morning, Hegseth said:

This is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated Narco terrorist will face the same fate.

The US military said the strike killed 11 drug traffickers, days after the US deployed several warships into the Caribbean on what it said was a mission to stem the flow of narcotics into the United States. Here's more:","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Letter by senior Democrats asks state department to reveal details behind financing of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation

Senior Democratic senators have called on the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, to reveal details behind the financing and oversight of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) amid concerns over rising death tolls near aid sites, the group's apparent coordination with the Israeli army and its reported use of private military contractors linked to intelligence operations.

The letter, co-signed by senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Welch, accuses the state department of an “inability to answer basic questions about GHF in a timely manner” and said that the department's “overriding of internal protocol and staff warnings is particularly concerning given it is unlikely to be able to conduct basic oversight of the funds it provided to GHF”.

The letter, which was addressed to Rubio, Huckabee and Russell Vought, the powerful director of the office of management and budget and current administrator for the US Agency for International Development, was delivered to the state department over the weekend and shared exclusively with the Guardian.

“The state department should immediately cease funding GHF and transfer or restore funding to experienced aid organizations given the strong and growing evidence that GHF is failing to accomplish its humanitarian mission,” they wrote.

Trump has said that the US disbursed $60m in food aid to Gaza, while the state department has only publicly acknowledged approval for a $30m grant for the GHF in June. The state department has not published details of its grant to the GHF, an omission that the senators said violates US law. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have died near GHF sites since its operations began in May, the UN reported in mid-August.

The new concerns come as the agency was mentioned in a draft plan for a “Gaza riviera” that critics have said would provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory's population and was reportedly developed by those close to the GHF. The 38-page prospectus, which has not been formally adopted as US policy, nonetheless would be one way to fulfill Donald Trump's calls for a “takeover” of the Gaza Strip.

The plan, which was first revealed by the Washington Post, also relied on consultants from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG has said that work was not approved and that it had fired two senior partners who led the financial modeling for the plan).

In their letter, the Democratic senators also attacked the GHF for its connections to the Israeli government and the use of private military contractors that have reportedly conducted intelligence operations. “The provision of humanitarian aid to starving populations should not be a pretext for military intelligence operations,” they wrote.

In the letter, the senators also demanded copies of award documents, internal reviews, export licenses for military services and other vetting that is legally required for GHF operations but have not yet been made public.

The Guardian has approached the state department and the GHF for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Polls point to ‘very close election' between the Jamaica Labour party and the opposition People's National party

Jamaicans head to the polls on Wednesday for a closely fought general election which has been overshadowed by an investigation into potential corruption in the ruling Jamaica Labour party (JLP) which is seeking a third term in office.

The latest local poll put the opposition People's National party (PNP) 3.1% lead over the JLP, but political analyst Damion Gordon cautioned that the lead was barely larger than the margin of error.

“It is going to be a very close election,” he said.

While the JLP is leaning on their track record of reducing crime and debt and growing the economy, the PNP has pitched itself as a party that will restore trust in leadership to rid the country of corruption and focus on critical public services such as infrastructure, water supply and hospital facilities.

The government has won praise in areas such as education and the economy, but it has also come under criticism for failing to improve infrastructure and access to running water in some parts of the country.

In the closing weeks of the campaign, however, the opposition put the spotlight on concerns over alleged corruption involving the prime minister, Andrew Holness. Last year, the country's anti-corruption body, the Integrity Commission, issued a report raising concerns about Holness's income and assets declarations and recommended further investigation by the Financial Investigations Division, a specialized unit within the Ministry of Finance.

The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, gaining permission from the supreme court to challenge the report, which he branded unlawful and unfair.

“It's a distraction for the government because the government has built its election campaign on the idea that it has delivered for Jamaicans in an unprecedented way,” Gordon said.

The World Bank has praised Jamaica for making “significant strides” in reducing public debt, from more than 140% of GDP in 2013 to 73.4% in the financial year 2023-2024, and its economy is expected to grow by 1.7% this year.

There has also been a drastic reduction in crime under the JLP, with official figures showing a 40% drop in murders in May, compared to the same period last year.

But during a recent debate between Holness and the opposition leader, Mark Golding, the prime minister was forced to focus on defending himself against allegations rather than just defending his achievements in office.

He said: “I have been investigated, for a year, with an expert forensic auditor. The findings of that report have suggested no corruption. There have been no charges. Every aspect of my report, every aspect of my personal life and my personal financial details are in the public domain.”

Golding told the Guardian that the investigation into the prime minister was a valid concern for voters.

He said: “Other issues are often on the top of people's minds, especially the cost of living and crime and violence and so on. But I think the consciousness of the nation has been sufficiently stirred around this issue that it is going to be an issue that will impact the outcome of the election.”

He added: “We don't see how a country like Jamaica can do with a prime minister who has that cloud hanging over him.”

Golding, who previously held dual Jamaican and British citizenship, himself came under pressure during the campaign over concerns over his “Jamaican-ness”.

“I am born in Jamaica. I grew up here, I've only ever worked here … And the fact that my father was British meant that I did inherit citizenship by descent. So I was a dual national, which is allowed by our constitution as long as the other nationality is a Commonwealth nationality, which obviously Britain is part of the commonwealth.”

Golding said he decided to give up his British citizenship after polls indicated that voters didn't think a leader should have dual citizenship. He has allowed a journalist to examine his citizenship renunciation documents and displayed his birth certificate to voters.

For many voters, however, the main concern is the economic progress Jamaica has seen in recent years. “I've seen growth,” said business owner, Shana Kay Henry, 30. “JLP is for everybody, poor and rich.”

One PNP supporter, an accountant who did not want to give her name, said that people in her constituency were not being listened to and their needs were not being addressed. She said: “We need somebody who will represent us. They need to hear our voices … do what needs to be done.”

The outcome of the election will come down to how parties mobilise their bases, Gordon said. With the JLP's strong performance in key areas during their tenure and with Golding offering a credible alternative, it is too close to call.

“Both political parties appear very confident, but I am of the view the election will be won on the day,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

13:42 JST, September 3, 2025

For many volunteers of the World Athletics Championships, which opens in Tokyo next week, the event will give them the chance to finally welcome spectators to a major international competition. A lot of them were scheduled to help out at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics but missed out because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Training sessions for registered volunteers have entered the final stretch, while municipalities hosting training camps for overseas teams are preparing to give incoming athletes a warm welcome.

Hosted by the World Athletics, the world's premier sporting event takes place every two years. This year is the first time since 1991 for Tokyo to host the event and Japan's third overall, including the 2007 Osaka event.

This year, over 2,000 athletes from about 200 countries and regions will compete across 49 events between Sept. 13 and 21 at the National Stadium.

“It's a long-awaited event and many spectators will be there,” said Nobuyuki Taguchi, a 46-year-old company employee from Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture. “I'm thrilled.”

Taguchi applied for the volunteer program as soon as recruitment began last November. He made the cut with a one-in-three chance of being accepted.

His job is to check tickets at the gates. He created his own list of potential questions and answers to be ready to cope with various inquiries from spectators and gathered information about participating athletes online.

Taguchi watches sports as a hobby. His first volunteer experience was at the Tokyo Olympics, where he was assigned to be a guide at the beach volleyball venue.

He was looking forward to interacting with visitors from Japan and abroad. However, the Games ended up being spectator-free due to the pandemic, and Taguchi's duty was changed to guide athletes. While he cherished the memories of being thanked by the athletes, Taguchi regretted not being able to connect with spectators.

Taguchi sees the upcoming championships, a major event with an expected worldwide audience of 1 billion, as the perfect opportunity to make up for the disappointment from four years ago.

“I want to hear lots of ‘thank yous,'” he said.

About 3,400 volunteers signed up for the volunteer program, according to a local organizing committee. The volunteers received training on basic things, such as the event schedule, and then moved on to specific duties from Aug. 25. Many had previously volunteered at the Tokyo Games, like Taguchi.

“The efforts of the volunteers are indispensable,” the committee's spokesperson said. “We want to work together to create the best event.”

Meanwhile, local governments hosting training camps for national teams are also looking forward to interacting with the athletes.

Training locations were decided through direct negotiations between national teams and local governments hosting them. Many municipalities that hosted pre-tournament camps for the Tokyo Games will host the same nations again.

One such case is Gifu Prefecture, which will host Canada's training camp. In the run-up to the Games, interactions between Canadian athletes and Gifu residents were limited to online events. The aim this time, however, is to “create many opportunities for direct interactions,” a prefectural government official said.

A welcoming reception for the Canadian team is scheduled for Sunday, and the team's coaches will instruct students from athletics clubs at local junior high and high schools on Tuesday.

Nine members of the music club at Gifu City's Miwa Junior High School will perform the Canadian national anthem at the reception. They are practicing under the instruction of a professional vocalist who has sung national anthems at international competitions.

“We want to directly convey our support to the athletes,” said Mitsuki Sakai, who leads the club.

Misato, Saitama Prefecture, will host the Greek team. The municipality launched a crowdfunding campaign in May to cover the costs of renting training equipment for the athletes and exchange events, raising about ¥4.8 million, close to its target, in three months.

“We hope it will be a good opportunity for children to discover their dreams or goals,” a city official said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Sept. 3 for a large-scale military parade marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

While no U.S. officials attended, U.S. President Donald Trump reacted on Truth Social, writing to Xi: ""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.""

The event marked the first public appearance of Putin, Kim, and Xi together — highlighting deepening ties among the three countries and reduced isolation of both the Russian and North Korean leaders. 

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, suggested that Trump's comment about a ""conspiracy"" against the United States was meant as irony.

""I think (Trump) did not say without irony that supposedly 'these three' are plotting against the United States,"" Ushakov said. ""I mean, no conspiracy — nobody was plotting anything, nobody was weaving anything, no conspiracy.""

Putin and Kim then departed the parade for bilateral talks, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

As Russia faced geopolitical isolation following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Pyongyang emerged as one of Moscow's most important military allies, supporting its war effort with artillery shells, missiles, and even soldiers. 

Likewise, despite officially claiming neutrality, China has been indirectly supporting Moscow's war by purchasing Russian oil and providing dual-use technology.

Addressing a crowd of more than 50,000 people at Tiananmen Square, Xi said: ""Today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,"" adding that the Chinese people ""stand on the right side of history.""

While Xi lauded peace and dialogue in his speech, China used the parade to show off its military might. 

The event featured over 10,000 troops, more than 100 aircraft and vehicles, and the country's most advanced weaponry, like the nuclear-capable DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, and laser weapons.

The parade came just days after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which brought together Xi, Putin, Kim, and other world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Taken together, both the military parade and the SCO summit are seemingly meant to project China's power on the global stage and Xi's vision of a new world order — especially amid rising tensions with the United States over trade and security.

While Putin attended the military parade in Beijing, Russian forces launched a large-scale drone attack targeting cities across Ukraine. Despite Xi's rhetoric about peace, China has emerged as a key ally and economic lifeline for Russia during its war against Ukraine, with Kyiv growing more vocal in accusing Beijing of directly supporting Moscow's war effort.

U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey arrived in Ukraine on Sept. 3, Ukraine's Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Telegram. 

Healey's visit follows a wave of Russian drone and missile strikes overnight on Sept. 3, targeting cities across western and central Ukraine.

""We are preparing important bilateral decisions that will strengthen the defense capabilities of our countries,"" Shmyhal wrote. 

According to Ukraine's defense chief, Healey's trip is focused on coordinating priorities for the upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in the Ramstein format, scheduled for Sept. 9 in London, and on advancing joint defense projects.

The Ramstein summit will bring together Ukraine's allies to discuss further military support, though the agenda has not yet been disclosed. The format, previously chaired by the U.S., is now jointly led by the U.K. and Germany after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

London has been among Kyiv's staunchest backers since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, supplying weapons, training, and intelligence. 

The U.K. is expected to play a key role in shaping new security guarantees for Ukraine as Western leaders weigh frameworks for a potential ceasefire and longer-term defense commitments.

Editor's note: The article was updated with additional details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing on Sept. 3, thanking him for Pyongyang's assistance during the war against Ukraine.

North Korea has become a key ally to Russia during the full-scale invasion, providing artillery, missiles, and thousands of troops.

""It is well known that your special forces took part in the liberation of Kursk Oblast at your initiative, in full compliance with our new treaty,"" Putin told Kim during the meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in western Beijing.

""I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen.""

Kim initially dispatched around 11,000-12,000 troops to Russia in late 2024 to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast. 

After Moscow retook much of the region in the spring of this year, both Putin and Kim publicly acknowledged the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war, marking an unprecedented escalation of the conflict.

Drawing parallels to the fight against the Axis Powers during World War II, Putin thanked Kim for ""joining the fight against modern neo-Nazism,"" referring to the Kremlin's false narratives about an alleged Nazi-led regime in Ukraine.

During the meeting in Beijing — reportedly attended by Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong — the North Korean dictator thanked Putin for appreciating the role of his troops. He called providing assistance to Russia a ""fraternal duty."" 

According to Ukrainian and Western officials, North Korea is receiving nuclear and missile technology, cash, and other support in exchange for military assistance.

Putin also said the two would discuss bilateral relations in ""all dimensions and directions,"" and invited Kim to visit Russia.

The talks followed a large-scale military parade hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

The parade marked the first time Putin, Kim, and Xi were seen together, highlighting deepening ties among the three countries and reducing the isolation of both the Russian and North Korean leaders.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, reacted by writing to Xi: ""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.""

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, suggested that Trump's comment about a ""conspiracy"" against the United States was meant as irony.

""I think (Trump) did not say without irony that supposedly 'these three' are plotting against the United States,"" Ushakov said. ""I mean, no conspiracy — nobody was plotting anything, nobody was weaving anything, no conspiracy.""

Putin previously met Kim while he was visiting Pyongyang in June 2024 to sign the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement, a deal that stipulated mutual support if one country is attacked and preceded the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia.

""Since the signing of our interstate treaty last June, relations between our countries have been developing in all aspects,"" Kim told Putin during the meeting.

""Within the framework of this treaty and in accordance with our obligations under this treaty with the brotherly Russian people and army, we fought together.""

According to South Korea's intelligence, Pyongyang plans to send an additional 6,000 troops to Russia as part of its third wave of deployment, while some 1,000 combat engineers have already arrived.

A senior Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that North Korea could have sent even more troops, with Ukrainian officials estimating Pyongyang's contribution to be between 20,000 and 30,000 soldiers.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service estimates that some 2,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed in the war.

China's rise is “unstoppable,” President Xi Jinping said Wednesday, as he oversaw a massive parade of the country's armed forces through central Beijing, a grand show of military might to mark 80 years since the end of World War II. 

Tens of thousands of military personnel took part in the event, which began with battalions of soldiers goose-stepping in unison past Tiananmen Square, where Mr. Xi and a cavalcade of world leaders had gathered on the rostrum of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, at the edge of the historic Forbidden City. 

They were followed by a showcase of cutting-edge military hardware, including new intercontinental ballistic missiles, unmanned tanks and submarines, stealth drones, and a triad of land, sea and air-launched nuclear weapons. Overhead, bombers and jets conducted flybys, as a military band performed a string of patriotic songs.

In a speech, Mr. Xi said China had sacrificed greatly during World War II, when the country was devastated by Japanese invasion and occupation, but that “faced with struggles between good and evil, progress and reaction, the Chinese people rallied together” to defy the enemy and rebuild.

“The Chinese nation is a great nation that will never be intimidated by any bullies,” Mr. Xi said. “Today, humanity again has to choose between peace and war, dialogue and confrontation, win-win cooperation and zero-sum game. The Chinese people firmly stand on the right side of history.” 

As well as the military strength on display, Wednesday's event was a demonstration of China's diplomatic clout in the face of pressure from the United States, which under President Donald Trump has tried to isolate Beijing with crippling tariffs and pressure on its trading partners. 

Ahead of his speech, Mr. Xi was shown on state TV walking and laughing alongside North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who then stood alongside him in positions of honour on the Tiananmen rostrum.

While China and Russia are North Korea's most important allies, the three men have not been photographed together before, and Mr. Xi's public embrace of two leaders who have long been global pariahs appeared designed to send a pointed message of defiance to the West. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the world was facing a choice between peace or war at a massive military parade in Beijing Sept. 3, flanked by Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

Certainly that seems to be how it was received by Mr. Trump, who lashed out on social media, accusing China of not acknowledging the U.S. role in defeating Imperial Japan. 

“Many Americans died in China's quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!” Mr. Trump wrote. “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” 

Since Mr. Trump's return to office, there have been some in Washington who have speculated openly about breaking the China-Russia partnership. But Mr. Trump's rapprochement with Moscow, including a meeting between the U.S. President and Mr. Putin in Alaska last month, appears to have had little effect. 

U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence have accused China of providing materiel for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, something Beijing denies, along with key economic support in the face of Western sanctions. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi hailed their friendship as an “example of major-country relations,” and promised to increase engagement as they signed more than 20 bilateral agreements, including allowing Russians to visit China visa-free.

North Korea has gone further, sending troops to bolster Russia's forces in the field, in return for military and economic support of its own, and Mr. Kim's prominent position in Wednesday's parade may have been an effort by Mr. Xi to ensure Pyongyang does not shift too far into Russia's field of influence. 

At a meeting with the North Korean leader in Beijing later Wednesday, Mr. Putin said Mr. Kim's soldiers had “fought courageously and heroically,” including in the “liberation of the Kursk region.” 

“We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen,” Mr. Putin said, a remarkable shift from only a few months ago when both countries were still denying that North Korean troops had even entered the conflict. 

Mr. Kim travelled to Beijing by armoured train, his first visit to China in six years. According to photos released by North Korean state media, he was accompanied by his young daughter Kim Ju Ae, who has taken on an increasingly prominent role in North Korean propaganda, with some analysts speculating Mr. Kim is positioning her as a potential successor.

Ms. Kim was not seen at the parade itself, where her father sat next to Mr. Xi and could be seen on state TV speaking with the Chinese leader through an interpreter, gesturing towards the impressive display of weaponry on show before them. They were joined on the rostrum by dozens of other world leaders, including Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iran's President Masoud Pezashkian and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. 

Many of the leaders present had taken part earlier this week in a meeting of the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a key plank in Mr. Xi's ongoing efforts to supplant the Western-led post World War II order and create what he called a “more just and equitable global governance system.” 

Mr. Putin on Monday praised the SCO as having revived “genuine multilateralism” and laying the “political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia.” 

“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others,” Mr. Putin said.

Both Beijing and Moscow have sought to use recent commemorations of the end of World War II to assert what they see as the correct historical interpretation of their country's sacrifices during that war. 

Writing Wednesday, Joseph Torigian, an expert on Chinese and Russian elite politics at Stanford's Hoover History Lab, said “Xi and Putin see themselves as men who inherited a baton from their forefathers to continue a struggle against outside enemy forces who have always wanted to eliminate their countries' distinct national characteristics and subjugate them.” 

Mr. Xi was keen to use Wednesday's parade to highlight China's success in the decades since the Second World War, rebuilding from one of its lowest points to become a global superpower once again, as well as who Beijing sees as responsible for this transformation. 

In describing the themes and messages of Wednesday's' parade, a narrator on state TV said the event showed “the will of history never stops under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China.”

Memorials for those who died in the mass shooting along the roadside by Schemengees Bar & Grille, Oct. 30, 2023.Matt York/The Associated Press

A group of 100 survivors and families of victims killed in the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine sued the U.S. government over claims it failed to respond to repeated warning signs that the shooter, an Army reservist, could become violent, according to a lawyer for the group. 

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, on Wednesday, claims the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Defense, and a New York Army hospital were negligent in their handling of Army Reserve Sergeant Robert Card, who had exhibited signs of severe mental illness for more than a year before the shooting and made explicit threats to carry out mass violence.

The Oct. 25, 2023, shooting killed 18 people and wounded 13 at a bowling alley and a restaurant. Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound two days later.

Maine mass shooter had numerous run-ins with authorities, showed warning signs long before shooting

The lawsuit claims that by March, 2023, the U.S. Army knew that Card, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and a West Point firearm and grenade instructor, was paranoid, delusional, violent and had access to firearms. But the Army did not remove Card's guns, dissuaded law enforcement from taking the guns, and dismissed Card's threats to “shoot up” a Maine Army Reserve centre in the month before the massacre, the victims say in the lawsuit.

In a statement, Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro said the Army does not comment on pending litigation. A Department of Defense spokesperson also declined to comment on pending litigation, and representatives for Tricare, the military's health care agency, did not respond to a request for comment.

Cynthia Young, whose husband William and fourteen-year-old son, Aaron, were both killed at the bowling alley, is among those suing.

In a statement, she said “we trusted those in power to protect our loved ones, and their inaction cost us everything.”

The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for pain and suffering, medical and funeral expenses, emotional distress and more.

The lawsuit claims Army researchers have recognized a connection between service members exposed to repeated explosions, like Card, and increased rates of anxiety, paranoid thinking and aggressive behaviour.

Citing other mass shootings committed by veterans and service members, the lawsuit claims the U.S. Army has developed a detailed procedure for dealing with service members whose mental health may make them a threat to themselves or others, but did not follow it in Card's case.

In the months before the Lewiston shooting, members of his unit warned their leadership that Card was making threats about mass shootings and had a collection of firearms. Card was sent to Keller Army Community Hospital in West Point, New York for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, where providers found that he had homicidal ideation and was a threat to others.

Despite the findings, Card was discharged, and the U.S. Army did not follow up with him to ensure he was following a treatment plan and was receiving the help he needed, the lawsuit claims.

In an exclusive interview, Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson speaks with the Globe about leaving Marvel behind to direct the deeply personal drama, Eleanor the Great

Midway through the 2003 film Lost in Translation, Scarlett Johansson's character, a young newlywed accompanying her photographer husband to Tokyo as he works on a movie's international tour, wanders into a press conference for the film-within-a-film. As the airheaded lead actress of the faux blockbuster, a junky piece of Hollywood nothingness titled Midnight Velocity, yammers on about reincarnation and the joys of “working with Keanu,” Johansson's character lets loose a wry, sad smile, and quickly exits in the hopes of finding a more spiritually fulfilling environment. 

For a few years, it might have been tempting to view that scene as a cruelly prescient peek into the arc of Johansson's own career. No longer the emerging starlet of such small, art-minded fare as Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation or Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, Johansson has become the world's biggest name brand. 

With US$15-billion in box-office sales to her credit, the actress is now history's highest-grossing movie star – and all thanks to such empty-calorie spectacles (Jurassic World Rebirth, eight separate Marvel movies) that are not all that far removed from the likes of Midnight Velocity. Today, there is nothing stopping the 40-year-old Johansson from spending the rest of her life counting cash and reminiscing about working with Keanu.

Yet instead of playing it easy, the actress seems stubbornly determined to use her megawatt fame, and attendant paydays, to keep as much distance between herself and any Midnight Velocity-like fate. For every safe and easily franchisable tentpole that Johansson has headlined over the past decade and a half, the actress has also doubled down on her commitment to keeping more idiosyncratic, less comfortably profitable storytellers (Jonathan Glazer, the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson) in the good books of their bankrollers. 

But next week, at the Toronto International Film Festival, Johansson will showcase her most unexpected – and most thoroughly anti-Midnight Velocity – project yet. In her feature directorial debut, Eleanor the Great, the actress goes behind the camera to tell a tender and unpredictable story about the travails of a 94-year-old woman who very likely hasn't seen a Marvel movie in her entire gosh-darn life. Even more daring: Johansson didn't try to find a role in it for herself, instead choosing to focus entirely on the filmmaking. 

“Honestly, it probably would have made financing it so much easier to have my name and face on the poster, but it would have been very, very hard to do both,” the actress says in an interview a few weeks ahead of TIFF. “I look at other actors who also direct, like Bradley Cooper and Robert Redford, and I have so much more respect for that choice. Just the stamina of it. I don't think I can be inside and outside like that at the same time.”

It would have been especially tricky given the duelling inside and outside layers of Eleanor the Great. During its first 20 minutes, the film could be mistaken for a soft-hearted generational comedy as the story traces the move of the nonagenarian title character (Thelma star June Squibb) from South Florida to Manhattan following the death of her best friend and roommate, Bessie (Rita Zohar). 

But once Eleanor mistakenly attends a Holocaust survivors' group at her local Jewish community centre, she falls into a rabbit hole of well-intentioned but damning deception, ultimately misappropriating Bessie's history as a survivor as her own life story. 

The drama that follows is deliberately messy and complex, its characters wrestling with grief, loneliness and, most of all, the lingering stains of history. So, not exactly the kind of box-office-friendly material that Johansson is used to. But for the filmmaker, whose star power helped lift Tory Kamen's screenplay out of the development hell that it had been stuck in for years, Eleanor's story spoke not only to her artistic ambitions, but her own personal history. 

“I grew up with my grandmother, and her mother only spoke Yiddish to her, so then my grandmother understood more Yiddish than she spoke, but she did speak it to us. It was a part of her makeup, her character,” recalls Johansson, who grew up in Manhattan's predominantly Jewish Upper East Side neighbourhood of Yorkville, the same area where Eleanor takes place.

 “There's certainly in that area, there are some remnants of the Ashkenazi community there. It's like all of New York, it's become a melting pot, which is wonderful. But these neighbourhoods that had real specific cultural imprints on them are not there any more.” 

Indeed, Johansson's film has one eye trained on contemporary Manhattan, with the other possessing nostalgic glint for the city's Jewish cultural history, the resulting film at times feeling as if Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters was plunked down at the intersection of Joan Micklin Silver's Crossing Delancey. (The fact that both Delancey and Eleanor have scenes involving deep discussion regarding kosher dills is surely no coincidence.) 

“I watched Crossing Delancey about 100 times growing up, but I love so many New York movies – Moonstruck, Living out Loud – where the city is not quite a character but there's just such specificity to the neighbourhoods and the characters,” Johansson says. “This movie is very much like my version of New York.” 

More than any shared cultural geography, though, Johansson's family tree suggests deep roots in the heart of Kamen's screenplay. While Johansson's maternal great-grandfather, Saul Szlamberg, had moved to the United States before the start of the Second World War, his brother and two nieces had died in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. 

These losses seem to reverberate deeply for Johansson, who has noted that she rarely cries while reading scripts – with the exception of this project, and Taika Waititi's screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, which also pivoted around the persecution of Jews in the Second World War (a film that earned the star an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress).

Telling Eleanor's story, and what the world today looks like for actual Holocaust survivors, “was definitely some part of” the attraction to the story, says Johansson. “But I also found the theme of forgiveness to be incredibly touching. And certainly Bessie's survivor story is raw and shocking.”

To that end, Johansson and her creative partners sought collaboration with the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation, which Steven Spielberg founded following the production of 1993's Schindler's List to preserve and share Holocaust survivor stories. 

“They helped us craft Bessie's story so that it was plausible and in a respectful way, and they gave us so much information about all the movement of people in that horrible time, like just physically moving and separating families from one another,” Johansson says, noting that she also cast real-life Jewish survivors to play members of Eleanor's support group. 

“It was important to get their input and feel like we were honouring the survivor stories. They were an amazing resource.” 

Any and all support was needed given that – unlike the months, sometimes years of preparation that one Johansson's Marvel movies receives – the director had to get Eleanor the Great up and running in a narrow window of time. That might be a typical challenge for any lower-budget production, but it wasn't especially easy when the star of your film was on the cusp of turning 95 years old.

“June is incredible – she has so much energy and stamina. It never was an issue of her willingness to do the work. Even with some of her mobility issues, she was completely prepared, dedicated, passionate. I never thought to ask, ‘Is June up for making it?'” Johansson says. 

“One time I remarked to her that every single angle or shot, you always have one absolutely perfect take. Usually it's the third or fourth take for people. But for her, it's the first that's fantastic. The second, the third. And she said to me, ‘You know, I've been doing this for such a long time that if I hadn't figured this out by now, I'm in the wrong job.'” 

However Eleanor the Great's TIFF launch goes next week – its world premiere at Cannes this past spring was one of the film festival's most sought-after tickets, with a horde of hopeful, soggy moviegoers being turned away from the door during one rainy afternoon – it feels clear that Johansson won't be asking herself whether she's pursued the wrong line of work. 

Unless her next inevitable sequel is titled something like Jurassic World: Midnight Velocity. Keanu, don't get any smart ideas here. 

Eleanor the Great premieres at TIFF on Sept. 8, with additional screenings Sept. 9 and 12. It opens across Canada Sept. 26.

It's tempting to include Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, another film in which Johansson is more supporting than lead, but her haunting, auditory-only performance in Spike Jonze's eerie AI romantic drama is its own sort of spectral presence, lost in a world not of its making. 

4. Lucy (2014)

One of French filmmaker Luc Besson's last great gifts to cinema before he became semi-cancelled is this truly unpredictable riff on Johansson's Black Widow work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

3. Marriage Story (2019)

More than the millions of memes it inspired, Johansson's standout scene with Adam Driver in which their unhappy couple trade insults contains so many raw truths that it feels like the cinematic equivalent of an open scab. Given that she earned a best actress Oscar nomination for the role, this is of course a compliment.

2. Under the Skin (2013)

Only an outsider director such as Jonathan Glazer could fully grasp and then weaponize Johansson's magazine-cover-ready beauty in such a terrifying, entrancing manner.

We might never know what Bill Murray's movie star Bob whispers to Johansson's deeply unhappy college grad Charlotte in the final moments of Coppola's now-certified classic. But that won't stop us from thinking about just how the two got to such a poignant point, and why its emotional potency still lingers today.

A US court ruled the company must share certain information with rival companies to increase competition. Google said the move could result in its rivals having access to its technology.

A US judge ruled on Tuesday that Google will have to share data with its other search engines for the sake of increasing competition in the sector.

In a 226-page decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta also rejected the prosecutors' demand to force the Alphabet-owned search engine to sell Google Chrome, the world's most popular internet browser, and the Android operating system for smartphones.

Google will file an appeal in the case, which could result in years going by without Alphabet having to act on the ruling.

According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the measures demanded by the US Department of Justice could result in the company's technology being given away to its competitors.

The ruling also bars Google from entering into exclusive agreements that would forbid companies from using rival operating systems on mobile devices.

The ruling is the result of a five-year-long legal battle between Alphabet and the US government. 

Last year, Judge Mehta ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in the sector of online search engines. Following that earlier ruling, prosecutors demanded far-reaching remedies to prevent the company from extending its search engine market control into dominance in the area of artificial intelligence.

AI giants like ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Perplexity are reportedly developing web browsers that will rival Google Chrome.

Google is also facing legal claims in other markets it dominates, including its Android app store and online advertising.

The case is part of a larger bipartisan crackdown on the US's so-called Big Tech firms, including other cases against Meta, Amazon and Apple, with a similar legal effort being made in Europe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","US House committee releases thousands of Epstein files","https://www.dw.com/en/us-house-committee-releases-thousands-of-epstein-files/a-73859878","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 05:58:10 GMT","

A US Congressional committee has released over 33,000 pages of files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats said most of the information was already public.

A Republican-led United States House of Representatives committee on Tuesday released tens of thousands of pages from the probe into disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein amid the case becoming a political headache for the Trump administration.

 The 33,295 pages, which are a part of a first batch of documents related to Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, were released by the House Oversight Committee on its website after being handed over by the Justice Department following a subpeona.

 ""We're in the process of uploading those documents for full transparency so everyone in America can see those documents,"" Republican Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told the media.

 ""It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded,"" Comer said. ""We want those to be public as soon as possible.""

There have been mounting cross-party calls for more transparency in the infamous case.

Epstein, an affluent financier with powerful connections, was charged with running a sex trafficking ring that exploited underage girls for a number of prominent clients.

He died in a New York prison cell in 2019, where he was awaiting trial. Authorities ruled his death a suicide.

It was not immediately clear whether the documents released on Tuesday contained previously unknown information.

US Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said 97% of the documents released Tuesday had already been made public.

""There is no mention of any client list or anything that improves transparency or justice for victims,"" Garcia said in a statement. ""House Republicans are trying to make a spectacle of releasing already-public documents. Pam Bondi has said the client list was on her desk. She could release it right now if she wanted to.""

Garcia said the  Oversight Committee on Tuesday heard directly from the victims of Epstein and Maxwell.

""The stories were horrific and infuriating. In the days and weeks ahead we will be hearing more from these victims,"" he wrote on X.

The House committee said in a statement that it expects to receive more records from the Justice Department and that they are being redacted to protect victim identities and remove any child sexual abuse material.

According to Reuters news agency, the materials released on Tuesday contained at least eight videos of what appeared to be police interviews with victims. Many of the interviews are timestamped between 2005 and 2006.

US President Donald Trump, who was a friend of Epstein, has been under pressure to release the documents after he vowed to do so during his presidential campaign. 

Demands for the full disclosure of files related to the case have risen even within his own ranks in recent months, despite Trump's statements that no one should ""waste time"" on the files.

Epstein's death triggered conspiracy theories, especially among Trump's supporters, that sensitive information had been covered up.

Many of Trump's supporters, notably those in the core Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement,  have accused the administration of shielding powerful figures allegedly tied to the case.

Kremlin dismisses Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Ukraine talks proposal over remarks about President Vladimir Putin

NATO chief expects swift agreement on Ukraine security guarantees

Putin thanks Kim Jong Un for North Korea's help fighting in Ukraine

Kim tells Putin North Korea willing to help Russia with 'everything'

US President Donald Trump says he is 'very disappointed' with Putin

This is an overview of the latest developments in Russia's war in Ukraine on Wednesday, September 3:

As US President Donald Trump tries to negotiate peace between Ukraine and Russia, discussions are underway on what might happen to the Ukrainian region of Donbas, which comprises Donetsk and Luhansk, and whether Ukraine might have to accept territorial concessions in exchange for a ceasefire. 

Read what the residents of eastern Ukraine told DW about the possibility of surrendering Donetsk and Luhansk to Russia. 

Leaders taking part in the ""coalition of the willing,"" a group of allies working on security guarantees for Ukraine, might invite US President Donald Trump to join the hybrid call, a German government spokesperson said.

""I can't pre-empt anything, but there are deliberations to dial in the US president,"" the spokesperson said during a press briefing in Berlin.

Members of the coalition are meeting in Paris on Thursday.

The mostly virtual meeting is expected to focus on what type of security guarantees can be provided to Ukraine to prevent another Russian attack in the event of a ceasefire.

The United Kingdom has imposed new sanctions on Russian officials and youth organizations linked to what it described as Moscow's policy of forcibly deporting and indoctrinating Ukrainian children.

Organizations such as the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation, which runs re-education programs for Ukrainian children and teenagers, subjecting them to militaristic training, and its president, Aymani Nesievna Kadyrova, are among those targeted, according to the statement.

The sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans, and other penalties.

""The Kremlin's policy of forced deportations, indoctrination and militarization of Ukrainian children is despicable,"" UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said.

Ukraine says more than 19,500 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory during the war without the consent of family or guardians, calling the abductions a war crime.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023 over the abduction of Ukrainian children.

The Kremlin said people should ignore German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comments about peace talks for Ukraine after he had made what Moscow called a series of ""unfavorable"" remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Tuesday, Merz called Putin ""perhaps the most serious war criminal of our time."" 

""He is a war criminal,"" Merz told German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1, adding he has ""no reason to believe"" the Russian leader wants a ceasefire with Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Merz's proposal to hold Ukraine-Russia ceasefire talks in Geneva should not be considered because of his comments.

Aleksander Ceferin, president of UEFA, European football's governing body, said banning Russian teams has not helped end the war in Ukraine, and he also opposes banning Israeli athletes over the war in Gaza.

Speaking to Politico, he said he wanted politicians to do more to stop these wars.

Russian teams have been banned from taking part in matches organised by football's European and world governing bodies since Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

""We were among the first to act, truly believing that sport could help put an end to this tragedy. Sadly, life showed us otherwise. Now I don't see much reaction from politics. From civil society it's huge,"" he said.

""I cannot understand how a politician who can do a lot to stop the slaughter, anywhere, can go to sleep seeing all the children and all the civilians dead. I don't understand it. You know, the idea football should solve these problems? No way,"" he added. 

He also supported the idea of reinstating Russian under-17 teams into European competitions. 

""I still think that the children should be treated differently because, you know, they are raised in fear and hatred,"" he said.

""They would understand that we are not their enemies, that nations are not enemies between each other. But politicians, they don't care about that,"" he said, adding that children also don't vote.

NATO chief Mark Rutte expects to receive clear information tomorrow, or soon afterward, about what security guarantees can be provided to Ukraine.

He said he anticipates that clarity will emerge during a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and allied leaders.

The ""coalition of the willing,"" made up of about 30 countries, is scheduled to meet in Paris on Thursday.

They intend to support Ukraine's military and would discuss the deployment of troops if a ceasefire is reached.

On Tuesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, however, stated that there are no concrete plans for military action, ""at least not in Germany.""

He emphasized that long-term security guarantees can only be decided once a ceasefire or peace agreement is in place.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a series of high-level diplomatic engagements aimed at increasing pressure on Russia and securing further support for Ukraine.

His first stop will be the Ukraine-Nordic and Baltic States Summit in Denmark on Wednesday.

In a statement posted on social media, Zelenskyy said: ""We are preparing significant reinforcements for Ukraine.""

He is also due to have bilateral meetings in France later on Wednesday.

""We are also preparing a format of the coalition of the willing and new steps in relations with the European Union and the United States,"" he wrote.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine suffered another night of Russian drone and missile attacks, posting pictures of what he said were emergency services responding to those attacks. 

""Putin is showing his impunity. And this undoubtedly requires a response from the world. It is only due to the lack of sufficient pressure, primarily on Russia's war economy, that this aggression continues,"" he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his soldiers' fighting ""heroically"" with Russian forces in Ukraine.

The two leaders held bilateral talks in Beijing after attending a military parade hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""At your initiative, as is well known, your special forces participated in the liberation of the Kursk region,"" Putin told Kim. ""Your soldiers fought courageously and heroically.""

South Korea estimates North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops and large amounts of military equipment, including ballistic missiles and artillery, to support Russia's war in Ukraine. According to Seoul, some 2,000 North Korean soldiers are estimated to have died fighting for Russia in Ukraine. 

Kim said that cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow has ""significantly strengthened"" since the two countries signed a strategic partnership pact in June last year.

""If there's anything I can do for you and the people of Russia, if there is more that needs to be done, I will consider it as a fraternal duty, an obligation that we surely need to bear, and will be prepared to do everything possible to help,"" Kim said.

US President Donald Trump said he is ""very disappointed"" with his Russian counterpart,Vladimir Putin, for failing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine.

Trump was speaking on the Scott Jennings Radio Show.

Trump recently gave Putin a two-week deadline to start talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""I'm very disappointed in President Putin, I can say that,"" Trump responded when asked if he felt betrayed by Putin's response. ""We had a great relationship, I'm very disappointed."" 

The president recently gave Putin a two-week deadline to start talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump said his administration was planning on ""doing something to help people live."" He did not provide any specifics on potential steps the US would take.

Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump said there would be consequences if Putin and Zelenskyy fail to meet to end the war in Ukraine. 

Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un joined Xi Jinping as guests at a military parade in China.

After the massive event, the Russian and North Korean leaders held talks, discussing the war in Ukraine among other topics.

It's clear that bilateral cooperation between Russia and North Korea has grown stronger. Kim even described his country's support as a ""fraternal duty"" to help Russia.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump expressed his ""disappointment"" with Putin over the failure to reach a peace deal on Ukraine.

However, that disappointment hasn't prompted the US president to take any concrete action, only a vague promise to ""do something to help people live.""

More than 33,000 pages of records related to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released by the US House oversight committee on Tuesday.

According to Ro Khanna, a Democrat on the committee, 97 per cent of the documents were already in the public domain.

The committee subpoenaed Donald Trump's department of justice (DoJ) for the documents, but Mr Khanna accused the department, which turned over the first batch of records last month, of stonewalling.

“Only 3 per cent of the documents given to the Oversight Committee are new,” he said.

“The rest are already in the public domain. Less than 1 per cent of files have been released. DOJ is stonewalling.”

Thousands of pages of documents related to the Epstein investigation have been released previously.

The House committee said in a statement that it expects to receive more records from the DoJ and they are being redacted to protect “victim identities” and remove “any child sexual abuse material”.

Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-level connections, died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking of underage girls.

Epstein's death and the US government's handling of his case has caused a political headache for Mr Trump, with many of his supporters embracing conspiracy theories surrounding the late paedophile.

Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Mr Khanna have proposed a measure that would require the DoJ to release all of its unclassified Epstein records, including those held by the FBI and US attorneys' offices.

Mr Massie and Mr Khanna will hold a press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday morning. 

The materials released on Tuesday included at least eight videos of apparent police interviews with victims. Several of the interviews are timestamped from 2005 and 2006.

In one video, a girl whose appearance and name are edited out, said Epstein paid her $350 for a massage and sex when she was 17 years old.

“He has the girls take off their clothes and give him a massage,” she said in the 17-minute video.

Other records include audio recordings from the criminal investigation of Epstein in Florida, including what appeared to be an interview with a victim whose name and date of birth were edited out.

The committee has subpoenaed the DOJ and Epstein's estate for documents and convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition.

The DoJ released a transcript last month of an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, the accomplice of Epstein, in which she said Mr Trump was friendly with the convicted sex offender but was “never inappropriate with anybody”.

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, was interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer.

The 63-year-old Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate convicted in connection with his activities, was moved from a prison in Florida to a minimum security facility in Texas following the interview with Blanche.

When Israel targets Palestinian seed banks, it's not just destroying buildings. It's attacking the future itself.

When Israel targets Palestinian seed banks, it's not just destroying buildings. It's attacking the future itself.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This summer, Israeli bulldozers rolled through the West Bank city of Hebron with ruthless efficiency, targeting not soldiers or weapons caches, but something deeply vulnerable: Palestine's only surviving national seed bank.

Within hours of the bulldozers' arrival on July 31, 2025, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees' seed multiplication facility lay in ruins — its propagation materials scattered, its infrastructure demolished, and with it, generations of Palestinian agricultural heritage reduced to rubble.

What happened in Hebron fits the legal definition of ecocide — the deliberate destruction of ecosystems to undermine human survival. The Union of Agricultural Work Committees condemned this attack as “an act of erasure intended to sever the generational ties between farmers and their land.”

When ecocide operates within the context of genocide, as it does in Palestine, it functions as a temporal weapon that extends the logic of elimination far beyond the present moment, reaching into an indefinite future where recovery becomes systematically impossible.

The Union of Agricultural Work Committees' seed facility housed over 70 baladi (heirloom) seed varieties, many of which no longer exist elsewhere, that Palestinian farmers had cultivated and perfected over centuries. These seeds — for rare, indigenous, hardy strains of tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, zucchini, and others collected from local farms in the West Bank and Gaza — weren't just any seeds. They were living libraries of Palestinian agricultural knowledge, carrying genetic traits for drought resistance, soil adaptation, and nutritional density that commercial varieties lack.

Their destruction was no accident. It was strategic.

Contemporary legal definitions of ecocide describe it as “unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment.” But this clinical language fails to capture the temporal dimensions of environmental destruction when deployed as a weapon of colonial control.

These seeds … were living libraries of Palestinian agricultural knowledge, carrying genetic traits for drought resistance, soil adaptation, and nutritional density.

Unlike direct physical violence, which operates in the immediate present, ecocide functions across temporal scales. The destruction of seed banks eliminates not just current agricultural capacity, but future possibilities for food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, alongside the ability to define their own food and agriculture systems, centering community and resisting the demands and reliance on corporate food regimes. Indigenous seed varieties, once lost, cannot be recreated — they represent thousands of years of co-evolution between plants, soil, climate, and human knowledge systems. Their destruction constitutes a temporal amputation — the severing of a community's ability to reproduce itself across generations.

This temporal dimension transforms ecocide from an environmental crime into genocidal strategy. The 1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” Crucially, Article II(c) includes “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.” Ecocide operates precisely through this mechanism — creating conditions where the targeted group cannot sustain itself over time.

Palestinian agriculture has always been more than economic activity — it represents a form of cultural continuity and resistance. Traditional Palestinian farming practices integrated olive groves with wheat, barley, legumes, and tree crops in polycultures that maximized both biodiversity and resilience. This agricultural system sustained Palestinian communities for millennia while maintaining soil health and water conservation.

The destruction of seed banks severs this generational chain of knowledge transmission. Each heirloom variety carries within its genetic structure the accumulated wisdom of Palestinian farmers who selected, saved, and improved seeds over centuries. When these varieties are destroyed, the cultural knowledge embedded within them — when to plant, how to process, which varieties thrive in specific microclimates — becomes orphaned, disconnected from its material foundation.

The destruction of seed banks eliminates not just current agricultural capacity, but future possibilities for food sovereignty.

In August 2025 alone, Israeli Occupation Forces uprooted 3000 olive trees in al-Mughayyir, near the West Bank city of Ramallah — gutting a community whose survival and identity are inseparable from its groves. Since October 2023, Israeli forces and settlers have destroyed over 52,300 olive trees in West Bank alone and the record stretches back to over six decades, with estimates surpassing 3 million uprooted olive and fruit trees.

Each tree cut down represents more than lost income — it is the severing of ancestral ties and the deliberate dismantling of a self-sustaining agricultural system that has nourished Palestinian life. The systematic nature of this destruction is not incidental collateral of war but part of a sustained campaign of agricultural erasure, aimed at making cultural continuity impossible.

Young Palestinians growing up under occupation already face systematic barriers to accessing ancestral lands. The destruction of agricultural heritage adds another layer to this dispossession, ensuring that even if land access were restored, the specific varieties and knowledge systems that sustained Palestinian agriculture for generations would remain irretrievable.

The temporal logic of ecocide extends beyond Palestine's borders, connecting to global struggles over seed sovereignty and agricultural biodiversity. Industrial agriculture has already driven the extinction of an estimated 75 percent of agricultural biodiversity since the 1900s. This “genetic erosion” makes all human communities more vulnerable to climate change, plant diseases, and environmental disruptions.

Indigenous and traditional seed varieties often carry genetic traits for drought tolerance, disease resistance, and nutritional density that commercial varieties lack. The destruction of Palestine's seed bank eliminates these traits not just for Palestinians, but also for the global gene pool. In an era of climate crisis, such biodiversity represents irreplaceable adaptive potential for human survival.

The targeting of seed banks in conflict zones — from Palestine to Sudan to Ukraine — reveals how ecocide operates as a global strategy of domination. By destroying the biological foundation of food sovereignty, powerful actors ensure that displaced and oppressed populations remain permanently dependent on external food systems controlled by their oppressors.

Perhaps the most insidious aspect of ecocide is its indefinite temporal reach. While physical violence creates immediate trauma that communities can potentially heal from, the destruction of ecological foundations creates wounds that may never close. Seeds destroyed today cannot be replanted tomorrow — their genetic information is gone forever.

This creates what professor Rob Nixon has termed “slow violence” — harm that unfolds gradually across temporal scales that exceed individual human lifespans. Palestinian children born today will inherit an impoverished biological landscape, with fewer Indigenous food varieties, degraded soil ecosystems, and diminished agricultural knowledge systems. Their children will inherit even less.

The undeterminable nature of this future damage is precisely the point. Ecocide operates through the creation of permanent dependency and vulnerability. By destroying the biological foundation of Palestinian food sovereignty, occupying forces ensure that resistance cannot take root — literally — in future generations.

Recognition of ecocide as a crime against humanity represents a crucial step toward accountability. Several countries have already criminalized ecocide in their domestic legal systems, and there are growing calls for the International Criminal Court to recognize it as a crime under international law.

But legal frameworks alone cannot address the temporal dimensions of ecological destruction. We must pay attention to the ongoing genocide in the present and be woefully aware of the temporal extension of the harms that we are complicit in. We need new models of accountability that recognize harm across generational time scales — reparations that address not just immediate damage, but the ongoing impacts of biological impoverishment.

The destruction of Palestine's seed banks reveals ecocide as a weapon of temporal control — a strategy for extending genocide beyond the present moment into an undeterminable future. Understanding this temporal dimension is crucial for developing effective forms of resistance, solidarity, and accountability.

Despite these systematic attacks, Palestinian agricultural resistance continues, and seed savers persist. Every saved seed becomes an act of refusal — a rejection of the logic that says Palestinians have no future. Each act of preservation becomes a bridge across the wounds that ecocide seeks to create.

Vivien Sansour, founder of the Palestine Heirloom Seed Library, has spent years searching for traditional varieties to save and propagate. Sansour's vision for the library is “not just about Palestinian seeds, but about how Palestinian seeds can tell the story of tenderness of our people, and people around the world that have made it possible for us to have shade under a tree.” Based in the UNESCO World Heritage village of Battir, her project seeks to preserve heritage seed varieties and traditional farming practices. In this patient work of recovery and propagation lies the possibility of futures that oppressive forces cannot control — futures that remain, like well-saved seeds, full of unexpected potential for new growth.

The occupation's bulldozers destroyed buildings and scattered seeds. But they cannot destroy the deeper truth that Palestinian seed keepers like Sansour embody.

“I have seen seeds make their way out of concrete,” Sansour says. “I have seen people come out of rubble, and I have saved my own seeds in ashes, and I have seen life insisting on itself — not because of us but despite us.”

This trope has long been used to justify repression of anarchists, communists, liberals, immigrants, and unions.

Listening to the incendiary rhetoric emanating from Trump and MAGA world, one would think the United States of today, decades after the collapse of the communist bloc, was enmeshed in an existential struggle against communism. Even before his election win in 2024, Trump claimed his opponents' economic policies were at the extremes of leftism. Kamala Harris, he said, had gone “full communist.” With Trump setting the tone — and now ensconced in the White House — his minions have amplified that rhetoric as a way of justifying their repressive onslaught. For example, Homeland Security Director, and anti-immigrant stormtrooper, Kristi Noem told the press in July that liberals “are actually turning out to be a bunch of communists and Marxists.” In like fashion, Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff Steven Miller — speaking in Washington's Union Station after the military was dispatched to that city, proclaimed, “We're not going to let the communists destroy a great American city.” The tenor and tone of all this show no signs of abating, as the fascistic moves and raw assertion of power continues.

That the trope of anti-communism is being invoked and retains such power, is in no small measure a testament to the legacy of the anti-communist initiatives of the 20th century. This writer's forthcoming book, Menace of Our Time: The Long War Against American Communism, takes a deeper dive into that history. Given the moment we find ourselves in, it is worth exploring some.

In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. What followed was a wave of repression in which his assassin, an erstwhile anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed, all within two months of the shooting. In the aftermath, New York State passed a law proscribing what it called “criminal anarchy,” making it a felony to advocate — not plan for, let alone move to carry out — revolution. The law would serve as a major weapon against organized leftists, specifically communists, who emerged in the early years of the 20th century.

Fast-forward 18 years, and an anarchist bombing at the home of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer triggered the Palmer Raids, a key chapter of what would come to be called the First Red Scare — a government roundup of thousands of anarchists and communists, hundreds of whom would be deported. Arrested in this period and prosecuted under the criminal anarchy law was the then-communist Benjamin Gitlow, convicted and imprisoned for publishing a document called The Left-Wing Manifesto. The conviction, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, was upheld. As the court wrote in its opinion, “It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration.” This principle of anti-advocacy — a fundamental negation of the First Amendment — would remain the law of the land for decades. It would also be a major instrument leveled against domestic communists.

This period also saw the rise of a young up-and-comer in the U.S. Justice Department: J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, who was modernizing the Bureau of Investigation (later the Federal Bureau of Investigation), created a filing system of anarchists and communists that would be a cornerstone of the FBI's work going forward. The bureau also deployed government informants who gathered intelligence, facilitated raids, and spread insidious rumors about the loyalty of dedicated comrades. It was a methodological template that would come to serve the FBI well.

While the fallout from the Palmer Raids subsided by the mid-1920s, the communists, who would cohere into the Communist Party USA (CPUSA or CP), would become the preeminent target of the FBI and other anti-communist forces. In doing so, it confronted the repressive bite of not only the bureau, but also the anti-syndicalism and criminal anarchy laws that had been passed in nearly every state in the U.S. — to say nothing of the routine harassment by right-wing forces and local police.

Such was the situation as the country entered the Great Depression. It was during this time that rank-and-file communists and their supporters fought for unions, the unemployed, and opposed lynchings and the larger Jim Crow system. In doing so, they confronted unceasing pushback — firings, violent attacks on their meetings, arrests on the picket lines, beatings by police, and even killings. All of this was facilitated by a media sounding a hyperbolic alarm against a communist menace.

That alarm would grow shriller as the country approached World War II. The communists, whose initial anti-war position was at cross purposes with the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, were targeted by early predecessors of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. They also saw their leader, Earl Browder, imprisoned for traveling under a false passport. At the same time, new anti-communist laws were enacted: the Voorhis Act, requiring the registration of agents of a foreign power (i.e., the CP); the Hatch Act, proscribing communists in government; and the Smith Act against teaching the principles of revolution. It was also during this time that Roosevelt bestowed extraordinary powers on the FBI to target domestic communism. That led to measures such as the creation of a custodial detention list — essentially a concentration camp scheme to round up communists if an emergency order was given. When the communists abandoned their anti-war position with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the repression abated — though hardly ended. It was a circumstance that would not last.

With the onset of the Cold War, the government undertook its most aggressive wave of anti-communist repression ever, imprisoning or holding under indictment dozens of the party's top leaders by way of the Smith Act. This formal repression also fostered a social climate where communists became pariahs of the first order.

An indication of how deeply anti-communist sentiment penetrated the public consciousness could be seen in a 1954 poll by the Opinion Research Corporation. When asked if congressional committees hurt innocent people, 49 percent of the respondents said yes. Then, when asked if innocent people could be hurt in the process, 58 percent said, hurt or not, it was more important to uncover communists. The vast majority of Americans also said that communists should be stripped of citizenship, that the government should be allowed to tap their phones, and that it was a good idea “for people to report to the FBI any neighbors or acquaintances whom they suspected of being communists.” That this repression garnered such support — despite the modest actual influence of U.S. communists  —  was an example of how a negative consensus could be built through unrelenting demagoguery. In the fifties and to a lesser degree in the sixties, it was communism; in the eighties and nineties, it was terrorism, in the wake of 9/11 it was Islam, first Al Qaeda, then ISIS, and now again it is “the communists” and “the woke left.” The names may have changed, but the methodology has not.

While the fever pitch of the Second Red Scare would lessen as the fifties gave way to the sixties, the pursuit of the CP did not. This era witnessed the initiation of the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO), the first and possibly the most extensive of all their notorious surveillance and infiltration efforts.

One example can offer insight into the program's myriad operations: the case of Aaron Libson, a closeted gay man and communist activist living in Philadelphia. In 1966, Libson was arrested by undercover police in a “tearoom”  —  a restroom in a public park used for gay encounters  —  on a sodomy charge. When the FBI, who knew Libson was a communist, learned of the arrest, they snapped into action with a COINTELPRO operation. As an FBI memorialized, the point was to “neutralize Libson with the party and embarrass the party generally.” To achieve this, they anonymously called James Dolsen, the head of the Philadelphia CP, as well as one of their press contacts “who has been used quite successfully in the Counterintelligence Program and has always protected the Bureau's interests.”

Libson describes what followed:

“When I had the arrest, I pleaded nolo contendere  —  I do not wish to contend  —  on a Friday. The next day, Saturday, I woke up and got ready for work, and as I looked at the paper that morning, there was a small article saying, ‘Local Red arrested.' I had a suicide plan ready just in case it came out, so I thought, OK, this is it and I carried out the plan. … I wasn't going to do anything at my house where my family would find me, so I rented a room at the Arch Street YMCA. I'd packed some of the crystal stuff you clean toilets in some tin foil, and I swallowed that and laid down and waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. In the interim, I'd called a friend of mine. While I was waiting for something to happen with the poison, I got up and sat on the window ledge  —  the room was on the fifth floor. As I realized the poison wasn't working.”

Fortunately, the friend stopped things from going further. For its part, the Bureau counted this as a victory. As the noted in a memo detailing various COINTELPRO operations, “After Libson entered a guilty plea in February 1967, the fact was published in a newspaper, Daniel Rubin, National Organizational Secretary, stated Libson was dropped from the CP.”

While COINTELPRO officially came to an end after being exposed in the early 1970s, the surveillance and attention to the CP did not. In 1978 Congress established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which allowed for the legal wiretapping of those the US considered foreign agents, which included the pro-Soviet, CPUSA. The Bureau also kept in place its informant Morris Childs, who was acting as CP General Secretary Gus Hall's liaison with the Soviets — a paradoxical circumstance of the Bureau both facilitating the funding of the CP, something Child's was responsible for, while also garnering precious intelligence — and then there was the FBI's investigation of the Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES) because of perceived communist infiltration. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the extraordinary attention to the CPUSA ended, if not the legal and extralegal measures against other perceived enemies.

Were all this a matter of the past, it would be bad enough, but this history has thrust itself into the present. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used against communists and anarchists during the Palmer Raids of 1920, was leveled in 2025 against Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mahmoud Khalil. Trump has talked about stripping immigrant citizens of naturalization; meanwhile, the MAGA shock troops have set their sights on the political opposition. Elise Stefanik, the MAGA congresswoman from New York, has called New York City's mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a “raging antisemite communist.” The methodology behind this is hardly concealed. Trump, while running for president in the summer of 2024, made this clear: “All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country.”

While this effort has not been wholly successful, it is a significant problem that no small number of people are swayed by this. In that sense, knowing a little history can serve as a weapon.

 The Battle Against Corruption Is Essential to the War Against Russia

 Daria Kaleniuk and Olena Halushka

Ukrainians know how to make their voices heard—and to make their leaders listen. They will never accept capitulation to Russia, whether in the form of the surrender of Ukrainian land or the abandonment of Ukrainian citizens to Russian occupiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky knows this. It is why he avoided making unacceptable concessions to U.S. President Donald Trump in his latest visit to the White House.

Defending against Russia's unlawful aggression is not the only way that Ukrainians fight for their future. Lately, Ukraine's people have also had to pressure their government in matters of domestic politics. During two whirlwind weeks in July, Zelensky's administration moved to strip two of the country's key anticorruption institutions, the National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), of their independence. On July 21, security services and the office of the prosecutor general conducted searches, all without court warrants, of more than 50 sites linked to NABU investigators, claiming these raids were “an operation to neutralize Russian influence in the agency,” but they presented little evidence of such influence to the public afterward. The next day, parliament adopted a law, which Zelensky immediately signed, granting the country's politically appointed prosecutor general control over all NABU investigations—an authority that had been turned over to the independent SAPO in 2016. In effect, the moves set back Ukraine's anticorruption reforms by a decade.

Ukrainians responded by taking to the streets. They perceived Zelensky's swift attack on these institutions as an assault on the country's anticorruption project and on the EU accession process, in which the formation of NABU and SAPO are important steps. On the same day that legislators voted to empower the prosecutor general, a large crowd of protesters, most of them in their teens and early 20s, gathered near the president's office with handmade signs to demand that Zelensky veto the law. Their message was clear: Ukrainians would not allow backsliding on democratic, transparent governance, even—or especially—amid a brutal war.

Domestic and international pressure grew, and within days, Zelensky submitted a draft bill to parliament reversing the changes. Authority was restored to NABU and SAPO by the end of July. On August 6, after a month of dragging its feet, the government also appointed a director of the Bureau of Economic Security, an agency critical to ensuring a fair postwar reconstruction, and unblocked the selection process for the head of the customs service, which plays an essential role in bringing in government funds.

Protracted war makes Ukrainian democracy vulnerable, but the public's democratic instincts are deeply embedded. The Ukrainian people rally behind Zelensky on the international stage, united in the aim to preserve the country's sovereignty, but the same people are committed to holding his government to account at home. They understand that fighting off corruption is essential to ensuring Ukraine's independent future. In addition to weakening Ukrainian democracy from within, corruption drains the Ukrainian armed forces of resources and presents Russia with ways to meddle in the country's internal politics. Russia cannot conquer Ukraine militarily, so it is placing its hope in an eventual political victory in which a fragmented Ukrainian society cannot resist when future Moscow-aligned politicians attempt to gain power. The Kremlin wants to turn Ukraine into another Georgia, where pro-Russian political actors have largely captured the state and are pushing the country toward autocracy. Only by fortifying its own democratic institutions can Ukraine deny Russia the control it seeks.

Ukrainians have shown themselves capable of doing much of this work themselves, but they also need the help of international partners to strengthen the country's democratic governance. Such reforms block channels for Russian influence and keep Ukraine on the path to integration into the European Union and NATO—memberships that will be Ukraine's only credible security guarantee.

Since the Revolution of Dignity, the 2014 protest movement that forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country, Ukraine has pushed through a series of reforms to improve the rule of law and reduce corruption. The government has not done so for altruistic purposes; instead, it has been spurred on by public demand. Years of polling data show that the fight against corruption has consistently been among Ukrainians' top priorities, and Zelensky's anticorruption pledges played a large part in winning him the presidency in 2019.

The country succeeded in translating public opinion into policy thanks to a combination of internal and external pressures, known as the “sandwich approach.” On one side, Ukrainian civil society relentlessly advocated for reforms and monitored their implementation. On the other, international partners conditioned aid and support for the Ukrainian government on concrete steps toward reform. Together, they empowered reformers within the government to overcome bureaucratic inertia and resistance from entrenched interests to effect meaningful change.

Since 2014, Ukraine built a comprehensive anticorruption infrastructure that few other emerging democracies can match. This included NABU, established in 2015 to investigate high-profile corruption; SAPO, established in 2016 to oversee the work of NABU's investigators and defend its cases in court; and the High Anti-Corruption Court, which became operational in 2019 to hear grand corruption cases. The United States, the United Kingdom, the EU, and EU member states such as Denmark shared best practices, provided technical assistance and training for institutional capacity building, and sent rule-of-law experts to participate in panels that assessed candidates for top posts and submitted shortlists for government approval.

In 2016, the introduction of electronic asset declarations—a system for reporting the incomes and assets of all public officials—bolstered anticorruption efforts. Public procurement processes also moved online, ensuring transparency and access to records. Multiple corruption schemes were shut down in the banking and energy sectors and in state-owned enterprises.



These changes were tectonic. Before 2014, members of parliament, senior government officials, and presidential advisers were beyond the reach of law enforcement agencies. Those agencies were fully controlled by the president, and they used their authority primarily to charge local village council heads with corruption or to go after the president's political enemies. When Yanukovych was ousted, no existing institution had the capacity and will to investigate high-level corruption within his circle.

But after SAPO became fully operational in 2016, Ukraine's anticorruption machinery came to life. Between then and today, 71 members of parliament have been served with corruption-related criminal charges—including legislators belonging to the ruling parties during Zelensky's presidency and that of his predecessor, President Petro Poroshenko. More than 40 judges have been convicted of corruption. Many of them were caught red-handed accepting bribes and sentenced to prison. NABU and SAPO have launched joint investigations with foreign law enforcement, too, giving them new tools to use in the fight against corruption—including the ability to freeze international assets.

Proving their independence and resolve, NABU and SAPO have gone after some of the most powerful individuals in Ukraine, even after the full-scale Russian invasion began. The subjects of their investigations have included the former head of the Supreme Court, Vsevolod Kniazev, who was caught taking a bribe worth $2.7 million; the current head of Ukraine's antitrust agency, Pavlo Kyrylenko, who was charged with illicit enrichment and failure to declare his assets; and oligarchic networks connected to PrivatBank, whose former owners were found by a British court to have stolen nearly $2 billion before the bank was nationalized in 2016.

After the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine's external partners let up on their anticorruption demands, worried about weakening the country during wartime. But Ukrainians themselves never stopped. They successfully pushed for several notable changes over the past few years. The electronic asset declarations system, for example, was shut down for security reasons in the first days of the full-scale war; after a citizens' petition collected almost 84,000 signatures in 24 hours in late 2023, the parliament restored it. Earlier that year, a journalistic investigation that revealed the defense ministry was purchasing food for the army at inflated prices compelled the parliament to pass a law to ensure transparency in nonlethal defense procurements.

Yet the silence of Ukraine's international partners and the new U.S. administration's deprioritization of democracy-building efforts gave the Ukrainian government some cover to roll back reforms at the same time that NABU and SAPO were getting dangerously close to Zelensky's inner circle. Those efforts culminated in June and July, when the anticorruption agencies announced criminal charges against former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, searched the German home of former Deputy Head of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma, and started looking into Zelensky's former business partner and close associate Timur Mindich.



The government seized the opportunity to crack down. In late January, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov replaced the director of the Defense Procurement Agency, the body tasked with buying Ukraine's weapons, contrary to a supervisory board decision, thus undermining the independence of the agency. In the spring, the State Bureau of Investigations, a law enforcement agency, began putting pressure on the High Qualification Commission of Judges, the body that reviews judicial appointments, in an attempt to obstruct the commission's vetting of Ukrainian judges whose professional activities and acquisition of property through illegal means call their independence and integrity into question. And in early July, the government refused to approve the new head of the Bureau of Economic Security, whose mandate includes investigation of economic crimes.

The State Bureau of Investigations also targeted Vitaliy Shabunin, the director of the board of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a nongovernmental organization one of us (Kaleniuk) co-founded that has played an instrumental role in setting up and defending Ukraine's independent anticorruption bodies. On July 11, the bureau conducted abrupt searches—without a court warrant—of the place where Shabunin is currently serving in the military and of his family's home in Kyiv. Authorities seized his and his family's electronic devices, including his children's tablets. Shabunin was charged with allegedly evading military service, even though he had voluntarily enlisted in the military in the early days of the full-scale war and between September 2022 and February 2023 had carried out a commander's order assigning him to work at the National Agency for Corruption Prevention, a government institution. Not coincidentally, the persecution of Shabunin escalated the week before the government went after NABU, ensuring that Ukraine's most prominent watchdog organization would be distracted when authorities stepped in.

But Zelensky's inner circle failed to foresee that thousands of young Ukrainians, not just NGOs, deeply care about good governance, democratic procedures, and independent state institutions. They were willing to take to the streets to make their demands heard. Following the public outcry, EU leaders started issuing statements warning that the new law curtailing NABU's authority would jeopardize Ukraine's EU accession. As a result, the president had no choice but to retreat.

Yet the attacks on NABU and SAPO have not stopped entirely. Staff still face pressure and intimidation. The NABU investigator Ruslan Magamedrasulov, along with his father, was held in pretrial detention on unsubstantiated charges of conspiring to do business with Russia. Parliament is still attempting to curtail independent institutions' powers in less blatant ways, such as by trying to block anticorruption agencies from conducting searches to document the transfer of bribes.

During an August 1 press conference with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin disparaged Ukraine's anticorruption institutions as having “zero efficiency.” This wasn't the only time these agencies have been in Putin's sights; he first mentioned them publicly days before launching the full-scale invasion in 2022. He is fixated on these agencies for a reason. Strong, independent institutions are a serious obstacle to Russia's imperial ambition to subjugate Ukraine, because they close the channels through which Moscow has historically projected influence and attempted to weaken its neighbor from within. By ensuring accountability and transparency, Ukraine reduces the vulnerabilities that Russia could exploit.

Fighting corruption is thus a vital part of the wider war. Ukraine does not have the luxury to postpone this battle until peacetime, and the Ukrainian people will not accept any deviation from the path of democratization they chose in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. They know that corruption is a threat to national security. It imperils Ukraine's EU accession prospects. It leaves the country more exposed to Russian influence. And it siphons away badly needed funds while Ukraine faces a much larger and richer enemy.

Anticorruption efforts have already delivered hard cash for Ukraine's defense. Since the start of the full-scale war, NABU and SAPO have transferred to the armed forces more than $70 million collected through bail payments, recovered bribes, or plea bargains during corruption investigations. In total, NABU and SAPO activities have brought in around $100 million per year in both 2023 and 2024. The agencies' work to ensure accountability in weapons procurement has borne fruit, too. In early August, for example, NABU and SAPO exposed a criminal group of political, military, and business figures that had misappropriated funds allocated by local authorities for the purchase of drones and electronic warfare systems.



But Ukrainians cannot contain corruption on their own. To give the country's people the life they are fighting for, Western leaders must fully commit to Ukraine's victory both on the battlefield and in building a strong, democratic, and resilient polity that will join the EU and NATO. Kyiv, of course, primarily needs modern weapons, delivered in the quantities necessary to win; investment in the domestic defense industry, to ensure sustainable military capacity; and stronger sanctions to crush Russia's war machine, not just contain it. EU and G-7 leaders must finally seize the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held in their countries and use this money for Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.

The country also needs help in undertaking the domestic reforms that matter for its long-term security. European governments in particular have leverage. As part of the EU accession process, which links progress to specific reforms, they should push Ukraine to uphold and protect judicial reforms and anticorruption infrastructure. Further reform is needed to Ukraine's customs and tax administration, where inefficiencies and corruption still bleed public resources. And attacks in any form on institutions and their staff, on civil society, and on independent media must end. These bodies are essential to maintaining checks and balances, especially in wartime.

In the fourth year of the full-scale war, and the 12th year since Russia's initial invasion, Ukrainians consistently remind the world what civic courage really means. They have shown that even an enemy as large and menacing as Russia can be deterred, that governance reforms can move forward during wartime, and that a committed public can encourage leaders to stand their ground on the world stage while also keeping them accountable for malpractice at home. Defeating Russia and building a strong Ukrainian democracy go hand in hand. If Ukraine's partners want to see the country prevail, they must insist on the high standards of governance and accountability that Ukrainian society itself demands.

 The Chance for a Two-State Solution Still Exists—but Won't for Long

 Richard Haass

More than a half century after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 242—which established the principle by which Israel would give up territory it gained in the war in exchange for peace and security—the Israelis and the Palestinians have made no meaningful, much less lasting, progress on their core differences.

It is time for this to change. What little opportunity still exists for realizing progress toward a durable agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians—one that would serve both parties' interests—is fast fading. Political and physical barriers to compromise will soon pass a tipping point.

Israel, mostly owing to its own efforts, now finds itself in a favorable security environment, in which threats along its borders and in the region have been seriously weakened, if not eliminated. The country has never been in a better position to address the strategic challenge posed by Palestinian nationalism, which will require a response with political as well as military dimensions.

But such an environment cannot last forever. Although Israel has a friend in the White House who is prepared to back it in important ways, long-term U.S. and European support for Israel is not guaranteed, especially if even more Americans and Europeans come to view it as a pariah state denying rights to others.

Israel faces a stark choice. It will either need to make a sincere bid for compromise and peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians or risk losing the international support that its long-term well-being requires. Although the two-state solution has become anathema to many Israelis, it remains the best hope for their prosperity and security. That having a state of their own would be good for the Palestinians goes without saying. But it would also be good for Israel; indeed, helping to bring about a Palestinian state has the potential to serve Israel just as much as it would serve others.

The Israelis and the Palestinians have come close to reaching a land-for-peace agreement on more than one occasion. But over the course of the past three to four decades, diplomacy has failed, in large part because Palestinian leaders—Yasir Arafat, the former president of the Palestinian Authority, and also his successors—were unwilling or unable (owing to political weakness) to accept what Israel offered in terms of territory, the status of Jerusalem, and the ability of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. Hamas's opposition to peace was and is more fundamental, because it would require acceptance of the Jewish state as a permanent part of the region.

The costs of this Palestinian rejection of a compromise-based two-state solution have been high. More than five million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza continue to live under Israel's control rather their own. And it has become far more difficult to reach a diplomatic outcome comparable to what the Palestinian leadership rejected in the past.



This is in large part because the situation on the ground has changed. There are now many more obstacles to peace—in particular the some 140 Israeli government–authorized settlements in the West Bank (and another 200 unauthorized outposts) that are home to more than 500,000 Israelis. Each settlement and outpost makes implementing territory-for-peace and building a viable Palestinian state more difficult; every additional settler creates political resistance to such a trade and raises the economic costs of relocating people.

Israeli politics have also changed. Parties on the political left have waned, and those on the right have strengthened. This political shift has been underway for decades but has rapidly accelerated since Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, which relies on the support of what can be described as far-right religious nationalists, has both reflected and accelerated this shift.

Many Israelis and their supporters around the world—even those angry with Netanyahu's conduct in the war and with what many see as an assault on Israeli democracy—now strongly oppose a Palestinian state, fearing that it would become a base from which armed factions would mount operations. Some argue that a two-state solution would whet rather than satisfy Palestinian political ambitions. Others oppose a Palestinian state not just for these reasons but also because they eye Gaza and the West Bank for Jewish settlement. It turns out that radical Palestinians are not the only ones who covet all that lies between the river and the sea.

As a result of these and other developments, declaring the demise of the two-state solution has become something of a cottage industry. And for understandable reasons: at best, it is on life support.

Still, a two-state solution is not yet dead and buried. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians would be better off with a viable, independent, sovereign state inhabited by Palestinians and run by them—but one premised on conditions that would preclude it from posing a security threat to Israel.

A Palestinian state, rather than providing a base for terror, would be more likely to reduce it in ways that the Israel Defense Forces cannot. That is because terrorists can now act with near impunity, as they are not responsible for any territory or economy and have no citizens to answer to. Absent a Palestinian state, Israel likely faces a forever war. By contrast, the government of a Palestinian state would face the military and economic consequences of any attacks it authorized on Israel, which would be acts of war rather than terrorism, and of unauthorized attacks that occurred from within its borders, which a sovereign government is expected to prevent.

This reality should motivate a responsible government—one not run by Hamas—to act in constructive ways while providing Israel recourse if Palestinian leaders proved unable or unwilling to meet their international obligations. Israel enjoyed international support for such recourse in the immediate aftermath of October 7. But Israel has lost any such understanding and sympathy during the period of more than 22 months in which it has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and exposed many more to conditions of extreme hardship.



Resolving the Palestinian issue would also create a context in which the Abraham Accords, and normalization between Arab countries and Israel more generally, could continue and broaden. Arab states could comfortably sell normalized relations with Israel to their citizens if they could point to a path for Palestinian statehood. Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has made clear that it is Israel's unwillingness to restart diplomacy predicated on the prospect of a two-state outcome that holds him back from pursuing closer ties with Israel. Similarly, a Palestinian state would enhance the stability of Israel's neighbors, above all Jordan, because satisfying the call for such an entity would relieve pressure on the Jordanian monarchy, which has long been willing to live in peace with Israel but would face domestic instability were an influx of Palestinians to enter the country and upset its demographic and political balance. Reducing the salience of the Palestinian issue would also allow Israel's national security establishment to focus on other pressing threats, above all those posed by Iran.

A separate Palestinian state would also be good for Israel's identity and internal cohesion. There are some two million Arab citizens of Israel, some of whom could be radicalized if Israel continues to frustrate Palestinian political ambitions and treat Palestinians so harshly. Even more fundamentally, a Palestinian state would free Israel from having to choose between being a democracy and being a Jewish state: granting five million Palestinians equal rights would threaten the latter, while denying them such rights would threaten the former. Obviously, all signs point to Israel denying them such rights, a trend that would only increase Israel's international isolation.

Being seen as open to a Palestinian state would help Israel avoid pariah status around the world, a reality that is gaining momentum as a reaction to Israel's military operations in Gaza. It would reduce the threat of economic sanctions from Europe and stem the growing alienation of many Americans, including younger American Jews—a trend that over time could even jeopardize U.S. military support for Israel. Israeli openness on this matter might also reduce anti-Semitism globally.

Last but most pressing, support in principle for a Palestinian state would offer Israel a pathway out of Gaza and to getting the remaining hostages back. Articulating a path toward a two-state solution is a prerequisite for replacing Israeli security forces with an Arab stabilization force and for creating competition for Hamas, which would lose its near-monopoly on the claim that only it can deliver a state for the Palestinian masses. As the British learned in Northern Ireland, radical groups cannot be defeated with military force alone. They must also be marginalized politically, by making available a diplomatic path that offers more promise than continued violence.

The desirability of an outcome is one thing, but feasibility is something different altogether. The immediate diplomatic focus, therefore, should be modest, given political realities both in Israel and among Palestinians. For those who still favor a two-state solution, the objective for the immediate future should be to preserve the possibility of more ambitious diplomacy and create conditions that would give such diplomacy a chance of one day succeeding.

This policy should have two dimensions: one of avoidance and another of creation. Regarding the former, governments ought to eschew calling for Palestinian self-determination. To paraphrase the Camp David accords that Washington helped broker between Egypt and Israel in 1978, the Palestinians should have the right to participate in the determination of their own future but not to declare or decide it unilaterally. A Palestinian state must be created in tandem with Israel. There is too much history and not enough territory to do it any other way.

Another form of unilateralism to be avoided is the declaration from concerned outsiders—namely Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom—of their intention to recognize a Palestinian state this fall if there is no cease-fire in Gaza. Although these powers view their actions as helpful, in practice they are anything but. The Israelis and the Palestinians must reach an accommodation, and Palestinians must internalize that a state of their own, if Israel is to allow it, cannot be delivered by others without compromise on their part. Adding to the problem is that the choice to recognize a state of Palestine now appears to reward Hamas rather than a moderate alternative.

Israeli unilateralism must also be resisted. Here, the onus falls on the United States, because politics in Israel—born of governing coalitions, demographic changes, and reactions to events such as October 7—have developed in such a way that Israel, left to its own devices, will not exercise restraint. The Trump administration should make clear its opposition to new settlements, new outposts, and any annexation of Palestinian territory. It should also communicate its expectation that settlers and Israel Defense Forces units will respect Palestinian human rights and property rights. What would add teeth to such a stance (something this and previous U.S. administrations have largely resisted doing) would be a message from Washington that, going forward, Israel will not be able to count on the United States to use its veto in the UN Security Council to protect Israel from all economic and diplomatic sanctions if it ignores U.S. preferences. Washington could also impose higher tariffs on Israel if it continues to undermine what limited prospects remain for a Palestinian state. It is possible for the United States to distinguish between support for Israel's security and support for its open-ended occupation and expansion.

Meanwhile, the United States, European countries, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab governments should press not just for an end to the war in Gaza and for the replacement of Israeli occupation forces with an Arab and Palestinian stabilization force; those governments should also put forward a public vision for a larger diplomatic process. They should articulate what they expect of both the Israelis and the Palestinians, what those parties could expect in return, and what they are prepared to do to encourage the process and buttress the results. This would include providing Israel with security assurances and economic assistance to help relocate settlers, and providing a new Palestinian state with what it requires to meet its obligations to its citizens and to Israel. What would be required here is nothing less than a long-term commitment to nation building—or, more precisely, state building.



Ideally, this would encourage the emergence of a more moderate Palestinian leadership willing to speak and act in ways that reassured a majority of Israelis, which in turn might encourage the emergence of a more moderate Israeli leadership. What comes to mind is the impact of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's outreach to Israelis just four years after Egypt attacked Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, which persuaded Israelis that they had a partner whose cooperation would justify the evacuation of settlements and the return of territory that Israel had gained in 1967. The precise terms of a Palestinian state would be addressed and negotiated further down the road by a new generation of Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

It is impossible to describe a path such as the one outlined above with optimism, given where the parties involved are now and how they got there. But there is some reason for hope. One is U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees himself as a peacemaker and who finds himself in a position to be one here. Trump is popular in Israel, and he has the support of many American Jews who define themselves as staunchly pro-Israel. The same holds for evangelical Christians. In some respects, Trump's position calls to mind that of U.S. President Richard Nixon. Nixon was able to extend a hand to communist China in no small part because, unlike other American presidents who might have wanted to do so, he did not have Richard Nixon to worry about.

Much the same holds for Trump when it comes to Israel. His negotiation of the Abraham Accords, moving of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and, most recently, bombing of Iran's nuclear sites all insulate him from criticism and provide him with leverage available to few, if any, of his predecessors. And no Democrat is likely to make hay with the argument that Trump would be selling out Israel by pressuring it—because so many in the Democratic Party want him to do just that. In addition, an active American push for peace would enhance the standing of the United States around the world—and that of its president. The choice is his to make.

Another reason for some hope is that the Arab world is ready to make peace with Israel. Several governments have already done so, and Saudi Arabia is prepared to move forward. Then there is the New York Declaration—the result of a UN conference chaired by Saudi Arabia and France on the two-state solution in late July—which among other things includes a call for Hamas to end its rule in Gaza and to hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. The declaration underscores just how far the Arab world has evolved in its willingness to live alongside Israel.

Finally, there is the fluid political situation in Israel. The number of Israelis protesting the weakening of the country's courts and democracy, and more recently advocating for an end of the war in Gaza and the return of the hostages, suggests that the legacy of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who sought to make careful compromises for peace, remains a strong force in Israeli politics.

Bringing about a Palestinian state will require help from the United States, Europe, and the Arab states. Most important, it will require that the Palestinians demonstrate in word and action that they are prepared to live in peace with Israel. If they are willing to do this, then there is a chance that politics in Israel will evolve—not to mention that Israel will be on the hook to respond in good faith.

It is, of course, possible that Israel will not have a diplomatic partner in the Palestinians, who are deeply divided politically. If so—if Palestinians are not prepared to reject Hamas and embrace moderation and a willingness to compromise—then Israel would be much less likely to be viewed by many, as it is now, as the principal impediment to peace. It would avoid some of the domestic divisions as well as regional and international opprobrium being directed its way. To be sure, Israel would still have to contend with the many internal consequences associated with having more than five million Palestinians living under its control. It would also have to approach Palestinians in a far more humane and responsible way than it has recently in both Gaza and the West Bank. But it would be in an improved situation all the same.

A Palestinian state would not solve every problem. A variation of Winston Churchill's famous assertion about democracy comes to mind: it is “the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” A cynic might say the same thing about the two-state solution, that it is the worst form of diplomatic outcome except for all the others.



Whatever its risks and shortcomings, a two-state solution would leave Israel better off than the alternatives. The status quo of open-ended occupation risks pushing Israel further down the path toward becoming an international pariah. Israel would forever face terrorism from a people who felt they had nothing to lose. The forced transfer of millions of Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank would have the same effect, and possibly destabilize Jordan and other neighbors, jeopardizing the peace that Israel is enjoying with those Arab countries that have sought it. A one-state solution, in which Palestinians became Israeli citizens, would threaten Israel's Jewishness, democratic rule, or both.

Abba Eban, Israel's erudite foreign minister at the time of the country's 1967 and 1973 conflicts with its Arab neighbors, once famously said that when it comes to making peace, the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. He had a point. But today the dictum applies to Israel, as well. Never in the country's history has Israel been more secure from external threat. It is at peace with Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. It has significantly degraded Iran's proxies in the region, above all Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran, Iraq, and Syria are all relatively weak. Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest Arab country, and one that enjoys a unique status in the Islamic world, has signaled its readiness to normalize ties if Israel demonstrates a willingness to address Palestinian national demands under reasonable conditions. And Israel has a staunch friend in the White House.

The United States should make good on its legacy of being Israel's closest friend. Policymakers and American citizens should consider that what is deemed today to constitute a pro-Israel stance could well be judged differently by history. It is in the interests of Israel and the United States alike to try to bring about a Palestinian state before the possibility disappears forever. It is literally now or never.

• Epstein files: On Capitol Hill, some Jeffrey Epstein survivors spoke publicly for the first time at a news conference, urging lawmakers to protect abuse victims. It comes as GOP leadership faces pressure for more transparency on the late convicted sex offender's case without going against the wishes of President Donald Trump, who has attempted to tamp down the political firestorm over Epstein.
    


            • Trump teases talk with Putin: During a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin “over the next few days.” Putin joined the leaders of China and North Korea in a show of force at China's military parade today.
    


• Crime crackdown: Trump floated the possibility of a federal crime crackdown in New Orleans — in addition to the previously stated Baltimore and Chicago — as the next cities his administration could target.
    


            Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she's encouraged President Donald Trump to meet at the White House with victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “I look forward to talking with President Trump about these women that I've met. I also encouraged him, already this morning, that he should have these women in the Oval Office. They deserve to be there,” Greene told CNN after today's bipartisan press conference with 10 survivors.
    


            Greene said she told Trump that she would be happy to put him in touch with the victims' attorneys to set up a meeting, but hasn't gotten an answer back.
    


                    “I am continuing to encourage him that these are the people that deserve to be in the Oval Office, not any of Jeffrey Epstein's rich, powerful friends that allowed this to happen to them, or anyone that may have been a part of it,” Greene said.
                





            Greene said it was an act of “cowardice” for a White House official to say it would be a “hostile act” to the administration for GOP lawmakers to support Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna's effort to force a House floor vote on their bill to release the full Epstein files, while the Justice Department is already cooperating with the House Oversight Committee.
    


                    “Everyone knows I've fought harder for President Trump for years now, and that person has their job because I fought so hard to help him get elected. And this isn't a hostile act towards the administration. The hostile act has been against these women for so many years now,” she said, adding that those who covered for Epstein committed the “real hostile act.”
                





            The Georgia Republican emphasized that no matter which party controls the White House or Congress, she “serves the American people.” Americans, she said, want the Epstein files released in full.
    


            President Donald Trump is looking to expand his federal crime crackdown, floating the idea of sending National Guard Troops to New Orleans next, in addition to Chicago and Baltimore.
    


            Meantime, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser is defending her move to extend the district's collaboration with federal law enforcement.
    


Here's the latest:



            Teresa Helm, a Jeffrey Epstein abuse survivor, slammed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Asked by a reporter about the Department of Justice interview Helm said:
    


                    “Her voice was elevated way before our voices were elevated here, today. And that same calm, manipulative voice that she had, so polite there that day with Todd Blanche was the same, polite, coercive, manipulative voice that I heard as she was grooming me to then send me off to home of Jeffrey Epstein where he would assault me.”
                





            Helm went on to say that nothing that Maxwell says can be believed because “she's been charged with perjury. I, myself, could sit there and listen and as I did. I sat there and listened to this woman's voice lie.”
    


            Helm criticized the lack of pushback from Blanche during the interview.
    


            “Does he even have the facts to be able to push back on her? We could sit there and push back. Why didn't we get to attend that? Why weren't we there that day? Or why wasn't even one of us consulted prior to that day in that meeting?” she asked.
    


            Helm said that she still finds Maxwell's voice “repulsive” and that it is still triggering.
    


            “I'm very angry to sit there and listen. The feelings that come up listening to this woman's voice is repulsive. Yes, I would say it's triggering. We all work very hard on healing and it's still gets to us after two decades,” she said.
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Maxwell.
    


            President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended a US military strike on what he described as a drug-laden boat off Venezuela's coast, addressing the operation a day after US officials confirmed that 11 people were killed aboard the vessel.
    


            The president emphasized the threat posed by the boat and claimed it was carrying “massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that.”
    


            “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again,” Trump added, issuing what appeared to be a broader warning to other trafficking groups.
    


            “We have to protect our country, and we're going to. Venezuela has been a very bad actor. They've been, as you know, they they've been sending millions of people into our country, many of them Tren de Aragua, some of the worst gangs, some of the worst people anywhere in the world in terms of gangs,” Trump said in defense of his administration's decision.
    


            “But Venezuela has been very bad, both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country,” Trump continued.
    


            Trump said earlier this week that the United States had conducted a deadly military strike against an alleged drug boat tied to the cartel Tren de Aragua.
    


            The use of military force against Latin American drug cartels represents a significant escalation by the Trump administration and could have serious implications for the region.
    


            The Trump administration has declared that the Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro “is one of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world and a threat to the national security” of the United States. Caracas has always denied these accusations.
    


            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie warned that blocking his efforts to circumvent party leaders and force a vote on his bill to release all Jeffrey Epstein-related files would be “really bad for Republicans.”
    


            “I care most about the policy here, not the politics of it, but politically it's really bad for Republicans,” he told CNN's Manu Raju.
    


            “They should just have this vote and put it behind them. Eighty percent of Republicans. It's not just Independents and Democrats who want these files released. Eighty percent of Republicans support releasing these files. So they're at odds with our base right now, and particularly the MAGA base,” he said.
    


            Massie confirmed that House Speaker Mike Johnson, in a closed-door meeting, urged House Republicans not to support his discharge petition, to instead support a resolution backing the House Oversight Committee, “and he assured them he would give them political cover, that they would have it by voting for the rule.”
    


            Massie had pushed back in the room against the speaker, CNN previously reported.
    


            He later told CNN that his “message was to my colleagues. And my message to my colleagues was, don't set yourself up.”
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday appeared supportive of Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer subpoenaing other government agencies for Epstein-related records.
    


            “I expect they will. I think the Oversight probe is going to be wide and expansive, and they're going to follow the truth wherever it leads,” he told reporters Wednesday.
    


            He, again, argued that GOP Rep. Thomas Massie's discharge petition “has been made moot and unnecessary” because of the Oversight Committee's work and last night's release of DOJ documents.
    


            “What we're going to do is effectively deputize the Oversight Committee, which is the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, to go do a deep dive on this. And I think they're going to uncover things that have never been uncovered before,” he said.
    


            On a congressional stock ban, he said that he's “generally favorable of the policy.”
    


            “There's a couple of different ideas on the table and we have to build consensus on that, ‘cause you got to do it responsibily. So some of the ideas that have been put forward, I'm not in love with the details of. But I mean it's generally a policy I've always favored. But we have lots of different opinions on that in the conference and in Congress, so we got to work through it,” he told reporters.
    


            He also denied that calling the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” the “Working Families Tax Plan” was a rebranding.
    


            “It's not a rebranding. And what we have to do to sell it is tell the truth, and that's the beauty of it,” he said.
    


            US President Donald Trump welcomed Polish President Karol Nawrocki, a former historian and populist firebrand, to the Oval Office on Wednesday, after he endorsed the conservative politician earlier this year.
    


                    “Polish-American relations are very important, very strong,” Nawrocki said from the Oval Office, adding that relations are stronger than ever.
                





            Nawrocki, a champion of Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election in June and was sworn in last month. The conservative politician is an independent but is closely aligned with the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost its majority in the 2023 parliamentary elections.
    


            Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse PiS's illiberal reforms have become challenging since Nawrocki's election, in part because the Polish president enjoys far-reaching veto powers over bills passed by parliament. Last week, Nawrocki blocked a bill that would extend social welfare payments to Ukrainian refugees living in the country.
    


            On Wednesday, after Trump affirmed that American soldiers would remain in Poland, Nawrocki said: “This is the first time in Polish history, in (the) 20th century and the 21st century, that the Poles are happy that we have foreign soldiers in Poland.”
    


                    We have almost 10,000 soldiers, and this is the signal (to) the whole world, and also to the Russian Federation, that we are together,” he said, also touting Poland's NATO contributions.
                





            Nawrocki also gave a shoutout to the large Polish diaspora in the United States, claiming that most of them voted for Trump.
    


            Brad Edwards, a lawyer for numerous victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Wednesday that Donald Trump helped him with his investigation of the case back in 2009 as he implored the president to back survivors' current-day push for transparency.
    


            For his part, Trump called the latest push from lawmakers and victims of the disgraced financier a “Democrat hoax.” But Edwards said that was not Trump's posture more than a decade ago.
    


            At the time, Trump was not in public office and Epstein had just been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison for his crimes as part of a plea deal that has since faced criticism for being too lenient.
    


            “Back in 2009 and several times after that, he didn't think that it was a hoax then. In fact, he helped me. He got on the phone, he told me things that were helping our investigation. Our investigation wasn't looking into him, but he was helping us then,” Edwards said. “So at this point in time, I would hope that he would revert back to what he was saying to get elected, which is, ‘I want transparency.'”
    


            Both active in the Palm Beach social scene, Trump and Epstein flew together on a private jet and partied side by side at Mar-a-Lago. But Trump has since called Epstein a “creep” and said that before Epstein's death, they hadn't spoken in years. On Wednesday, one of Epstein's victims, Chauntae Davies, said that Epstein “bragged” about his close friendship with Trump.
    


            “His biggest brag forever was that he was very good friends with Donald Trump. He had an 8 by 10 framed picture of him on his desk with the two of them,” Davies said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Edwards assertion.
    


            President Donald Trump issued a warning Wednesday when asked about his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
    


            “I have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other,” Trump said from the Oval office.
    


            “Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it or unhappy, and if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen,” the president added in what appeared to be a veiled threat.
    


            Trump grew visibly agitated when questioned about the administration's actions – or lack there of – so far against Russia.
    


            “How do you know there's no action? Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside of China, they're almost equal. Would you say there was no action that cost hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia?” Trump said.
    


            “You call that no action,” he added. “And I haven't done phase two yet or phase three,” he said, hinting at further punitive steps.
    


            “If you remember two weeks ago, I did, I said, if India buys, India's got big problems, and that's what happens. So don't tell me about that,” Trump added.
    


            Despite repeated threats, the Trump administration has so far been reluctant to slap further sanctions on Russia in its continued efforts to reach a peace deal.
    


            President Donald Trump insisted Wednesday that he would avert a government shutdown later this month, even as he predicted no Democrats would back the GOP's funding measure.
    


            “We won't have any Democrat votes,” he said, adding that even if he devised the “greatest budget ever,” Republicans “wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats, because they've lost their mind.”
    


            Trump offered no explanation of how he plans to pass a funding bill along partisan lines, since the GOP doesn't hold the necessary 60 Senate votes to approve legislation on its own.
    


            Democrats have said that they plan to demand concessions from the White House in exchange for supporting a bipartisan measure before government funding expires at the end of September. Trump officials, however, have signaled little willingness to negotiate.
    


            Trump did appear to acknowledge his remarks could make those talks more difficult, attacking Democrats even as he acknowledged that “I don't want to burn the Republican Party with it.”
    


            “No matter what we did, no matter how good, you could give them everything that they've ever dreamed of and you wouldn't get one vote,” Trump said of Democrats.
    


            President Donald Trump said he would talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “over the next few days” when a reporter asked about the US leader's two-week deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.
    


            “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said without specifying which leader he meant while taking questions in the Oval Office.
    


            A White House official later clarified that Trump was referring to Zelensky.
    


            “I'll be speaking with him over the next few days and we're going to see,” Trump added.
    


            Trump said on August 22 that he would give Putin “a couple of weeks” before enacting potential consequences against Moscow, after urging Putin and Zelensky to meet directly in hopes of ending the war. Trump said at the time, “I'll know in two weeks what I'm going to do.”
    


            Friday will mark two weeks since those remarks.
    


            Meanwhile, momentum around peace talks has stalled, with no sign that the Putin-Zelensky meeting the White House has pushed is happening. Putin this week floated a meeting in Moscow, which Kyiv has dismissed as an unserious proposal.
    


            The US president added today that he's “not happy with all the people,” lamenting how many have died in the war.
    


CLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to clarify that Trump was referring to an upcoming conversation with Zelensky and not Putin, according to a White House official. 



CNN's Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post.



            President Donald Trump floated the possibility of a federal crime crackdown in New Orleans, pointing to support from the state's Republican governor.
    


            “We're making a determination now: do we go to Chicago, or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland.
    


            He continued, “So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”
    


            Trump has repeatedly floated Baltimore and Chicago as the next cities his administration could target following his deployment of the National Guard to Washington, DC, and a federal takeover of the DC police department.
    


            But Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, both Democrats, have strongly pushed back against such intervention. DC is also significantly different from other cities because the federal government has more authority.
    


            Trump later again pointed to Baltimore as a city the federal government could “straighten out.”
    


            “Gov. Moore wanted me to go and walk through Baltimore with him. And I said, you know, ‘I think I'm a brave guy, but there's no reason to be stupid.' … We'd go into Baltimore, straighten that out very quickly, too,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump dismissed renewed calls for the full release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling the transparency push from lawmakers and victims of the disgraced financier a “Democrat hoax.”
    


            “This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday. “We've given thousands of pages of files, and I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going and going.”
    


            The president's remarks came as a group of Epstein abuse survivors gathered on Capitol Hill to speak out publicly in favor of releasing all the documents related to the investigation with appropriate redactions for privacy.
    


            One of them, Haley Robson, took direct aim at Trump's assertion, saying “there is no hoax. The abuse was real.”
    


            But Trump bristled at the fresh effort to get the files released, which has been spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, arguing that it's distracting from his administration's successes.
    


            “What they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is get people to talk about that,” he said. “We're having the most successful eight months of any president ever, and that's what I want to talk about. That's what we should be talking about, not the Epstein hoax.
    


            An attorney for numerous Jeffrey Epstein survivors said they will hold Speaker Mike Johnson and lawmakers accountable related to the Epstein case.
    


            “I can tell you that in the Oversight Committee meeting yesterday, they indicated that they were all for transparency, releasing the files, and asked us to hold them accountable. … So we intend to hold them accountable,” Brad Edwards said at the news conference today.
    


            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie called on his GOP colleagues to sign onto the push to force the full House to vote on a resolution that would require all documents related to Epstein to be turned over.
    


            “I'm not going to give up,” he said.
    


            Under the maneuver, known as a discharge petition, Massie would need just five more Republicans to force the bill to the floor since every Democrat is expected to sign on.
    


            Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna called the survivors who spoke at the news conference “American heroes,” underscoring the bipartisan effort to release more documents related to the Epstein case by adding, “I've never done a press conference with (GOP Rep.) Marjorie Taylor Greene before.”
    


            President Donald Trump suggested China's military parade was designed in part for him to watch – and he was.
    


            “I understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching – and I was watching,” Trump said of the event, where Chinese President Xi Jinping stood with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
    


            “My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland.
    


            Trump hosted Putin in Alaska last month to discuss an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, followed by a meeting with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. But frustrated with the pace of peace talks since, Trump has weighed how involved he should personally be.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin has been embraced on the world stage this week. The show of force in China caught the attention of Trump, who posted on social media Tuesday telling Xi to give his “warmest regards” to Putin and Kim as they “conspire against” the US.
    


            Trump said he thought it was a “beautiful ceremony” and “very impressive.”
    


            Lisa Phillips said that fellow victims of Jeffrey Epstein would work together to compile their own list of abusers if all of the information related to Epstein's case is not released.
    


            “Us Epstein survivors have been discussing creating our own list. We know the names. Many of us were abused by them,” Phillips said at today's news conference on Capitol Hill.
    


            “Now together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know who were regularly in the Epstein world. And it will be done by survivors and for survivors. No one else is involved,” she added.
    


            Phillips told reporters at the news conference to “stay tuned for more details.”
    


            Haley Robson, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse, pushed back against President Donald Trump's previous comments calling the firestorm around the Epstein case a “Democrat hoax.”



            Asked by reporter about the president's past comments, Robson said:
    


                    “Mr. President, Donald J. Trump. I am a registered Republican. Not that that matters, because this is not political. However, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax. We are real human beings. This is real trauma.”
                





            She asked Trump and the rest of the world to humanize survivors.
    


            “These women are real. … I would like Donald J. Trump and every person in America and around the world to humanize us, to see us for who we are and to hear us for what we have to say. There is no hoax. The abuse was real,” she said.
    


            Sky Roberts, Virginia Giuffre's brother, made an emotional plea to lawmakers to make the right choice and seek justice for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse.
    


                    “But here's my one ask: Look these survivors in the eye and tell them why. Then look, the people of the United States in the eye and tell them why. And then when you're alone, look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself why?” Roberts urged.
                





            Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Epstein's sex crimes, who also alleged Britain's Prince Andrew abused her when she was a teenager, died by suicide in April at age 41, her family said.
    


            Roberts said that the issue is not a political one. “This is not about left or right. This is about humanity. This is about doing what's right. And this is about ensuring that the future we leave behind isn't one where the powerful can hide behind their wealth, their influence and their money to evade justice,” he said.
    


            He asked lawmakers to not make the vote about money or power, but justice, appealing to their conscience.
    


            “Whether you're a dad, a mom, a brother or a sister, look your young ones in the face, look them in the eye and tell them you didn't stand against the very people who raped, molested and preyed upon children and young women. Tell them you were willing to negotiate a deal. Money should never be what makes something right or wrong. If you vote no, your stance will be clear,” he said.

            At the White House, President Donald Trump is greeting the Polish President Karol Nawrocki. They will hold a bilateral meeting and lunch soon.
    


            Fighter jets performed a flyover upon Nawrocki's arrival.

            Marina Lacerda spoke out today for the first time about the abuse she suffered from Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “I never thought that I would find myself here. The only reason that I am here is because it feels like the people who matter in this country finally care about what we have to say,” Lacerda said, speaking from Capitol Hill alongside other victims and members of Congress.
    


            Lacerda said she was a 14-year-old immigrant from Brazil working three jobs to support her mother and sister when she was introduced to Epstein and told that she could make $300 to give massages. Lacerda said she had to be at Epstein's New York City apartment so often that she dropped out of high school before ninth grade.
    


            “It went from a dream job to the worst nightmare,” she recounted.
    


            Lacerda said the release of files related to the case could help remember the traumatic experiences she experienced that she has been unable to remember.
    


            “The worst part is that the government is still in possession right now of the documents and information about … that could help me remember and get over all of this maybe, and help me heal. They have documents with my name on them,” Lacerda said.
    


            Lacerda said she was never given an opportunity to testify about her experience and that she has feared for her life and her family's lives.
    


            “We could have saved so many women,” Lacerda said. “Why didn't they let me testify to help stop him?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","What we know about the White House push for federal troops in Chicago","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/us/national-guard-chicago-trump-push-wwk","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 07:00:00 GMT","


            The potential for a showdown over crime in Chicago – not just between law enforcement and crooks but between the federal government and city leaders – is escalating.
    


            With US troops patrolling Washington, DC, after a similar National Guard deployment in June to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump is ramping up his rhetoric against predominantly Democratic cities, with a direct target on the nation's third-most populous.
    


            “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,” Trump said with typical hyperbole Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “(Gov. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC.”
    


            “We're going,” the president hours later told a reporter about sending in the National Guard. “I didn't say when. We're going in.”
    


            Still, the White House refuses to coordinate with local law enforcement, Pritzker said this week, saying cooperation is a necessary step for fighting crime. And the state is ready to fight a troop deployment: “We will do everything possible to ensure that agents operating inside the confines of this state do so in a legal and ethical manner.”
    


Pritzker's clash with Trump offers political test for Illinois governor



            Meanwhile, some residents – and at least one Democrat on the Chicago City Council – argue the National Guard could ease stress on police after a violent Labor Day weekend and say public safety “shouldn't be this partisan.”
    


             “Chicago is not the murder capital of the world; we all know that,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told CNN's Laura Coates. “But we are a city that needs help.”
    


            With no specific plans announced to send the US military to Chicago, here's what we know about violent crime there and what Trump could do soon:
    


            Trump administration officials have been working for weeks to draw up plans for a federal troop deployment to Chicago the moment the president gives the green light, they told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            “We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,” Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson said Saturday.
    


            For now, a ramped-up immigration operation is the one thing the feds have confirmed: “ICE has informed our Illinois State Police Department that they are going to begin operations sometime later this week,” Democratic Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday.
    


            Illinois State Police got a phone call Saturday from Customs and Border Protection indicating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would deploy to Chicago – the first communication Illinois got from the Trump administration on the issue, the governor said.
    


            “First, Donald Trump is positioning federal agents and staging military vehicles on federal property, such as the Great Lakes naval base,” Pritzker said Tuesday. It's also likely federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and CBP will be stationed in the city, he added, citing “unauthorized patriotic officials inside the government and from well-sourced reporters.”
    


            Residents should expect “unidentifiable” agents in unmarked vehicles with masks planning to raid Latino communities in the name of targeting “violent criminals,” despite a very small percentage of those targeted fitting that bill, Pritzker said.
    


            “Instead, you're to see videos of them hauling away mothers and fathers traveling to work or picking up their kids from school. Sometimes they will detain, handcuff and haul away children,” he said.
    


            Any National Guard troop deployment in Illinois to fight crime is “not sustainable,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday.
    


            “National Guard troops are not trained to do local law enforcement,” Raoul said. “FBI agents, DEA agents, ATF agents are trained to fight crime, and they have collaborated with local law enforcement. I would prefer more resources on that end than sending the military illegally into the streets of American cities against American citizens.”
    


            The back-and-forth followed a Labor Day weekend of deadly violence in Chicago worse than in the previous two years, with seven people shot to death, according to preliminary Chicago Police Department reports. In all, 56 victims were hit by gunfire, according to police reports.
    


            A 14-year-old boy wounded in the arm and hand was the youngest victim, while seven people were wounded in a drive-by attack only a block from Chicago Police headquarters. An eighth homicide victim recovered over the weekend from Lake Michigan died by drowning, the Cook County Coroner's Office told CNN; police have not said when they believe he was killed or why the case was classified as a homicide.
    


These Chicago residents welcome extra help fighting crime but don't want Trump to send the National Guard



            Over the same holiday period a year ago, six people were killed by gunfire in Chicago, CNN affiliate WTTW reported, though the figure did not count four people killed on a Chicago “L” train that was outside the city limits at the time of the shooting.
    


            Before the holiday surge, city leaders had been pointing to a broader drop in violent crime in 2025.
    


            “In the first six months of this year, Chicago has seen a 33% reduction in homicides and a 38% reduction in shootings,” said a news release last week from Johnson's office. Overall, violent crime is down 21.4% this year, city figures show.
    


            Trump has been floating the idea of deploying troops inside Chicago for more than a week: “Chicago's a mess. You have an incompetent mayor – grossly incompetent – and we'll straighten that out probably next,” he said in the Oval Office in late August.
    


            But if the president were to federalize the National Guard in Chicago, it is not clear what authority he would cite or what troops would do in the Windy City.
    


            While the president has direct power over the DC National Guard and some authority over that capital city's police department because they are in a federally controlled district, he does not have the same power in states.
    


            “There's very little stopping this president from doing what he wants to do,” said Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and CNN senior law enforcement analyst.
    


            “But he'll find the legal environment and trying to replicate the same sort of surge of federal agents and the presence of National Guard troops very, very different in every city in this country that is not Washington, DC.”
    


            Trump last called up the National Guard against a governor's will in June, sending 2,000 members of the California National Guard into the streets of Los Angeles to push back against protests opposing aggressive immigration raids in the area.
    


            The National Guard played a limited security role, providing security to federal buildings and agents in a square-mile section of downtown where protests had become unruly. Local police, not guard members, responded when people violated a curfew declared by the mayor.
    


Judge says Trump administration's use of US military in Los Angeles violated federal law



            Still, California Gov. Gavin Newsom mounted a challenge in court, and a federal judge agreed Tuesday the situation in Los Angeles did not rise to the sort of emergency that would give Trump power to federalize the National Guard. The administration announced Wednesday it is appealing Breyer's decision.
    


            “President Trump and (Defense) Secretary (Pete) Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into service in other cities across the country … thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” wrote US District Judge Charles Breyer, a nominee of then-President Bill Clinton.
    


            “In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,” he added, a 19th-century law that generally prohibits the use of troops for domestic law enforcement purposes.
    


            Although Breyer issued a court order preventing that sort of National Guard action from being repeated in California, it does not apply to other states, so there's nothing in the decision that directly stops the president from activating it in Illinois.
    


            The last time active-duty military was sent to Chicago against the wishes of local officials was on July 4, 1894, according to the archives of the Chicago Tribune, when a labor dispute at a Pullman factory crippled the nation's rail industry and resulted in days of rioting.
    


            “I protest against this, and ask the immediate withdrawal of the Federal troops from active duty in this State,” then-Gov. John Peter Altgeld wrote to President Grover Cleveland, according to the Tribune.
    


            Since then, military deployments in Chicago have come at the direction of Illinois governors, including during the notoriously violent response to protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and a precautionary call-up in preparation for the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer found guilty in the murder of George Floyd.
    


            “Let us be clear: there is no emergency in Chicago that warrants the President of the United States deploying the military,” 13 Democratic members of Illinois' congressional delegation said in a Labor Day statement.
    


            Despite the general drop in crime this year in Chicago, many residents still feel terrorized.
    


            “My grandkids can't sit outside. They can't sit in the living room or at the kitchen table because a bullet may come through,” said Rochelle Sykes, who lives in a neighborhood with the city's highest number of shooting victims per capita this year.
    


            Sykes is not convinced the city's crime stats are telling the whole story, she told CNN's Omar Jimenez. Indeed, Chicago last year ended its contract with ShotSpotter, whose sound equipment is designed to detect shots fired even if police are never called.
    


            “There's a lot of things that go unreported,” Sykes said, “and these are things that us living in the neighborhood see every day.”
    


            The city can “absolutely use federal resources from the National Guard,” Lopez, the alderman, said, raising the possibility of stationing troops in busy parts of the city, like on Michigan Avenue and at public bus and train stations.
    


            “We are currently allowing officers to spend their eight-hour shift babysitting these locations when they could actually be in the neighborhoods, answering 911 calls,” Lopez told CNN.
    


            Others, however, say calling in the National Guard could make things worse.
    


            “The presence of military, for me, would put our communities in a situation where they feel like they are incarcerated,” said Cedric Hawkins, a resident of the southside Pullman neighborhood who has had nine relatives killed by gun violence.
    


            And many state and local officials are warning that the idea of using the military to deal with crime in US cities is not a precedent they want to set.
    


            “This president … wants to, quite frankly, make the military presence on American soil something that people normalize,” said Stratton, the lieutenant governor. “This is not normal. We cannot normalize it.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day of Gov. JB Pritzker's comments. He spoke Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Kim Jong Un's daughter has made her first public trip outside North Korea. Why is she in Beijing?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/02/china/kim-jong-un-daughter-beijing-intl-hnk","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 01:45:00 GMT","


            As North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stepped off his armored green train in Beijing on Tuesday, greeted by Chinese officials shaking his hand and leading him down a red carpet, many observers noticed a young girl walking behind him, smiling politely, dressed in black with her hair tied in a bow.
    


            This is believed to be Kim Ju Ae, the leader's mysterious daughter. She's has made various public appearances over the years, mostly at military-related events, prompting speculation about why she's in Beijing and whether Kim could be preparing his future successor.
    


            The young girl's first public trip abroad is one of massive significance, at a parade where Chinese leader Xi Jinping will flaunt his military forces, and where her father will stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow autocrats including Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin – partnerships she may very well need to navigate one day.
    


            The child was nowhere to be seen on Wednesday as her father strode down the red carpet at Tiananmen Square ahead of Xi's military parade.
    


            Little is known about Kim's daughter, whose first public appearance in 2022 confirmed her existence, after years of speculation.
    


            American basketball star Dennis Rodman revealed Kim had a baby called Ju Ae when he visited Pyongyang in 2013, telling The Guardian afterward, “I held their baby Ju Ae and spoke with (Kim's wife) as well.”
    


            There are varying reports about her exact age and birth year; it's widely estimated she's now a preteen or early teen, though that's largely based on Rodman's testimony, and it's not clear how many months old she was when he met the family.
    


            Kim's daughter was introduced to the world in true Kim style in 2022, accompanying her father as he oversaw the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Several more public appearances came in 2023 – mostly at military events, such as a military parade where she gazed out at rows of ICBMs in the capital Pyongyang.
    


            At the time, experts said her appearance at these events sent a clear message: that North Korea would hold tight to its weapons, including its nuclear program, and that the Kim clan remained at the center of the country's military power.
    


            “By ostentatiously including his wife and daughter, Kim wants observers at home and abroad to see his family dynasty and the North Korean military as irrevocably linked,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, after the 2023 parade.
    

Kim Jong Un's daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, made her first public appearance outside North Korea, sparking speculation about her potential future as a leader. CNN's Mike Valerio reports more on her Beijing visit. #cnn #news


            North Korea has been ruled as a hereditary dictatorship since its founding in 1948 by Kim Il Sung. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after his father's death in 1994, and Kim Jong Un took power 17 years later when Kim Jong Il died.
    


            Given the significance of the family dynasty, the public debut of Kim's daughter sparked debate about whether she could be groomed as a successor – with mixed opinions among experts.
    


            Some have pointed to the way she's covered in North Korean state media – described as “beloved” and “respected” – as a sign that she may have special status. Bringing her to military events from an early age could be a way to prepare her for the realities of leading 1.3 million armed forces personnel, as well as cultivating trust and respect from those troops, experts have said.
    


            But others are skeptical – saying they've long believed that Kim's two other children would be chosen as successors instead.
    


            Her public appearances could also be a PR move to cultivate an image of Kim as a “family man” or “fatherly” figure, said Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of the center's Korea Program, in a 2024 interview with CNN.
    


            She pointed out that it would make sense for Kim to use his daughter for that purpose instead of his sons, because Rodman had already revealed her existence to the world – whereas even less is known about her siblings, who can still grow up out of the limelight.
    


            For instance, Kim himself studied in Switzerland in the 1990s – but his daughter is “too well-known now, she'll never be able to study overseas,” Town said.

            • Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un stood together publicly for the first time at a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II.
    


            • The event represents a defiant challenge to the US-led world order. In reaction, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US.
    


            • The parade showcased hundreds of advanced weapons and featured more than 10,000 troops, revealing China's growing military power under Xi's push to modernize the world's largest standing army.
    


            Our live coverage has now ended. See the post below for a catch-up on the day's events and scroll further back for a look at the developments as they happened.
    


            You can also read our analysis of today's events here and see pictures from the parade, here.
    


            After a busy few days hosting foreign leaders from around the world, China rounded out events on Wednesday with an enormous military parade, followed by an elaborate musical gala.
    


            For the first time, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood side-by-side publicly, watching the military parade roll by in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
    


            As we end our coverage, take a look below what we've been following today:
    


            After a full day of events in Beijing, China's World War II commemorations have ended with a musical gala that lasted around an hour and a half.
    


            Actors danced and sang songs related to the war, performing on an elaborately designed stage with props and costumes. Dozens of actors took part in the performance.
    


            The gala, named “Justice Will Prevail,” was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
    


            The performance was watched by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, alongside high-ranking officials in the Chinese government.
    


            Xi greeted a number of World War II veterans who were also in attendance before the spectacle began.
    


            The performance was divided into five chapters, and featured some of China's most famous actors and performers. It showed pictures of the signing of the “Declaration by United Nations” in 1942, which affirmed the basic principles of universal human rights, as well as Japan's surrender in 1945.
    


            Towards the end of the performance, a voiceover called upon the people of China to lead the country forward.
    


            “Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, working tirelessly to comprehensively advance China's development and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization,” it said.
    


            A total of 26 foreign leaders have traveled to China in the last few days, with some attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Sunday and Monday, and others arriving for the country's military parade in Beijing that took place on Wednesday.
    


            Though Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were indisputably the guests that gained the most global attention, several other heads of state also took part in the events.
    


            Here's some of the other officials who were in attendance:
    


            Retired Navy Admiral and CNN military analyst, James Stavridis, weighed in on the united front presented by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at today's parade.
    


            “If I were advising Vladimir Putin I would say, be careful what you wish for with China,” Stavridis told John Berman on CNN News Central. “Because you are ultimately going to end up as a very junior partner in that relationship.”
    


            The former naval officer believes the display of solidarity between China's President and Putin is an orchestrated move, part of Xi's wider effort to establish an alternative world order that can challenge the US and its Western allies.
    


            “Xi is smart,” Stavridis said. “He's manipulating Putin. But yes, Putin is feeling pretty good.”
    


            Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said that Donald Trump claiming there is a “conspiracy” against the United States shows that the US president has a “sense of humor.”
    


            After the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea met in China, Trump wrote Tuesday on Truth Social to Chinese leader Xi Jinping: “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
    


            Speaking Wednesday in Beijing, Putin said “the US president does not lack a sense of humor.”
    


            Putin said that he and Trump have developed “good relations,” and that none of the world leaders who joined the summit in China “expressed negative judgments about the current US administration.”
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is willing to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Moscow.
    


            Speaking to the media in Beijing, Putin said US President Donald Trump had asked him to hold talks with Zelensky.
    


                    “Donald asked me if it was possible to hold such a meeting. I said yes, it is possible. In the end, if Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow. Such a meeting will take place,” Putin said.
                





            Earlier in his speech, the Russian leader stressed that he “never ruled out” meeting Zelensky, but questioned whether there is “any point” in such a meeting.
    


For context: Putin's proposal is almost certain to be a non-starter for Kyiv. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukrainian authorities say they have foiled multiple alleged Russian plots to assassinate Zelensky.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that every country has the right to choose how it ensures its own security, including Ukraine.
    


            But the Russian president stressed, while speaking to the media in Beijing, that “the security of one country cannot be achieved at the expense of another country,” reiterating that Moscow opposes Kyiv joining NATO.
    


            Putin's comments come a day before Ukraine's Western allies are set to meet to discuss plans to guarantee the country's future security in the event of a halt to Russia's invasion.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking to the media in Beijing now after attending China's military parade, where he appeared alongside leader Xi Jinping and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
    


            We'll bring you updates when we have them, stay with us.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin is enjoying another moment in the international spotlight on his visit to China, using the occasion to showcase his partnership with a key military ally: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            The massive military parade in Beijing Wednesday was Chinese leader Xi Jinping's show, but Putin also met on the sidelines with Kim, who has sent both soldiers and ammunition to support Russia's war on Ukraine.
    


            Putin praised Pyongyang on Wednesday for sending troops, saying North Korean soldiers “fought courageously and heroically” on the front lines against Ukrainian forces.
    


            After a two-and-a-half hour meeting with Kim following the parade, the two leaders shared a hug, and Putin was heard extending an invitation to his North Korean counterpart to visit Russia.
    


            Western officials estimate around 4,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting on Russia's side from a contingent of around 12,000, deployed primarily to Russia's Kursk border region to help repel a Ukrainian incursion.
    


            The military alliance is now in the open after months of initial secrecy. Kim recently publicly mourned his country's casualties and North Korea has released a propaganda video glorifying the soldiers fighting on Russia's side.
    


            It's a not-so-subtle display of military resolve by Putin just weeks after meeting US President Donald Trump in Alaska to talk about a possible end to the war.
    


            In remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit meeting ahead of the parade, Putin seemed to indicate that he had not budged one inch from the position he held when he launched the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, blaming the West for what he described as the root cause of the conflict: the 2014 Maidan revolution that ended with pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country after a violent crackdown.
    


            And if Putin's resolve to continue the war on Ukraine was in question, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine as Russia rained more than 500 drones and two dozen cruise missiles overnight as the Kremlin leader attended the military parade in Beijing.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin talked with Luong Cuong, the president of Vietnam, on Wednesday evening, in the last scheduled meeting of Putin's trip to Beijing, according to the Kremlin.
    


            Images posted to social media by the Kremlin show the pair smiling and shaking hands in front of their countries' flags, as well as sitting down for the event in the Chinese capital's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
    


            According to a Kremlin translation of Cuong's remarks, the Vietnamese leader told Putin that “every Vietnamese citizen values ​​the great and kind assistance that the Soviet Union and Russia provided us before, when we fought for our freedom, and now, when we are building our country.”
    


            Cuong congratulated Russia on “the great achievements” it “has made over the past time,” the Kremlin added.
    


            “You have overcome many difficulties. We believe that Russia under your leadership will become great, will become a pillar protecting peace, justice and stability. We believe (in it) and wish you success,” he continued, according to the Kremlin.
    


            More than 50,000 people gathered at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Wednesday to witness Xi Jinping's staggering show of military might.
    


            The spectacle also served as a gathering of world leaders, many of whom are part of a growing bloc of illiberal allies seeking to challenge American leadership.
    


            For many people in the West, the defining images of the parade will not be the goose-stepping troops or the nuclear-capable missiles – but rather the sight of Xi standing side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – which is being seen as an unprecedented show of solidarity against the US and its allies.
    


            Moscow hopes US President Donald Trump's claim that Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping are conspiring against America was meant “figuratively,” the Kremlin has said.
    


            As China's military parade got underway in Beijing, Trump posted on Truth Social: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
    


            Speaking to journalists on the sidelines following the Putin-Kim summit Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “no one is plotting any conspiracies” and expressed hope Trump's statement was meant “figuratively, not literally.”
    


            Peskov also added Russia's relations with partners in the East, especially with China and North Korea, as well as meetings within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and other summits, are carried out for the good of their nations, and not against anyone.
    


            “The principle is for the benefit of the peoples of our countries, and not against third countries,” he said.
    


            Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said earlier Wednesday: “I want to say that no conspiracies have been arranged, no one has been conspiring, no conspiracies at all, and moreover, none of these three leaders have even entertained such thoughts.”
    


            Turning our attention back to China's military parade for a moment and let's take a look now at some of the most standout images of the weapons showcased on Wednesday.
    


            More than 50,000 spectators gathered to watch military vehicles, missiles, drones and other weapons roll through Beijing, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
    


            China introduced its newest intercontinental ballistic missiles in years, wheeling the massive DF-61 weapons around on mobile platforms. The DF-61 designation was last seen in the 1970s, according to the Germany-based Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy.
    


            Air-defense lasers were displayed, including one large laser that state-run TV said would be mounted on warships. A land version of the weapon was also shown to spectators.
    


            Two extra-large undersea drones also debuted at the parade, with images showing them dwarfing nearby soldiers.
    


            Scroll down to see a selection:
    


            Chinese leader Xi Jinping's unveiling of advanced weapons at Wednesday's military parade, which included an intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs, was a way of sending a message to the West, a leading military analyst told CNN today.
    


            “China is moving much more rapidly in this critical military technology area than the United States is.” Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in an interview with Rosemary Church earlier.
    


            “They're gaining an advantage that will give them the ability to make it much more difficult for the US and its allies to be able to project power into the Western Pacific in a crisis.”
    


            The leaders' comradery offers a challenge to the West, and an insight into Xi's vision of a new world order, Davis believes.
    


            “It's about intimidation. It's about asserting China's reality, or China's perception, that China's rise is unstoppable.” he added.
    


            Davis sees Xi's showcase of weaponry and display of solidarity with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a warning to the West, particularly regarding Taiwan.
    


            “China is saying to Taiwan, we will impose unification on Taiwan, against the wishes of the Taiwanese people, through military force at a time of our choosing and we're building up the military capabilities to do that.” Davis added.
    


For context: At Wednesday's parade, Xi presented a united front alongside Putin and Kim. The leaders were pictured publicly together for the first time as they walked through Tiananmen Square.
    


            Xi Jinping staged a staggering show of China's military power today, rallying some of the world's most powerful authoritarian leaders behind his vision for a new world order as US President Donald Trump wages a global trade war and reshapes American alliances.
    


Here are some talking points from the day:



Military spectacle: The parade showcased a mix of conventional weaponry and advanced technologies, including air-defense lasers, stealth fighter jets, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs – highlighting China's significant investment in modern warfare capabilities.
    


            Rows of soldiers goose-stepped in perfect unison — long a hallmark of authoritarian regimes' militaries.
    


Autocratic trio: One of the most striking images of the day was Xi walking toward the Tiananmen rostrum, flanked on either side by Putin and Kim, with the other world leaders following behind. It was a clear statement of unity between the strongman leaders, who share a vision for an alternative world order that can counter the US and its Western partners.
    


Putin invites Kim to Russia: After the parade, the two leaders held closed-door talks for more than two hours, and Putin invited Kim to visit Russia. Before those talks, Putin thanked North Korean troops for fighting for Moscow against Ukraine, and Kim said his country would support Russia “as brothers.”



Family affair: Kim also brought two members of his family to Beijing, photos show – his sister Kim Yo Jong, believed to be one of his closest confidantes and advisors, and a young girl believed to be his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who has sparked speculation about being his potential successor.
    


Trump weighs in: US President Donald Trump wrote a sarcastic social media post as the parade got underway, saying: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” A Russian presidential aide responded by saying: “No one has been conspiring.”
    


            A Kremlin pool reporter captured some behind-the-scenes color from the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after attending China's massive military parade Wednesday morning.
    


            In a post on his Telegram channel, pool reporter Alexander Yunashev shared video of what appeared to be Kim's staff cleaning up the room after the two-and-a-half hour meeting between the two leaders.
    


            In a caption accompanying the post, Yunashev speculated that the North Korean staffers were wiping out any traces of Kim's presence in the room, noting that the staffers “took away the glass from which he drank, wiped the upholstery of the chair and those parts of the furniture that the Korean leader touched.”
    


            After the meeting, Yunashev added, “Putin and Kim left the office very satisfied and went to drink tea in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
    


            Yunashev is a reporter for the pro-Kremlin tabloid Life News; his Telegram bio describes him as a 15-year veteran of the Kremlin pool.
    


            It is not immediately clear why the staff would clean the meeting room, but some genetics experts have suggested that DNA can be used to collect information on the health of world leaders.
    


            Let's take a look back at some of the most striking images from the parade - those featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            The three leaders stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing on Wednesday, in what marked the first time they have been pictured publicly together.
    


            The trio appeared to be in good spirits, and were seen smiling and talking animatedly to each other throughout the day.
    


            The speaker of South Korea's parliament, Woo Won-shik, shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before the two watched a Chinese military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, marking the first known contact between Kim and a South Korean official since June 2019.
    


            In that year, Kim met with then-US president Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in at the Panmunjom, located within the Demilitarized Zone.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The head of the European Parliament's trade committee said Wednesday he has “doubts” about aspects of the EU's trade deal with the Trump administration and predicted the deal could be amended during the legislative approval process. 

“A lot of questions are there, and I guess there will be some amendments,” said committee chairman Bernd Lange, adding that “myself and also some colleagues of mine have doubts about the deal.”

Lange stopped short of outright opposing the agreement struck July 27 between the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on European goods while lowering EU tariffs on U.S. cars and industrial goods to zero; some EU goods including aircraft, cork and generic pharmaceuticals, were exempted from the 15% rates. 

The deal has had a mixed reception in Europe, with business associations saying it imposes high costs that will impede exports to the U.S. Von der Leyen says that it will lower a painful 27.5% tariff on autos and bring stability and predictability for businesses.

Lange however said “there is no security or predictability,” citing a U.S. decision two weeks after the deal was struck to include some 400 different goods containing steel such as pumps and motorcycle under a 50% steel and aluminum tariff instead of the 15% tariff. 

A top EU trade official urged the committee to approve the deal, saying the rate was low enough to keep trade flowing and maintain EU companies access to the U.S. market while avoiding a worse trade conflict. “You need to look at the alternative,” said Sabine Weyand, director general for trade. 




The agreement has been set down only in a 3 1/2 joint statement that left room for further talks on key issues. 

Trump faces questions about whether he exceeded his legal authorities by declaring a national emergency under a 1977 law to impose the broad tariffs. A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a previous lower court ruling that the president lacked the power to exact tariffs of that magnitude without going through Congress or using other legal mechanisms, a decision that Trump said Tuesday will in turn be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump aroused concern Aug. 26 by threatening tariffs in response to EU digital regulation, which EU officials said were not part of the deal. 

“Where will it end - we are just getting more and more demands from Trump,” said deputy Saskia Bricmont, a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance group.

Parliamentary action would be needed to implement the EU side of the tariffs deal. Lange did not say what the amendments might contain. The leader of one group in parliament, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, has come out against the deal but the group has only 136 seats in the 720-seat parliament and cannot stop the deal by itself. Lange is a member of the group.

The European Commission underlined its determination to expand cooperative trade to other partners beyond the US, on Wednesday sending free trade deals with Mexico and the Mercosur trading bloc in Latin America for ratification by member states. 

The Mercosur deal would create what EU officials call the world's largest free trade zone with 700 million people and lower high tariffs on EU farm exports in Latin America. It also would protect some politically sensitive EU farm products, particularly beef, in an attempt to mollify objections from EU farm lobbies in France and Poland. 

A limited amount of Mercosur beef - equal to around 1.5% of the European market - would face a moderate 7.5% tariff, but quantities above that would be hit with prohibitively high rates. There is also 6.3 billion euros in support for farmers in case of unexpected market disruptions.

Watch live as Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, visits the White House to strengthen ties with President Donald Trump and make the case for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in his country.

Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, arrived at the White House on Wednesday, looking to strengthen his relationship with President Donald Trump and make the case that the United States needs to maintain its robust military presence in his country.

The visit to Washington is Nawrocki's first overseas trip since taking office last month. It comes after Trump took the unusual step of involving himself in the elections of longtime ally Poland, endorsing Nawrocki, who was backed by the conservative Law and Justice party.

Other news we're following today:








While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year.

Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. And murders had been reduced by a third, even when including the 14 victims of a Jan. 1 truck attack.

New Orleans City Council Vice President Helena Moreno condemned any notion of sending federal troops to New Orleans.

“This is about scare tactics and politicizing public safety,” said Moreno, the frontrunner in the mayor's race. “Ultimately leading to the misuse of public funds and resources to attempt to score political points. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.”

Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement.

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the strike on a boat carrying drugs from Venezuela shows that the U.S. will not tolerate drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.

He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.”

“And it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said.

Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser's announcement comes as the nation's capital looks to emerge from President Trump's federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Bowser's deal with the city's police officers includes a 13% pay increase as well as other incentives such as cost-of-living increases and an expanded take-home car program. Bowser has sought to add at least 500 officers for years, often publicly struggling with the D.C. Council over the issue. The department currently contains 3,188 sworn officers, with Bowser looking to boost that number up to around 4,000.

Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service.

“We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. “We don't need a presidential emergency.”

Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, along with Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, traveled to Houston to announce the seizure.

Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. After their seizure, the chemicals were brought to the Port of Houston.

The Trump administration has designated eight Latin American crime organizations, including the Sinaloa drug cartel, as “foreign terrorist organizations.” This gave Pirro's office the authority to execute the seizure under the terrorism forfeiture provision.

Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case.

“I'm having a conversation with him very shortly, and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said. He did not clarify if he was talking about Putin or Zelenskyy.

The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be.

Still, he said that the bloodshed in eastern Europe has to end, and expressed confidence that he'll be able to bring the conflict to a close.

“Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. He added, “They not soldiers from my country. This is my country. But I have a power to end things.”

After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans.

“So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

State and local officials, many of whom are top Democrats, have sharply opposed troop presence in Chicago and Baltimore. Landry, though, is a Republican.

The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”

Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans.

“They're bringing us together as a country,” Khanna said, of the stories of accusers, gesturing toward Greene with a smile. “I've never done a press conference with Marjorie before.”

Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment.

Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.

Their meeting Wednesday in Mexico City comes a day after Trump dramatically stepped up his administration's military role in the Caribbean with what he called a deadly strike on a Venezuelan drug cartel.

Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power.

“We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said.

Speaking to reporters before the Rubio meeting, she said what her administration planned to agree to with the United States is a “cooperation program about border security and the application of the law within the framework of our (respective) sovereignties.”

The president pushed back when asked why the U.S. carried out a lethal strike on a Venezuelan drug-carrying vessel on Tuesday instead of interdicting it and capturing the alleged smugglers. 

Trump said the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

The president said that “thousands and thousands of documents” had been released but that the “Democratic hoax” would continue.

“No matter what you do it's going to keep going,” Trump said. He added, “Really, I think it's enough.”

Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. And, while numerous documents have been released as part of the Epstein investigations, the majority contained information that was already public.

Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. One accuser asked Trump to come meet her at the Capitol so she could explain while the issue wasn't a hoax.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.”

Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.”

He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. China held a parade to recognize the 80th anniversary of the war ending.

The U.S. sanctioned a Chinese firm and its representatives on Wednesday, accusing them of involvement in making and selling synthetic opioids to Americans.

The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. 

“Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.”

China-based chemical companies are the primary source of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids entering the United States, regularly through Mexico.

People identifying themselves as Epstein accusers are calling on Trump for his help in making public remaining documents in the case.

Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.”

The political clash over calls for releasing the files has flummoxed House Republican leadership and been a sticking point for the Trump administration.

Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department, but they mostly contain information already publicly known.

The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison.

Lee Gelernt, who argued for the ACLU, said the use of “a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. This ruling will not be the final say on this matter. We are confident in our position, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”

The U.S. leader greeted his Polish counterpart at the South Portico of the White House with a hearty shoulder slap and exchange of big smiles.

The two stood side-by-side as four F-35 fighter jets flew over the White House, followed by another formation of four F-16s.

Trump and Nawrocki then went inside together.

The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. IT WILL END!”

He did not offer any additional comment.

Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Ukrainian officials will “try to connect” with President Trump to hear about new ways to increase pressure on Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.”

“When we speak about pressure, we mean air defense, we mean weapon deals, we mean drone production, and of course, of course, sanctions,” the Ukrainian leader said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

“Such signals we gave (the) president of the United States. He said ‘couple of weeks', and he will answer on this,” Zelenskyy said of Trump. “'Couple of weeks', in my understanding, it's two weeks or maximum three weeks. This Monday, two weeks ended.”

Attorneys for some alleged victims of Epstein and Maxwell also appeared alongside the lawmakers, in support of the discharge petition.

The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly.

Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke.

Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition.

A bipartisan set of House lawmakers has appealed to their colleagues to support a discharge petition that could force a House vote requiring the Department of Justice to release its Epstein files.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage.

“There is something that is rotten in Washington,” Khanna said. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”

The lawmakers spoke a day after the House Oversight Committee publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department on the sex trafficking investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. The files mostly contained information that was already publicly known or available, but the release showed lawmakers' eagerness to act on the issue, quickly reviving a political clash that has flummoxed House Republican leadership and roiled the Trump administration.

Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, another proponent of the petition, along with Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says when Trump called him recently to discuss the novel idea he thought: “That's genius.”

The idea is to give Republicans a chance to make their case to voters, who tend to reject the party in power during midterm cycles. Republicans are struggling to hold onto their majority in Congress.

Besides, the speaker added, Trump “loves a big show.”

They're working with Senate Republican Leader John Thune to make it happen.

“I think that's a done deal now,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a social media post by Trump on Wednesday that said he was conspiring with the leaders of North Korea and China against the United States.

Asked about the post at a news conference in Beijing, the Russian leader told journalists “the President of the United States is not without a sense of humor.”

“Over these four days, during negotiations of all kinds, both in formal and informal settings, no one has ever expressed any negative judgments on the current American administration,” Putin said.

Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a four-day visit. He took part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, held extensive talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with other leaders, and attended a military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also present at the parade. Kim and Putin held talks after the event.

The Russian leader also said everyone with whom he had spoken during his visit to China had “supported our meeting in Anchorage,” and expressed their hope that negotiations would end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

House Republicans emerged from a private meeting with White House officials rebranding Trump's signature bill: The Working Families Tax Cuts Act.

“We're so excited about that,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting.

Polling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.

The gathering comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers calls for the House to take up their bill that would force the Department of Justice to release its investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

It's an unusual grouping of lawmakers, including Republicans Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Democrat Ro Khanna. They're trying to use a rarely-used legislative maneuver to force a vote on their bill against the wishes of House Republican leadership.

“A nation that allows rich and powerful men to traffic and abuse young girls without consequence is a nation that has lost its moral and spiritual core,” Khanna said.

Around the news conference, a large crowd gathered with signs that said, “Believe the survivors,” and “Unlock the Epstein files.”

Attendance was mandatory at the basement session, a sign of Trump's grip on the GOP.

Despite their legislative success in passing Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts bill into law, Republicans held few town hall meetings this summer as they retool their pitch to voters.

The images from China offer a striking, maybe even sinister, message that there could be a new reconfiguration of rising power in Eurasia, an “Axis of Upheaval,” as one U.S. analyst has called it.

But there's also evidence that the events in Beijing are simply more of the self-interested, high-level jockeying that has marked regional power politics for decades:

They're watching high-tech military hardware and marching soldiers fill the streets of Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

Two days earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping huddled together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

The gatherings in China could be read as a defiant message to the United States and its allies. At the very least, they offered yet more evidence of a burgeoning shift away from a U.S.-dominated, Western-led world order, as Trump withdraws America from many of its historic roles and roils economic relationships with tariffs.

“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump posted in a social media message to Xi.

U.S. employers posted 7.2 million job vacancies in July, down from 7.4 million in June, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that layoffs rose slightly, and that the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was almost unchanged from June at 3.2 million.

The U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly due to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve and partly because Trump's trade wars have created uncertainty that is paralyzing managers making hiring decisions. The economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023.

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and their families are rallying in front of the Capitol as they press Congress to force more disclosure in the criminal investigation into the late financier.

A political clash is unfolding in the House over how Congress should proceed in a matter that has rattled both House Republican leadership and the Trump administration. On Wednesday, speakers at the rally often grew emotional as they recounted how they were lured into Epstein's abuse, and they demanded government accountability for the actions of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

“Our demands are clear,” said Sky Roberts, whose late sister Virginia Giuffre was an outspoken survivor. “Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her life. No leniency. No deals. No special treatment.”

Survivors also demanded that the Epstein files be released publicly and that anyone complicit be held accountable.

The special session agenda set by Kehoe also includes proposed changes to Missouri's ballot measure process.

One key change would make it harder for ballot initiatives to succeed. If approved by voters, Missouri's constitution would be amended so that all future ballot measures would need not only a majority of the statewide vote but also a majority of the votes in each congressional district in order to pass.

If such a standard had been in place last year, an abortion-rights amendment to the state constitution would have failed. That measure narrowly passed statewide on the strength of “yes” votes in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas but failed in rural congressional districts.

Missouri lawmakers are meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional map in ways that could improve the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress next year. The session was called by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and should run at least a week.

Missouri is the third state to pursue mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican lawmakers in Texas, prodded by Trump, was the first, approving a new map that increases the Republicans advantage in five more districts.

Democratic-led California fought back, asking voters to approve in November a plan to give Democrats a chance at winning five more seats.

Tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Florida's tuition waiver law was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling one of her signature achievements shows how much politics have shifted.

More than 6,500 students qualified for the waiver in Florida before DeSantis signed the bill revoking it as of July 1. At the University of Florida, a state resident pays about $6,380 in tuition, compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Now some of these students have switched to online programs to finish their degrees, and staying at home to avoid being detained.

Rubio is in Mexico City as President Claudia Sheinbaum was convening a security forum of all 32 Mexican governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor's office and security commanders. “Under no circumstance will we accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is detrimental to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the country,” she said Monday in her State of the Nation address.

Sheinbaum had been talking up a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that would protect Mexican sovereignty while combatting the flow of fentanyl north and weapons south. Sheinbaum sought to lower expectations Tuesday, saying it would be more like a memorandum of understanding to share intelligence.

“It is a relationship of respect and at the same time collaboration,” Sheinbaum said.

Trump suggested otherwise last month, saying: “Mexico does what we tell them to do.” 

All these hot-button issues for the Trump administration and its neighbors will top the secretary of state's agenda this week on his third trip to Latin America since becoming chief U.S. diplomat.

The trip comes as the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, including military deployments and what it said was a lethal strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel.

In talks with leaders in Mexico and Ecuador on Wednesday and Thursday, Rubio will make the case that broader, deeper cooperation with the U.S. is key to improving health, safety and security. But Trump has alienated allies in the region with persistent demands, threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions.

Trump will greet Polish president Karol Nawrocki at 11 a.m. for a bilateral meeting and lunch. No other events are listed on his public schedule.

At President Trump's news conference Tuesday, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked something that surely baffled those who avoided social media over Labor Day: “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” 

Doocy referred to questions about Trump's health that swirled through social media over the weekend. With a 50-minute appearance, Trump certainly put to rest rumors that he was dead or seriously ill. But for the news media, it quickly renewed questions about whether they were being diligent enough in investigating questions over a president's health, a year after they dealt with the same issues with his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president. Pictures showing him with bruises on his hands and apparent swelling in his legs circulated online recently, as did clips of misstatements in public, such as mistakenly referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month as “Kristi.” None of these is evidence of serious illness.

The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. It's a fairly common condition for older adults.

A bitcoin treasury and mining company linked to the Trump family began trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq stock market.

American Bitcoin's listing follows a completed merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The company is backed by President Donald Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

“Our Nasdaq debut marks a historic milestone in bringing bitcoin into the core of U.S. capital markets,” Eric Trump said in a statement. He is a co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin. 

Public companies accumulating bitcoin as a corporate treasury has become a popular trend in crypto as the world's most popular digital asset is priced near an all-time high. The parent company of Trump's Truth Social has also moved to accumulate bitcoin. 

American Bitcoin said it plans to use “self-mining operations and opportunistic bitcoin purchases” to stand out in a growing field.

Wednesday's listing gives investors yet another chance to put money in a Trump-linked crypto project. The Trump family has made a heavy pivot from real estate into crypto in the last year with projects ranging from a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin to the president hawking his own meme coin. 

On Monday, another Trump-family backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial, launched public trading of its tokens. The popularity of such projects has put the value of the Trump family's crypto holdings at several billion dollars, at least on paper.

Democrats have blasted the president for trying to monetize his popularity with crypto investors while also pushing for pro-crypto legislation and regulations. Trump has denied any improper conflicts of interest.

TUOLUMNE COUNTY, Calif. (AP) — A wildfire in California burned thousands of acres Tuesday, damaging homes and prompting evacuations in Chinese Camp, a historic gold-mining town.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Carlie was hoping to spend her senior year savoring her final moments on the palm tree-lined campus of the University of Central Florida. Instead, she sits at home alone, logging on to online courses, afraid to leave her apartment and run the risk of being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

A few months ago, Carlie was studying public relations in Orlando, envisioning one day working for nonprofits that help students like her. Thanks to in-state tuition and private scholarships, Carlie had been living a life she had only dreamed of in Haiti, a country she left behind at 13 years old.

Now, she's one of thousands of Florida students whose education is being delayed or derailed after state lawmakers revoked a 2014 law that let residents who are in the country illegally qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. 

Across the country, tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of an immigration crackdown carried out by President Donald Trump and his allies.

“It feels like all my hard work means nothing. Like, one day I can just lose it,” said Carlie, who spoke on condition of being identified by only her first name because she fears being deported.




When Florida lawmakers passed the tuition waiver law more than a decade ago, it was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling what had been one of her signature achievements is a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have shifted toward Trump's priorities.

According to state data, more than 6,500 students qualified for what's known as the out-of-state tuition waiver during the 2023-2024 school year. That waiver was revoked as of July 1, after DeSantis signed the bill repealing the tuition cuts.

The cost difference is substantial. At the flagship University of Florida, a state resident is estimated to pay about $6,380 in tuition for the 2025-2026 academic year compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident student. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Florida's state colleges and universities don't specifically track the enrollment of students without legal status, but some immigrant advocates say they expect fewer students to attend in-person classes, and many to give up on college altogether.

Diego Dulanto Falcon earned a bachelor's in psychology thanks to the tuition waiver. Now he's pursuing his master's in public health at the University of South Florida. 

In losing access to in-state tuition, Dulanto Falcon said students without legal status are being cut off from a range of opportunities.

“Fully undocumented students, they have absolutely no options,” Dulanto Falcon said. “They either work under the table or they just don't work at all.”

Going to high school in Miami, David stacked his schedule with dual enrollment and Advanced Placement classes. He hoped to attend college and become a radiologist or physical therapist. David, who was born in Honduras, said that now feels impossible for students like him without legal status. While his friends went off to universities like Duke and Florida State, David went to work at McDonald's. 

He spoke on condition of being identified only by his middle name because he fears deportation.

“When you come into this country and your parents make the sacrifice and you're a kid, all they tell you is focus on school,” David said. “I did just that.”

But now, without the tuition waver, he said he can't afford college.

Around the country, programs offering in-state tuition rates to immigrants that once had wide bipartisan support increasingly have come under criticism from Republicans. In legal challenges, the Trump administration has argued the benefits are unconstitutional.

The Justice Department has been suing states to end tuition breaks, starting with Texas in June, followed by Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Meantime, the U.S. Department of Education is investigating colleges that offer scholarships to students without legal status.

Rosie Curts, a high school math teacher in the Dallas Independent School District, worries she won't be able to motivate her students to learn algebra if they feel college is out of reach. A Texas law gave college students without legal residency access to in-state tuition for decades before a federal judge blocked it in June.

“The idea that that can all be snatched away from them in such a cruel fashion is demotivating to the whole educators' mindset,” Curts said in a call with reporters.

In Orlando, Carlie had a private scholarship to attend Central Florida, but it only covered the in-state tuition rate. 

She was able to enroll as an online student at Purdue Global University, but she said some of her credits didn't transfer and she had to change her major, delaying her graduation.

Going to school in-person in Florida was no longer an option after more than a dozen colleges and universities, including UCF, signed agreements with ICE allowing them to carry out immigration enforcement on campus, she said. 

“I chose online school because I simply don't feel safe,” Carlie said.

Living hours away from family in Miami, Carlie worries that if she was detained, it could be days before someone noticed she was missing. It's much safer to stay inside, she said, living on food she gets delivered to her apartment as she tries to finish her education.

“I'm trying to get my life back on track,” Carlie said. “I can't stay home forever.”

Board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, based in Savannah, Georgia, explains why VO2 max and muscle mass are the main indicators of longevity.

There are numerous paths to living a longer, healthier life, mostly through physical activity, diet and other lifestyle factors.

But according to board-certified cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, the key to longevity could come down to two main metrics.

In a video posted to his more than 1 million followers on social media, London broke down how two factors – VO2 max and muscle mass – can help increase health span and lifespan.

WHAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE TO 100 YEARS OLD HAVE IN COMMON, ACCORDING TO SCIENCE

VO2 max is an indicator of how efficiently the body utilizes oxygen with intense exercise, said London, who is based in Savannah, Georgia.

""In other words, the health of your cardiovascular system,"" he said. ""Not surprising that it increases health span and lifespan.""

A post shared by Jeremy London, MD (@drjeremylondon)

In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital, London added that VO2 max is ""statistically"" the No. 1 indicator of longevity. (See the video at the top of this article.)

In comparing individuals with a low VO2 max to those with a higher VO2 max, scientists have identified ""magnitudes of improvement"" in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing longevity.

""Even if you've never exercised, or if you haven't exercised for a long time, you can still get benefits.""

A recent Harvard Medical School publication confirmed that a high VO2 correlates with better physical fitness and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

""If you know your VO2 max, you can use it as a tool to help you exercise more efficiently,"" the Harvard experts wrote.

""If you have a higher VO2 max, that means your heart and lungs are more effectively supplying blood to your muscles, and that your muscles are efficiently extracting and using oxygen from your blood. That's why a high VO2 max is a good indicator of a high fitness level.""

""Muscle is so important for your functional capacity, being able to do the things you want to do in later years,"" the expert said. (iStock)

Muscle mass is the next element that can impact longevity, London noted.

""It's a close second, and plays a significant role in the ability to continue daily life activities as we age,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""The combination of the two is the magic sauce.""

AGING BRAINS COULD ‘BECOME' YOUNGER WHEN KEY PROTEIN IS DECREASED

One reason is that muscle is a ""glucose sink,"" meaning it decreases the risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

When the body is ill, muscle mass can also secrete ""myocines,"" which are anti-inflammatory proteins that can decrease the severity of illnesses.

""Muscle is so important for your functional capacity, being able to do the things you want to do in later years,"" London said. ""The deadlifts you do at 30 enable you to pick up the suitcase at 80.""

Starting a simple walking program can help increase muscle mass, the expert said. (iStock)

Building muscle mass doesn't always require heavyweight training or strenuous exercise. In fact, London said he's sometimes hesitant to use the word ""exercise"" at all.

""Just move,"" he said. ""It could be dancing for some people, it could be swimming, it could be just going for a walk … It may just be body weight or yoga, or Pilates or whatever.""

The key is consistency, he emphasized, and finding a balance between what you need and what you enjoy doing for fitness and movement.

""Just moving,"" even if it's dancing, can help increase muscle mass in older individuals, the expert said. (iStock)

""There's no one answer for everybody, but you just want to put your muscles under stress and strain so they can grow,"" London went on. 

""The deadlifts you do at 30 enable you to pick up the suitcase at 80.""

""And you want to be moving on a regular basis during the week so that you're getting your heart rate up to keep your VO2 max as high as it possibly can be, based on your age.""

A simple walking program or body weight resistance training, he said, is ""free, accessible and always available.""

London added, ""The cool thing is, even if you've never exercised, or if you haven't exercised for a long time, you can still get benefits.""

President Donald Trump announces the National Guard will be deployed to Chicago and touts the success of his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown.

President Donald Trump and his administration have launched a crusade against Illinois lawmakers who've refused offers to send in National Guard troops to Chicago following a violent Labor Day weekend in the city. 

While Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and other state leaders remain adamant that National Guard troops are not welcome in Chicago, the Trump administration has turned up the heat on Pritzker to accept them amid Trump's crime crackdown in Washington. 

""At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed... Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet,"" Trump said in a Tuesday social media post. ""I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, & soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Trump issued another post on social media Tuesday morning, labeling Chicago the ""murder capital."" 

Trump doubled down on his sentiments later in the Oval Office, and said that places like Afghanistan ""don't even come close"" to the crime in Chicago. Additionally, he said he had decided he would send National Guard troops to Chicago, despite Pritzker's opposition. 

""If the governor of Illinois would call me up, I would love to do it,"" Trump told reporters later on Tuesday. ""Now, we're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country."" 

Other members of the administration also weighed in on Chicago's violence over Labor Day weekend. For example, JD Vance shared a post quoting Pritzker claiming that Trump was ""manufacturing a crisis,"" while depicting Chicago Labor Day crime statistics. 

Additionally, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that Democrats would rather let their constituents suffer than accept Trump's offer.

""Local Democrat leaders would rather knowingly put their residents in harms way than let President Trump help,"" Jackson said in a Tuesday post on X. ""These people are sick!""

Pritzker's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. However, Pritzker remained staunch in his opposition to National Guard troops in Chicago following Trump's social media posts. 

""Just a lovely day here,"" Pritzker said in a video posted to social media Tuesday. ""No emergency, so Donald Trump understands, no emergency in the city of Chicago to send troops in.""

Separately, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in an August statement that crime is down in Chicago. He said the city in the past year has reduced homicides by more than 30%, robberies by 35% and shootings by almost 40%.

Even so, the White House has pointed to local reports that Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city for the past 13 years. 

However, 2024 FBI data shows that Chicago does not have the most murders per capita and isn't listed in the top five cities for murder per capita. 

Pritzker previously has called Trump's push to bring National Guard troops to Chicago ""unconstitutional"" and ""un-American.""

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are activated to handle state and federal operations, like natural disasters. State governments typically oversee their respective National Guard forces. However, the federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard. 

In June, Trump deployed California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration riots there — controversially circumventing the authority of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

Newsom, a Democrat, ultimately filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for federalizing the National Guard to respond to those riots. A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that Trump's decision to deploy the troops to Los Angeles violated federal law.

President Donald Trump shared footage of a kinetic U.S. military strike against an Tren de Aragua narco-terrorist vessel carrying drugs from Venezuela on Tuesday.

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration cannot speed the deportations of migrants accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua using an 18th-century wartime law.

In a 2-1 ruling, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not created to be used against gangs like Tren de Aragua.

""The Trump administration's use of a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court,"" Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, said. ""This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.""

The Alien Enemies Act was previously used only three times in U.S. history, and all came during declared wars in the War of 1812 and the two World Wars.

The Trump administration claimed that courts cannot second-guess the president's determination that Tren de Aragua was connected to Venezuela's government and represented a danger to the U.S., which it argued warranted using the law.

The administration deported alleged Tren de Aragua members to a mega-prison in El Salvador where, officials argued, U.S. courts could not order their release.

More than 250 of the deported migrants returned to Venezuela under a deal announced in July.

In a 2-1 ruling, the court granted the preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs because they ""found no invasion or predatory incursion"" in this case.

The court's ruling blocks deportations from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

The majority opinion said Trump's allegations about Tren de Aragua do not meet the historical levels of national conflict that Congress intended for when the law was approved.

""A country encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,"" U.S. Circuit Judges Leslie Southwick and Irma Carrillo Ramirez wrote.

In a dissent, U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew Oldham argued that the majority was second-guessing Trump's conduct in foreign affairs and national security, which are areas where courts often give the president great deference.

""The majority's approach to this case is not only unprecedented—it is contrary to more than 200 years of precedent,"" Oldham wrote.

The Trump administration secured one legal victory in Tuesday's ruling, with the judges finding the procedures officials use to advise detainees under the Alien Enemies Act about their legal rights are appropriate.

The ruling can be appealed to the full Fifth Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to make the ultimate decision in this case.

Former President Donald Trump explains how he settled conflict with North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.

Kim Jong Un set foot in Beijing Tuesday for his first visit to China in years, accompanied by his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, also thought to be his successor, per South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).

The young girl is believed to be around 12 or 13, and her debut appearance outside of her home country signals a possible role as North Korea's heir-in-waiting, a parenting expert suspects. She was first publicly introduced in North Korea in 2022.

Dressed in a smart black suit, Kim Ju Ae followed her father as they were welcomed by Communist Party officials ahead of China's military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.

On Wednesday, she may stand alongside Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping.

A parenting expert warned that bringing Kim Ju Ae onto the global stage at a young age could carry consequences.

""She's being shaped into a role, rather than being supported to figure out who she is as an individual and that pressure could have a huge impact on her mental health,"" Kirsty Ketley told Fox News Digital. 

""Even the most carefully groomed successor, like she could be, would struggle when thrust into leadership and even when later in life.

""It's likely she'll be under constant coaching, but that doesn't remove the emotional weight of having your future decided for you at such a young age.""

North Korea's famous father and daughter left Pyongyang on Monday for the international event, crossing into China by armored train to watch the country's biggest-ever display of military power.

The event will last 70 minutes and include soldiers, tanks, anti-drone systems and aircraft passing through Tiananmen Square as President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin look on.

So far, Kim Ju Ae has been seen at a missile launch in November 2022 and other public events in North Korea in June.

NIS has claimed Kim Ju Ae enjoys skiing, horse riding, and swimming, and is privately homeschooled in Pyongyang, per The Associated Press. She is also said to appear on postage stamps in North Korea.

Ketley said Kim's daughter should be looking ahead to high school and testing boundaries in relatively safe environments.

""Kim Ju Ae doesn't get those usual luxuries because her playground is now military parades and meetings with world leaders,"" Ketley warned.

""While she may be carefully shielded and trained, internally she could well be experiencing anxiety, confusion, or even loneliness. Intense public pressure can stunt children's emotional growth.""

Despite Tuesday's global introduction, the public is not aware of Kim Ju Ae's exact age. It's thought she is the second of Kim Jong Un's and his wife, Ri Sol-Ju's, three kids because rhe dictator remains secretive about his family.

Retired NBA star Dennis Rodman inadvertently revealed the girl's existence over a decade ago in an interview with The Guardian.

During a 2013 trip to Pyongyang, Rodman told reporters he had ""held the baby Ju Ae,"" calling Kim Jong Un a ""good dad.""

""If I were advising Kim Jong Un, I'd urge him to balance his daughter's exposure to power with opportunities for normality, including friendships, play and chances to fail, which are the building blocks of resilience,"" said Ketley.

Panelists Katie Zacharia and Roxanne Hoge discuss how the Democrats are struggling to find a central leader for their party on ‘Fox News @ Night.'

For decades, Democrats have clung to James Carville's mantra: ""It's the economy, stupid."" It became the default excuse for every campaign message, every strategy and every setback.  

We need to retire that phrase from our political lexicon. 

My fellow Democrats forget that Carville's first rule on his whiteboard in Little Rock wasn't the economy, stupid. It was ""Change vs. more of the same."" Voters still want change — not numbers, not excuses. And if President Donald Trump offers change while Democrats defend the system as it is, Democrats will lose. 

JAMES CARVILLE WARNS DEMOCRATS NOT TO GET BAITED INTO DISCUSSING WOKE ISSUES: 'YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK SILLY'

Today, my party is jumping onto a shiny substitute considered to be the winning message that unites all — ""affordability"" — as if the idea that lower prices are better than higher ones is a revelation. Has a candidate ever campaigned on the reverse? 

Democratic strategist James Carville is famous for his economic advice, but that no longer applies if the party wants to win. (PBS)

During the Biden administration, consumer costs inflated on our watch, but now we are asking midterm voters to give us the keys back to the car anyway.  

When is my party going to learn that politics is about culture and connection, not charts and spreadsheets? It's about being relevant to the lives of ordinary people, not proving to them that we are right. 

DEMOCRATS ARE STILL LOST BUT ONE YEAR AFTER BIDEN'S EXIT, THEY'RE STARTING TO FOLLOW A RIVAL'S ROADMAP

Voters aren't sitting in some academic economics lecture. They don't care about GDP growth, labor-force participation rates, or the Bureau of Labor Statistics when they feel prices are too high. They don't want to hear that homicides, robberies and carjackings have decreased according to the latest stats, when they feel unsafe. Sending in the National Guard won't be a solution to ending crime in our inner cities, but it does make communities feel protected.  

Are Democrats so disconnected from reality that we've unlearned the most basic political principle of all, that perception and politics go hand-in-glove?  

Voters are not looking to be informed by candidates, especially when they sound like human calculators, vomiting out numbers. Being informed isn't the same as feeling informed and telling voters that how they feel isn't real, because numbers say otherwise, isn't a winning message. Shaming Trump voters for their choice last year or lecturing them that this isn't what they voted for, offends them rather than persuades them. Patronizing voters is not a strategy. 

What voters in this midterm election want is some cultural common sense, and to borrow a bullet from the Democratic talking points, Democrats have not been meeting voters where they are — yet.  

CARVILLE PANS DEMOCRATS FOR CONTINUING TO ALIENATE MEN WITH 'FUTURE IS FEMALE' TALK

Voters want to hear us acknowledge that crime is bad and say we need more cops on the street, but not necessarily troops. They want our candidates to give a straight answer and plainly state that boys shouldn't compete in girls' sports as a matter of fairness. It's okay for Democrats to say they believe in merit-based hiring instead of DEI and box-checking quotas.  

Most Americans feel this way — and Democrats lose credibility when they dodge these conversations or give evasive answers.  

President Biden stumbles while boarding Air Force One in Montgomery, Alabama on Sunday, March 5, 2023. (Fox News)

Democrats avoid going where the news and conversations are happening. Our leaders and candidates too often duck and cover. When issues turn culturally sensitive, they play hide and seek. We need to run straight into the culture war fires, not away from them. Those are the conversations voters are having and we need to join them.  

My old boss, President Joe Biden, learned this lesson the hard way. Biden's presidency illustrates this danger for Democrats on the ballot everywhere in 2026. At the very moments when Americans were craving leadership — like a national debate over college campus unrest and violent antisemitism — Biden was absent. Scranton Joe, who built his career on a chip-on-the-shoulder authenticity that connected with ordinary people, became the first non-Ivy League president in decades. Yet, he was silent when he could have drawn the sharpest contrast from the elites.

DEMOCRAT-ALIGNED GROUP REPORTEDLY PAID SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS FOR CONTENT

Biden told Americans the economy was the envy of the world, and then his Baghdad Bobs in the White House told us he was as sharp as ever. Polls said Americans felt otherwise, still his instinct was to retreat further.  Voters saw fewer unscripted moments, such as interviews or news conferences, smaller steps off Air Force One and a greater reliance on teleprompters. In a political age where imagery shapes public opinion, Biden looked feeble, distant and disconnected. He followed an outdated media strategy that led him into a political death spiral.

Trump, by contrast, dives headfirst into every news cycle and runs into every cultural fire — from campus protests to celebrity dust-ups like Sydney Sweeney's jeans or Cracker Barrel's new logo. He doesn't hesitate, he doesn't duck, he doesn't wait for the perfect poll-tested phrase. Love him or hate him, voters can't miss that he shows up with an opinion and a position. He doesn't keep them guessing.  

Democrats don't need to copy Trump's style. But they do need his guts. If voters are talking about trans athletes, immigration, DEI or crime — and they stay silent or pivot — then they're absent from the conversations Americans outside the Beltway are having with friends, family and their neighbors. It's these social conversations that are shaping political identity, not stats and charts.

Voters will tune out any type of hell Democrats try to raise about prices, tariffs or cuts to Medicare if they think we don't ""get"" them on culture. 

The way out of the wilderness isn't another slogan about affordability. It's courage and common sense. Stop hiding behind statistics. Start running into the fire. Only then will Democrats earn back voters' trust.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the latest ship launched by China and where America stands in the shipbuilding battle on 'Special Report.'

American workers are front and center in the race to stay ahead of China. There just aren't enough of them. Jobs are going unfilled from advanced semiconductor foundries to the drydocks where the U.S. Navy's combat ships are built. Ships and chips are both in crisis. 

And no, AI by itself isn't the answer.  

""We've spent the last 10 years teaching people how to code. We need to spend the next 10 years teaching people how to use their hands,"" Navy Secretary John Phelan said July 16 in Detroit.  

TARIFF UNCERTAINTY THREATENS $490B IN US MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT, REPORT WARNS

It's shipfitters, blasters, superconducting process integration managers and semiconductor equipment technicians who will ensure the USA beats China. Both ships and chips rely on touch labor — albeit in very sophisticated factories and foundries.  

Shipbuilding is key to the US Navy's future. FILE: The USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) steams in close formation as one of 42 ships and submarines representing 15 international partner nations during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise 2014. (iStock)

President Donald Trump gets it. ""Every policy of the Trump administration is designed to lift up the American worker, promote great-paying, blue-collar jobs and to rebuild the industrial bedrock of our nation,"" he said Aug. 26.  

Not that you'll see just blue collars anymore: look for black T-shirts, plaid flannel, white clean room ""bunny suits"" and engineers in polos. But the essentials are the same. This critical workforce is made up of men and women who've built their technical expertise and thrive on getting the job done, whether with a crane or a lithography machine.  

NEW STUDY REVEALS THREATS TO THE CLASS OF 2025. FIXING THEM SHOULD BE JOB NO. 1 FOR AMERICA

Here's the stunning problem. Although both ships and chips sectors are booming with urgent programs and new opportunities, America as a nation has devalued the trades and is paying the price. The manufacturing sector's workforce decline due to decades of globalism has been so sharp that U.S. national security and economic dominance are at risk.  

Just 3% of the American population today work in manufacturing, versus 9% during the Cold War. COVID-19 hit hard. Texas, Florida and Georgia have added enough manufacturing jobs to surge ahead of their pre-pandemic employment levels, but almost half of U.S. states still have lower manufacturing totals than 2019.  

Unless reversed, the decline in manufacturing labor could hurt America's position. 

NAVY RECRUITMENT 'SKYROCKETS' UNDER TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, OFFICIAL SAYS

You already know America's Navy is smaller than China's. The Navy's own shipyards need to hire 250,000 new workers over the next decade for maintenance, construction and repair. Add in the shipbuilders who are trying to accelerate new submarines, aircraft carriers and destroyers, and workforce shortages threaten maritime dominance over China.

Priority No. 1 is pay. Trump said that wages for blue-collar workers are rising at the fastest rate in 60 years. Wages for welders on nuclear submarines need to be much higher than fast food and delivery trucks. It's not just entry-level jobs. Shipyards must retain experienced shipfitters ready to step up as foremen and boost the talent pool for hundreds of major suppliers. The wider plan is ""the nation as a shipyard"" with a combination of investment and tapping new labor pools to make ship modules in locations where labor abounds.   

The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing fell from 40% in 1990 to 12% in 2020. With a projected 33% growth in semiconductor jobs by 2030, the gap between job openings and qualified candidates will leave 146,000 positions unfilled. More workers are being sought for both commercial semiconductors, and for the advanced composite chips used in defense electronics.  

Here's the stunning problem. Although both ships and chips sectors are booming with urgent programs and new opportunities, America as a nation has devalued the trades and is paying the price. 

These aren't your day-to-day, mass-produced silicon chips; think multi-layered chips powering information systems for satellites, F-16 fighters, radars, Apache helicopters and more. And many are smaller than a grain of sand. Production at one advanced Linthicum, Maryland, foundry alone will quadruple by 2030 — if they can hire.

The good news is that manufacturing is starting a resurgence, according to the St. Louis Fed. Investment in new facilities has doubled since 2022. Private capital targeted at near-term modernization in shipyards can deliver efficiency and sustained profits. The One Big Beautiful Bill expands access to Pell Grants, which can cover on-the-job training programs. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer sees job creators across America as ""back at the center of our economic agenda"" at locations from an aerospace composites manufacturer in Utah to a microelectronics fab in Idaho.  

Trump likes to call out ""the incredible hardworking men and women of our country."" Don't forget, they are on the front lines of the race with China. American prosperity — and security — depend on America's workers.

President Donald Trump is escalating his tough-on-crime campaign against Democrats, particularly those considering 2028 presidential bids, ahead of an expected illegal immigration crackdown in Chicago on Friday.

Trump's pressure campaign comes as his federalization of the California National Guard this summer was deemed illegal by a federal court judge on Tuesday.

Trump increased his criticism of Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson last weekend for their inability to decrease crime, as Pritzker complained about the lack of communication between his office and the federal government amid reports of the prospective illegal immigration raids and Johnson signing an executive order directing the Chicago Police Department not to help its federal counterparts.

“At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed,” Trump wrote on social media Tuesday morning. “The last two weekends were similar. Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far. Pritzker needs help badly; he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Two days earlier, Pritzker told CBS he would be open to support from federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, but not from the National Guard, describing that as “an invasion.”

“I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities,” he said on Sunday. “That's un-American, and frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.”

During his first public appearance in days, Trump on Tuesday confirmed plans to surge federal law enforcement to Chicago but downplayed when.

“Chicago is a hellhole right now. Baltimore is a hellhole right now,” he told reporters after announcing he was moving the headquarters of U.S. Space Force to Alabama.

To that end, Trump has implored Pritzker to welcome the National Guard, in part because of legal restraints underscored by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's decision on Tuesday finding that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law, the Posse Comitatus Act, by federalizing the California National Guard and deploying U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in June to respond to anti-illegal immigration raid protests. 

The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits presidents from using the military for domestic law enforcement, with Trump aides emphasizing that any federal law enforcement operations in Chicago would be immigration-centric.

When asked for the White House's response, spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Examiner that  “once again, a rogue judge is trying to usurp the authority of the commander in chief to protect American cities from violence and destruction.” 

“President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in,” Kelly said. “While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the president is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.” 

Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump's appeals based on high crime rates in Democratic-led cities. FBI data demonstrates that 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates and at least 100,000 residents in 2024 had Democratic mayors.

“The perception in America is that these cities are lost, and that the mayors, and the city council, and the leadership in these cities lack the will to do what's necessary to fix them,” said Brian Seitchick, a national Republican strategist. 

Trump's focus on crime is similar to his crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border when he first came into office, according to Matt Dole, a GOP strategist in Ohio. 

“He did not come in and say: here's the 10-year road map to fix illegal immigration. He came in, he said: Start arresting and deporting people today, and take whatever resources you need to do it,” Dole said. “But I think that's what we're seeing in D.C. There is a path to making D.C. safer, and that same path can be used in other cities where crime is a problem, from Chicago to Los Angeles to New York, to Austin, Texas, wherever it is.” 

Simultaneously, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) has distinguished herself by deploying the New Mexico Guard in Albuquerque and Española in April to counter crime emergencies, including regarding fentanyl and juvenile offenses, by providing non-law enforcement assistance. Regardless, she has criticized Trump's federalization of the National Guard in California and Washington, D.C. by arguing her troops are unarmed, dressed in plain clothes, and do not undertake police-like responsibilities, such as riot control. 

Trump's tough-on-crime campaign started last month after former Department of Government Efficiency engineer Big Balls was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Dupont Circle, a wealthy Washington neighborhood. The following week, Trump relied on the Home Rule Act to declare a 30-day public safety emergency in Washington last month, permitting him to federalize the Washington National Guard and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.

That 30-day public safety emergency is poised to expire next week, and Trump has previewed the prospect of extending it, though that would require congressional approval, which he is unlikely to obtain because it will need 60 votes in the Senate. The president has also indicated his willingness to extend the emergency without Congress.

The White House on Tuesday promoted how federalized law enforcement in Washington has so far resulted in 1,669 arrests, including 16 accused members of gangs such as MS-13 and TDA. The White House added that five missing children had been found and 50 homeless encampments had been removed, with as many as 3,200 federal employees deployed across 22 agencies.

“President Trump's efforts to crack down on crime in DC have yielded tremendous results in such a short time – violent crime has plummeted and dangerous criminals are being removed from the streets every single night,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. “The Trump administration is grateful to continue partnering with [Washington] Mayor [Muriel] Bowser to make D.C. the safest city in the country. The mayor's fellow Democrats should take note, working with President Trump means safer communities and less crime – no one in their right mind could seriously oppose that.” 

In a weekend pitch to Democratic governors concerning the National Guard, Trump cited Bowser's approval ratings, asserting they have improved because she endorsed his federalization of Washington's law enforcement. Bowser, however, has been scrutinized for not being more adversarial with Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll published last week found that 56% of registered voters opposed Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington. 

“The left's opposition to these efforts are driven purely by Trump Derangement Syndrome, because anyone who cared about the safety of American communities would look at the outstanding results in DC and want to replicate it nationwide,” a third White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, told the Washington Examiner. 

Trump signaled last month that Chicago, another city led by a Democratic mayor, would be the next federal target after the success in Washington.

TRUMP'S HIGH-PROFILE FIRINGS SHOW DISSENT IN 2.0 CAN BE A ‘ONE-WAY TICKET TO EXILE'

“When we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C. Chicago is very dangerous,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.

But he has not ruled out taking his crackdown on crime to other blue cities, including Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco, and New York City, following through on his yearslong attacks on urban enclaves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","California Democrats race to pass bills to stop Trump agenda before session ends","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3790333/california-democrats-race-pass-bills-stop-trump-agenda/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

California lawmakers are racing to push through dozens of new bills over the next two weeks aimed at stopping President Donald Trump's agenda, including efforts he has made to restrict abortion access, limit LGBT rights, and carry out mass deportations. 

Most of the measures have already cleared legislative hurdles but lack the final votes needed and Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) signature to become law. Democrats have the supermajority in the state legislature, meaning they will have little to no pushback on key bills. Their only problem now is getting as many through the state Assembly and state Senate as possible before Sept. 12. 

One bill that Democratic lawmakers are eager to get over the finish line would allow pharmacists to dispense abortion drugs without the names and addresses of the patient, pharmacy, or doctor on the label. The bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D-CA), is in direct response to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication. 

“[Assembly Bill] 260 is about ensuring Californians have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from political agendas,” Majority Leader Aguiar-Curry said. “It safeguards providers, strengthens access through telehealth, and ensures Mifepristone—a safe, [Food and Drug Administration]-approved medication for over 20 years—remains legal and available throughout California, especially for those in rural and underserved areas.”

Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have enacted strict abortion bans. California has done the opposite.

“AB 260 positions California as a bulwark against these changes, ensuring state-level protections remain intact amid federal uncertainty,” Aguiar-Curry said, adding that the bill would also shield abortion medication providers from civil penalties, criminal prosecution, and professional discipline. 

Newsom called Kennedy's plan to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication “another attack on women's reproductive freedom and scientifically-reviewed health care.”

“California will continue to protect every person's right to make their own medical decisions and help ensure that Mifepristone is available to those who need it,” Newsom said in a statement.

AB54 builds on AB260 by protecting healthcare providers from criminal prosecution by other states for prescribing or dispensing abortion drugs, including through the mail. AB54, called the Access to Safe Abortion Care Act, would reaffirm that it is lawful to mail, ship, take, receive, or otherwise transport any drug, medicine, or instrument that can be designed or adapted to produce an abortion that is lawful in California. 

California Democrats are also taking aim at Trump's immigration policies and his plan to carry out mass deportations.

Trump and Newsom have gone head-to-head over the president's decision to send in federalized soldiers and Marines to fight crime in California over the objections of state and local leaders. Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled Trump had broken federal law when he turned nearly 5,000 soldiers into a national police force. 

Many of the bills making their way through the legislature are seeking to counter Trump's crackdown on immigration and would limit federal officers' movements and anonymity in the state. 

Senate Bill 627, for example, would prohibit law enforcement agents from covering their faces to obscure their identity, carving out exceptions for SWAT teams and undercover officers. Another bill, SB805, would require officers to display their IDs with their name and badge numbers and limit the instances in which bounty hunters can get involved with immigration enforcement. 

“In a normal world, this legislation would be unnecessary and unheard of,” state Sen. Sasha Renée Péres (D-CA), the bill's author, said in a statement. “With the rise in impersonation claims and the ensuing fear and confusion being created, there is a clear need for strong, more consistent standards for law enforcement identification. This legislation is not just raising the issue; it aims to directly address it by reaffirming the state's role under its policing powers.” 

Other bills, such as AB1303, SB635, and SB81, would shield the public's information from being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Others, such as SB580 and SB294, would provide guidance to local agencies on protecting sensitive data and database management and, separately, would require employers to notify their workers of their rights related to immigration raids. 

JUDGE RULES TRUMP DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TO LOS ANGELES VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW

There is also a heavy emphasis in the state legislature to protect schools from handing over information to federal immigration authorities unless they have a court order or warrant. Other bills require schools to inform parents that their children are entitled to free public education regardless of immigration status and that the schools must notify them when immigration officers are on site. 

While Republicans in the state legislature have sponsored a number of bills, most of their recent efforts were funneled into unsuccessfully stopping their Democratic counterparts from passing two bills that would redraw the congressional district maps and another that would give the governor the ability to call a Nov. 4 special election.

A federal appeals court decided on Tuesday to reinstate Biden-appointed Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, months after President Donald Trump fired her.

In a 2-1 majority decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a federal judge's ruling that determined it was illegal to fire Slaughter.

“The government is not likely to succeed on appeal because any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved Supreme Court precedent,” the court wrote in the 29-page order. “Bucking such precedent is not within this court's job description.

The order cited federal law stating FTC commissioners can only be removed “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, another Biden appointee on the commission, in March without giving an explanation. However, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson maintained at the time that Trump “had the authority” to fire them. Bedoya formally resigned from the FTC in June, but Slaughter is expected to return to work this week following the appeals court's order.

“Amid the efforts by the Trump administration to illegally abolish independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve, I'm heartened the court has recognized that he is not above the law,” she said.

“I'm very eager to get back first thing tomorrow to the work I was entrusted to do on behalf of the American people,” she added.

The Trump administration will likely appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

TRUMP FACES CONTINUED LEGAL FIGHTS OVER FIRING INDEPENDENT AGENCY HEADS

In recent months, Trump has been firing multiple members of independent federal agencies, with the terminations then challenged in court. The latest officials to have been ousted in high-profile shake-ups include former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, and Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Cook filed a lawsuit last week challenging her “illegal” termination, a possibility that Monarez and McEntarfer may also consider. Slaughter and Bedoya previously sued Trump for the same reason.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson blamed the city's crime problem on “red states” on Tuesday, claiming it was their supposedly loose gun laws that were contributing to violence. 

“Chicago will continue to have a ‘violence problem' as long as Red states continue to have a gun problem,” Johnson posted on X on Tuesday evening. “The endless flow of illegal guns into Chicago can be traced to Red states like Mississippi, Indiana, and Louisiana. It is up to the federal government to step up and stop interstate gun trafficking networks.”

Johnson has rejected the Trump administration's offer to deploy the National Guard to his city to help with Chicago‘s crime problem. He has criticized such overtures, likening them to an authoritarian takeover.

He requested the federal government's assistance, but not for additional law enforcement officers or the National Guard.

CRIME IN US CITIES AS TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND CRACKDOWN: LATEST COVERAGE

“We need the federal government to stop the endless flow of guns into our state and into our city,” Johnson said. “Chicago police officers have taken more than 24,000 guns, illegal guns, off the streets of Chicago since I've taken office.

“They have worked hard every single day to make our city safer, and they've made historic progress,” he said. “However, we will never be able to end gun violence in Chicago as long as the president continues to allow tens of thousands of guns to be trafficked into our state and our city. The vast majority of guns do not come from Chicago. They are not made in Cook County. They are not bought in the state of Illinois.

“These guns come from red states,” Johnson said. “They are coming from Indiana. They are coming from Mississippi. They are coming from Louisiana. And that is the harsh reality, whether Republicans like it or not.”

PRITZKER SAYS NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS STAGING FOR DEPLOYMENT TO CHICAGO

Chicago is the third-largest city in the United States and is regularly listed among the cities with the most homicides each year. Johnson has been mayor since May 15, 2023. Over the last two years, Chicago has had more homicides than any other city in the nation, with 617 in 2023 and 573 in 2024, Johnson's first full year in office. Last year was the first time Chicago had fewer than 600 reported homicides since 2019, according to reports.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) faces mounting criticism and intensifying 2028 presidential speculation after being photographed shirtless aboard Hollywood megastar George Clooney's luxury yacht on Italy's Lake Como over Labor Day weekend.

The Daily Mail published images on Monday showing Moore lounging on the rear deck of Clooney's yacht, alongside his wife, Maryland first lady Dawn Moore. The pair appeared relaxed as they soaked up the sun near Clooney's villa in Laglio, where they are reportedly staying.

While Clooney was not seen on the yacht at the time, the sighting has sparked political controversy in the United States, where critics say Moore's high-profile foreign vacation is tone-deaf amid rising crime in Maryland, particularly in Baltimore.

In a statement to local news outlets, Moore's senior adviser and communications director, David Turner, said: “The Governor paid for a trip to celebrate his wife's 50th birthday.”

The statement confirmed the Moores were staying at Clooney's Italian estate and were accompanied by Maryland State Police officers, who provide security on all official and personal trips.

A White House spokeswoman slammed the trip in a pointed statement to Spotlight on Maryland, saying: “While Maryland residents try to escape dangerous criminals in their communities, Gov. Wes Moore is attempting to escape accountability for the out-of-control crime in his state by fleeing to Italy for a luxury getaway with Democrat elites.”

“Gov. Moore needs to get his priorities straight — instead of taking yacht vacations or fantasizing about his 2028 presidential bid, he needs to make Maryland safe again,” the statement continued.

The release of the vacation photos sparked immediate outrage on social media, with critics slamming Moore for indulging in a luxury getaway while Maryland, and particularly Baltimore, grapples with rampant crime and economic struggles.

One viral post read: “HANGING OUT WITH GEORGE ON VACAY: @GovWesMoore traded Annapolis for Lake Como, sipping wine with Clooney while his tax and fee hikes crush Marylanders. Who needs being governor when you've got George!”

Maryland Delegate Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) also weighed in on X: “‘The Other Wes Moore' — While Baltimoreans are terrified to leave their homes due to unsafe streets, @GovWesMoore is living the high life on Lake Como, Italy with George Clooney.”

Another user posted: “Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and his wife are seeking refuge in the comforts of a Hollywood actor's famous Lake Como villa. Catching rays on George Clooney's yacht…while Baltimore is a hell hole riddled with crime.”

The backlash comes as Moore continues a very public feud with President Donald Trump over crime in Baltimore. Just last month, Trump criticized Moore for inviting him to “walk the streets of Maryland,” calling it a “provocative” move and labeling Baltimore “crime-ridden.”

Over the past few months, Trump has repeatedly threatened to send the National Guard into Baltimore, calling the city “out of control” and accusing Moore of ignoring public safety concerns.

In a July post on Truth Social, Trump blasted the governor, saying: “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland' with him. I assume he is talking about out-of-control, crime-ridden Baltimore?”

Trump's comments came after Moore publicly rejected the idea of federal intervention, calling the president's rhetoric divisive and counterproductive. Moore has argued that local leaders, not Washington, should be trusted to fix Baltimore's deep-rooted issues.

“The idea that the solution to Baltimore's challenges is military occupation is as offensive as it is unserious,” Moore said during a press conference in August. “We need investment, not intimidation.”

Clooney, a prominent Democratic megadonor, has been vocal in his praise of Moore as a rising political star. In an interview with CNN earlier this year, the Oscar-winning actor said Moore was “levitating above” other potential Democratic presidential contenders and called him a “proper leader.”

The Hollywood icon's political influence is well established — and recent. In 2024, Clooney made national headlines when he penned a bombshell New York Times op-ed calling President Joe Biden to step aside from the presidential race. The public plea sent shockwaves through the Democratic establishment and was widely credited with pressuring Biden to withdraw from his reelection campaign.

Clooney's intervention helped pave the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic front-runner, a shift that dramatically reshaped the party's strategy just months before the Democratic National Convention.

A growing constituency on the right wants America to unlearn the lessons of World War II.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

“The story we got about World War II is all wrong,” a guest told Tucker Carlson on his podcast two weeks ago. “I think that's right,” replied Carlson. The guest, a Cornell chemistry professor named David Collum, then spelled out what he meant: “One can make the argument we should have sided with Hitler and fought Stalin.” Such sentiments might sound shocking to the uninitiated, but they are not to Carlson's audience. In fact, the notion that the German dictator was unfairly maligned has become a running theme on Carlson's show—and beyond.

Last September, Carlson interviewed a man named Darryl Cooper, whom he dubbed “the most important popular historian working in the United States today.” Cooper's conception of honest history soon became clear: He suggested that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill might have been “the chief villain of the Second World War,” with Nazi Germany at best coming in second. The day after the episode aired, Cooper further downplayed Hitler's genocidal ambitions, writing on social media that the German leader had sought peace with Europe and merely wanted “to reach an acceptable solution to the Jewish problem.” He did not explain why the Jews should have been considered a “problem” in the first place.

“What is it about Hitler? Why is he the most evil?” the far-right podcaster Candace Owens asked in July 2024. “The first thing people would say is: ‘Well, an ethnic cleansing almost took place.' And now I offer back: ‘You mean like we actually did to the Germans.'” A repeat guest on Carlson's show, Owens defended him after his conversation with Cooper. “Many Americans are learning that WW2 history is not as black and white as we were taught and some details were purposefully omitted from our textbooks,” she wrote on X.

These Reich rehabilitators are not fringe figures. Carlson's show ranks among the top podcasts in America. He spoke before President Donald Trump on the final night of the 2024 Republican National Convention, and his son serves as a deputy press secretary to Vice President J. D. Vance, who owes his office in part to Carlson's advocacy. Owens has millions of followers on YouTube, Instagram, and X, and over the past six months, she has been interviewed by some of the nation's most popular podcasters, including the comedian Theo Von and the ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith. Her output has attained sufficient notoriety that she is currently being sued by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, over her repeated claims that the French first lady was actually born a man. Cooper, the would-be World War II revisionist, publishes the top-selling history newsletter on the entire Substack platform.

Yair Rosenberg: The anti-Semitic revolution on the American right

Why does a potent portion of the American right seek to rehabilitate Hitler? The Nazi apologetics are partly an attention-seeking attempt at provocation—an effort to signal iconoclasm by transgressing one of society's few remaining taboos. But there is more to the story than that. Carlson and his fellow travelers on the far right correctly identify the Second World War as a pivot point in America's understanding of itself and its attitude toward its Jewish citizens. The country learned hard lessons from the Nazi Holocaust about the catastrophic consequences of conspiratorial prejudice. Today, a growing constituency on the right wants the nation to unlearn them.



Before World War II, the United States was a far more anti-Semitic place than it is now. Far from joining the conflict to rescue Europe's Jews, the country was largely unsympathetic to their plight. In 1938, on the eve of the Holocaust, Gallup found that 54 percent of Americans believed that “the persecution of Jews in Europe has been partly their own fault,” and that another 11 percent thought it was “entirely” their fault. In other words, as the Nazis prepared to exterminate the Jews, most Americans blamed the victims.

The same week that the Kristallnacht pogrom left thousands of synagogues and Jewish businesses in ruins, 72 percent of Americans opposed allowing “a larger number of Jewish exiles from Germany to come to the United States to live.” Months later, 67 percent opposed a bill aimed at accepting child refugees from Germany; the idea never made it to a congressional vote. Many Americans worried, however illogically, that fleeing Jews might be German spies, a vanishingly rare occurrence. Those with suspicions included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suggested in 1940 that some refugees could be engaged in espionage under compulsion from the Nazis, “especially Jewish refugees.”

This climate of paranoia and hostility had deadly consequences. In 1939, the U.S. and Canada turned away the M.S. St. Louis, which carried nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where hundreds of the passengers were captured and killed by the Germans. Restrained by public sentiment, Roosevelt not only kept the country's refugee caps largely in place but also rejected pleas to bomb the Auschwitz concentration camp and the railway tracks that led to it. When the United States finally entered the war, it did so not out of any special sense of obligation to the Jews but to defend itself after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

That indifference to the Holocaust was immediately dispelled when the Allied Forces liberated several of the Nazi camps where millions of Jews had been murdered. Entering the gates of these sadistic sites, American service members came face-to-face with unspeakable Nazi atrocities—rotting piles of naked corpses, gas chambers, thousands of emaciated adults. Denial gave way to revulsion. “I thought of some of the stories I previously had read about Dachau and was glad of the chance to see for myself just to prove once and for all that what I had heard was propaganda,” Sergeant Horace Evers wrote to his family in May 1945. “But no it wasn't propaganda at all … If anything some of the truth had been held back.”

Timothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days

Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and future U.S. president, personally went to Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald and the first Nazi camp liberated by American troops. “I made the visit deliberately,” he cabled to Washington, “in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.'” Eisenhower then requested that members of Congress and prominent journalists be brought to the camps to see and document the horrors themselves. “I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald,” the legendary CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow told his listeners after touring the camp. “I reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it, I have no words.”

Two-thirds of Europe's Jews had been murdered. American soldiers, drafted from across the United States, returned home bearing witness to what they had encountered. “Anti-Semitism was right there, it had been carried to the ultimate, and I knew that that was something we had to get rid of because I had experienced it,” Sergeant Leon Bass, a Black veteran whose segregated unit entered Buchenwald, later testified. In this way, the American people learned firsthand where rampant anti-Jewish prejudice led—and the country was transformed.

Americans began to understand themselves as the ones who'd defeated the Nazis and saved the Jews. Slowly but surely, anti-Semitism became un-American. But today, those lessons—like the people who learned them—are passing away, and a wave of propagandists with a very different agenda has arisen to fill the void they left behind.



Over the past few years, Tucker Carlson and his co-ideologues have begun insinuating anti-Semitic ideas into the public discourse. The former Fox News host has described Ben Shapiro, perhaps the most prominent American Jewish conservative, and those like him as foreign subversives who “don't care about the country at all.” He has also promoted a lightly sanitized version of the white-supremacist “Great Replacement” theory that has inspired multiple anti-Semitic massacres on American soil. Candace Owens has accused Israel of involvement in the 9/11 attacks and the JFK assassination, and claimed that a Jewish pedophile cult controls the world. (Like many pushing such slanders, she has apparently discerned that replacing Jews with Israel or Zionists grants age-old conspiracy theories new legitimacy.) In March, an influencer named Ian Carroll—who has a combined 3.8 million social-media followers, and whose work has been shared by Elon Musk—joined Joe Rogan, arguably the most popular podcaster in America, to expound without challenge about how a “giant group of Jewish billionaires is running a sex-trafficking operation targeting American politicians and business people.”

Before America entered World War II, reactionaries such as the famed aviator Charles Lindbergh and the Catholic radio firebrand Father Charles Coughlin inveighed against the country's tiny Jewish population, accusing it of controlling America's institutions and dragging the U.S. to war. “Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government,” Lindbergh declared of American Jews in 1941. “Why is there persecution in Germany today?” asked Coughlin after Kristallnacht. “Jewish persecution only followed after Christians first were persecuted.” For these men and their millions of supporters, behind every perceived social and political problem lay a sinister Jewish culprit.

The 21st-century heirs of Lindbergh and Coughlin seek to turn back the clock to a time when such sentiments were seen by many as sensible rather than scandalous. These far-right figures have correctly ascertained that to change what is possible in American politics, they need to change how America talks about itself and its past. “The reason I keep focusing on this is probably the same reason you're doing it,” Carlson told Darryl Cooper, the amateur Holocaust historian. “I think it's central to the society we live in, the myths upon which it's built. I think it's also the cause of the destruction of Western civilization—these lies.”

Carlson couches his claims in layers of intellectual abstraction. Others are less coy. “Hitler burned down the trans clinics, arrested the Rothschild bankers, and gave free homes to families,” the former mixed martial artist Jake Shields told his 870,000 followers on X last week. “Does this sound like the most evil man who ever lived?” The post received 44,000 likes. (Shields has also denied that “a single Jew died in gas chambers.”) “Hitler was right about y'all,” said Myron Gaines, a manosphere podcaster with some 2 million followers across platforms, referring to Jews last year. “You guys come into a country, you push your pornography, you push your fuckin' central banking, you push your degeneracy, you push the LGBT community, you push all this fuckin' bullshit into a society, you destroy it from within.” These influencers are less respectable than Carlson, but their views are precisely the ones that more presentable propagandists like him are effectively working to mainstream. After Carlson's guest last month suggested that the U.S. “should have sided with Hitler,” Shields reposted the clip.

Had Carlson and his cohort attempted their revisionism 20 years ago, they would have encountered a chorus of contradiction from real people who had experienced the history they sought to rewrite and know where its conspiratorial calumnies lead. But today, most of those people are dead, and a new generation is rising that never witnessed the Holocaust firsthand or heard about it from family and friends who did.

Late last year, David Shor, one of the Democratic Party's top data scientists, surveyed some 130,000 voters about whether they had a “favorable” or “unfavorable” opinion of Jewish people. Hardly anyone over the age of 70 said their view was unfavorable. More than a quarter of those under 25 did. The question is not whether America's self-understanding is changing; it's how far that change will go—and what the consequences will be.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A common narrative has it that commitment and motherhood make women unhappy. New data suggest the opposite is true.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When I was deciding whether to have children, in the early 2000s, most of what I read about the prospect was negative. Articles detailed the sleep deprivation, the physical challenges of pregnancy, the sheer overwhelmingness of motherhood. If you want to be happy, these writers warned, don't have children. You might not want to get married, either—after all, marriage, research suggested, mostly benefits men.

Friends and family had few positive things to say, especially about parenting. When I asked parents I knew about the disadvantages of having children, I got an earful about tantrums, child-care difficulties, and the lack of time to yourself. “You don't sleep for 18 years,” one cousin confided. When I would ask about advantages, there was usually a long, awkward pause. “It makes you less selfish,” one aunt offered—not a convincing argument for a fiercely independent, career-minded woman such as myself.

These same sentiments are prevalent in today's online conversations and news reports. “Women Are Happier Without Children or a Spouse, Says Happiness Expert,” one headline reads. Another reveals “Why So Many Single Women Without Children Are Happy.” People post in discussion forums, asking, “Why do you think that single unmarried women without children are happier than married women with children?”

But are married mothers actually less happy than single women without children? That's one of the questions that, along with my colleagues Jenet Erickson, Wendy Wang, and Brad Wilcox, I set out to answer by conducting a nationally representative survey of 3,000 American women ages 25 to 55, fielded by YouGov in March 2025.

Read: Enough with the mom guilt already

What we found contradicts the negative messages that I had come across: Married mothers are actually happier than unmarried women and married women without children. In the survey, 19 percent of married mothers described themselves as “very happy,” compared with 11 percent of married women without children, 13 percent of unmarried mothers, and 10 percent of unmarried women without children. Married mothers were also more likely to say that life is enjoyable most or all of the time than the other three groups. These numbers are controlled for age, family income, and education, so we know that those factors aren't the cause of the differences.

These findings are not a one-off. Well-respected sources, such as the General Social Survey, show the same result; married mothers and fathers in that survey were more likely to report being “very happy” than unmarried people and those without children. Another recent study found that married or partnered mothers are less likely to frequently feel depressed or anxious than people in the other three groups.

Could it be not that marriage produces happiness, but that the causation goes the other way—that happier people are more likely to marry? One study controlled for premarital happiness levels and still found that marriage results in happier people and a less intense dip in life satisfaction at middle age.

That's not to say the roles of wife and mother don't have their challenges. Roughly two-thirds of mothers in our survey, for example, said that they felt overwhelmed each day (though so did more than half of nonmothers). About six in 10 mothers said that they wished they had more time to themselves, compared with about four out of 10 childless women.

Why, then, are mothers happier? The reasons speak to the profound experience of parenthood. Married mothers were the most likely to agree that their life “has a clear sense of purpose” (28 percent), followed closely by unmarried mothers (25 percent). Only approximately 15 percent of women without children agreed. Mothers were also more likely than nonmothers to agree that their life “feels meaningful” all or most of the time.

I now have three children, and I am somewhat incredulous that in my premotherhood inquiries, no one mentioned the sense of purpose parenthood gives you. Yes, you're going to be tired and overwhelmed, but there's a deep knowledge that you're doing something important with your life: You're nurturing a human being. These feelings of purpose and meaning are sometimes difficult to put into words—perhaps why they aren't regularly discussed—but they are central to being a parent. I am fortunate to have a career I love and find meaningful; even so, the sense of purpose I have found through motherhood dwarfs every career milestone I have ever achieved.

From the March 2025 issue: Want to change your personality? Have a baby.

The survey results also showed that marriage comes with several advantages. Married women are about half as likely to report being lonely as unmarried women. One factor may be that married women are more likely, they report, to regularly receive physical affection and touch. Touch is, in turn, strongly linked to happiness: 22 percent of women in the survey who experienced a high level of physical touch were very happy, compared with only 7 percent of those who received a low level of touch. Touch, especially from a spouse, is associated with reduced stress, increased trust, and greater feelings of safety.

The false narrative that marriage and motherhood are a recipe for women's unhappiness is doing a lot of damage. In a nationally representative survey that I analyzed for my book Generations, the number of 18-year-old women who expected to have children plummeted by 11 percentage points from the late 2000s to the early 2020s. Negative messaging about marriage and motherhood is likely at the root of these Gen Z shifts, along with a pervasive pessimism about everything, egged on by social media, that borders on doomerism. Young people are also profoundly lonely and spend less time with their peers in person; the consequences for their adult relationships are unknown. Recent trends are even more concerning: AI girlfriends and boyfriends now offer the prospect of “relationships” with an always-available entity that has no needs of its own. Meanwhile, the fertility rate in the U.S. is at an all-time low.

There are many reasons people choose not to have children or not to get married, but false messages about happiness should not be one of them. The articles I read long ago were right that parenting (and marriage) can often be exhausting. But they ignored the sense of meaning that comes from parenthood and the connection of physical touch at the core of family life. After all, an AI boyfriend can't hug you back—to say nothing of an AI child.

Automatic deference to labor unions has not paid off for Democratic politicians.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In its period of exile, the Democratic Party has a lot of decisions to make. One of those decisions concerns its relationship with organized labor. Joe Biden and members of his administration—and, indeed, much of the party's leadership—believed that forming a historically tight partnership with organized labor would help arrest the party's decline with the working class. They turned out to be wrong. Working-class voters, even the small and shrinking share of them who belong to private-sector unions, continued drifting away, seemingly unimpressed by Union Joe's long list of policy concessions.

Having seen their labor strategy collapse, Democrats are weighing two choices. One school of thought, favored on the progressive left, is that if Biden didn't win back working-class voters, it's because he wasn't pro-union enough. For example, a recent newsletter by Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama-administration official turned podcaster, argues that the path to winning back blue-collar voters requires (among other things) that Democrats “become even more pro-union.” Pfeiffer doesn't explain why a more ardent alliance with organized labor would succeed for future Democratic candidates when it failed for Biden, or even how exceeding Biden on this score would be possible. The necessity and utility of the maneuver is simply taken as axiomatic.

A wiser strategy, one that a handful of Democrats have gingerly broached, would be to revert to the party's traditional, pre-Biden stance toward labor. This approach would recognize that the political cost of trying to satisfy the labor movement's every demand is rising, and the number of votes that the movement delivers in return for such fealty is shrinking. The experience of the Biden administration, and of some Democratic-run localities, suggests that automatic deference to unions can undermine what ought to be politicians' top priority right now: lowering the cost of living. Which means it is making the goal of winning back working-class voters harder, not easier.

The Democrats have been the pro-labor party since the New Deal. But, before Biden, their alliance with labor was never unqualified. Democrats broadly supported laws that protected the right to organize, as well as the generous minimum-wage and social-insurance laws that unions favored. However, they made exceptions when they believed that union demands ran contrary to the public interest. Franklin D. Roosevelt himself sometimes intervened against striking unions, and even opposed public-sector unionization on principle. Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had episodic fights with labor even as they usually took its side. Bill Clinton broke with labor to enact the North American Free Trade Agreement. Barack Obama offended teachers' unions by supporting education reform, and defied some industrial unions by capping the tax break on expensive health-insurance plans.

Biden chose a different approach. He vowed to be “the most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history.” In practice, this meant not merely giving unions their customary seat at the table and vigorously enforcing labor law, as previous Democratic administrations had done, but exceeding that support in both symbolic and substantive ways. Biden called himself “a union man,” joined an auto-worker picket line and, with rare exceptions, gave labor nearly absolute deference on any issue in which it held a direct stake. His administration directed $36 billion in federal spending to bail out the Teamsters' pension fund.

Yet even before he abandoned his reelection bid, Biden's standing among working-class voters was dismal. Once Kamala Harris replaced him as the nominee, she failed to garner an endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Longshoremen's Association, or the United Mine Workers of America—or even the Teamsters. Harris won a majority of union households, but according to Pew data, these voters swung toward Donald Trump by six points compared with 2016, in terms of two-party vote share.

Why did the administration's approach to unions fail to reap electoral rewards? One reason is that, as some union leaders have acknowledged, their members have begun basing their votes more on cultural issues, such as guns, immigration, and trans rights, than on economic ones. But there is another factor at play, one much less widely recognized: Uncritical fealty to union demands can cause Democrats to adopt policies that actually threaten working-class voters' material well-being.

Michael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement

Biden's long list of concessions to unions were not free. He kept in place tariffs Trump had imposed during his first term, raised them on Canadian lumber and solar panels from Southeast Asia, and made no effort to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership or any free-trade agreement. He imposed more stringent rules favored by labor on domestic shipping and federal construction projects. None of these measures had a large effect individually. Collectively, they and others like them impeded Biden's goal of reopening the economy and then bringing down the inflation that followed.

The potential for conflict between labor-backed positions and the broader public good can sometimes sit in plain sight, unnoticed by unions or even third-party observers. A recent New York Times story quotes a labor official in Nevada complaining that the Democratic Party alienated union members by failing to focus on affordability. The same article cites the union's complaints that Democratic legislators in the state voted in 2023 to end a requirement for daily hotel-room cleanings.

That requirement, adopted in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was expensive and became obsolete once scientists realized that the virus did not, in fact, spread through surface contact. Amazingly, the union that backed the daily-cleaning measure—and withheld support from Democrats who finally rescinded it three years later—is permitted in the article to pose as a champion of affordability, when it was fighting for a make-work requirement that pushed up hotel costs.

Labor's preferences were easier to align with Democratic policy goals in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment was high, the economy needed more stimulus, and policies that created more jobs were helpful in generating economic growth. (John Maynard Keynes famously argued during the Great Depression that hiring workers to dig holes and fill them again would still stimulate the economy.) But under the current conditions of low unemployment and elevated inflation, make-work policies and excessive government spending are much more harmful.

The rise of the abundance agenda, which focuses on removing barriers to providing Americans with a higher standard of living, especially by increasing the housing supply, has made the tension between these goals a subject of contentious debate on the left. This doesn't make the abundance agenda anti-union. As Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein point out in Abundance, a book that otherwise mostly skirts the labor issue, countries with much higher union density than the United States have managed to build transportation infrastructure far more cheaply. Indeed, the paradigmatic case of abundance-agenda liberalism in action, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's rapid rebuild of a collapsed I-95 bridge, was undertaken cooperatively with unions.

The abundance agenda does, however, create more than occasional friction with union demands. Public-employee unions support strict rules on compensation and firing that make it harder for the government to work as nimbly as the private sector. In California, where the housing shortage is especially dire, unions have used laws that hold up housing construction as leverage to extract concessions from developers. The California high-speed-rail authority, which is closing in on two decades of work without any usable track, continues to boast of the high-paying jobs it has created. This reflects one side of a philosophical divide within the party over whether to treat high labor costs as a core goal of public-infrastructure projects—or as, well, a cost.

The abundance agenda thus implies that Democrats need to return to their pre-Biden relationship with organized labor. This has generated intense backlash. At a high-profile conference in April, the moderate commentator Josh Barro said, “When I look at policies in New York that stand in the way of abundance, very often if you look under the hood, you eventually find a labor union at the end that's the driver.”

This comment, a video clip of which was promptly shared on X, was treated like an act of war by the online left. “Bashing unions and calling for cutting wages and benefits will only lose us even more working class voters and elections,” Greg Casar, a progressive Democratic House member from Texas, posted in response. Left-wing magazines such as Jacobin, The Nation, and Current Affairs seized on Barro's comment as having exposed a barely concealed desire to crush labor.

Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war

The divide revealed by this episode is not about the general merit of unions, or about specific policy questions related to unions, but whether policy specifics need to be taken into account at all. The labor movement and its progressive allies treat support for labor as a binary question. To oppose any discrete union policy is to join the ranks of enemies of labor and therefore the progressive movement itself.

That might sound like an unfairly broad characterization. But the polemics attacking the abundance agenda as anti-labor are notable for their lack of substantive engagement. They treat even the most indefensible union demands as implicitly sacrosanct. One example is a requirement in New York City that subway trains employ two operators. In a column published first in Common Dreams, republished by In These Times, and republished yet again by Jacobin, Dylan Gyauch-Lewis describes opposition to the two-operator rule as prima facie evidence of abundance liberals' “skepticism of labor.” She does not bother to argue, or even assert, that this rule has any public-safety (or other) value.

Running through this line of argument is the idea that unions can do no wrong. Ro Khanna, a progressive representative from California who has praised aspects of the abundance agenda, recently told a meeting of the Teamsters,“The problem is not with the Teamsters. The problem is with the Democratic Party. We can't expect people to vote if we don't stand for working-class issues.”

Recall that the Teamsters declined to endorse Harris in 2024 even after the Biden administration bailed out its pension fund. If that doesn't count as standing up for working people, Biden must be wondering if he can have the $36 billion back to spend on something else.

Campaigning and governing both involve trade-offs. Democrats can and should defend the right to organize and support positions held by unions that don't impose a major drag on the public good. Winning the support of working-class voters requires compromising with their views on social policy, which risks alienating other progressive groups. Making policy decisions sometimes presents a choice between the financial well-being of an interest group, including unions, and the broader public.

The Biden administration tried to inhabit a reality in which none of these choices existed. They could appeal to social liberals and compensate for their shortcomings with the working class by giving the unions a virtual veto over policy. The formula is so seductive that many Democrats still refuse to notice that it doesn't actually work.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The end of critical thinking in the classroom

AI has transformed my experience of education. I am a senior at a public high school in New York, and these tools are everywhere. I do not want to use them in the way I see other kids my age using them—I generally choose not to—but they are inescapable.



During a lesson on the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, I watched a classmate discreetly shift in their seat, prop their laptop up on a crossed leg, and highlight the entirety of the chapter under discussion. In seconds, they had pulled up ChatGPT and dropped the text into the prompt box, which spat out an AI-generated annotation of the chapter. These annotations are used for discussions; we turn them in to our teacher at the end of class, and many of them are graded as part of our class participation. What was meant to be a reflective, thought-provoking discussion on slavery and human resilience was flattened into copy-paste commentary. In Algebra II, after homework worksheets were passed around, I witnessed a peer use their phone to take a quick snapshot, which they then uploaded to ChatGPT. The AI quickly painted my classmate's screen with what it asserted to be a step-by-step solution and relevant graphs.



These incidents were jarring—not just because of the cheating, but because they made me realize how normalized these shortcuts have become. Many homework assignments are due by 11:59 p.m., to be submitted online via Google Classroom. We used to share memes about pounding away at the keyboard at 11:57, anxiously rushing to complete our work on time. These moments were not fun, exactly, but they did draw students together in a shared academic experience. Many of us were propelled by a kind of frantic productivity as we approached midnight, putting the finishing touches on our ideas and work. Now the deadline has been sapped of all meaning. AI has softened the consequences of procrastination and led many students to avoid doing any work at all. As a consequence, these programs have destroyed much of what tied us together as students. There is little intensity anymore. Relatively few students seem to feel that the work is urgent or that they need to sharpen their own mind. We are struggling to receive the lessons of discipline that used to come from having to complete complicated work on a tight deadline, because chatbots promise to complete our tasks in seconds.

Desperate to address AI, schools across the U.S. are investing in detection tools and screen-monitoring software to curb cheating. Some of these tools have been used in my school: Teachers rely on plagiarism checkers and exam-proctoring software. Still, these systems aren't foolproof, and many students have begun to bypass these measures. Students use AI “humanizer” tools, which rephrase text to remove “robotic undertones,” as one such program puts it, or they manually edit the AI's output themselves to simplify language or adjust the chatbot's sentence structure. During in-class exams, screens may be locked or recording technology may be employed, but students have ways around these, too—sneaking phones in, for example. Based on what I've observed, preventative measures can only go so far.



The trouble with chatbots is not just that they allow students to get away with cheating or that they remove a sense of urgency from academics. The technology has also led students to focus on external results at the expense of internal growth. The dominant worldview seems to be: Why worry about actually learning anything when you can get an A for outsourcing your thinking to a machine?



During my sophomore year, I participated in my school's debate team. I was excited to have a space outside the classroom where creativity, critical thinking, and intellectual rigor were valued and sharpened. I love the rush of building arguments from scratch. ChatGPT was released back in 2022, when I was a freshman, but the debate team weathered that first year without being overly influenced by the technology—at least as far as I could tell. But soon, AI took hold there as well. Many students avoided the technology and still stand against it, but it was impossible to ignore what we saw at competitions: chatbots being used for research and to construct arguments between rounds.



To me, debate is about forming your own arguments and pushing yourself to refute curveball counters. It's about developing the skills to outthink and out-argue your opponent. It isn't about who can present the best cookie-cutter AI arguments with polished and possibly invented data. Something I once loved now feels empty.

AI is not all bad. Some students may use these tools to develop their understanding or explore topics more deeply, serving their intellectual curiosity without actually cheating. AI can also be used as a study aid—say, quizzing you on vocabulary ahead of a Spanish test. But the temptation to abuse these tools is always there. I am concerned about what will happen as the short-term solutions presented by chatbots become the only ones that people know how to pursue—especially beyond the classroom. If we keep leaning on AI to sidestep pressure or deadlines, what happens when the tools aren't there? In the real world, chatbots cannot hold the powerful to account in the way an investigative reporter does, through relentless interviews and vetting hard-t0-find information. They cannot perform open-heart surgery or ballet. Many of us are so accustomed to outsourcing that we're dulling the very instincts that we need to prevail in life: grit, critical thinking, and the ability to function smoothly under stress.



It will take more than AI detectors and screen monitoring to address this disconnect. Student assessments should be focused on tasks that are not easily delegated to technology: oral exams, for instance, in which students walk educators through their thinking process, or personalized writing assignments that are unique to the student or current events. Portfolio-based or presentational grading could be emphasized over traditional exams or pop quizzes, giving students ample time to earn their grades. Students can also be encouraged to reflect on their own work—using learning journals or discussion to express their struggles, approaches, and lessons learned after each assignment.



These strategies could create an academic environment where integrity, creativity, and original thought thrive. Whatever the path forward, it must be forged soon. If chatbots have made school easier to get through, they are also making school equally as hard to grow out of. The technology is producing a generation of eternal novices, unable to think or perform for themselves.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Jonathan Rauch on the “constitution of knowledge,” disinformation's dangers, and why reality always wins. Plus: What a J. D. Vance presidency would look like.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts

On this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic's David Frum discusses recent questions about President Donald Trump's health and explores what a potential J. D. Vance presidency might mean for the country. He contrasts Trump's impulsive, ego-driven style with Vance's methodical, ideologically driven approach, examining how each wields power, pursues personal and political goals, and shapes domestic and foreign policy. Frum explains why understanding these differences is crucial for anticipating the challenges ahead.

Then Frum is joined by Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth. They discuss how societies decide what's real, why disinformation has become a central political strategy, and living in a “reality-based community.” Rauch explains the dangers of the “fire hose of falsehood,” why authoritarian regimes weaponize confusion, and why, even amid today's “machinery of lies,” reality still has the final word.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Jonathan Rauch of the Brookings Institution and The Atlantic, and we'll be talking about many things, but above all about his landmark 2021 book, The Constitution of Knowledge.

Before I talk to Jonathan, I want to open with some preliminary remarks about a shadowy future ahead for the United States. I am recording this talk on the 1st of September of 2025, Labor Day Monday. Now, rumor is rife this day that President [Donald] Trump suffered some kind of medical event over the weekend. I have, of course, no idea whether there is any basis for this rumor, and I'm not speculating about its truth or falsehood. But here are some hard facts. When Donald Trump entered office in January 2025, he was five months older than Joe Biden was when Joe Biden started his presidency in January of 2021. Watch any video of Trump, compare it to a video even from his first term, when he was already past 70, and you can see the evidence of time upon his body and mind.

Now, there are more than 40 months remaining in the present Trump term. It's worth preparing now for what may lie ahead—preparing intellectually, I mean, for what may lie ahead—and specifically for the ways that an administration might change or this administration might change if Vice President [J. D.] Vance inherited President Trump's office either before 2028 or after.

Now, I often use the following formula to describe the Donald Trump personality and the Donald Trump presidency. I've said he's a head case first, a crook second, and an autocrat only third. Trump's peculiar psychology often impels him to do things that are nonfunctional from any other point of view. One example: President Trump in his first term received a lot of political benefit from his close political association, his close working relationship, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now in September of 2025, Trump is locked in a bitter personal dispute with Modi that has blown up a 30-year strategic partnership between India and the United States, and it's reportedly all because Trump is furious at Modi for not nominating Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for Donald Trump's very minor role in brokering an end to the India-Pakistan fighting in June of 2025.

The annals of the Trump presidency—first term and second—are thick with incidents that make no sense even on Donald Trump's own terms. I mean, think about the story about the Qatari plane that Donald Trump has purported to accept on behalf of the United States and that is supposedly then going to be donated to the Trump presidential library, whether on the ground or in the air, after Donald Trump leaves office. Now, this so-called gift is going to cost the American taxpayer a billion dollars. It can be refused by any future Congress because a president or a person—anyone who's an official—can only accept a gift from a foreign government with the consent of Congress, and if Congress were to pass a resolution saying the gift is not acceptable, then the gift would become illegal and unconstitutional. Now, why go through all of this for such a speculative benefit? I think it's driven by psychological need more than any kind of rational desire for gain.

Now, if we imagine a President Vance, I expect we'll see less of this kind of self-defeating behavior. Through his political life, Vance has pursued power fiercely, but astutely. He has reinvented himself again and again as opportunity beckoned, but he does not get distracted by delusions and fantasies the way Donald Trump has so often done. So he's not a head case, nor is Vance the kind of impulse-driven pursuer of personal financial gain that Donald Trump is.

I don't mean that a Vance administration would be an honest one. Vance is very much beholden to and often deeply identifies with men who seem to wish to use the United States government as a tool for their own massive self-enrichment. But I don't see Vance engaging in the kind of petty chicanery, like making the Secret Service stay at a resort or hotel that Vance owns and then overcharging from their night in order to make a few comparatively paltry dollars. I don't see him doing things like that, in that kind of self-defeating way. There's no Vance meme coin, and there's no instance of Vance putting his relatives into positions to pick up special favors and advantages the way some of Donald Trump's relatives have done. That kind of thing is not the Vance style.

But what is ahead for a Vance presidency—whether before or after 2028—is for a leader determined to consolidate power, other people's greed can often offer a useful tool. [Russian President] Vladimir Putin skyrocketed to power in the year 2000 by offering protection to the family and friends of the dying Russian President Boris Yeltsin. If they supported the maneuvers that brought Putin to the presidency, without a prior election, Putin would secure their wealth and privileges against the family's loss of its grip on power and public office. The story is told in the book from Yale University Press, with the wonderful title The Less You Know, the Better You Sleep, by veteran Russia correspondent David Satter.

You might imagine some kind of comparable or analogous deal being struck between an incoming President Vance and suddenly vulnerable members of the 47th president's family. Unlike Trump, J. D. Vance has a lot of ideas about the external world that go far beyond his own vanity and his own wealth. Trump likes Putin and hates Ukraine because, apparently, Putin flatters him and because Ukraine defied or insulted him. Vance thinks much more ideologically. He fits both Ukraine and Russia into a much larger project to promote extremist right-wing rule across the European continent. He traveled to Germany in February to help that country's far right in elections that same month. Then he spent his summer holidays in England to boost authoritarian nationalists over moderate conservatives.

Trump likes tariffs because he wrongly thinks foreigners are taking advantage of Americans and because maybe he enjoys the emotional surge of wielding arbitrary power. Did I say 25 percent tariffs? I'm doubling them and now I'm doubling them again. Oh, you said something nice to me. Okay, back to 25 percent. He loves that. Vance advocates tariffs, however, for much more grounded reasons. He has a vision of transforming the United States economy in such a way as to up-value the comparative—the relative value of male labor, devalue the relative value of female labor, and thereby make marginal men more attractive as partners in a big social-engineering project that is not ultimately economic, but that, it's not just whimsical; it is part of a larger vision of how things should be, how the world should be. It's an ideology, not a fixation, and not a twitch—something carefully considered.

Where Vance is continuous with Trump is in his preference for, or in his attraction to, or his willingness to use authoritarian methods of governance. Vance has made himself the face of Trump's military deployments in Democratic-governed cities—Los Angeles and Washington, for now; Chicago, apparently, next; maybe others in the future. Vance mimics and even outdoes Trump's derisive and sarcastic rhetorical style that denies dignity and respect to opponents and critics.

Trump has taken every side of the immigration debate over his career. He can flip-flop even on admitting hundreds of thousands of Chinese foreign students in the United States. One day, No. The next day, Yes. The day after that: Who knows? For Vance, it's a matter of supreme principle to purge the country of unwanted foreigners by any means necessary, including the suppression of previously existing due process, which he's defended in writing, for example, in this quote, from a tweet of April 15th this year. Here's Vance: “Here's a useful test: ask the people weeping over the lack of due process what precisely they propose for dealing with Biden's millions and millions of illegals. And with reasonable resource and administrative judge constraints, does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year?”

So since the goal is to deport a few million people per year, we have to do away with due process because there's no way to achieve that goal while respecting due process, and even though due process is in the Constitution, out it goes. And that's not a whim, and that's not a twitch. That's a matter of settled and sincere belief for which Vance is willing to pay a political price.

It's important to understand, as we consider what may lie ahead between now and 2028 and after 2028, that not all authoritarians are the same. Some are flamboyant and bombastic. Others are methodical and purposeful. Some talk a lot. Others talk less. Some are motivated by personal ego, others, by ideological fanaticism. Some are driven by past vendettas, others, by plans to grab power and never let it go. Some are the past, and others are the future.

Had Donald Trump vanished from politics after the attempted coup of January 2021, Americans might congratulate themselves on surviving a bad episode in their country's history as they survived the repressive panic after the First World War and McCarthyism after the Second World War. But Trump did not vanish. He returned to power, this time backed by a party and a movement united in support of his authoritarian goals and authoritarian methods. The American crisis of democracy is shaping up to be bigger than any one person, even a person as outsize as Donald Trump. The crisis will not end when Trump's career does. The crisis may, in fact, be getting bigger, more dangerous, more institutional, more permanent. A crisis of the house divided as grave or graver than any since the Civil War.

And now my dialogue with Jonathan Rauch. But first, a quick break.

[Music]

David Frum: Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a contributing editor to The Atlantic. Those titles, however, don't convey the weight of the reputation Jonathan has earned in 45 years in journalism. He has won esteem and admiration through the English-speaking world, with books and articles on subjects from gay marriage to nuclear power to modern Japanese life.

Looming over all those accomplishments, however, is his most recent book, The Constitution of Knowledge. The Constitution of Knowledge is a work of philosophy about the subject of how we know and how we're entitled to say that we know. And in my opinion, it belongs on the shelf with [René] Descartes, [John] Locke, and all the other great thinkers on these important questions of the way the human mind works.

I've known Jonathan Rauch personally as a close friend since 1978, and although I've seen him acclaimed over those years for many achievements, The Constitution of Knowledge is his greatest, and the topic of our conversation today.

Jonathan, welcome. And I'm about to lower the tone dramatically.

Jonathan Rauch: Well, go ahead, but I just have to thank you for that outrageously overgenerous introduction. None of those accomplishments really matches up to the value of my friendship with you, David. You've been my spirit animal for almost 50 years.

Frum: Well, thank you. But now I'm going to lower the tone, so you may want to retract that remark.

So I discovered before we talked that you had not heard of the story I'm about to say, so I'm going to tell it in a little bit more detail, but you don't need to know the details to see how I'm going to queue it up because what I want to know is, how does an adherent of The Constitution of Knowledge deal with the following problem?

There is a well-known podcaster named Candace Owens. Huge, huge following. Says a lot of weird things, a lot of crazy things, a lot of borderline, or even over-the-borderline, anti-Semitic things. But she's in serious legal trouble right now because a lawsuit has been filed over her repeated, multipart accusations and claims that the wife of the president of France, a mother of three children, has in fact been a man all along and was “born a man,” in Candace Owens's words, and “will die a man.”

Now, I'm not asking you to enter into the Owens-Macron controversy or to comment in any way.

Rauch: Oh, c'mon, can't I really?

Frum: I want to know, how do you, Jonathan Rauch, leading exponent of the constitution of knowledge—how do you deal with a problem like this?

Rauch: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, I laugh. Second of all, I remind us that in a libel lawsuit, truth is an absolute defense. The third thing to say is, so what we're looking at here could be just hilarious and amusing, or it could be quite sinister, depending on the context. It's hilarious and amusing if it's a tabloid story in which crazy people out for clicks say crazy things, and that's their business model, and get sued for it. It is more sinister if it's part of an entire information ecosystem that is in the business of spreading lies, exaggerations, half truths, and conspiracy theories for political gain. And sometimes those things will be funny and outrageous. Sometimes they'll seem funny and outrageous like Hillary Clinton is running a juvenile sex-trafficking ring from the basement of a pizzeria, but they'll turn out not to be funny when some guy shows up with a rifle and starts shooting. And sometimes they'll be deeply sinister, as when they're integrated into a campaign being run by the president of the United States and his federal government. So you tell me, is Candace Owens part of a larger industrial complex devoted to lying in politics, or is this a hilarious one-off?

Frum: You tell me.

Rauch: Well, okay, let's set aside Candace Owens. Let's go a little bit closer to the bone. In Donald Trump's first term, he engaged in something that's known in disinformation circles—we can talk about what that is and what it isn't in the constitution of knowledge; we'll get there in a minute, I guess—but he engaged in what's known as a fire hose of falsehood, Russian-style, mass-disinformation campaign, and that's where you put out so many lies, exaggerations, half truths, and conspiracy theories that people just throw up their hands. The media can't keep up. No one knows what's right or wrong. The fact-checkers can't keep up. Twenty a day is how The Washington Post clocked his lies. You don't do that by accident. You do that on purpose.

The second term looks a little bit different. Again, you tell me if it's more sinister or less. I suspect it's more sinister. In the first term we were seeing mountains of lies emanating from the mouth of Donald Trump, but we were not seeing mountains of lies emanating from the entire administration below him. We were seeing a lot of bureaucracies, places like, you know, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, doing their best to hang on to truth-telling. In the second term, we're seeing cabinet officials—people like the attorney general and people like the secretary of Health and Human Services—we're seeing official agencies all engaging in this same practice. And so now we're seeing a machinery of lies. It's coming from the government itself, not just Trump. That's a change, and it's a bad change. So does that answer the question?

Frum: Well, let me give you a concrete example, another concrete example. And this one is clearly not funny, not even a little bit. You're the parent of a newborn child and you want to do the best for your child. And the doctor recommends to you that you go through a suite of vaccinations for the child. But you've heard one of your neighbors say that this is not a good idea, that the vaccinations will actually harm your child, whom you love more than anything. And so you go online to find out what the truth is, and maybe you go to government agencies, which are the most reputable, and you discover the government agencies, who used to be sure that you should do the suite of vaccinations, are suddenly endorsing the view that it's complicated. You can't be sure. There are a lot of risks here. You need to balance them for yourself using information from somebody other than the government itself. Where are we on that?

Rauch: We're in a dangerous place. Or what if you're concerned about foreign policy and you're trying to understand what America's stakes are in, for example, the fight over Ukraine, and the president tells you that this was a fight that the Ukrainians started. The complete inversion of reality. You're apt to be confused, right?

Frum: Yeah.

Rauch: And that's the point.

Frum: So what is this constitution that we are supposed to follow as our guide to solving this problem?

Rauch: Well, this might take a second because it's an entire book in a nutshell, but I'll try not to filibuster.

Every society from a small tribe to a large country has a problem with reality, which is people perceive reality differently and they get in fights over it. What's true; what's not true? In a small tribe, on something that's got pretty much instantaneous feedback, like, Where is the next water hole? or, Where's the enemy tribe located? Are they over the next hill? or, Is that a tiger in the bush?—you're going to get quick feedback and you're going to be fairly reality-based. But on the bigger, more abstract questions—which a lot can depend on—like Which God do we worship to make it rain?, you're going to disagree.

Down through the ages, societies have mostly settled that question through violence, war, oppression. They rely on an authoritarian leader, a priest, an oracle—terrible, terrible ways to stay grounded to reality.

Starting in the time of John Locke and Galileo—and then in the 300 some years since then—we in the liberal West developed an alternative. I call it the “constitution of knowledge,” but it is a set of rules and norms and institutions that dictate how we go about settling our disagreements about reality and that show us a way to do that that keeps us grounded in reality and that allows us to settle our disagreements peaceably through structured persuasion. And what it does is—we call this science, but it's broader than science; it also includes journalism and law and government agencies, and museums and libraries—but it creates an international system in which people follow rules to float hypotheses and refute those hypotheses and get trained up in how to do that. They're not allowed to use coercion. They're not allowed to end arguments. They're forced to defend themselves. There's a lot of structure that goes into that. If you just throw people in a room and say, Disagree. Come up with an idea of truth, you get 8chan, 4chan, X. You need tons of structure to make it happen. And that's the constitution of knowledge. It's all of these institutions and norms: everything from the academic journals to the legal standards, which you learned at Harvard Law School. How to write a footnote, how to structure an argument, publication standards, all of this stuff. And it defines what I call the reality-based community, of which the four long poles are: the world of academics, research, and science, number one; journalism, number two; law, number three; and government, number four. Government has to be tethered to reality, or it can just throw you in jail for a made-up crime, which, by the way, seems to be happening, at least to some people.

So that's the constitution of knowledge in a nutshell. It's the system we rely on to keep our society tethered to reality in a way that is peaceful and knowledgeable, preserves our freedom—and that's what's under attack. And by the way, has been since Galileo's time.

Frum: So some parts of this constitution of knowledge look more robust than others. So, when the president of France and his wife come to court and present their case against Candace Owens and demonstrate the DNA hearings and show the biological relationship of Brigitte Macron to her three children, they will prove that they are right, that Candace Owens was repeatedly and deliberately and intentionally mistaken, and she will probably owe some money, if she doesn't settle first. So that part of the constitutional community will work.

But to go to my example about the vaccinations: If you are a young parent trying to find out whether to vaccinate your child, the governmental part of that community is suddenly a lot less helpful than it was a year and a half ago.

Rauch: Well, that's right. People don't think about this, David, but over a period of decades, a lot of systems were put in place to try to keep the U.S. government reality-based, and that's very important for a bunch of reasons. One is, you'll make bad choices as a government if your choices are not based on reality. You'll vaccinate the wrong people. You won't vaccinate anyone. You'll fail to approve the drugs that should be approved. You'll get into wars and conflicts. You shouldn't—on and on and on.

The second reason that we did that is basic fairness and justice, right? If government can make up facts about you, then it can do anything it wants to. This is what we learned from [George] Orwell and [Hannah] Arendt. The core of totalitarianism is the government's ability to make stuff up. So we adopted things like the Administrative Procedure Act in the '40s, and that sets up pretty elaborate systems that keep government tethered to facts. We put inspectors general throughout the government, dozens of them in multiple agencies with independence to say, Okay, is the decision-making here lawful and is it factual? We delegated courts so that if the government bases its regulatory decision on false facts, you can go to court; you can sue. You can say, This is false, and a court will find for you, and on and on and on. This is one of the great achievements of the modern liberal state. Fact-basing.

We now see an attack on that on multiple fronts. Think about DOGE. A bunch of amateurs are put in charge of reforming everything. They sweep in there and then they start putting up a website, trumpeting their claims, many of which turn out to be simply made-up. They exaggerate their savings by an order of magnitude. What you do with this is you quickly put in position two things. First, people don't know what they can rely on, on something fundamental like vaccines or something like foreign policy. But second, after a while, you get to the real goal of this kind of campaign of untruth and disinformation. People throw up their hands. They say, I don't know who to believe anymore. The New York Times is saying one thing, but the secretary of Health and Human Services is saying another. Is it safe to take this vaccine? Isn't it safe? They throw up their hands and they stop believing in any facts at all. Once you've done that, you've demoralized your target population. You've made them feel it's futile to fight back, to ever decide on truth. And that's the ultimate goal.

Frum: Tell me about the other poles. I think there's a lot of feeling in American society now that universities are not doing their job of being objective, fact-driven institutions of learning, but are adopting ideological missions of one kind, and now there's this big counterreaction to push them to be ideological in a different way. Can the system work with one pole missing, or do we need all four to be working it together at the same time for the system to function?

Rauch: Well, of course, ideally, you want them all to be in good shape. Until January 20th, 2025, I was most worried about universities. Despite Trump's attempt in the first term to warp the government scientific agencies, he mostly failed at doing that. Media has its problems, but it, I think, acquitted itself with flying colors in Trump's first term. And indeed with some flaws in Biden's term, in telling us what's going on in the government—could be better, of course. Courts did best of all.

Academia was, I think, the most problematic area for all the reasons that you've just mentioned. One is there are fields now, the humanities and social sciences, where you see politicization, and even where you don't see deliberate politicization, you see such an overwhelming ratio of progressives to all other points of view, that there's no longer enough robust disagreement for views to really be tested. So things that just aren't true begin to get promulgated. I've been worried enough about that to join the board of Heterodox Academy, which is an academic-reform organization and to join the advisory board of University of Austin, which is trying to set out a new direction and to really work on reforming this problem.

Trust in universities has dropped by, what, 20 percentage points, over the last five years, something pretty catastrophic, and that's gotta be fixed because universities—you know, if there's going to be a cure for cancer, it's probably going to come out of our universities, out of our research establishment. And when it gets corrupted, a lot of bad things happen.

That's true until January 19th, 2025. And now I think we have a bigger problem, which is that the U.S. government itself is under siege.

Frum: All right, so as a citizen of the society governed by the constitution of knowledge, what are your rights and what are your responsibilities?

Rauch: So let me see if I can answer this in a slightly larger context. Rights and responsibilities is the correct frame. We talk endlessly about freedom of speech, for example, in academia, and academic freedom. Freedom is easy to talk about. But there are three things that you need for the constitution of knowledge to work, and you've got to have all three of them. And all three of them are difficult.

The first is freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of inquiry. And that means on university campuses, when you've got two-thirds of students saying that they feel chilled, reluctant to express their true opinions for fear of social consequences, that's a big problem. When professors are saying they're afraid to speak out, that's a big problem. So you've got to have freedom of speech, but we're used to talking about that.

But you need two other things. The second is commitment to fact. The rule of fact in the constitution of knowledge is like the rule of law in the U.S. Constitution. Even when you don't like how it comes out, even when you think it's wrong, in the end, you accept the consensus on facts. You can challenge it. You can change it over time, but you don't make up your own facts. You don't invent footnotes. You don't say any old thing. You abide by the rule of fact, and that is really hard to do. It's way easier and more fun to make stuff up or a conspiracy theory or whatnot. But without that adherence to the rule of facts, we're nowhere. So you need discipline, not just freedom. That's the responsibility that goes with the right.

And then the third thing you need is diversity of viewpoint. This is a direct analogy to Madison's “enlarge the sphere,” the need for pluralism to make constitutional democracy work. How do you deal with the problem of one faction becoming powerful and taking control? You have a lot of factions and you pit them against each other. Same thing with the constitution of knowledge. You have to have a lot of different viewpoints and a lot of different people defending those viewpoints because we can't see our own biases, but I can see some of yours and you can see some of mine. So we pit these viewpoints against each other, and that's the magic of the whole system. That's how we find our errors. If you don't have viewpoint diversity, if, for instance, everybody in the sociology department believes—well, we won't get into specifics, I can think of a few things—but believes the same thing on race or sex or gender, those assumptions won't be questioned and mistakes will be made. So you've got to have all three of those things and they're all in jeopardy.

Frum: What about taboos? Where do they fit into the constitution of knowledge? Let me give you a very concrete example from the history of religion. There has been a long, long debate about whether Jesus was an historical person, whether he existed, and whether the Gospel version of his life is true. Many different points of view have been aired on that. And we have long ago stopped murdering people if they say something that one faction or another doesn't agree. In the history of Judaism, are stories like the Exodus from Egypt true? Is a story of the conquest of the Holy Land by Joshua true? Again, a lot of research, a lot of archaeology on those questions. Islam makes a series of historical claims about itself, and you can't study those and the few in academic institutions that have ever studied them do so in a code so deliberately impenetrable as to make its books unreadable by outsiders.

And the reason they do is because everyone understands that, like Christianity before, I don't know, 1789, unlike the history of Judaism, because Jews never had this power, you give the wrong answer to the question and you could be faced with deadly violence and probably the authorities will look the other way.

Rauch: Well, it depends what you mean by taboo, right? If you mean a social taboo, things that we think it's just better not to talk about generally, like, what's the evidence on race and IQ? You know, sometimes I'm okay with that. We don't start from scratch in the reality-based community. We don't get up every morning and try to say, Is the law of gravity still true today? Is evolution still true? Do we decide today to restudy the Holocaust? The answer is we don't need to. Ideally you wouldn't have things become cemented in taboos where you can't question them at all, but very often we consign people who question established truth and facts and sometimes taboos to the margins. And usually they belong there because usually they're nut cases, but not always. Okay.

But terrorism, violence, outright threats and intimidation have no place in this system. Of course, one of the first examples of using terrorism internationally to suppress an entire conversation was the stimulus for my first and maybe still most important book, Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attacks on Free Thought, and that was in February of 1989 when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed the death of Salman Rushdie for writing a novel. Now, it wasn't just about the novel, it was really about the ideas in the novel, and it was about the idea that anyone anywhere in the world could question the truths that the Ayatollah maintained. And that proved to be an effective campaign. A bunch of people were killed and a lot of other people were chilled. And that campaign is still going on. I was just two weeks ago giving a talk on the exact same stage where Salman Rushdie, a few years ago, was almost murdered by a knife-ist. I actually met the guy who was the first to rush the stage and get that guy.

Of course, this kind of violence, this kind of threat, has no place in the constitution of knowledge, and the whole point of the constitution of knowledge is it forces us, whether we want to or not, to settle our disagreements through persuasion. The very first thing it does—like the U.S. Constitution—is take violence out of the hands of ordinary people and say, That's not how we settle disputes.

Frum: What happens when the authorities become selective in the extent to which they will deal with violence and not deal with violence? I mean, since October 7th of 2023, we have seen that, in the United States to a lesser degree, in Canada to a greater degree, in Europe and the United Kingdom even more, there's certain forms of violence and intimidation that the authorities will look away from, perhaps because they're frightened, perhaps because important elements of the authorities have some sympathy with the threats and intimidation. How do citizens of the republic governed by the constitution of knowledge deal with this problem?

Rauch: I'm tempted to ask if that's a trick question because the answer is those that shouldn't happen, right? Biggest example of that I can think of is, what, 1,500 people or so were convicted for attempting to overthrow the U.S. government. Many of them committed violence; many committed violence against policemen. The first thing Donald Trump did was pardon them all and say, That's okay. And, and this is a shocking corruption of the social contract that we make with each other to protect a free society where disputes can be settled and we can be anchored to reality. It just shouldn't happen. Now, of course, you know, it's going to, but you don't want to institutionalize it, and that's what I'm afraid is happening right now in the U.S., maybe elsewhere.

Frum: One of the most misunderstood essays of all time is Francis Fukuyama's 1989 essay “The End of History?,” where he is remembered as having said, Once you get to a liberal capitalist society, that's it. History stops. That's not what he said. What he said was, Once you get to liberal capitalist society, ideological development stops. You can go backwards to barbarism and cruelty and savagery and oppression, but you can't go forwards to a new dispensation.

So my question to you as a believer in this constitution of knowledge: Was that right? We hear a lot today about post-liberalism, about the desire to move to something beyond these rules that you described. This is offered not as a regression toward a barbarous past, but as an advance toward an even more promising future. Can the constitution of knowledge be time-limited? And is there something on the other side of it?

Rauch: I think Frank was right, actually, in the point that he was actually making, which you correctly summarize. He wasn't saying conflict will never occur or recur, but he was saying that there's no remaining alternative to liberalism—you know, small-L liberalists and free markets and liberal democratic government and science broadly defined—and that the alternatives are not as good. And they've all been tried and they've all failed. And I think since he wrote that article, what, 36 years ago, a lot of alternatives have been tried. Really, they're old alternatives. Putin's trying one, and Xi is trying one, and Iran's trying one, and they're all going to fail. I'm not so sure about China yet. We'll see. But I'm pretty confident that that's not a system that will endure in the long term.

So I think the same is true of the constitution of knowledge. There is—so what's unique about the reality-based community, the rules of the constitution of knowledge, is that they're open-ended and impersonal in the same way that markets are and in the same way that elections are. So everyone has to follow the same rules no matter who they are, which means that in principle, you can perform an experiment in Picton, Ontario, Canada, and someone speaking a different language in India can rerun the experiment and find out if you were right, or you can make an argument in a magazine and someone speaking Swahili in Africa can trace your logic and your cites and see if you're right.

The only system that can set up a global network of hundreds of thousands of institutions and hundreds of millions of individuals trained to communicate with each other, to constantly exchange information in search of each other's errors, is the constitution of knowledge, because it's the only system that says what matters is your hypothesis, not who you are, and every hypothesis needs to be checked and rechecked before it's admitted as fact.

No other system does that. No other system can turn all of humanity into a kind of global super-brain that literally transforms the capacity of our species to know and literally creates more new knowledge every day before breakfast than was created by Homo sapiens in its first 200,000 years. No system that relies on priests or politbureaus or monarchs or sacred texts or oracles can ever come anywhere near that.

Frum: What if we successfully break the global links, though? We are living now through a time where one of the big projects that the people in control of both the United States and China, two major powers, is to sever these kinds of connections: connections of information, sever connections of trade, sever connections of human contact. People who visit China tell me that it is striking when you go there how few Americans you now see. Whereas once you would've seen—20 years ago, you'd have seen many, many visitors and tourists and travelers and students, now it's a very rare thing to see an American there. Trade connections are being severed across the Atlantic and across the Pacific. Social media's creating these kinds of warring fiefdoms, with China locked, in its way, and tech oligarchs trying to control the American system, and the government of the United States looking for ways to commandeer those systems, to impose—they call them ombudsman—but really sort of truth commissars at major American media companies. Companies paying fines to the president if they say something he doesn't like, especially if it's true, in order to get permission for their corporate activities to continue.

We've seen periods of global integration collapse. The Roman Empire collapsed and left behind lots of little principalities. The Victorian world system that came to its apogee in 1913 collapsed and left us with half a century of nationalism and violence. Could it happen again? On the intellectual domain, not just the trade and material domain?

Rauch: So, it's harder to make that happen in the intellectual domain than in the domain of, say, trade, where you can impose a tariff and something comes off a ship and you slap it with what amounts to a tax. Or the realm of immigration, where you're dealing with physical bodies. Or for that matter, the realm of political nationalism, where you can bust up alliances, for example. It's harder to do that in the realm of knowledge, just because knowledge can be transmitted electronically over wires.

So, one of the remarkable things that's happened over the last, well, century-plus, but accelerating the last 20 years or so, has been international collaboration in science and journalism. Because what used to be quite difficult, which would be for, I don't know, David Frum to collaborate with a scientist or journalist in China, is now trivially easy. If you can surmount the language barrier, you're on Zoom, you're co-authoring a paper, and so we've seen rapid rise, startling rise in international scientific collaboration, and that in turn has resulted in bringing on board lots of new minds, new thinking, new energy, new resources from places like India and Africa, which were kind of sidelined in the scientific community. So that process is hard to stop, right? Because it's going to be electronic and collaborational.

Where you pay a cost—and I think are already paying a cost—is you do need some exchange of bodies. It is to the world's benefit, to the benefit of humanity and science, if students from around the world can study here. Learn how to do science from the best people here, take that back home with them, and teach it to the people at home and then bring them into this global system of knowledge-seeking, or stay here and become leading scientists with the massive resources that are available.

The Trump administration seems to be doing its best to cut those ties. It is cutting the funding for scientific research, including global. It is making it difficult for foreign students to come. A lot of people are not coming at this point because they're worried about getting nailed by immigration or losing a visa or losing funding. Francis Collins, former NIH [National Institutes of Health] director and others say we're experiencing, for the first time in memory, reverse brain drain, where most talented minds are leaving America, looking for work in Canada and places that are in Europe that are eager to recruit them. And that's going to hurt us as a nation, and it's also going to hurt the search for knowledge because you want the best minds put to work where they can work most efficiently and productively. And in many cases, that's still the United States.

Frum: What if the human mind is constituted in a way that it chafes at the constitutional knowledge and actually doesn't want it? And we see lots of examples of how this could be so. People are drawn to conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories promise them that the universe is, even if malign, is organized by somebody. It's not just a blank and impersonal thing that is utterly indifferent to our fates. There's someone in charge, and that's a reassuring thing. One of the reasons that the anti-vax deception finds winners is people want to believe that nature is benign, and that if we could just live more in harmony with it, we would be healthier and stronger. And, of course, we have seen that human beings—many of us, anyway—prefer to live in an orthodoxy enforced by some kind of supernatural guarantee than to live in all the uncertainties. That's what the crisis of modernity is all about, right? That you have to live with uncertainty and you have to accept your neighbor's certainty because you're uncertain about your uncertainty. What if we're not—what if it's just trying to make us live in ways that human beings don't want to live, and that rebellion against this, and maybe the system's overthrow, is in our genes?

Rauch: Well, you can take off the what if part of that statement, because it's just unquestionably true. The constitution of knowledge, in particular, and all three of these liberal systems—free exchange and liberal democracy—are profoundly counterintuitive. Chapter 2 of my book The Constitution of Knowledge is about the massive numbers of cognitive and social distortions that make it difficult for us to challenge our own assumptions, to even know that our assumptions need challenging. As Madison says—I'll mangle the quote, but maybe you can get it—if all men were angels, we would not need a government. If people were naturally predisposed to question their mistakes, especially the things that they're most certain of, to put their ideas up for critical review, to change their mind, or at least put up with it when society changes its mind, we wouldn't need a constitution of knowledge, just as if we were all inclined to get along in a giant democracy without rules, we wouldn't need a U.S. Constitution. It is precisely because being based in reality as a society is so difficult and so counterintuitive that we need these rules. It's the reason it took 300 years to develop them to reach the point where they are today.

I often say—you know, I've been a free-speech nut since we were students together back in college. That's almost 50 years. And what I've learned in that period is that the single most crazy, counterintuitive social idea ever invented is the idea that the government should not only tolerate speech that is wrongheaded, bigoted, offensive, but actually protect the speech. That is the craziest, most counterintuitive idea ever—redeemed only by the fact that it is also the single most successful social idea ever. But the result of that is that you and I will have to get up every morning and defend these principles from scratch. And we just have to be cheerful about that. And there will be attack after attack on the constitution of knowledge. It started with Galileo, who was thrown into house arrest because he believed in the Copernican system. And if the people now who are trying to sic on to the government into wholesale distortion of reality are defeated, there will be something else coming along behind them. And that's just reality.

Frum: And that leaves you thinking that the future looks like what?

Rauch: Based on the past, the future looks good. It's not automatic. We have to understand that the people who are fighting the constitution of knowledge—especially Donald Trump, but also the cancel-culture people, who have been very successful in the realm of academia, to some extent, journalism and corporate life—they're very sophisticated people and they're using very sophisticated, time-honored propaganda and cognitive-warfare tactics.

But we have a couple things going for us. One is that people hate to live in an epistemically polluted system where they don't know what's true and they don't know what they can trust and they don't know whether they can take the vaccine and they don't know if anyone's ever telling them the truth. This is an experiment that was tried in the Soviet Union and many other places. It fails because people hate it. Over time, they will gravitate toward sources that prove reliable. It's not easy and it's not always obvious.

There's this also second thing that the constitution of knowledge has going for it, which is reality. Here's the thing. If you stop vaccinating people for measles, guess what happens? You get measles. Then kids start to die. Then people look around and say, WTF? You can only suspend reality for so long before it hits you in the face. And that's been the undoing of all the regimes throughout history, which have tried to manipulate reality: They get high on their own supply, they believe their own propaganda, they lose track of truth, they become arrogant about their manipulations, and they succumb to reality.

The best thing that we have going for us, for the constitution of knowledge, is there is no other system that can come close in terms of finding and discovering truth and keeping society moored to reality. That doesn't mean we win automatically. And it sure doesn't mean we win in the short run. [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin and, for that matter, Donald Trump can do what they're doing for a significant amount of time and get away with a lot. But we are not where we are just because of hard work.

Frum: Do you think the loss of print as the preferred medium of communication compromises or even dooms your project?

Rauch: Well, as a longtime print journalist, I'm inclined to say, Duh. But I guess that would be self-serving. It doesn't doom it; nothing dooms it. But it's a problem. And that's because print journalism has historically been the best at focusing resources to perform investigations, organizing editorial hierarchies that are careful about checking, creating newsrooms that are good at training the next generation in these methods, and having a business model that sustains that. The business model is now dead or dying. It's getting very hard to support those enterprises.

Television has historically done good work, but it's been less good at it. Social media is much less good at it still because the incentives are wrong, and don't get me started on TikTok. And so it's a challenging environment.

Frum: Jonathan, thank you. It's always a pleasure. I always learn from you. I've been learning from you for a long time. And as you have said, so I feel that our relationship has been one of the primordial bonds of my life. And I'm grateful that we can, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine and your constitution of knowledge, that we can hope to limp along a little longer.

Rauch: It's an honor to be with you and a special privilege to be joined with you in what is a long-term project to promote and protect the liberal principles that I learned so much about from you.

Frum: Thank you. Bye-bye.

Frum: Thanks so much to Jonathan Rauch for joining me today on The David Frum Show. I hope that if you liked this dialogue, if you benefited from it, you will consider sharing it with others who might also enjoy it. And I hope you will consider subscribing to The Atlantic, which is the best way to support our work. And subscribe, of course, to this podcast, on any platform you use, video or audio.

I also want to take a moment for a correction for a mistake I made in last week's monologue. I made a citation mistake last week. I quoted the journalist and author Walter Lippmann. The quote was accurate, but I sourced it to Lippmann's 1922 book Public Opinion. In fact, the book came from another book, first published in 1920: Liberty and the News. I apologize for my error; it has been noted in the transcript of the monologue on the Atlantic website. Thank you so much for joining us on The David Frum Show. Again, please like and subscribe and share. I'll look forward to seeing you next week back here on The David Frum Show.

In Trump's manosphere, the center is not holding.

Six months into Donald Trump's second term, the “manosphere” — an ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and YouTube shows that helped elect him — appears to be losing some of its enthusiasm for him.

Many of these hosts, who appeal to a young, male, and politically disengaged audience, now seem less excited about the administration's actions and focus. While some remain loyal, others are more critical or have shifted away from politics entirely. This fragmentation could pose a challenge for Trump, the MAGA movement, and the Republican Party in future elections as they try to hold together the unconventional coalition of voters that helped him win reelection.

With tens of millions of listeners, these podcasts have a significant reach. They frequently top podcast charts and attract a large audience, particularly among men. Recent data shows that the share of podcast listeners who identify as Republican has been growing, and millions more Americans becoming regular podcast consumers, making these hosts' shifts in loyalty and tone all the more important.

2.2 million subscribers (8.4 million on their YouTube prank channel); pranks, pop culture, and sports; weekly

The fratty young Canadian and American men of the Full Send Podcast, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron “Steiny” Steinberg, part of the prank group called the Nelk Boys, are two of Trump's most loyal podcasters. The Nelk group began their media and entertainment business as party-boy influencers, known as early as 2020 as “the most recognizable personalities for young people in North America,” when they gained notoriety for hosting parties during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And they built on that brand of performative hypermasculinity, organizing “brotests” to reopen gyms, traveling across the US and essentially taking contrarianism as far as they could. One fan told the Toronto Star back in 2020 that “a large part of ‘Nelk' is not listening” and not following rules.

That spirit brought them millions of followers, views, and financial success through partnerships, promotions, and subscriptions. And through their vlogging and prank videos, they have been able to mainstream and promote a variety of right-leaning and far-right commentators on their show, leading to accusations of “extreme misogyny” and bigotry.

Over the last few years, Forgeard and his collaborators have interviewed Trump repeatedly and talked with him and JD Vance during the 2024 campaign. Trump, in turn, has shouted the boys out in speeches and praised them and their work, noting in 2023 that many in the political and media establishment “don't realize that the NELK boys are probably a lot more powerful than them.”

Since January, they've been more or less supportive of Trump — praising his foreign policy and negotiating over the Russia-Ukraine war. Still, more recently, they have said that they want “to maybe stay out of politics for a little bit because we just want to have fun, too,” after getting intense criticism for interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

2.69 million subscribers; current events and business; two to three times each week

Hosted by businessman Patrick Bet-David in a panel-style discussion with three to four co-hosts, PBD Podcast tends to talk about all kinds of current events, ranging from celebrity news to hard politics. Trump has appeared on the show before, visiting Bet-David during the 2024 campaign, and Bet-David has called himself a staunch Trump ally.

Though the shows feature some debate over Trump's policies, those conversations tend to end by criticizing Democrats and boosting the Trump stance. During the rollout of “Liberation Day” tariffs in spring, for example, the panel was torn and confused about the impact of tariffs on the global markets, before criticizing the Federal Reserve and endorsing Trump's negotiations. Similarly, they have long praised Trump's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, calling Trump an “alpha” male for his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders. And they show no signs of slowing their support soon.

20 million subscribers; interviews, commentary; about four times per week

The biggest podcaster in the world wasn't always a Trump fan, but became one over the course of the last five years as his show became one of the most influential platforms for politicians, celebrities, thinkers, and more. Rogan's October Trump interview broke records (it's been viewed 60 million times now) and kicked off a frenzy on the Democratic side when he didn't agree to the terms set by Kamala Harris's campaign to get her on the show.

Over the last few months, however, Rogan's support for Trump has been much more muted. He's been critical of tariffs, government censorship and pseudo-policing language, the extent to which mass deportations are being carried out, and, more recently, the obfuscation over the supposed Epstein files and the administration “gaslighting” supporters. The podcaster sounds more jaded. As opposed to becoming a full-throated critic, he seems less enthusiastic about the president's embrace of big tech CEOs, the lack of promised transparency by the administration on things like government spending, censorship, and the Epstein case. Instead, Rogan demonstrates disillusionment and disengagement.

4.1 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; about twice a week

Theo Von, the comedian and host of This Past Weekend, has started to split with Trump more visibly over the Epstein episode. Von used to be a bigger Trump fan; he hosted Trump a year ago, when in the span of a week he talked to both Trump and Bernie Sanders, and this May, he delivered a stand-up set during Trump's visit to a Qatari American military base.

Yet, Von seems to be a lot more skeptical of Trump this summer — criticizing his tariffs, America's involvement in the Middle East by attacking Iran, American support for Israel and “helping” support a “genocide in Gaza,” and the administration's response to calls for transparency on the Epstein case.

Von himself has started to host Trump critics, having on Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to discuss the Epstein case, and using social media to criticize Vance (a former guest of Von's) for reneging on his promise to “release” the Epstein files. In more recent episodes of his show, Von sounds more muted about Trump — still hosting conversations with a variety of guests and telling jokes but also talking about how “corrupt” the “system” is, how nothing really seems to be changing, and how depressing politics is.

2 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; weekly

The host of the Flagrant comedy podcast, Andrew Schulz, is disillusioned with Trump, but much more vocally. Schulz was a big Trump supporter in the past, also hosting him on his show in 2024. Schulz has now turned into Trump's loudest former-fan-turned-critic in this universe. The sharp break came in July, during the Epstein debacle, when he began to express more regret for his Trump support, saying that, “If I wanted to vote for somebody that was going to keep the Epstein files under wrap, that was going to extend the foreign wars and was going to increase the budget, I would have voted for Kamala.” And he is communicating a lot of what new 2024 Trump voters who weren't huge supporters of the president have been saying in polling. “Everything he campaigned on I believe he wanted to do, and now he's doing the exact opposite thing of every single fucking thing,” Schulz said in July.

Schulz, like Von, has started to host more liberal and Trump-critical voices: Sanders, Khanna, Pete Buttigieg, the Pod Save America hosts, and the journalist Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder). He now teases himself for his past support for Trump and has essentially turned his show into a vehicle for those expressing regret over their Trump support to feel better about looking for other options.

As Schulz said recently, Democrats have an opportunity to win back voters like him. “You have an opportunity to be like, hey, we told you he was a liar. Here's the proof that he's a liar. Come over here, here are some ideas that might be better. You might like these. If you just go, hey, fuck you, you're dumb, the people that are called dumb are never goingwo to come to your side.”

A handful of podcasters and influencers have pulled back from discussing current events and politics, or if they delve into Trump-related topics, they do so carefully. Shawn Ryan (4.8 million subscribers) and Lex Fridman (4.79 million subscribers), for example, host interview shows that delve into hyper-specific and niche topics with guests who don't talk too much about political news of the day, but they both conducted softball interviews with Trump last autumn.

Both have continued speaking with businessmen, authors, former military officers, historians, and thinkers since the election but have not been vocal defenders or commentators on Trump's presidency so far. Fridman interviewed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but they only talked about Trump in passing for a few moments, and it was never critical. The same situation applies to Ryan, who also interviewed Vance last year, but hasn't talked much about the Epstein debacle, tariffs, or immigration.

Two other big Trump supporters have pulled back from political discussions and promoting Trump. Adin Ross (4.6 million) and Logan Paul (4.8 million) both interviewed Trump last year but pivoted back to their original style of video livestreaming pranks, commentary on internet culture, and challenges (like Ross having his back waxed on a livestream with MrBeast).

The shifting loyalties within the manosphere could be a sign of broader changes among the young, male voters who helped elect Trump — the current tensions at least suggest early challenges to the durability of the president's coalition. Still, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will actively work to win back the support of these creators and their audiences — he hasn't returned to most of these shows since taking office.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

A roundtable discussion among leading MAGA intellectuals suggests they might be suffering from success.

What happens when you put four of the Trump right's leading intellectuals together in a room? You see what it looks like when a political movement gets high on its own supply.

The conversation in question is a recently published two-hour video roundtable hosted by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an organization dedicated to educating and connecting young conservatives. The panelists are tech monarchist Curtis Yarvin, “postliberal” political theorist Patrick Deneen, the culture war activist Chris Rufo, and globetrotting journalist Christopher Caldwell.

Prior to Trump, Caldwell was the only member of the panel with a claim to real influence. Since, however, each has become a defining figure in the pro-Trump coalition. Yarvin's ideas helped inspire DOGE. Deneen is a major influence on Vice President JD Vance. Rufo shaped Trump's war on higher ed, and Caldwell's ideas influenced its attack on civil rights law.

On a casual watch, their conversation seems like a debate over the American experiment. Yarvin is opposed, repeatedly suggesting that the US take lessons from French autocrats like Louis XIV and Napoleon. The other panelists disagree, arguing that it's possible to build a better America by making the current system more right-wing.

But what's actually important is how much all four of them agree about what a “more right-wing” America should look like.

“We all have strong opinions — agreements, disagreements — but it all seems like we're moving in the same direction,” Rufo says near the roundtable's end. “We can hash out the ideas among ourselves [because] we had the big debate with the left between 2020 and 2024. I think we've effectively won that debate.”

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

That overall direction, it is clear, is giving more and more power over our lives to Donald J. Trump. Over and over again, the speakers praise Trump's consolidation of power over the executive branch and urge him to go further, ignoring or mocking concerns about legality and democracy. Yarvin's authoritarian provocations aren't immediately dismissed or scorned by his co-panelists, but serve as a conversational focal point that permits the others to indulge their own radicalism. Their shared ambition is explicitly revolutionary, aiming not merely to transform the government but also to remake the very souls of American citizens.

“I think the aim should be not simply to dismantle, but to replace,” Deneen says. “And not just replace the government, but replace the America that — in some ways — fostered and brought it into being.”

But that's abstract. To understand not just how radical, but how weird the pro-Trump right has become, take these three moments from the conversation:

About 20 minutes into the discussion, Yarvin proposes a distinction between two types of Americans that the other panelists rather like (they return to it repeatedly throughout the two hours).

On the one hand, Yarvin says, you have “modern” Americans who flourish in a society that gives them control over the direction of their own lives. On the other hand, you have “pre-modern” Americans who “cannot take care of themselves in a civilized society.” He picks, as an example of the latter, “a gangbanger in Baltimore” — and proceeds to propose a flagrantly illegal scheme for putting their entire life under control of a local church:

You are going to get your welfare check from your minister. And you are part of that community. You don't pay taxes — basically, your relationship with the state is intermediated through your church. Your minister can drug test you, he can assign you work, he can put an AirTag on you, he can tell you where to go [and] where not to go.

Yarvin never says the word “Black,” but we all know who “gangbanger in Baltimore” is supposed to refer to. What he's describing, in short, is the government turning Black men who it labels “gangbangers” into serfs whose lives are fully managed by state-blessed churches. This isn't a call to reinstitute slavery, but it's pretty damn close.

And nobody objects to this in principle! Not one person says, “Hey, what you're talking about is both a gross violation of human rights and quite a bit racist.” In fact, the rest of the panel takes Yarvin's ideas and runs with them.

The first response, from Caldwell, is that Yarvin's scheme would be unconstitutional under the First and 14th Amendments. The First Amendment prohibits the federal government from establishing a religion, and the 14th “incorporates” the First, a legal term for applying the protections in the Bill of Rights to state governments. The state of Maryland cannot legally turn the population of Baltimore into church property because that would effectively establish a religion.

After pointing this out, Caldwell then suggests repealing the 14th Amendment. It's not exactly clear if he thinks that's a good idea, or suggesting it's a big problem for Yarvin that his plan would require something as big as repealing an amendment.

Before Caldwell can fully clarify, Deneen interjects with a different proposal: for the Supreme Court to un-incorporate the First Amendment. He wants, quite explicitly, for the Court to allow states to make certain religions official and privileged — describing this as a way that people can live together in a divided country.

“Religion, in the original Constitution, was officially established,” Deneen declares (dubiously). “The First Amendment was written to allow for the establishment of religion in the states.”

The point here is not merely that these ideas are wild and illiberal (imagine, say, an Alabama where the dictates of the Southern Baptist Church enjoy force of law). It is that Yarvin's bizarre ramblings about Baltimore, which should be dismissed by any sensible person, were instead used as a jumping-off point for various other radical schemes designed to transform the American social compact.

Around the 40-minute mark, the conversation turns to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — whose tenure, nearly everyone agreed, prefigured the aggressive use of political power Trump is currently deploying. Rufo worked closely with DeSantis, particularly his attempt to impose state controls on higher ed, and spent much of his conversation singing the governor's praises.

His biggest critique, in fact, was that DeSantis erred strategically by running against Trump.

“He would have been better off saying, ‘Hey, I'm very popular, Florida should repeal term limits and I will rule Florida for 25 years,'” Rufo moots.

Not to be outdone, Yarvin proposes that DeSantis should have ramped up his “heresies” against American liberalism “by 10x” or even “100x.” He suggests DeSantis should have established “a branch of the Boy Scouts, where they're the Florida Scouts, where they wear Florida uniforms.”

Deneen immediately replies that “that's a good idea” — prompting a bit of nervous laughter given that, as Rufo notes, “it's been tried before.” I took that as a reference to the Hitler Youth, though Yarvin swiftly clarified that he was thinking of the Young Pioneer groups in the Soviet Union and Communist China.

As with the Baltimore discussion, nobody is willing to directly attack Yarvin on the obvious grounds: In this case, that totalitarian youth indoctrination shouldn't be a model for policy in 21st-century America. Remarkably, Rufo tries to defend DeSantis by arguing that he actually did something like what Yarvin wanted — specifically by reviving the Florida State Guard, a state militia that had been inactive since 1947.

Caldwell did challenge Yarvin somewhat, arguing that “not every reform benefits from being deptupled.” But note that his objection was not the direction of change — authoritarian — but rather the size and speed of the change.

Nearly an hour and a half into the video, the panelists get into an argument about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. There was consensus that its true purpose was not efficiency, but rather conducting an ideological purge. Their debate was about the wisdom of using “efficiency” as window dressing.

Caldwell argues that Musk's talk of efficiency was a “necessary smoke screen” to hide its true purpose from the public. Had the Trump administration been honest about DOGE's true purpose, which is firing anyone who disagreed with it, they would have faced significant mass resistance.

“It's a much less acceptable story to present to the public than ‘we're saving money,” he argues.

Rufo, largely backed by Deneen and Yarvin, takes exception. He claims that Trump and Musk should have openly claimed that they had a mandate to remove liberals from the state, to conduct a “systematic extirpation” of anyone in the federal government who might have qualms about their agenda.

“President Trump won. So he gets to determine who is in his administration,” Rufo says. This efficiency talk was “a mistake that Elon made, because he thought that DOGE was a clever meme…and that he is a libertarian.”

Once again, the shared premise here is more important than the surface disagreement. There is, for the most part, a general sense that an ideological purge is basically a good idea. Much like the Florida youth cadres discussion, the kind of behavior that's widely seen as a mark of democratic backsliding and authoritarian mismanagement in other countries is seen by the panelists as a masterstroke in the war on liberalism.

There are moments, in the conversation, where it appears as if Caldwell is willing to question this premise. “It's a corrosive thing to say that you can't work in the federal government if you believe this-or-that,” he says.

But challenged by Rufo, who explicitly endorses such a political test for public employment, he reverts back to the public relations argument — saying the problem with Rufo's position is that “it doesn't command majority support.”

Caldwell is no moderate. He has repeatedly written favorably about foreign right-wing authoritarians, like Viktor Orbán and Narendra Modi. In his book on civil rights, he writes that white people “fell asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.”

Yet in this conversation, he is clearly the voice of restraint relative to the other three panelists. His willingness to give on the DOGE question reflects the fact that he is, in fact, no moderate — he is a radically aggressive culture warrior, just one who is somewhat less open about his authoritarian means than Yarvin or Rufo (who explicitly describes himself in the conversation as producing “propaganda” professionally).

I would call it a mask-off moment for the right's intellectual cadres. But I think the mask has been off for quite some time.

﻿Protecting astronauts in space — and maybe even Mars — will help transform health on Earth.

One day, Mars might become a home to humans. But first, there's the cinematic, sci-fi challenge of making the Red Planet suitable for life. There's a problem, though: The typical person can't get to space safely. That throws a wrench into the whole “let's move to Mars” plan in the face of extreme climate change and other existential risks on Earth.

Today, the path to becoming an astronaut is “littered with the hopes and dreams of medically disqualified candidates,” said Shawna Pandya, a research astronaut with the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS) and the director of its Space Medicine Group. “Once upon a time, kids being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the doctor's office would be told, ‘Well, you could still be anything, except an astronaut.'”

Here are some of the common reasons why you might be medically disqualified from becoming an astronaut:

Astronauts inherently aren't representative of the broader population — they're selected for being in very good health. The stress of existing in essentially weightless microgravity conditions, like those on the International Space Station (ISS), can be incredibly tough on the human body. Astronauts face heightened risks of early-onset osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and significant muscle mass loss. Naturally, government space agencies want people whose bodies are more resilient to such pressures, and who can perform necessary duties without a ton of medical intervention.

According to Haig Aintablian, director of the UCLA Space Medicine Program, “just as pregnancy causes the body to undergo complex and unique changes, spaceflight also produces distinct and significant physiological changes.” It also requires its own medical specialty to manage (aptly called space medicine).

There's a lot scientists don't know, from the physical to the psychological. That's a problem — for the future of science, space travel, and maybe even human existence at large.

NASA wants to go to Mars for research, and aims to send humans there as early as the 2030s. As the most similar planet to Earth in our solar system, Mars may have once harbored life, or may even currently. And in the future, we may even need it to support us.

Decades ago, seriously engaging with the idea of moving to Mars was extremely fringe for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a lack of technical feasibility to the desire to put scientific resources toward solving problems on Earth. Elon Musk — founder of the spaceflight company SpaceX — became a famed advocate for colonizing Mars in the early 2000s. He still is. Musk, who is currently worth around $410 billion, claims that he is only accumulating assets for the purpose of Martian space settlement. Last year, he said that he wants 1 million human settlers on the Red Planet in a self-sustaining city by 2050.

Now Musk isn't alone. NASA experts, biologists, academics, futurists, disaster resilience researchers, and physicians are seriously considering the possibility of making humanity an interplanetary species.

“The biggest problem for humanity to solve is the guaranteed survival of our species — which the logical answer is to become multiplanetary,” Aintablian said. “I don't think there's a better solution than Mars.”

While we know some of the health effects of being on the ISS, we can't really replicate the effects of Martian radiation exposure. Kelly Weinersmith — a biologist and co-author of A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through? — thinks that settling Mars on Musk's timescale will be catastrophic. She argues that we shouldn't rush to set up shop before understanding — and mitigating — the risks, even if this takes centuries rather than decades.

But many advocates for settling Mars are much more impatient. The only way to get there safely would be to unlock significant advances in space medicine, a nascent field that has just barely scratched the surface in its approximately 75-year history.

“Nothing that humanity has done that has been worthwhile has been easy,” Aintablian told me. “So much in our development as a civilization has been difficult, and the reason why we're able to live such comfortable lives now is because of the extremely difficult challenges that humans have had to solve in the past.”

Since extremely few people end up in space right now, the researchers trying to understand how to improve human health there have a limited sample size to work with. Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space in 1961, and more than 600 astronauts have followed him. Only about a sixth of them are women.

NASA researchers have identified some key ways that time in space can impact human health — radiation exposures, isolation, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and environmental consequences like an altered immune system. But we're still lacking many specific examples of how these different dynamics play out in real life.

One of the best studies we have is NASA's famous 2019 twins study. Twin studies allow researchers to separate the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental influences on health outcomes. NASA compared the health of identical twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly over the course of a year. Scott went into orbit on the ISS while Mark remained on Earth. Both underwent the same battery of physiological tests, and the results indicated some surprising new differences between the two men.

Scott's telomeres — the bits of DNA at the end of our chromosomes — lengthened while he was in space and (mostly) reverted to normal once he returned to Earth, possibly indicating radiation-induced DNA damage and potential increased cancer risk. Scott also lost body mass, developed signs of cardiovascular damage that were not present in Mark, and experienced some short-term cognitive changes after returning to Earth.

While survivable with the right training, equipment, and precautions, the twin study demonstrated how space's unique environment can have significant consequences for gene expression and overall health while in orbit.

If the best of the best struggle, what about the rest of us? We're getting some insights here now, too.

Since space tourism has literally taken off, astronauts aren't the only ones going to space now: Wealthy non-astronauts, like Jeff Bezos, Gayle King, and Katy Perry, have recently taken short, recreational jaunts into outer space through Bezos's space tech company, Blue Origin.

Aintablian is very excited about the prospect of civilian access to space increasing, which will inherently mean people with medical issues are also flying. This represents a huge opportunity for scientists to study the medical management of a much wider range of conditions.

That said, 10 or 15 minutes in space is hardly comparable to the conditions on the ISS. And Mars poses even worse consequences in terms of hostile environments and time spent away from Earth. Mars has toxic dust, lacks plant life and a breathable atmosphere, and only has about 40 percent of Earth's gravity. Earth's global magnetic field protects our planet from harmful radiation, and the Martian counterparts are localized, not planet-wide.

The longest time someone has been in space consecutively is 438 days aboard a space station. But crewed missions to Mars would probably take at least nine months just to get there, let alone stay or travel back (which could take up to three years). Mars is usually around 140 million miles from Earth based on its orbital path around the sun, with up to a 20-minute communication delay one way. If they experienced a medical emergency, astronauts likely wouldn't be able to access telemedicine instructions in time, and they couldn't turn back around for treatment.

A crewed mission to Mars would have to take all of their supplies with them before they left our planet. And when the first people heading to Mars set foot on the planet, they won't have access to the intense support astronauts receive when landing back on Earth.

Getting to Mars is only part of the challenge. We've been to space, but so far, humans have only ever sent robots to the Red Planet. We are making educated guesses at what Mars is like for living things. Earth analogues aren't able to truly replicate the closed, hostile conditions of the space environment, which can wreak havoc on astronauts' mental health. Desert research stations have an atmosphere, while the moon barely has one — and setting up that modest base was a huge mission in its own right. Weinersmith told me that scientists at polar research stations are isolated in remote, inhospitable environments, but they can “still open the door, take a deep breath, and not die.”

We're still pretty far from being able to breathe in Mars' atmosphere — but it would be nice to get there one day and simply not die.

Enter: space medicine.

Programs dedicated to figuring out how to get humans safely into space for long periods of time are popping up, and non-physician health care providers are getting in on the action too. UCLA is planning to launch a space nursing program and possibly space paramedic training. SpaceMed is a European master's program focused on human health in spaceflight and other extreme conditions.

Today, astronauts receive most of their care from Earth-based aerospace medicine physicians called flight surgeons through telemedicine. Aintablian envisions a future where health care providers directly accompany astronauts on their expedition-class missions, like to the moon or Mars. Artificial intelligence can act as a resource for the on-board flight surgeon, he predicted, and aid in the development of other technologies that will bring us closer to Mars.

Such technology is already in the works. Google recently collaborated with NASA to develop an AI system that could guide astronauts in diagnosing and treating medical conditions that arise in-flight when they lack access to telemedicine.

But the devil is in the details, Pandya told me. AI can help with just-in-time training for medical emergencies and diagnostics, but the data requirements would be massive. Since extremely few people end up in space — and the ones who do are overwhelmingly male — models might be trained on an unrepresentative dataset that could lead to inaccurate predictions of physiological changes in space. These kinks need to be worked out first.

Right now, there's a gendered gap in the research — so much so that Weinersmith told me there's never a line to the women's restroom at space settlement conferences. Human reproduction and development in space, as a result, is wildly understudied.

As far as we know, no human being has ever been to space while pregnant, and we don't know of any humans who have been conceived in space. We're going to learn a lot about reproduction on Earth from the first human space pregnancy and space birth, a prerequisite for a self-sustaining settlement on Mars. (Plus, space tourism companies are talking about hotels in space, and we know what people do in hotels.) Ideally, you want to have an idea of what will happen to someone giving birth in space before they actually go through it.

“What we're arguing is that we should do the research to understand those risks before we go out there because if there are massive risks, there usually are technological solutions for some of these,” Weinersmith said.

NASA will begin its second Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog this October, a year-long “mission” to Mars in a 3D-printed habitat at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it will collect behavioral health data on the effects of isolation and confinement. Scientists are conducting bed rest studies, which simulate the physiological effects of altered gravity and weightlessness. And as funding cuts transform the future of scientific research on Earth and beyond, space medicine researchers are among those advocating for continued investment in space and biomedical science.

Maedeh Mozneb, a biomedical engineer and project scientist in the Sharma Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told me that the ultimate goal is to send “avatars” of astronauts to space by taking their stem cells and creating 3D tissue cultures called organoids that represent different parts of their body — yes, miniature hearts, kidneys, and even brains made from Earth-dwelling humans. From there, scientists can determine personalized countermeasures such as workout plans or supplements tailored to each astronaut's needs, before they actually end up in space.

The hope, for those space medicine physicians like Pandya, is that in a spacefaring future, all medical disciplines — from neurology to radiology — will be represented in space medicine.

Space medicine research and practice isn't cheap. “I often get asked,” said Pandya, “‘Why are you spending money on space health when we have all of these problems on Earth?'” But that's the wrong way to think about it, she said.

Research conducted in space has already improved health on this planet. Advances in digital imaging for moon photography during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission later played a crucial role in CT scans and MRIs. Remote health monitoring tools designed for astronauts in space are now widely used in hospitals.

Space medicine research will also allow more people to go to space. In 2023, Pandya's team demonstrated the safety and functionality of a continuous glucose monitor in the spaceflight environment. This could eventually allow diabetics to check their blood sugar in space. It has implications for current astronauts, who can develop insulin resistance and pre-diabetes symptoms in longer-duration spaceflights. The child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes who wants to be an astronaut may actually have the chance to live out their dream now, and studying how the body metabolizes glucose in space helps us better understand health on Earth.

Then there are the diseases that take decades to unfold. Muscle loss in space can help scientists better understand how to treat conditions like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. On Earth, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's often aren't apparent until a person is in their late 60s.

In microgravity, said Shelby Giza, the director of business development at Space Tango, a company that facilitates automated research and development in microgravity conditions, “you can see that kind of disease output in a matter of weeks.” Research on these conditions can be conducted much faster — and hopefully accelerate the pace of medical breakthroughs.

The same can be said for cancer. Not all radiation exposures are made equal, and susceptibility to the harmful effects of radiation varies between individuals. Since the ISS is within the protection of Earth's magnetosphere, it's not the best comparison to the elevated radiation levels astronauts would face on Mars.

According to former NASA astronaut and biologist Kate Rubins, most astronauts are healthy people in their 30s and 40s, an age when cancer typically doesn't develop. Scientists must track astronauts for decades after their last spaceflight to see if cancer or other adverse health conditions occur. NASA's Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health program, which is voluntary for former astronauts and not specific to cancer alone, monitors the health status of people like Kelly and Rubins for the rest of their lives.

Exposure to space radiation is linked to developing cancer and degenerative diseases. To mitigate the risk of developing fatal cancers, NASA currently limits astronauts' spaceflight radiation exposure to 600 millisieverts (mSv) — roughly the equivalent of 60 CT scans of the torso and pelvis — over the course of their entire career. A 2023 NASA white paper estimates that a healthy astronaut will have a 33 percent increased risk of dying from cancer in their lifetime after a 1,000-day mission to Mars.

One of the next big things in space medicine “is probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,” Aintablian told me. “I do believe that with the amount of emphasis being placed on radiation protection, we're going to figure out ways to actually protect against significant amounts of radiation for the general public for multiple uses.”

While it's still relatively early days for the space pharma industry, life science companies are taking note, seeing microgravity as a platform for better drug discovery.

Like fiber optic cables used for telecommunications, some pharmaceuticals are better synthesized in microgravity conditions. Scientists can produce more uniform protein crystals in microgravity, which can improve drug injectability and reduce the need for refrigeration.

Raphael Roettgen, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of space biotech startup Prometheus Life Technologies, told me that organoids — those 3D cell models replicating human organs — grow more cleanly in space without Earth's gravity weighing them down. Derived from non-embryonic stem cells, these miniature organ models have tremendous potential for personalized medicine.

Roettgen hopes that human space organoids could reduce the need for animal testing in the near term. Eventually, he hopes that new organs could be regenerated for patients needing transplants. Since the new tissue would be derived from the patient's own stem cells, there would not be a risk of immune rejection, saving transplant patients astronomical costs and immense suffering. He estimates that liver regeneration and transplants from these organoids could become a reality in patients within the next 20 years.

Microgravity is an “expensive tool,” but an important one nonetheless, said Mozneb, who studies the effects of low earth orbit on stem cell differentiation. She hopes increasing commercialization and new technologies will significantly decrease the cost of launching experiments into orbit over the next 10 years.

What we already know about space medicine is a drop in the ocean of what we will discover as more people — astronauts and otherwise — venture into space.

“It's like if you were studying genetics back in the '90s,” Mozneb said. “Everything is a discovery.”

Klarna has paid more than $16 million to nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO.

The Swedish fintech has distributed $16.55 million to nonprofits founded by its chief executive officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski's wife over the last five years, according to the company's F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

Klarna has paid Nina Siemiatkowski's nonprofit Milkywire $2.75 million for its services since 2022, and a further $1 million to purchase carbon credits, which are permits to offset a portion of its greenhouse gas emissions through supporting projects that remove the equivalent amount of emissions.

It has also contributed $12.8 million to date to the WRLD Foundation, another nonprofit founded by the Klarna chief's wife, which channels donations to organizations identified and vetted by Milkywire on Klarna's behalf, the filing shows.

According to the WRLD Foundation's website, the climate impact-focused nonprofit was established in 2021 to raise awareness around sustainability, run educational programs, and support other nonprofits. Klarna's F-1 filing also notes that it allows customers to choose to make donations to the WRLD Foundation through its app and website as part of its environmental, social, and governance initiative.

Founded by Nina Siemiatkowski in 2018, Milkywire's website says it delivers climate impact solutions in areas including carbon removal, nature restoration, and protection. Klarna's F-1 filing also states that Milkywire provides it with other services and tools, including ""product development, digital integrations, websites, campaigns, content creation and other digital solutions.""

Klarna said in the filing that it underwent a thorough screening process before engaging Milkywire for its services and that it believes the fees paid to it are competitive. It added that the partnership was approved by its board of directors, but that Siemiatkowski recused himself from the process, in line with its conflict of interest policy.

Klarna declined to comment.

Klarna isn't the only company to engage with organizations linked to its executives' families. Google has previously invested in genetics firm 23andMe, which was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, who was married to Google cofounder Sergey Brin at the time.

Klarna's disclosure comes as it readies for its IPO next week, seeking to raise up to $1.72 billion in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday called demands that his administration release the Jeffrey Epstein files a distraction from his successes, as a group of victims of the notorious sex offender called for those documents to be publicly disclosed.

""This is a Democratic hoax that never ends,"" Trump told reporters at the White House when he was asked about the Epstein files.

Despite Trump's claim, his fellow Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has been leading a renewed charge in Congress to force the release of documents about Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Massie has filed a so-called discharge petition in the House of Representatives, which, if passed, would order the Department of Justice to release all documents related to Epstein.

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., held a press conference on Wednesday on Capitol Hill with a group of victims of Epstein and Maxwell.

In this article

Newsmax filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing conservative media giant Fox News of acting as a monopoly and suppressing its right-leaning competitors.

""Fox has sought to protect and expand its monopoly power in the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market by engaging in a suite of anticompetitive behaviors,"" attorneys for the outlet wrote in the federal suit in southern Florida.

The lawyers allege that Fox News coerces distributors into ""exclusionary and restrictive agreements,"" and that it has used ""intimidation tactics"" to hurt Newsmax — including hiring ""private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives.""

""But for Fox's anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier 'critical mass' for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property,"" they wrote in the suit.

A Fox News spokesperson curtly replied, ""Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.""

Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy is a former reporter for the New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who created Fox News.

""Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over,"" Ruddy said in a statement.

Newsmax wants a judge to issue a permanent injunction barring Fox's allegedly exclusionary agreements. 

It also seeks a judgment for three times the amount of damages that it has allegedly sustained by Fox, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest ""at the highest legal rate.""

The suit alleges that Fox, which has long been the most-watched cable news network on television, uses multiple strategies to ""coerce distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels.""

Fox either explicitly or tacitly makes access to its content conditional on distributors agreeing not to carry those channels, the suit alleges.

If they do, Fox imposes financial penalties on those distributors, by requiring them ""to carry and pay high fees for Fox's little-watched channels like Fox Business,"" according to Newsmax.

Fox also allegedly ""inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing."" 

""These tactics constitute unlawful restraints of trade and flow directly from Fox's unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market,"" the suit alleges.

""Fox's longstanding and ongoing practices have harmed and will further harm, competition and consumers in the United States.""

The antitrust complaint is the latest legal headache for Fox News, which has been the target of multiple high-profile and pricey lawsuits in recent years. 

In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to settle a defamation suit over false claims said on its air about Dominion Voting Systems rigging the 2020 presidential election.

A similar suit filed by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, is currently headed for trial. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion.

As a financial planner in the early 90s, William ""Bill"" Bengen confronted a question that still puzzles aspiring retirees today — ""When I get to retirement, how much can I spend?""

For Bengen's baby boomer clients at the time, there was little expert guidance on the subject.

Bengen decided to investigate himself by running numbers with a spreadsheet and a data book.

In October 1994, he published his findings in the Journal of Financial Planning, and what is now known as the 4% withdrawal rule for retirement was born.

Today's investors still confront the same retirement withdrawal dilemma, with the added risk of inflation, which Bengen calls the ""greatest enemy of retirees."" Bengen created the 4% rule during a stretch of relatively low, stable inflation.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

With his new book, ""A Richer Retirement: Supercharging the 4% Rule to Spend More and Enjoy More,"" Bengen is urging retirees to consider their entire financial circumstances when identifying their withdrawal strategy.

For some retirees, the good news is they may be able to withdraw more than 4%, according to Bengen.

Despite the 4% rule's popularity, some investors get it wrong, Bengen said.

The strategy does not call for a 4% withdrawal rate for every year in retirement.

Instead, the 4% withdrawal rate applies only to the first year. That rate is then adjusted for subsequent years to account for inflation, much like Social Security benefits get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, according to Bengen.

That COLA withdrawal approach is not the only strategy. Some people may choose to withdraw a fixed percentage or withdrawal amount. Others may prefer to take more money out early in retirement and cut back later, Bengen said.

""There's so many ways you can do it,"" Bengen said.

However, all retirees would benefit from keeping all of their financial circumstances in mind when identifying their personal strategy, he said.

Those factors include the length of their planning horizon, whether they have taxable or non-taxable assets, whether they want to leave money to heirs, how their assets are allocated, how often they plan to rebalance their portfolios, the size of their returns and when they plan to make their withdrawals, according to Bengen.

In the 90s, Bengen's research pointed to a maximum safe withdrawal rate of 4.15% for the first year of retirement.

That rate was based on several portfolio assumptions:

Today, the maximum safe withdrawal rate is 4.7%, according to Bengen's calculations.

Bengen calls that 4.7% rate ""Universal Safemax"" — the historical maximum safe withdrawal rate for all retirees.

Consequently, retirees who use a 4.7% withdrawal rate may be sacrificing on average about 35% per year in withdrawals, a ""considerable reduction in lifestyle,"" Bengen writes in his book.

Notably, Bengen's historical data shows some retirees may be able to take those withdrawals even higher, with the average Safemax rate at about 7.1%.

To be sure, because that 4.7% maximum safe withdrawal rate is based on past performance, it is not guaranteed that it will hold true for future retirees. Whether new retirees should rethink that withdrawal rate has been a subject of debate among experts.

Moreover, if retirees expect to leave money to heirs, they will have to cut their withdrawal rates accordingly, Bengen said.

In his book, Bengen provides tables to help prospective retirees roughly gauge their own personal maximum safe withdrawal rate.

To gauge their ""Safemax,"" retirees need to estimate their average inflation rate for their early retirement years as well as the expected Shiller CAPE (or cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings) ratio, a measure of stock market valuation that takes inflation-adjusted earnings into account.

A bear market — where stocks fall more than 20% — or high inflation early in retirement can affect the longevity of retirement portfolios, according to Bengen.

Higher inflation during retirement can be ""scary,"" Bengen said. While the record 8.7% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment that went into effect for 2023 may have seemed nice, the extra money was mostly claimed by higher prices, he said.

Retirees should be prepared to deal with inflation ""immediately and strongly if it occurs,"" Bengen said. For most people, that comes down to reducing their expenditures, he said.

Nearly two-thirds of retirees — 63% — worry that tariffs will push inflation higher than what Social Security cost-of-living adjustments may cover, according to a June Nationwide Retirement Institute survey.

While the latest government data shows there has been an uptick in inflation, with the Consumer Price Index at 2.7% on a 12-month basis as of July, that is still lower than the 9% rate that inflation gauge posted in June 2022.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Google seems to have escaped its antitrust case better than some feared.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the technology giant can keep its Chrome browser, but Google cannot have exclusive contracts and must share some search data. The ruling comes nearly a year after Mehta ruled that Google had a monopoly on internet search.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet popped after the ruling and were still up more than 5% before the bell this morning. Shares of Apple, to whom Google pays billions of dollars a year to be the default search engine on iPhones, also surged in extended trading.

Stocks kicked off the new trading month with a sharp slide yesterday. Investors appeared jolted by a pang of uncertainty following a federal appeals court's ruling that many of President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.

Here's what else to know:

Speaking of those tariffs, Trump said yesterday that he would ask the Supreme Court for an ""expedited ruling"" to overturn the appeals court's Friday decision.

Trump told reporters that his team's appeal to the Supreme Court could come today. He said the ""financial fabric of our country"" is at risk and that the U.S. could ""end up being a third-world country"" without his tariffs.

Elsewhere on the judicial front, a federal judged yesterday also blocked the Trump administration from using the National Guard and military to enforce laws in California.

Two major chains announced refreshed menus yesterday. (No, they weren't just new pumpkin spice-flavored items.)

McDonald's said it would bring back its Extra Value Meal, which offers a 15% discount compared to buying individual menu items separately. The deal was last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Starbucks also said it will launch protein-packed lattes and cold foam later this month. As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, the additions come as many Americans are increasingly focused on their protein intake.

Macy's shares surged more 12% before the bell this morning after the retailer struck a more positive note with investors this quarter.

The department store operator blew past earnings expectations from Wall Street for its second quarter, also raising its full-year outlook. That marks a turn from last quarter, when Macy's cut its full-year guidance and cited sales uncertainty tied to Trump's tariffs.

Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic's valuation just keeps climbing. Here are the big numbers from the buzzy AI company's latest funding round:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Quantum computing startup IQM raises $320 million as investors pile into the tech","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/quantum-computing-startup-iqm-raises-320-million.html","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:00:01 GMT","



Quantum computing firm IQM says it's raised $320 million of fresh funding to ramp up investments in technology and commercial growth.

The startup, which is headquartered in Espoo, Finland, was founded in 2018 by a team of scientists with the aim of building powerful quantum computers in Europe like the machines companies such as Google and IBM are building in the U.S.

Quantum computers are machines that use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers, which store information in bits (ones and zeroes). Quantum computers use quantum bits, or ""qubits,"" which can be zero, one or something in between — the aim being to process much larger volumes of data to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance.

IQM's funding round was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. cybersecurity-focused investment firm, while Finnish venture capital firm Tesi also invested. It gives the seven-year-old company ""unicorn"" status, meaning it's valued at $1 billion or more, according to co-CEO and co-founder Jan Goetz.

The investment underscores heightened investor buzz around the quantum computing space. Shares of publicly-listed quantum firms like IonQ and D-Wave Quantum have seen huge rallies in the past year. IonQ stock is up nearly 480% in the last 12 months, while D-Wave Quantum's shares have spiked over 1,400%.

""If you compare us directly to the companies which are Nasdaq-listed and take KPIs like people, revenue, patents, things like this, actually we are not behind. We can actually compete on this level,"" Goetz told CNBC in an interview.

Goetz said that IQM has come a long way since the early days of building the company. The company has 350 employees globally and has built out finance and sales operations as well as a factory in Espoo where it builds its machines.

There are now a number of European companies working on quantum computers, including IQM, Pasqual and Quandela. However, they are yet to achieve the scale of their U.S. counterparts.

In a speech earlier this year, the European Commission's tech chief Henna Virkkunen said that European quantum computing startups often struggle to scale due to a lack of private capital, noting that the European Union receives only 5% of global private funding compared to 50% for the U.S.

""If you just look at what is happening in Europe in these deep tech fields which come out of universities, naturally we have quite a lot of startups because we have so many good universities in Europe. But then it's really hard to make them grow,"" IQM's Goetz said.

""Now I think there is a risk of, if you have very high valuations in companies in the U.S., that they just drive M&A consolidation using their high share price."" Indeed, IonQ in June announced it would buy U.K. quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics for nearly $1.1 billion in a deal consisting primarily of stock.

IQM has now sold a total of 15 quantum computers to date. The company sells two main products: its flagship machine, Radiance, and a more affordable quantum computer called Spark, which the company sells to universities.

Going forward, IQM is planning to move beyond just hardware. Goetz said the firm will use part of the cash it's raised to develop a software platform aimed at making quantum computing accessible to developers who aren't experts in the field.

The other main goal for IQM is global expansion, with plans to scale up commercial and sales operations in the U.S. and Asia. Goetz said IQM has sold two systems in Asia so far — one in Taiwan and the other in South Korea — and recently sold its first machine in the U.S.

While an initial public offering may be an option for IQM further down the line, Goetz insisted the company has no IPO plans for the moment, adding there are still ""attractive routes"" in the private markets for raising capital.

The ultimate goal, he said, is to ""build a sustainable, profitable business and really make it a kind of company that's there to stay and to shape the future of compute over a long time.""

""We will do whatever is necessary to make that happen,"" Goetz added.

German startup DeepL on Wednesday said it was expanding beyond artificial intelligence-powered translation into general AI agents focused on businesses.

The term ""agent"" refers to an AI tool that can carry out tasks in the background in response to user prompts.

DeepL Agent is designed to complete ""repetitive, time-intensive tasks across a wide variety of functions"" according to the company. It can responds to natural langauge commands from a users. DeepL Agent can be used in various teams from human resources to marketing, the company added.

Agents or agentic AI have become buzzwords in the technology industry, underscoring how companies see how these digital assistants automating more mundane tasks. Companies such as Microsoft with Co-Pilot and Anthropic's Claude are products focused on the enterprise customer.

The move is a step beyond what DeepL, which is valued at $2 billion, has focused on since it was founded in 2017. It potentially pits the company against major AI players like Anthropic, OpenAI and Microsoft, which are targeting enterprise customers.

DeepL CEO Jarek Kutylowski told CNBC on Wednesday that the company's agent was a natural extension of its translation product.

""We found out that the technology is as capable of helping you whenever you're doing research or whatever you're doing,"" Kutylowski said.

""All of those tedious tasks in your office when you have to switch between different systems and take some data from one system, put it into another one, AI, and those autonomous agents, and the DeepL Agent in particular, can help solve so much better.""

DeepL's translation product is based on its self-developed large language models. Kutylowski said DeepL Agent is based on its own models, as well as on those available ""externally"" from other providers.

While there are a large number of companies advertising AI agents, the market is still in a very early stage. Overall investor interest in AI companies is meanwhile still high. Amazon-backed Anthropic on Tuesday announced a funding round that put the firm at a $183-billion post-money valuation.

Technology listings appear to be gathering steam, with both fintech firm Klarna and crypto exchange Gemini this week unveiling details of their upcoming initial public offerings.

Against this backdrop, CNBC asked Kutylowski if DeepL was considering an IPO, to which he responded: ""That's not a short term plan that we would be considering right now.""

Job openings ticked down in July to levels rarely seen since the Covid pandemic, bolstering fears of cooling in the labor market.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover report showed around 7.18 million listings in July, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. That's only the second reading under the 7.2 million level since the end of 2020.

Wednesday's print was the lowest since September 2024, when just over 7.1 million openings were reported. Outside of that blip lower last year, these job opening levels were last seen when the pandemic was causing an upheaval of the U.S. economy and labor force.

It also came in below expectations for 7.4 million openings from economists polled by Dow Jones.

That underscored rising concerns of weakening in the labor market, a trend that has shown up in anecdotal evidence for several months.

""This is a turning point for the labor market,"" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""It's yet another crack.""

""This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,"" Long added.

Weekly jobless claims data due on Thursday will offer the next round of insight into the health of the job market. Then, attention turns to the closely followed jobs report on Friday morning.

In this article

Alphabet shares rose 9% on Wednesday as investors viewed the result of Google's antitrust case as broadly favorable to the tech giant.

The U.S. Department of Justice had proposed a sort of breakup of Google, which included divesting its Chrome browser, in an antitrust case that began in September 2023.

While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the DOJ.

Google will not have to divest Chrome. The company can also still make payments to companies to preload products, but it cannot have exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing.

That means Google will still be able to pay Apple the billions of dollars it does to be the default search engine on iPhones. 

Apple shares were also higher.

""This is a monster win for Cupertino and for Google its a home run ruling that removes a huge overhang on the stock,"" Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Tuesday referring to Apple's headquarters in California.

Google has been facing rising competition to its core search business from the likes of Perplexity and OpenAI. But the company has so far fended off challenges with its advertising business still growing.

Google has pinned its hopes of becoming a major artificial intelligence player on Gemini, its suite of AI models and the chatbot that goes by the same name.

""Following today's announcement, we are increasingly constructive in the longer-term durability of Google's Search business and are raising our estimates accordingly,"" Ives said, adding that he now has a new price target of $245 for Alphabet's stock.

The ruling also means Google will not have to divest the Android operating system that it develops.

Android is seen as a key tool for Google to increase the number of users for Gemini given that around 70% of smartphones globally run the operating system, giving the U.S. technology giant an existing base of users.

Oops, something went wrong

The U.S. economy is staring down a debt-fueled heart attack within the next few years, but that will likely buoy cryptocurrency prices, according to veteran asset manager Ray Dalio.

In an interview with the Financial Times, the Bridgewater Associates founder linked a rise in the price of digital assets and gold to America's overwhelming debt burden, which isn't improving, according to a transcript of the conversation that he posted to X on Wednesday.

The U.S. government is spending more money than it's taking in, while servicing enormous amounts of debt. And as the government borrows more to cover budget shortfalls, while managing its existing burden, creditors could eventually cause trouble, Dalio said.

Creditors will sell U.S. debt as they grow worried about its ability to function as a store of value, he said. That will likely put the Federal Reserve in a tough position, Dalio added, where it has to decide between rising interest rates and a debt default crisis or printing money to buy debt and “try to hold real interest rates down, which will lower the value of money.”

The billionaire, who foresaw the 2008 financial meltdown, described it as the ""traumatic last phase” of a “big debt cycle,” where over the course of history, excessive debt has culminated in an economic contraction and systematic crisis.

To that point, Dalio said that deregulation isn't a threat to governments' use of fiat currencies in stabilizing economies or facilitating international trade. It is rather unhealthy debt levels, he said, that are eroding the status of currencies like the greenback across several sovereigns.

“I do see the dollar and the other reserve currency governments' bad debt situations as threatening to their appeals as reserve currencies and storeholds of wealth, which is what has been contributing to the rises in gold and cryptocurrency prices,” he said.

Bitcoin and gold have surged this year. The precious metal's price has increased 38% year-to-date, hitting an all-time high of $3,530 per ounce Wednesday, according to Trading Economics. Bitcoin's price has increased 20% to $112,000 over the same period, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Dalio's latest assessment of the U.S. economy follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, a federal framework for stablecoins. Dalio said that a decline in the purchasing power of U.S. Treasuries “shouldn't produce any systematic risk” for them, if they are well regulated.

Dalio said cryptocurrencies resemble hard currencies, partly due to their so-called tokenomics. Bitcoin's total supply, for example, is capped at 21 million, while the government can theoretically print an unlimited amount of money.

“Crypto is now an alternative currency that has its supply limited, so, all things being equal, if the supply of dollar money rises and/or the demand for it falls, that would likely make crypto an attractive alternative currency,” he said.

Trump Bros' American Bitcoin Mining Stock Soars, Then Plunges During Public Debut

In late July, Dalio urged investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin and gold. It's a macroeconomic hedge amid increasing risks in bond and equity markets, he said.

Dalio expressed a preference for gold, arguing that a central bank is unlikely to adopt the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization as a reserve currency. Still, the outlook for some fiat currencies is bleak, he said in the interview with the Financial Times.

“I think that most fiat currencies, especially those with large debts, will have problems being effective storeholds of wealth and will go down in value relative to hard currencies,” he said, pointing to parallels between the coming years and two periods in the 20th century.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The crypto markets are booming, but the most recent wave of enthusiasm isn't just from small-time traders or dabblers curious about memecoins. Big financial institutions are leaning in. Etherealize, a startup launched in January, hopes to convince Wall Street to dive even further into crypto, and it's raised $40 million to build out products and infrastructure on Ethereum for financial institutions. 

Longtime crypto venture capitalists Electric Capital and Paradigm led the fundraising round. Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of Ethereum, and the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to developing the protocol, also helped fund Etherealize with an initial grant. The raise was for equity and token warrants, Vivek Raman, cofounder and CEO of Etherealize, told Fortune.





“Now's the time to really, really mobilize,” Raman said. “I think that we have the best window of first possible adoption that I've ever seen.” 





As the Trump administration ushers in a new era of pro-crypto regulation, traditional financial institutions have started to more publicly explore blockchain technology. Big banks are considering launching their own stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. And asset managers are putting financial products on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.





“The window is now,” Raman said.




The Etherealize CEO isn't speaking just as a crypto booster—but as a veteran of traditional finance who's spent years at Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. “There aren't institutional builders that are willing to go through and walk through all of their processes and pain points,” he said. “I want to do that. I actually think that stuff is fun.”





In August 2024, Raman received a grant from Ethereum cofounder Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation to talk with a swath of Wall Street executives about if and how financial institutions wanted to use Ethereum.





“It was market discovery,” he said. “We were going in, making sure the market wanted Ethereum.”





The market spoke, and in early 2025, Raman launched Etherealize, a portmanteau of “Ethereum” and “realize,” along with Danny Ryan, a longtime Ethereum developer and researcher; Grant Hummer, another traditional finance veteran and Ethereum booster; and Zach Obront, an Ethereum security engineer.





“The regulatory pendulum can only swing so far,” Ryan said. In other words, he anticipates that the permissive regulatory regime under Trump will eventually subside.




That's why he, Raman, and their 14 employees are focused on onboarding as many Wall Street institutions as possible. Instead of just advocating for Ethereum, they're building out products and infrastructure that financial institutions can use to streamline what Raman calls “Stone Age technology.”





While the Etherealize CEO declined to give specifics, he said they were focused on tokenizing, or putting in blockchain wrappers for, financial assets like mortgages, credit, and other fixed-income products—among other projects.





“They trade over the phone, and they settle using fax machines, and they use wire transfers,” said Raman, in reference Wall Street traders. “If you digitize and put [assets] on a blockchain, it's a step function of improvement.”

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds surpassed their Ethereum counterparts in terms of investment flows on Tuesday.

According to SoSoValue data, spot bitcoin ETFs saw $332.7 million in net inflows on Tuesday, led by $132.7 million moving into Fidelity's FBTC and $72.8 million into BlackRock's IBIT. Funds from Grayscale, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck and Invesco also saw net inflows yesterday.

Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs reported a total daily net outflow of $135.3 million. Fidelity's FETH saw $99.2 million in outflows and Bitwise's ETHW recorded $24.2 million in negative flows.

""The shift of ETF inflows from ETH to BTC suggests institutional investors may be rebalancing portfolios to capitalize on Bitcoin's perceived stability amid macroeconomic uncertainties,"" said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. 

Ethereum ETFs outperformed bitcoin ETFs in August, as analysts pointed to a ""rotational shift"" toward Ethereum, driven by its yield-generating capabilities, improving regulatory clarity, and growing corporate treasury adoption.

While bitcoin ETFs recorded a monthly net outflow of $751 million in August, Ethereum ETFs saw $3.87 billion flow into the funds during the period.

""In the short term, this could bolster bitcoin's price support near $108k and reduce selling pressure, though Ethereum's stronger yield prospects and Digital Asset Treasuries growth may sustain its outperformance into year-end,"" Ruck told The Block.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin rose 0.55% in the past day to $110,943 while Ethereum dropped 1% to trade at $4,327 as of 11:45 p.m. on Tuesday.

Ondo Finance, a blockchain protocol focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), is rolling out a new platform that allows non-U.S. investors to access over 100 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on Ethereum, according to a press release viewed by The Defiant. The protocol says it has plans to expand the number of tokenized stocks and funds to more than 1,000 by the end of the year.

The platform, called Ondo Global Markets, aims to provide 24/7 exposure to U.S. equities for qualified investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, and Latin America, according to the release. Those who want to mint, redeem, and transfer tokenized shares would have to complete standard customer due diligence, the firm said.

At launch, the platform will focus on liquid stocks like Apple and Tesla, along with popular ETFs from Fidelity and BlackRock. Over time, Ondo says it plans to add bonds, international equities, and other publicly traded instruments.

According to the project's FAQ page, the tokenized versions of shares are backed by the underlying U.S. securities, held at registered broker-dealers, though the tokens “do not provide their holders with rights to hold or receive their respective underlying assets.”

A spokesperson for Ondo Finance told The Defiant that the firm has decided to start with U.S. public equities “because they are the most in-demand, liquid markets in the world.” Comparing tokenized stocks to USD-pegged stablecoins and other tokenized RWAs, the spokesperson said: 

For the latest initiative, Ondo Global Markets also integrates with crypto wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols, using Chainlink oracles for pricing data and LayerZero for cross-chain interoperability. The company said support for BNB Chain and Solana is also coming soon, though it didn't specify a timeframe.

Lending protocol Morpho will also support select tokenized assets as collateral to borrow against and lend within a dedicated vault managed by Gauntlet, Ondo told The Defiant.

The Ondo spokesperson also said that tokenized stocks deliver the same total-return exposure as the underlying assets, noting that “each token mirrors the economic performance of its underlying asset—including price movements, dividends, and corporate actions—so holders participate in the same economic results as if they owned the asset directly.”

Ondo Finance, which boasts around $1.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama, is the latest firm to jump into the tokenized stock game. 

Earlier this week, crypto exchange Kraken announced that it was partnering with Backed to expand the firm's tokenized stock product, xStocks, to Ethereum as well. xStocks are already available on three other blockchain networks — Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron.

Key Takeaways

Binance announced it will delist three altcoins within days, pulling the plug on their trading pairs. The news immediately sent the tokens crashing, with each suffering double-digit losses.

In this analysis, CCN explains why Binance chose to delist these projects. We also examine whether the altcoins can mount a recovery, or if this decision ends their relevance in the market.

According to the Binance delisting news, the affected altcoins are BakeryToken (BAKE), Self Chain (SLF), and Hifi Finance (HIFI).

The exchange confirmed that trading pairs for these tokens will be removed on Sept. 17.

Binance explained that it decided to delist them after a review showed the projects no longer meet the exchange's high standards and industry requirements.

“Based on our most recent reviews, we have decided to delist and cease trading on all spot trading pairs for the following token(s) at 2025-09-17 03:00 (UTC): BakeryToken (BAKE). Hifi Finance (HIFI), Self Chain (SLF),” Binance revealed. 

Following the delisting news, BAKE's price plunged 25%, SLF tumbled 23%, and HIFI shed 17% in the past 24 hours. These declines highlight how quickly markets react when Binance pulls support for a token.

But what's next for the altcoins after this unfortunate development? Let's find out.

For those unfamiliar, BAKE is the native token of the decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) BakeryToken. Built as a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain, BAKE enjoyed a strong run during the 2021 bull market, climbing to an all-time high of $8.48.

Fast forward to today, and BAKE has lost 99% of its value amid fading demand. Technically, the daily chart shows a persistent downtrend since February, with the token posting lower highs and lower lows before forming a falling wedge.

Normally, a falling wedge can hint at a bullish reversal. But in this case, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) has slipped into negative territory, pointing to stronger selling pressure.

This makes it more likely that BAKE continues to crash, potentially dropping to $0.049.

Still, if sentiment shifts and a turnaround occurs, BAKE's price could attempt to break above resistance and rally toward $0.15.

SLF is another token hit hard by Binance's delisting news. One year ago, the Self Chain token traded at an all-time high of $0.83. Today, it has collapsed by 95%, slipping to $0.040, a slight bounce from the new all-time low it touched earlier in the day.

On the daily chart, SLF trades below a key resistance line. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has plunged to -0.52, signaling strong capital outflows and weak demand.

At the same time, the Bollinger Bands (BB) have tightened, a sign that volatility is compressing and a big move could be imminent.

Currently, the token sits in oversold territory. The BB contraction suggests a breakout is looming.

If buying pressure returns, SLF could slowly recover toward $0.19. But if selling pressure intensifies, the decline may deepen, pushing the altcoin to fresh lows.

Last on the list of altcoins caught in Binance's delisting sweep is HIFI. Since the news broke, the token's price has dropped 20%, while trading volume has spiked over 330%.

This surge in activity alongside falling prices shows that the downtrend remains strong, with sellers firmly in control.

From a technical perspective, HIFI's price is trapped in a descending triangle.

The MACD has slipped into negative territory, but the 12 EMA (blue) and 26 EMA (orange) converge, suggesting that the correction could be nearing exhaustion.

That doesn't necessarily mean a breakout is next. Instead, HIFI will likely consolidate between $0.074 and $0.10 in the near term.

However, if buyers step in and treat the current levels as a dip-buying opportunity, the token could rally toward $0.26.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin dominance has retreated from its 62% peak to 55%, marking one of our favorite metrics for gauging market rotation dynamics and suggesting early signs of capital flowing into alts.

Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin's market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap, serving as a key indicator of whether investors are favoring Bitcoin's ""safe haven"" status or seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins.

This 700 basis point decline from the cycle peak is an encouraging setup for altcoins heading into the fourth quarter, with Ethereum and Solana showing early signs of renewed interest as institutional and retail capital begin to rotate into alternative assets.



Digital asset treasures (DATs) are headlining this push for Solana and Ethereum with multiple teams working to raise capital and buy up assets through a publicly traded entity. From the 2021/2022 cycle, Bitcoin dominance fell below 40%, suggesting there is significant runway for altcoin rallies if market conditions continue to favor risk assets.

The current 55% level positions the market in a transitional phase where altcoins can begin establishing momentum without requiring extreme speculative fervor.

However, a critical factor to monitor will be whether altcoins can capture genuine spot market demand, rather than primarily benefiting from derivatives-driven momentum. With substantial institutional capital potentially flowing into digital asset treasuries and ETF products, the question remains whether this buying power will translate into direct token purchases that drive sustainable price appreciation.

Digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is bringing its stock onto blockchain rails as equity tokenization is gaining steam.

The Nasdaq-listed company has partnered with blockchain firm Superstate to make its Class A common stock available as tokens on the Solana SOL$211.31 network through Superstate's Opening Bell platform. The arrangement preserves the full rights of SEC-registered equity while allowing investors to hold and transfer shares on-chain, the firms said.

Tokenization of traditional assets has gained traction across the financial sector as firms experiment with moving equities, bonds and money-market funds onto blockchain rails. A slew of tokenized equity products hit the market in the past few months predominantly for EU investors, including by Robinhood, Gemini with Dinari, and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance. However, some offerings drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.

Unlike synthetic or wrapped tokenized stocks that operate without issuer involvement, Galaxy's shares are issued directly on-chain and tracked by Superstate as a transfer agent, recording changes to the shareholder register instantly as tokens move between verified wallets.

This approach seeks to combine compliance with blockchain features such as fast settlement, transparency and around-the clock-availability, the firms said.

""We're proud to be working with Superstate to help lay the groundwork for an on-chain capital market that bridges traditional equities with next-generation infrastructure,"" Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said in a statement. ""Our goal is a tokenized equity that brings the best of crypto – transparency, programmability and composability – into the traditional world.""

The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (“GENIUS”) Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. The GENIUS Act is part of a broader push to accelerate the development of emerging technologies in the U.S., from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. That same push is showing up in the patent world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles.

Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain patents. In Ex Parte David L. Newman, the PTAB reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. § 101 and provided some useful discussion of how the USPTO (and patent applicants) should approach blockchain-related patents. The claims at issue relate to “securely storing data across a network in a multi-dimensional distributed database” in order to “process[] license contracts, including computing proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian addresses.”

The Examiner had rejected the claims as directed to the abstract idea of “payment, distribution, and pricing for two users bound by a contractual relationship,” concluding that the additional elements in the claims do not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application. In the Examiner's view, the invention simply used “a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea.” The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging that the claims involved an abstract idea because “[i]t is well settled that commercial interactions involving payment transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human activity.”

However, the Board drew the line at step 2 of the Alice analysis. Unlike the Examiner, the Board determined that the claims integrate the abstract idea into a practical application “by improving the technical functioning of the recited blockchain by transforming it into a multi-dimensional database slidechain that allows for the execution and simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain.” In other words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself operates. As the Board explained, the claims “recite[] steps that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain… [and] uses the recited abstract idea in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a particular technological environment.”

Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based on 35 U.S.C. § 101. Specifically, applicants should use their specification to clearly articulate how their invention improves “the performance of a computer” and/or “the functionality of the blockchain and the processing thereof.”

The Proskauer Intellectual Property Team is continuing to monitor the evolving guidance on patent eligibility of emerging technologies. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader emerging technology space.

ATLANTA, Sept. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vaycaychella, Inc. (OTC Pink: VAYK) (""VAYK"") today announced the revival of its cryptocurrency strategy, amid the growing trend among investors and public companies to apply ""crypto treasury"" to the assets controlled by public companies. This initiative aims to monetize intangible assets of historic landmarks valued at up to $10 to $20 million.

This strategy is part of the company's comprehensive business plan to offer a one-stop service solution for the $64 billion short-term rental industry. The business plan consists of three integrated services: property renovation, particularly of historic landmark properties; short-term rental management, enhanced with AI tools; and an innovative financing model involving the application of a crypto treasury strategy.

""We have always been pioneers in exploring the potential of applying cryptocurrency strategies to daily business operations,"" stated Jason Armstrong, CEO of Vaycaychella. ""In March 2022, the previous management acquired Definancial, Inc., a technology firm developing cryptocurrency exchange solutions. After the new management team took over in 2024, we planned to release crypto-based Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on our newly acquired rights to a $2.5 million property, which is a nationally registered historic landmark. However, the NFT market was at a low point, and we had to postpone our cryptocurrency business.""

""Now is the time to launch it,"" declared Armstrong.

The concept is to leverage the unique and fungible cultural value of historic landmark buildings while renovating these buildings into boutique short-term rentals (such as Airbnb). The company will sell NFT tokens, each minted using unique visual records of the renovation process of the historic landmarks, with a bonus feature of a one-night free stay at these buildings after they are renovated into Airbnb properties. Furthermore, the proceeds from selling these NFTs will be managed under a cryptocurrency treasury account, from which the potential gains will be split between the company and the NFT holders.

""One of the great features of utilizing NFTs and a crypto treasury is that they will not dilute the value of current shareholders, but will add an extra source of profit for them,"" added Armstrong. ""These NFTs and cryptocurrencies will monetize intangible historic and cultural value, which is not reflected in our current balance sheet and therefore has not been used to increase our current shareholders' equity value. Once monetized, they will not only benefit the NFT holders but also may generate significant revenue for current shareholders.""

Armstrong projected that the NFT and its linked crypto treasury account would become operational in a few months. The first group of NFTs will be released on basis of the historic landmark Rufus Rose House in downtown Atlanta.  Meanwhile, the company is in discussions with potential partners to add more historic landmark buildings to its NFT and crypto treasury strategy, aiming to bring the total portfolio value to between $10 and $20 million.

Press Release

September 1, 2025Asteria Corporation (Japan)Lib Work Co., Ltd.(Japan)

Tokyo — September 1, 2025 — Asteria Corporation (Headquarters: Shibuya-ku, Tokyo; President & Representative Director: Yoichiro Hirano; Securities Code: 3853) and Lib Work Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Yamaga, Kumamoto Prefecture; President & Representative Director: Chikara Seguchi; Securities Code: 1431) announce a business partnership to develop NFT infrastructure and begin construction of a Housing Asset Digital Platform to prevent tampering with 3D-Printed house design data and other information.

Additionally, by adopting Asteria's “Asteria Warp” platform, Lib Work plans to accept payments with JPYC, a Japanese yen-backed stablecoin, for their 3D-Printed houses and other construction projects.

The global 3D-Printed housing market is rapidly expanding because of its ability to reduce the use of costly building materials and address labor shortages in the construction industry. According to Lib Work's research, the market is expected to grow to approximately ¥221 trillion by 2034—roughly 100 times its current size. However, 3D-Printed housing design data faces the following digital-specific challenges:

Challenges with Design Documents and Data for 3D-Printed Housing(Digital-Specific Risks)

•High risk of unauthorized copying and tampering, requiring advanced management to ensure legitimacy and authenticity

•Repair histories directly impact asset valuations during sales and investments, yet they are not properly recorded and shared

To address these challenges, Lib Work began exploring a digital platform that records, certifies, and distributes design documents, construction data, and repair histories as NFTs. They have also partnered with Asteria, a company that possesses blockchain technology for tamper-proof certification used in shareholder meetings and municipal documents, to begin building a Housing Asset Digital Platform.

By combining Asteria's Web3 and NFT technology and expertise with Lib Work's 3D-Printed housing development know-how, they aim to build the world's first* platform that ensures housing asset reliability from both architectural and digital perspectives.

*Based on Lib Work research

The Housing Asset Digital Platform aims to ensure the authenticity and reliability of housing assets and maintain and enhance their long-term value by recording and certifying 3D-Printed housing design, construction, and repair data as NFTs on the blockchain.

NFTs utilize blockchain technology to guarantee the uniqueness and tamper-proof nature of digital data. Applying this to housing provides the following new ownership benefits and added values:

1.Prevention of unauthorized copying of design documents (tampering is prevented by storing design document data on the blockchain)

2.Proof of authenticity (issuing digital certificates via NFT)

3.Keeping track of repair histories (transparent housing lifecycle management)

4.Asset value creation through serial numbering

5.Creating new value circulation for housing assets by centrally managing and distributing previously fragmented housing data

6.Metaverse expansion (utilizing design and construction data in digital spaces)

Lib Work also plans to accept payments using JPYC, a Japanese yen-backed stablecoin, by leveraging blockchain infrastructure and Asteria Warp.

Asteria and Lib Work aim to expand the use of NFTs to general housing and create new value circulation for housing assets through the development of the Housing Asset Digital Platform.

Lib Work will also franchise and license its 3D-Printed home technologies, establishing a new model of scale in the housing industry. As a group, they are targeting a total of 10,000 3D-Printed houses by 2040, with this project serving as crucial infrastructure development toward achieving that goal.

Furthermore, Lib Work plans to expand its housing assets globally in the future by accepting USDT and USDC, two USD-backed stablecoins, to allow for international transactions.

Asteria is a software development company that provides products and services that “connect” systems, people, things and intentions based on the concept of “Connecting the World with Software”. Its flagship product, “ASTERIA Warp” is middleware which integrates data from different systems and cloud services without coding and has been adopted by over 10,000 companies. Other products include digital storage app “Handbook X”, mobile app builder “Platio” and no-code AI/IoT platform “Gravio”. By offering these products, Asteria promotes digital transformation (DX) and helps organizations improve their business process efficiency. Asteria is also engaged in raising awareness of new technologies and their value and fosters innovation through its involvement in the launch of Blockchain Collaborative Consortium and No Code Promotion Association.

Under the slogan “Changing lifestyles, changing the world, creating the future,” Lib Work operates diversified businesses beyond residential construction to realize its mission of “creating innovation in housing through sustainability and technology.”

Lib Work employs targeted customer acquisition strategies in its digital marketing through specialized sites like “e-tochi.net,” a land listing website, and its “Lib Work ch” YouTube channel. Lib Work also operates subscription-based platforms for construction companies nationwide like My Home Robo (a system that proposes plans for new homes) and IP licensing of the “niko and … EDIT HOUSE” house products co-developed with ALC/Adastria Lifestyle Creation. Additionally, Lib Work continues to work towards a sustainable future through the full-scale deployment of its sustainable 3D printed housing.

Introduction 

The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. What started as a way to prove ownership of digital art has grown into a foundation for real-world applications across industries. From collectibles to real estate, NFT smart contract development is now pushing boundaries and opening doors to a tokenized economy.

Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent.

The Birth of NFT Smart Contracts

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. The real magic happens through smart contract development, which encodes the rules of ownership and transfer.

Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today.

NFTs in Digital Art

Digital artists were the first to feel the power of NFT smart contracts. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. Every sale, every royalty, and every ownership transfer was automated through blockchain smart contract development.

The brilliance was not just in ownership—it was in ensuring authenticity. No one could copy and claim the artwork as theirs because the blockchain recorded every detail of ownership. For artists, this meant empowerment; for buyers, it meant trust. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention.

NFT Smart Contracts Beyond Art and Gaming

While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Industries are finding creative uses for NFTs:

Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds.

Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs.

Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey.

Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access.

This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. As a result, companies see NFTs not just as collectibles, but as defi smart contract development tools for finance, business agreements, and beyond.

Technological Advancements in NFT Smart Contracts 

The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. For example:

Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells.

Fractionalization: High-value assets are split into smaller, affordable shares.

Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development.

Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools.

This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. It's not just about ownership anymore—it's about trust, automation, and innovation.

Future of NFT Smart Contracts 

The future of NFTs looks beyond art and gaming. Imagine a world where:

These are not distant dreams. With blockchain smart contract development, industries are preparing for decentralized systems where human trust is replaced with coded transparency. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution.

The Role of NFT Marketplace Development Companies

Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. These companies design and audit NFT smart contracts, ensuring smooth transactions and secure ownership transfers.

For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. From defi to niche NFT solutions, these firms bring vision to reality.

In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development.

Conclusion 

NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Their future will shape how we own, trade, and trust both digital and physical assets.

Choosing the right partner makes all the difference. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that helps businesses navigate this revolution. With expertise in smart contract development, they provide reliable, scalable, and creative solutions for enterprises that want to lead in the digital era.

The evolution of NFT smart contracts shows us one thing: innovation thrives when technology meets trust. And the right company ensures that the journey is both secure and successful.

Introduction

Imagine a world where business agreements execute themselves the moment conditions are met—no middlemen, no delays, no hidden risks. That's the promise of smart contracts. At their simplest, smart contracts are digital agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute once certain conditions are fulfilled, ensuring transparency and trust.

Introduction 

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is consulting on draft changes to how we handle data protection complaints. It sets out our proposed framework to assess and determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint. This will allow us to focus on cases where we can have the most impact and improve data protection compliance. 

People have a statutory right to lodge a data protection complaint with the ICO if they think there has been an infringement of their data protection rights under the UK GDPR. 

In recent years we have seen a significant increase in data protection complaints. In 2023/24, we received 39,721 complaints. In 2024/25 this rose to 42,881 and current forecasts indicate that this could increase to somewhere between 45,000 and 55,000 if the current trend continues. 

The ever-increasing demand for our services is impacting our ability to respond quickly and effectively. We want to consider new ways of handling data protection complaints. 

The Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) places new requirements on organisations to have a complaints process specifically for data protection related issues. Once the provision comes into force, we would expect that more complaints will be resolved by organisations without the involvement of the ICO. 

If people do bring their complaint to the ICO, we want to provide the most effective service given the finite resources we have. That means looking at our own approach to handling complaints. 

We are proposing changes to our processes to better support people who have experienced harm and focus our resources on those cases where we can have the biggest impact. Organisations will also benefit from reduced routine engagement on lower-risk cases, enabling them to focus on the most significant concerns. Our goal is not just to manage demand, but to raise standards around customer experience and regulatory effectiveness. 

We have developed a draft framework that we propose to use to determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint. We are also proposing new reporting mechanisms to enable us to monitor complaint volumes across specific organisations and sectors. This will allow us to identify trends or themes which may benefit from other types of regulatory action. 

The approach outlined in this consultation would ensure that every complaint contributes towards our understanding of an organisation's information rights practices, while allowing us to focus our resources on the most significant risks. It also strengthens our ability to identify systemic issues earlier. 

It reflects our ambition to be a strategic regulator – one that considers every complaint, responds proportionately and uses the insight gained to drive improvements in data protection practices. 

We need to do things differently and transforming our processes will enable us to target our resources to support people's information rights in a way that has a positive impact and addresses the areas that cause the greatest harm. 

Please respond to the ideas in our consultation to help shape the process. You can respond to the consultation via our survey on Citizen Space. 

The questions are split into the following sections: 

Section 1: About you. 

Section 2: Your views on our approach. 

Section 3: Questions to assess the impact of our proposed approach.   

Section 4: Any additional comments about the framework.  

The consultation will remain open until 23:59 on Friday 31 October 2025. We may not consider responses received after this deadline.

The Information Commissioner's Office and the Afghan Spreadsheet Data Breach","https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2025/09/03/david-erdos-how-exposed-the-information-commissioners-office-and-the-afghan-spreadsheet-data-breach/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

On 17 August 2023 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) put the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on broad notice about the devastating failure of data protection that is now generally known as the Afghan data breach (although sadly there have been many others). This involved the illegal release of some 33,000 lines of gravely sensitive personal spreadsheet data which put almost 100,000 people – up to 25,000 Afghans applying for relocation to the UK as well as their family members, many of whom were also identified in the data – at grave risk of harm and may even have resulted in some of their deaths. However, despite details of this egregious and illegal exposure of data subjects being immediately required by law and subsequently coming into view, the ICO decided not to carry out any investigation and therefore not to take any enforcement action, such as issuing a fine, enforcement notice or even a mere reprimand. Astonishingly, the ICO also made no contemporaneous record whatsoever of the rationale for these critical decisions or even the bare fact that they had been made. Given the exacting supervisory requirements set down in the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), these subsequent (in)actions expose further serious failings in UK data protection. These failings point to the need for an in-depth independent investigation of UK data protection regulation, which should also explore the serious gap between the UK GDPR's promises and the ICO's hyper-discretionary and hyper-selective track-record and approach and what might be done to address this. What follows merely provides a partial indication of some of the particular issues which arise in relation to Afghan spreadsheet data breach itself. It is based on the (still very limited) information which has come into public view so far and builds on a previous blog post on the same subject posted last month.

Lack of Contemporaneous Record Keeping

This post draws primarily on an ICO memorandum which seeks to summarise the ICO's involvement with the Afghan spreadsheet data breach and to provide a justification for the various decisions made between 17 August 2023 and 15 July 2025. However, it is vital to emphasise that the memorandum in question is completely post-hoc. It was entirely written after 15 July 2025 and was not able to draw on any “internal record of the ICO's actions and decision making regarding this data breach” as there is none. Ab initio, this complete lack of contemporaneous documentation constitutes a significant failure of demonstrable compliance with the data protection framework (in this case, the duties of the regulator as opposed to those of controllers and processors) and is particularly problematic given both the seriousness of the breaches requiring attention and the legally aberrant decision not to take any regulatory action. Moreover, no reasonable justification is provided for it even post-hoc. Thus, although the memorandum invokes the super-injunction which the MoD obtained on 1 September 2023, this is contradicted by its acknowledgment that the super-injunction expressly made clear that it “did not prevent the ICO from taking any steps in private that the ICO consider[ed] appropriate”. Similarly, although it is argued that any “written notes” would have “likely necessitated the inclusion of information which was classified as Secret or Top Secret”, its statement that this rendered the ICO “unable” to take such notes is again contradicted by its express acknowledgment that this would merely have created “additional handling difficulties”. Any such difficulties must be considered part of the ICO's normal terrain given its legal mandate to ensure independent supervision even in highly sensitive contexts, such as those involving national security, which are also precisely the contexts that often raise the most serious data protection concerns. It is also striking that the memorandum clearly reveals that these sorts of concerns did not prevent the MoD responding to enquiries on this matter to ICO email addresses.

Failure to Notify within 72 Hours and Effect of Super-Injunction

At least parts of the memorandum's analysis of the substance of the matter are unfortunately also misleading. Thus, although it states that the MoD did tell the ICO on 17 August 2023 that it had experienced a “serious data breach”, which was two days after it itself became aware of the February 2022 loss of the Afghan spreadsheet data, the memorandum goes on to incorrectly claim that the ICO was therefore “notified within 72 hours”, “as required by Article 33(1) of the UKGDPR”.  The same claim was made by the ICO in its initial statement on the data breach released on 15 July 2025. Although breach notification is certainly mandated under Article 33(1), Article 33(3) explicitly states that such notification must “at least”:

(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

In contrast, the memorandum is clear that on 17 August 2023 the MoD merely communicated the fact that a serious breach had occurred, made clear that “sensitivity” prevented any further information being provided at this time and stated that a face-to-face meeting was necessary. Three weeks passed until an (unnamed) ICO official attended an 8 September 2023 meeting where he was served with the 1 September 2023 super-injunction and, according to the memorandum, provided with “an overview of what was known by MoD at that time”.  However, even this failed to constitute an (albeit delayed) Article 33 breach notification as it is also explicitly stated that the “rationale” for “obtaining the injunction was not shared” and yet we now know that the MoD had already offered express justification to the court that the super-injunction was a critical measure to mitigate the breach's adverse effects on the data subjects. Unfortunately, it remains unclear when a full Article 33(1) notification was carried out, if at all.

The super-injunction itself prevented discharge of the default obligation to notify the breach to any affected individual data subject (under Article 34) and was cited by the ICO as a central reason for it holding itself unable to investigate the incident or to keep internal records. This stark reality, alongside the clarity of the Article 33 requirements (as well as the fact that the proceedings did include two representatives of media organisations), renders it hugely problematic that the MoD did not inform the ICO in advance of its intention to seek the super-injunction (or explain its rationale even well after it had been granted), that the ICO did not object to this and, assuming the super-injunction really was an impediment to the demonstrable performance of its regulatory functions, that the ICO did not seek any variation of it from the court.

Lack of any ICO Investigation 

The ICO's lack of forensic engagement must be related to a decision made on 5 December 2023 – apparently after just one further meeting with the MoD – that it was not “in a position to independently investigate the incident”. This decision was by made by Stephen Bonner, Deputy Commissioner (Regulatory Supervision), and was briefed “at a high level” to the Information Commissioner John Edwards who apparently did not demur or seek further information. The twin justifications proffered, namely the super-injunction and the Secret or Top Secret information classification, mirror those for failing to keep any internal records and are similarly problematic. As regards the security classification, the memorandum is clear that it merely created “additional handling difficulties”. Meanwhile, the super-injunction explicitly stated that the ICO remained free to take “any steps in private” that it considered “appropriate” and this fact is clearly integral to the justification of the ICO not seeking any alternation of its terms. If the ICO understood the super-injunction differently, then it was manifestly incumbent on it to approach the court for an amendment.

As has been clear at least since C-311/18 Schrems (2020), the ICO's “primary responsibility is to monitor the application of the [UK] GDPR and to ensure its enforcement” (at [108]). The ICO is not permitted to delegate this twin responsibility or tasks to the very controller under scrutiny as it is statutorily obliged to ensure that it “act with complete independence in performing [its] tasks” (UK GDPR, art 52). It is also “required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]) and it therefore follows that it must intervene when put on notice about a prima facie “clear breach” of data protection of a serious nature. Alongside other enforcement action, the ICO is explicitly required under Article 83 of the UK GDPR to “ensure that the imposition of administrative fines” is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” and Recital 148 authoritatively specifies that it should impose a fine on organisations (whether public or private) for any data protection breach which is not “minor”. Given the overarching requirement for “strong enforcement” (UK GDPR, Recital 7), Recital 148's interpretation is particularly imperative when other measures such as an enforcement notice is not forthcoming. Moreover, in December 2023 when handing down a £350k fine for a worryingly similar (although considerably less far-reaching) MoD data breach in 2021 (also involving Afghan relocations data), the Commissioner himself acknowledged that in relation to “breaches of data protection that are so egregious that they put people's lives at risk” it was “necessary for us at the ICO to apply the full sanctions of the law”. It is manifest, however, that the application of any, let alone full, legal sanctions is impossible if prima facie serious breaches of the law are not even subject to ICO investigation.

The ICO's 5 December 2023 decision not to investigate resulted in it only taking part in meetings (including reviewing documentation) coordinated by the data controller itself and giving input at and around these. However, no evidence is provided of any such meeting taking place between 5 December 2023 and 26 June 2024. Moreover, following that latter meeting, Stephen Bonner made (but did not record) another critical decision which was that “no further action (‘NFA') was required at this time”.  John Edwards was subsequently informed (although not until 19 September 2024) “at a high level” and “had no objection with the approach”. It is difficult to see how sufficient lines of inquiry could possibly have been pursued by this point to justify such an outcome and the memorandum anyway presents no evidence to suggest that this was anything other than a very serious breach which positively required action on the part of ICO. Nevertheless, approximately a third of the memorandum (pp. 11-15) seeks post-hoc to set out such a justification. 

Some of this merely repeat claims relating to the super-injunction and the information classification which have been considered and rejected above. Other parts are both counter-intuitive and contradictory. Thus, it claims as an argument against regulatory action that the ICO was “already investigating and taking regulatory action against the MoD for a separate data breach” which resulted in the December 2023 £350k fine. However, as explicitly specified in Article 83(2)(e) of the UKGDPR and in the ICO's own guidance, “relevant previous infringements by the controller” (or, in the Information Commissioner's words “a similar breach”) are peremptorily established as an aggravating rather than a mitigating factor for regulatory action. The memorandum also seeks to assert that the ICO had formed an understanding that the spreadsheet failure was “a one-off occurrence following a failure to following [sic] usual checks, rather than reflecting a wider culture of non-compliance”. However, this patently clashes with positive knowledge of the other egregious data breach (also involving Afghan relocation application data) and information which has subsequently become available through a freedom of information request showing there have been 49 separate data breaches at this MoD unit over the past four years including seven which were serious enough to be notified to ICO.

The memorandum briefly summarises four further meetings at the MoD after 26 June 2024 involving ICO as well as related MoD-ICO interactions. It is clear from this that a range of relevant matters concerning both the breach itself and changes to data practices were discussed and explored. Nevertheless, none of this appears to have involved a forensic investigation by the ICO itself of the actual breach (including whether even the intended release – which involved the unencrypted permanent disclosure of highly sensitive personal data about 150 individuals to a number of third parties – was itself lawful). There was also no suggestion of any potential regulatory sanction for the manifest serious failures (which is unsurprising given the No Further Action decision already made) and it is clear that the MoD itself were far from always being promptly forthcoming. For example, enquiries made at the 26 June 2024 meeting remained unanswered until an email on 8 October 2024 and certain queries raised at the 6 May 2025 meeting remained unanswered until 10 July 2025 (just 5 days before the super-injunction was lifted). It is also clear that following the 26 June 2024 No Further Action decision, the focus increasingly turned to plans for joint MoD-ICO management of public relations communications once the super-injunction was lifted. Thus, as early as 3 July 2024 the MoD sent the ICO “an initial comms and engagement pack” and such joint work continued (including at, and after, meetings) over the subsequent months.

Conclusions 

As a result of both its scale and acute sensitivity (which involved risks to life and perhaps even death), the MoD's Afghan spreadsheet data breach was one of the most egregious in UK history. The lifting of the 1 September 2023 super-injunction which took place on 15 June 2025 exposed this to the world. This event also exposed acute failings in UK data protection supervision. The ICO's failure to engage in any enforcement action in response to such an egregious breach is impossible to square with its duty (which has been acknowledged by the Information Commissioner himself) “to apply the full sanctions of the law” in such cases.  However, beyond even this, it is now clear that the ICO did not mount any independent investigation into this matter and that it did not maintain any contemporaneous record of its decisions. Whilst undoubtedly posing weighty challenges, neither the high classification of the information at issue nor the super-injunction itself provides a good justification for this. The absence of an ICO investigation and contemporaneous record-keeping is at even greater variance with its obligation to demonstrably discharge its “responsibility for ensuring that the [UK] GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]). 

Although aberrant from the perspective of UK GDPR standards, this outcome is sadly consonant with the accelerating trends towards hyper-discretion and hyper-selection in UK data protection regulation. Other major data breaches, such as the 2023 one which continues to impact the British Library (much less serious but also raising far few complexities in terms of investigation), have also not been fully investigated or sanctioned. Moreover, the ICO's Annual Report 2024/25 revealed that the ICO carried out only 43 UK GDPR investigations in the past year (an 85% reduction on 2023-24), issued just 2 UK GDPR fines (compared to >250 in both Germany and Spain) and served no UK GDPR enforcement notices at all. These facts expose the need for an in-depth, thorough and independent investigation into the state of UK data protection regulation, including an examination of what might be done to reverse its current lack of consistent and robust results for data subjects and the public at large.

Turkey's central bank has issued a ‘call for participation' for companies in the finance and technology sectors to ‘enrich' its ongoing explorations into the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (TCMB)'s directorate-general for payment systems and financial technologies announced the move today (3 September) via a seven-page ‘call for participation in the digital Turkish lira project ecosystem' document (Turkish-language only), accompanied by a short press release (in English).

The Ankara-headquartered authority is conducting studies to evaluate the feasibility of a CBDC and specifically wants to ‘demonstrate the potential features, test different technological infrastructures and system designs, and implement pilot applications.'

The central bank is welcoming project applications across five areas of interest: tokenisation, programmable payments, user-sovereign identity (also known as self-sovereign identity), interoperability with existing systems, and ‘machine-to-machine payment scenarios.'

Project applications can be submitted under one or more of the categories. Organisations can apply with a maximum of three projects. The deadline for applications for ‘first stage' involvement is 15 October 2025.

RELATED ARTICLE Turkish central bank progresses ‘digital lira' tests – a news story (10 January 2023) on a previous milestone on the central bank's CBDC journey – see below

The TCMB is already relatively well progressed in its CBDC explorations – which it refers to as the ‘Digital Turkish Lira Project'.

A ‘Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform' was established in 2021 via the signing memorandums of understanding with two companies – Aselsan and Havelsan – and TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey), an institution affiliated with Turkey's Ministry of Industry and Technology. Aselsan and Havelsan are best known as defence companies though they also operate in sectors including IT and software.

The Digital Turkish Lira Project's first phase focused on retail payments. By 2022, the necessary infrastructure had been developed, and the first successful payment transactions were completed in pilot tests at the end of the year. Pilot tests continued in 2023 and a 63-page ‘Digital Turkish Lira First Phase Evaluation Report' was published (Turkish language – a 64-page English-language version was subsequently published).

The second phase is now ongoing is focused on ‘develop[ing] projects encompassing new use cases, in addition to ongoing studies in technology, economics and law, and to enrich the Digital Turkish Lira Project ecosystem with additional participation.'

The central bank says it wants companies ‘to develop exemplary scenarios based on the categories and criteria outlined in the Call document, develop innovative projects based on these scenarios, and collaborate on them.'

‘This will diversify the use of the Digital Turkish Lira, aiming to make it a key component of Turkey's rapidly developing financial technology ecosystem,' the central bank states.

=>>> Global Government Fintech's dedicated ‘Digital Currencies' section <==

At a global level, CBDCs increasingly seem to be in the shadow of an alternative, and increasingly popular, type of digital currency – stablecoins, which are issued by private companies (that said, the US state of Wyoming last month made government fintech history by issuing the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US).

A Bank for International Settlements (BIS)'s survey about central banks' CBDC activities during 2024 (published last month – August 2025) found that, of 93 central banks surveyed, 85 were exploring either a retail CBDC (for general population use), a wholesale CBDC (for interbank use) or both. But none of the few CBDCs currently ‘live' globally are proving popular.

In Turkey, plans to launch a ‘blockchain-based' digital currency within four years were published in 2019 although CBDC research in the country pre-dates that.

The central bank stated in December 2022 that ‘studies on the legal dimension show that digital identification is of critical importance' to the CBDC project. A 2023 Presidential Annual Programme (Turkish language), published by the Presidency Strategy and Budget directorate in October 2022, included mention of CBDC. It stated that integration of a CBDC with ‘identity' and central bank-operated instant payment system FAST ‘within the scope of research and development studies will be completed'. The 391-page document's brief CBDC section also stated that research with banks would take place focused on wholesale CBDC.

Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world, according to the World Bank. The country has a population of about 85.5 million people.

- XRP solidifies its role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance in 2025, driven by Ripple's infrastructure dominance and regulatory breakthroughs.

- Ripple's $1.3 trillion ODL network and SEC victory paved the way for the first XRP ETF, unlocking $8 billion in institutional capital and CBDC partnerships.

- XRP's $2.77 price and DeepSeek AI's $5 target highlight its speculative appeal, while ETF adoption and October 2025 seasonal trends suggest growth potential.

- Experts recommend dollar-cost averaging and legal safeguards for XRP investors, emphasizing its dual utility as a stable infrastructure asset and high-risk/high-reward play.

 

In 2025, XRP has emerged as a linchpin in the evolution of global digital finance, driven by Ripple's infrastructure dominance, regulatory breakthroughs, and strategic CBDC partnerships. As central banks and institutions accelerate their transition to tokenized assets, XRP's role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance is becoming increasingly critical. This analysis explores how XRP's unique positioning—coupled with expert investment strategies—positions it as a cornerstone for long-term wealth creation in the next phase of digital finance.  

Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service has processed $1.3 trillion in cross-border payments through 300+ institutional partners in 2025, leveraging XRP's 3–5 second settlement times and near-zero fees to outperform legacy systems like SWIFT [1]. This infrastructure dominance is underpinned by Ripple's legal victory over the SEC in August 2025, which not only removed regulatory uncertainty but also paved the way for the first SEC-approved XRP ETF [1]. The ETF's anticipated launch is projected to unlock $8 billion in institutional capital inflows, further solidifying XRP's role in global financial infrastructure.  

Ripple's adaptability is also evident in its CBDC-related initiatives. SWIFT's Q3 2025 interoperability tests with the XRP Ledger demonstrated its potential as a complementary layer for tokenized assets, including U.S. Treasuries and gold [1]. Meanwhile, partnerships with the Republic of Palau and Bhutan to pilot digital currency projects highlight XRP's growing appeal as a scalable, energy-efficient solution for cross-border interoperability [3]. With over 100 countries exploring CBDCs, Ripple's technology is uniquely positioned to address the scalability and efficiency challenges of the next-generation financial system.  

While competitors like Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL) focus on permissioned enterprise integration, XRP's decentralized model and established network of partnerships offer broader institutional appeal [1]. GCUL's closed architecture, though tailored for corporate clients, lacks the open protocol flexibility that enables XRP to serve as a universal bridge for both fiat and tokenized assets. This distinction is critical as macroeconomic tailwinds—such as the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs)—gain momentum. Ripple's expansion into stablecoins, tokenized securities, and RWA platforms further cements its role in the evolving digital finance ecosystem [1].  

Retail investor sentiment for XRP in 2025 is cautiously optimistic, with the token trading around $2.77 as of September 2025. Technical analysts highlight key support levels at $2.50–$2.60 and resistance at $2.80–$2.90, with a breakdown below $2.80 potentially exposing further downside [2]. Conversely, a reclamation of this level could trigger a rally toward $3.40–$3.45. DeepSeek AI's projection of a $5 target by late 2025 adds to the bullish narrative, driven by XRP's breakout from a five-month consolidation pattern [3].  

The anticipated XRP ETF is a major catalyst for both institutional and retail adoption, mirroring the inflows seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Historical market cycles also suggest a potential rally in October 2025, aligning with seasonal trends and regulatory momentum [4]. For investors, this creates a window of opportunity to capitalize on XRP's dual role as a utility asset and speculative play.  

Experts emphasize proactive wealth protection and strategic planning for XRP investors. Jake Claver, a crypto adviser for ultra-wealthy clients, recommends establishing legal, tax, and security structures before profits materialize. Tools like digital asset trusts, LLCs, and custody solutions can safeguard holdings against volatility and generational wealth transfer challenges [1].  

For retail investors, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) remains a core strategy to mitigate XRP's price swings. Diversifying portfolios with Bitcoin and Ethereum while monitoring whale activity and technical indicators can identify optimal entry points [5]. Additionally, low-cap altcoins like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) may offer high-growth opportunities, though they come with elevated risks [3].  

XRP's strategic positioning in the global CBDC ecosystem—bolstered by regulatory clarity, infrastructure dominance, and institutional adoption—makes it a compelling asset for long-term wealth creation. As Ripple continues to expand its partnerships and integrate with real-world assets, XRP is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the transition to a tokenized global economy. For investors, a balanced approach that combines technical analysis, regulatory foresight, and proactive wealth management will be key to navigating this dynamic landscape.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- XRP and Google Cloud's GCUL compete in cross-border payments, with XRP leveraging 3–5 second transactions and 300+ bank partnerships for liquidity optimization.

- XRP's 2025 SEC legal victory and CBDC interoperability tests with SWIFT strengthen its institutional adoption and regulatory credibility.

- GCUL's permissioned blockchain targets enterprise integration but faces scalability challenges compared to XRP's open protocol and existing global infrastructure.

- Analysts project XRP could reach $5.25 by 2030, driven by its role in tokenized assets and defensible cost-efficiency against GCUL's institutional-centric approach.



The cross-border payment landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain-based solutions redefine liquidity and settlement efficiency. At the heart of this transformation lies XRP, Ripple's native token, which has carved a niche in liquidity optimization and institutional adoption. Yet, its dominance faces a new challenger: Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL), a permissioned blockchain designed for enterprise integration. To assess XRP's competitive resilience, we must dissect its strategic advantages, regulatory tailwinds, and evolving role in CBDC ecosystems, while contrasting it with GCUL's institutional-centric approach.  

XRP's core strength lies in its dual role as a bridge asset and a settlement layer. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) processes transactions in 3–5 seconds at a cost of less than $0.01, making it an attractive solution for banks seeking to reduce friction in cross-border flows [1]. Ripple's 300+ bank partnerships, spanning 90+ markets and 55+ currencies, underscore its entrenched position in global finance [2]. This infrastructure has been further bolstered by Ripple's recent legal victory over the SEC in August 2025, which cleared the path for institutional adoption and renewed investor confidence [2].  

XRP's integration with CBDC initiatives is another critical differentiator. In Q3 2025, SWIFT began testing XRP Ledger for interoperability with CBDCs, positioning it as a complementary layer for tokenized assets like U.S. Treasuries and gold [1]. Ripple's collaboration with SBI Group in Japan to distribute Ripple USD (RLUSD)—a stablecoin backed by BNY Mellon—further highlights its adaptability in regulatory environments [3]. These developments suggest XRP is evolving from a payment token to a foundational asset in a broader digital financial ecosystem.  

Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL), currently in private testing, represents a direct challenge to XRP's dominance. Built as a permissioned blockchain using Python, GCUL prioritizes controlled enterprise adoption and compliance, with a pilot program already underway at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for asset tokenization [1]. Unlike XRP, which relies on a native token, GCUL has no plans for an initial coin offering (ICO), focusing instead on institutional integration through pre-vetted partnerships [2]. This approach aligns with Alphabet's $2.5 trillion market capitalization and its ability to leverage existing enterprise infrastructure.  

However, GCUL's success hinges on its ability to scale beyond asset tokenization. While XRP Ledger already supports 300+ banks and offers open protocol design, GCUL's private nature may limit its appeal to institutions seeking decentralized, permissionless solutions [2]. Additionally, GCUL's 2026 commercial launch timeline gives XRP a head start in capturing market share, particularly in regions where regulatory clarity is still emerging.  

Despite GCUL's institutional focus, XRP's resilience stems from its established use cases and regulatory momentum. The XRP Ledger's role in FX settlements—tested by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley—demonstrates its utility in real-world applications [1]. Meanwhile, Ripple's Liquidity Hub expansion aims to use XRP as a bridge for tokenized assets, a strategy that could outpace GCUL's narrower focus on asset tokenization [3].  

Moreover, XRP's recent legal victory has catalyzed institutional interest, with CME futures open interest surpassing $1 billion [2]. This liquidity, combined with XRP's low-cost, high-speed transactions, positions it as a defensible asset in a market where speed and cost efficiency remain paramount. Analysts project XRP could reach $5.25 by 2030, contingent on regulatory developments and adoption trends [1].  

XRP's competitive resilience lies in its dual strengths: a proven track record in cross-border payments and a forward-looking integration with CBDCs and tokenized assets. While GCUL's institutional focus and Alphabet's resources pose a long-term threat, XRP's decentralized architecture, regulatory clarity, and existing partnerships provide a formidable moat. For investors, the key question is not whether GCUL will disrupt the market, but whether XRP can maintain its first-mover advantage in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Trump Inc.'s much-trumpeted crypto foray — the WLFI token — launched Monday with ambitions of serving as the backbone of a new digital ecosystem. Within hours, it was mired in the turbulence and instability that has long been the hallmarks of crypto trading.

The token, promoted by Donald Trump's family and listed this week on leading exchanges Binance and Coinbase, is still changing hands about 25% below its launch price, and has a market value of around $5.4 billion. The stumble followed a late disclosure that nearly 25 billion WLFI coins would circulate — far more than investors had expected — rattling confidence in the cryptocurrency.

It's common for tokens to slide on their first day of trading as early holders take profits, though expectations for this high-profile debut had been lofty. World Liberty Financial Inc. — co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., with their father listed as “co-founder emeritus” — is the decentralized finance company that issued WLFI token. Just before launch, the firm announced 25 billion tokens would be circulating, about five times the roughly 5 billion many investors had expected, with most of the 100 billion total supply still not tradable, and a lot of it held by insiders. Directly or indirectly, the Trump family controls more than 20 billion WLFI tokens, according to the project's website.

The disclosure showed billions of tokens would go to Alt5 Sigma Corp., a publicly traded crypto-payments firm that's affiliated with many principals involved in World Liberty. Alt5 recently agreeing to hold about 7.5% of WLFI's total supply and raised $1.5 billion. Its board was recast to include World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff as chairman and Eric Trump as director.

Alt5's shares dropped 29% on Tuesday, to $5.58 apiece, underscoring how closely the firm's fortunes are now tied to WLFI. Though the tokens it received are tradable, the company has said its aim is to accumulate rather than sell. The shares fell another 16% on Wednesday.

To steady sentiment, World Liberty removed 47 million tokens, valued at roughly $11 million, from circulation, through a process known as burning, the project said. And the firm has highlighted support from backers such as crypto billionaire Justin Sun.

The World Liberty team also proposed destroying some WLFI tokens received as fees, to reduce circulating supply. The proposal has received broad support, but is yet to be officially voted on by WLFI holders.

“The WLFI launch has been a tremendous success,” said a World Liberty Financial spokesperson.

On World Liberty's governance forum, some investors voiced frustration over the shifting numbers and ambiguity around who qualified as an “early supporter” and how much they could sell. Online, traders noted circulating supply estimates ranging from 3% to 25%, adding to confusion in the hours after launch.

“Ideally, day one would be great,” said Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert.com. “Unfortunately, the team fumbled communication before launch and Twitter was against them, turning the day red.” He said he is not selling his WLFI holdings and might buy more for a short-term trade. Bruno Ver, another early holder, said he had planned to sell quickly but decided to wait. “At this point I am not worried, just curious how the market will react and evolve in the longer run,” he said.

On X, Eric Trump pointed to premium to early round prices as evidence of strong performance, noting that WLFI traded well above those levels in its first days. Sun also said he would not sell his WLFI tokens and promoted a yield product for WLFI holders. 

WLFI is as much a branding exercise as a financial product, unfolding in one of finance's least stable arenas. Earlier this year Trump -promoted memecoin surged briefly on debut before crashing. Analysts say the true test will be whether World Liberty's ecosystem takes hold beyond speculation. Its stablecoin, USD1, already boasts a market value of about $2.7 billion, and the team has plans for lending, borrowing, and other services.

“Volatility on launch day is quite common,” said Dessislava Aubert, senior analyst at Kaiko. “The recent proposal for a fee burn mechanism could generate short-term hype. However, long-term value depends on ecosystem adoption, particularly USD1, which drives WLFI usage and despite listing on major [centralized exchanges], USD1 faces steep competition in the stablecoin market.”

For now, given WLFI's fully diluted value above $20 billion, it has been treated more generously than other comparable crypto projects, according to Lex Sokolin of Generative Ventures, a venture capital investment firm.

While most tokens tied to personalities or narratives can swing violently, WLFI has already been given the kind of reception usually reserved for more established, revenue-generating businesses, according to Sokolin. “With those comps, WLFI has had a very kind reception from the market so far,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Turkish central bank wants companies to ‘enrich' CBDC explorations","https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/digital-turkish-lira-ecosystem-call-for-participation/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:51:55 GMT","

Turkey's central bank has issued a ‘call for participation' for companies in the finance and technology sectors to ‘enrich' its ongoing explorations into the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (TCMB)'s directorate-general for payment systems and financial technologies announced the move today (3 September) via a seven-page ‘call for participation in the digital Turkish lira project ecosystem' document (Turkish-language only), accompanied by a short press release (in English).

The Ankara-headquartered authority is conducting studies to evaluate the feasibility of a CBDC and specifically wants to ‘demonstrate the potential features, test different technological infrastructures and system designs, and implement pilot applications.'

The central bank is welcoming project applications across five areas of interest: tokenisation, programmable payments, user-sovereign identity (also known as self-sovereign identity), interoperability with existing systems, and ‘machine-to-machine payment scenarios.'

Project applications can be submitted under one or more of the categories. Organisations can apply with a maximum of three projects. The deadline for applications for ‘first stage' involvement is 15 October 2025.

RELATED ARTICLE Turkish central bank progresses ‘digital lira' tests – a news story (10 January 2023) on a previous milestone on the central bank's CBDC journey – see below

The TCMB is already relatively well progressed in its CBDC explorations – which it refers to as the ‘Digital Turkish Lira Project'.

A ‘Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform' was established in 2021 via the signing memorandums of understanding with two companies – Aselsan and Havelsan – and TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey), an institution affiliated with Turkey's Ministry of Industry and Technology. Aselsan and Havelsan are best known as defence companies though they also operate in sectors including IT and software.

The Digital Turkish Lira Project's first phase focused on retail payments. By 2022, the necessary infrastructure had been developed, and the first successful payment transactions were completed in pilot tests at the end of the year. Pilot tests continued in 2023 and a 63-page ‘Digital Turkish Lira First Phase Evaluation Report' was published (Turkish language – a 64-page English-language version was subsequently published).

The second phase is now ongoing is focused on ‘develop[ing] projects encompassing new use cases, in addition to ongoing studies in technology, economics and law, and to enrich the Digital Turkish Lira Project ecosystem with additional participation.'

The central bank says it wants companies ‘to develop exemplary scenarios based on the categories and criteria outlined in the Call document, develop innovative projects based on these scenarios, and collaborate on them.'

‘This will diversify the use of the Digital Turkish Lira, aiming to make it a key component of Turkey's rapidly developing financial technology ecosystem,' the central bank states.

=>>> Global Government Fintech's dedicated ‘Digital Currencies' section <==

At a global level, CBDCs increasingly seem to be in the shadow of an alternative, and increasingly popular, type of digital currency – stablecoins, which are issued by private companies (that said, the US state of Wyoming last month made government fintech history by issuing the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US).

A Bank for International Settlements (BIS)'s survey about central banks' CBDC activities during 2024 (published last month – August 2025) found that, of 93 central banks surveyed, 85 were exploring either a retail CBDC (for general population use), a wholesale CBDC (for interbank use) or both. But none of the few CBDCs currently ‘live' globally are proving popular.

In Turkey, plans to launch a ‘blockchain-based' digital currency within four years were published in 2019 although CBDC research in the country pre-dates that.

The central bank stated in December 2022 that ‘studies on the legal dimension show that digital identification is of critical importance' to the CBDC project. A 2023 Presidential Annual Programme (Turkish language), published by the Presidency Strategy and Budget directorate in October 2022, included mention of CBDC. It stated that integration of a CBDC with ‘identity' and central bank-operated instant payment system FAST ‘within the scope of research and development studies will be completed'. The 391-page document's brief CBDC section also stated that research with banks would take place focused on wholesale CBDC.

Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world, according to the World Bank. The country has a population of about 85.5 million people.

Roblox Lawsuit Reveals Wider Pattern of Digital Predators Grooming Kids and the Urgent Need for a Multi-Front Strategy to End It

In an era where children are increasingly connected to technology, the need to protect their online safety has never been more urgent. The internet offers incredible educational opportunities and social connections, but it also exposes children to significant risks, from cyberbullying to exploitation. In North Carolina, a 10-year-old girl became the victim of online exploitation through Roblox, one of the world's most popular gaming platforms. The case, now in Guilford County Superior Court, reveals a chilling reality: predators are leveraging gaming platforms, virtual currencies, and sophisticated grooming techniques to exploit children in ways that can escalate to human trafficking.

What You Need to Know

The Case and the Pattern Behind It
In the North Carolina lawsuit, an adult allegedly masqueraded as a child, built rapport in-game, then offered Robux in exchange for explicit images before escalating to coercion. This is not an outlier. It mirrors how modern offenders operate on youth-heavy platforms: establish trust, isolate by moving channels, and exploit, often with digital currency as the hook.

Roblox counters that it invests heavily in safety (AI and 24/7 human moderation), restricts the sharing of links and personal information, and collaborates with law enforcement and child-safety partners. Roblox designed its own AI-warning system, “Sentinel,” which submitted approximately 1,200 reports of potential child exploitation attempts to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the first half of 2025. Those steps matter, but at the family and school level, waiting for platforms to solve this alone leaves children exposed during the most vulnerable window: first contact to first image.

How Digital Grooming Works (and Why Robux Matters)
The grooming pipeline typically looks like this:

Robux (or any platform currency) is potent with preteens: it feels legitimate and exciting, disguising the interaction as “play” or “trading.” That's why transaction-aware safety – flagging suspicious currency flows tied to minors and sudden new “friends” – should be a core platform signal.

Scale Raises the Stakes
With the enormous scale of daily users and engagement hours (111.8 million daily active users and 27.4 billion hours of engagement in the second quarter of 2025 alone, according to Roblox), even a tiny failure rate creates a staggering number of victims. Litigation and Attorney General actions in multiple states underscore a broader reckoning: Another lawsuit alleging child sexploitation involving a 15-year-old boy was filed against Roblox in Clay County, Missouri. In this instance, a male predator posted as a young girl to cultivate trust, transitioning messaging to text where he eventually coerced the child to send sexually explicit images of himself. Youth-oriented platforms must be safe by default, not merely configurable with the right toggles because, too often, those toggles aren't set.

What Parents and Caregivers Can Do Today:

Set the defaults to “safe” and keep them there

What Schools Can Do:

Visibility + curriculum = prevention

What Platforms Must Change:

Design for children's realities, not ideal users

What Law Enforcement Should Prioritize:

Victim care first, evidence second—both fast

We Can't Outsource Our Children's Safety
School IT teams, tech companies, and legislators all matter, but none can cover the moment-to-moment interactions where most harm begins. Parents and local communities remain the first line of defense. The North Carolina case and others serve as a warning: If we wait for someone else to fix this, children will pay the price.

Resources (Share These)

Bottom Line
This isn't about panic; it's about precision. A predictable grooming pipeline, a known leverage point (virtual currency), and identifiable signals provide us with the blueprint to prevent first contact, detect early, and respond quickly. Platforms must make default-safe design non-negotiable. Schools must build visibility and teach the realities. And families must engage daily. That's how we close the window between the first chat and the first harm, and keep our kids safe wherever they play.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Crypto Unlocked: New Patent Eligibility Guidance on Blockchain Technology","https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-unlocked-new-patent-eligibility-4997876/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:34:51 GMT","



The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (“GENIUS”) Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. The GENIUS Act is part of a broader push to accelerate the development of emerging technologies in the U.S., from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. That same push is showing up in the patent world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles.

Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain patents. In Ex Parte David L. Newman, the PTAB reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. § 101 and provided some useful discussion of how the USPTO (and patent applicants) should approach blockchain-related patents. The claims at issue relate to “securely storing data across a network in a multi-dimensional distributed database” in order to “process[] license contracts, including computing proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian addresses.”

The Examiner had rejected the claims as directed to the abstract idea of “payment, distribution, and pricing for two users bound by a contractual relationship,” concluding that the additional elements in the claims do not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application. In the Examiner's view, the invention simply used “a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea.” The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging that the claims involved an abstract idea because “[i]t is well settled that commercial interactions involving payment transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human activity.”

However, the Board drew the line at step 2 of the Alice analysis. Unlike the Examiner, the Board determined that the claims integrate the abstract idea into a practical application “by improving the technical functioning of the recited blockchain by transforming it into a multi-dimensional database slidechain that allows for the execution and simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain.” In other words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself operates. As the Board explained, the claims “recite[] steps that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain… [and] uses the recited abstract idea in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a particular technological environment.”

Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based on 35 U.S.C. § 101. Specifically, applicants should use their specification to clearly articulate how their invention improves “the performance of a computer” and/or “the functionality of the blockchain and the processing thereof.”

The Proskauer Intellectual Property Team is continuing to monitor the evolving guidance on patent eligibility of emerging technologies. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader emerging technology space.

For the first time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have clarified that registered US exchanges are not barred from listing and trading certain spot cryptocurrency products.

In a joint statement released Tuesday, staff from the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC's Divisions of Market Oversight and Clearing and Risk said their view is that “SEC- and CFTC-registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products.” The applies to SEC-registered national securities exchanges (NSEs), CFTC-registered designated contract markets (DCMs), and foreign boards of trade (FBOTs).

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said the move reflects a shift toward bringing cryptocurrency activity back onshore. “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot cryptocurrency assets. The SEC is committed to working with the CFTC to ensure that our regulatory frameworks support innovation and competition in these rapidly evolving markets,” he said.

The statement is linked to the SEC's Project Cryptocurrency and the CFTC's Cryptocurrency Sprint, both launched to expand oversight of digital assets. The effort also builds on recommendations from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. CFTC Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham began the Cryptocurrency Sprint last month, seeking public feedback on listing spot cryptocurrency contracts on DCMs.

Industry participants welcomed the development. “The joint statement from the SEC and CFTC today gives major US exchanges the green light to offer spot trading on leading digital assets,” Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, said in an email. “This opens the door for even more mainstream adoption, granting direct access to these commodity assets at venues where trillions of dollars already reside.”

The statement makes a distinction between traditional exchanges and cryptocurrency-native platforms. Companies like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini already support spot trading for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but they are not NSEs or DCMs, so they fall outside the same federal market structure as exchanges like Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year, the SEC dropped lawsuits against several of those cryptocurrency platforms.

The joint statement also prompted reaction from traditional finance. “The NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote on X.

The guidance comes as the Trump administration pushes to make the US a hub for cryptocurrency activity. Earlier this summer, President Trump signed a bill regulating stablecoins, the first cryptocurrency-specific legislation in the US Congress is also working on a broader cryptocurrency market structure bill.

Blume added that the development makes Bitcoin products easier to design and combine with existing offerings. Gerald Gallagher, general counsel for the Sei protocol, framed it as the end of a regulatory standoff. “Bottom line: The turf wars are ending. The SEC and CFTC are rowing in the same direction. The US just validated the importance of building high-performance cryptocurrency trading infrastructure,” he posted on social media.

Can you feel the undercurrents shaking the financial world? The impending IPOs of crypto giants Gemini and Figure Technologies are making waves, captivating the attention of investors and analysts alike. Both firms, entrenched powerhouses within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, are angling for valuations that speak volumes about the rising tide of confidence in digital currencies. With Gemini eyeing a $2.22 billion valuation and Figure aspiring toward $4.13 billion, the implications for US crypto exchanges and the broader blockchain landscape are nothing short of seismic.

What happens when you combine visionary entrepreneurship with a commitment to compliance? Enter Gemini, launched in 2014 by the astute Winklevoss twins, who have meticulously curated a reputation as a trustworthy exchange adhering to regulatory mandates. Their latest S-1 filing reveals a strategy to release 16.67 million shares, with a price point poised between $17 and $19. This endeavor aims to raise an astonishing $317 million but transcends mere financial gains; it marks a defining moment in the realm of institutional acceptance of crypto, a landmark for the legitimacy of digital currencies. As they gear up to join the ranks of Coinbase and Bullish, the stakes have never been more significant.

The forthcoming IPOs represent a monumental shift in investor attitudes, signaling an increasingly optimistic outlook in the cryptocurrency market. The buzz surrounding these public offerings suggests a growing appetite for digital asset investments. As the market matures, these listings not only legitimize established entities like Gemini but may also inspire a wave of initiatives from emerging startups. History echoes this potential; Coinbase's triumphant debut has shown how such listings can invigorate the sector and rouse interest, setting a new course for the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Delving into Reddit discussions reveals a cocktail of enthusiasm and skepticism swirling around Gemini's IPO. Many users are buzzing with optimism, viewing this milestone as a beacon of growing acceptance for digital currencies. However, darker clouds gather as some question the lingering regulatory challenges and operational obstacles that loiter in the background. The stark contrast in scale between mid-sized exchanges like Gemini and industry titans like Coinbase creates unease about long-term viability in this tumultuous market.

While established players gain momentum, the surfacing of Web3 startups could lead to precarious circumstances. The influx of institutional faith may raise expectations yet complicate the harmony between crypto and traditional financial systems. The dependence on third-party platforms for fiat-to-crypto conversions poses substantial risks, especially as regulators tighten the screws surrounding the crypto environment. The anticipated IPOs of Gemini and Figure are likely to bring forth more stringent compliance requirements, crafting new hurdles for burgeoning firms navigating this labyrinth.

With its public debut on the horizon, Gemini is positioning itself as a crucial conduit connecting traditional finance with the fluid dynamics of the crypto world. The Winklevoss twins, long-time proponents of a regulated crypto ecosystem, may finally see their vision come to life through this IPO. Investors are on the lookout for robust pathways into the digital economy, and Gemini's steadfast commitment to compliance could be the key to unlocking interest from both institutional and retail investors alike in a market teetering on volatility.

The imminent IPOs of Gemini and Figure Technologies herald a pivotal moment in the narrative of cryptocurrency, suggesting the dawn of a new era for mainstream adoption of crypto assets. As the waves of confidence swell and institutional curiosity ignites, these developments promise to reshape the territory for both established exchanges and fresh entrants. For astute investors, this is a moment ripe with potential—an invitation to tap into an expanding niche marked by regulated frameworks. Yet, the journey will not be without its challenges, underscoring the need for unwavering compliance and operational resilience. How companies like Gemini harness these opportunities while navigating market complexities could be critical in charting the future of cryptocurrency investment, unlocking rewards for those who choose to engage now.

Bitcoin's (BTC) slide into September comes with an uncomfortable reminder for traders that history is not on their side.

The largest token by market capitalization has declined in nine of the last 14 September months, with an average monthly loss of around 12%.

This seasonality looms large again in 2025. Bitcoin opened the week near $110,000, its weakest level in nearly two months, and total crypto market capitalization has slipped to $3.74 trillion, reaching a three-week low.

BTC prices have been flat over the past 24 hours, with Solana's SOL (SOL) leading gains at 4%, XRP XRP$2.8624 posting 1% and Cardano's ADA (ADA) rising 1.5%.

Traders say the combination of macro uncertainty, fragile sentiment, and thinning volumes leaves little room for error heading into what has historically been the toughest month on the calendar.

The technicals don't inspire much confidence either. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, noted that the broader capitalization chart “continues to record a series of lower lows, signaling a downward trend.”

He pointed to Bitcoin's failure to hold $112,000 and warned of “further decline toward the $105,000 area,” a level that has long acted as support before the psychological $100,000 barrier.

The crypto fear index has slipped back toward 40, its lowest since April, suggesting nerves are rising before they've fully broken.

In 2017, bitcoin dropped nearly 8% in September despite the euphoric rally that carried it to $20,000 later that year. In 2019, the token lost almost 14% in September, foreshadowing months of sideways action. 

Even in the latest cycle, September 2021 and 2022 both saw steep drawdowns, reminding traders that liquidity drains and macro jitters often coincide with the end of summer.

This year, those headwinds are visible in ETF flows. After steady accumulation through much of August, spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded net outflows of $440 million last week.

Ether ETFs, which launched just last year, posted more than $1 billion in inflows, marking a rare bright spot but also a sign that capital may be rotating rather than growing overall.

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows spot ETFs have now absorbed more than 1.3 million BTC, nearly 6% of total supply, putting them on par with the largest exchanges for market share.

The risk is that support levels break before macro relief arrives. Non-farm payrolls due Friday are expected to show just 45,000 new jobs, confirming a slowing U.S. labor market.

A soft print would strengthen the case for a September rate cut from the Fed, a catalyst that could flip sentiment back to risk-on. Until then, traders are paying up for downside hedges.

Options data shows the strongest demand for puts in weeks, with skew leaning firmly bearish, FxPro's Kuptsikevich noted, calling for caution among intra-day traders.

Crypto infrastructure provider Utila raised $22 million in its latest fundraising round nearly tripling its valuation in the last six six months, the firm told CoinDesk.

The round was led by Red Dot Capital Partners with Nyca, Wing VC, DCG and Cerca Partners among investors also participating, extending the March Series A funding round to $40 million.

Founded in New York and Tel Aviv, Utila provides a digital asset operations platform tailored for enterprises working with stablecoins. The system handles payments, treasury and trading functions, while offering compliance and continuity features for businesses. The firm's customers include payment providers, neobanks and asset managers, reflecting the growing use of dollar-pegged tokens in global finance.

Stablecoins garnered attention this year from outside of crypto circles as the killer application of blockchain technology. The sector, currently a $270 billion market, have the potential to disrupt cross-border payments as a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional financial rails, proponents say. Major banks and global retailers like Walmart, Amazon are reportedly exploring using stablecoins.

Payments firm Stripe acquiring stablecoin startup Bridge and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO were the ""bitcoin ETF moments"" for stablecoin adoption, Bentzi Rabi, co-founder and CEO of Utila said in an interview with CoinDesk. 

Utila did not actively seek new funding, but received inbound offers as stablecoin demand spiked, Rabi said. Since March, the firm has doubled its customer base and now processes over $15 billion in monthly transactions. 

With most of its original Series A capital still unused, Utila opted to extend the round to accelerate its expansion into fast-growing markets such as Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific, where stablecoins are increasingly central to financial infrastructure.

Glassnode's HODL Waves visualize the distribution of bitcoin BTC$112,407.36 supply across different age bands. Each colored band represents the percentage of BTC last moved within the time frame shown in the legend.

The recent narrative around bitcoin's declining price has focused on OG whales (long-time holders with large balances) selling their coins. This is partly true, as highlighted by Galaxy facilitating an 80,000 BTC transaction and other notable movements over the past few months. Bitcoin also crossed the milestone of $100,000 within the past 12 months, a level that likely triggered selling for many investors.

However, Glassnode's data suggests this selling is not the dominant story. Coins held for 7 to 10 years now account for over 8.1% of supply, the highest level since 2019. While total circulating supply has continued to shrink, the growth in this cohort indicates old supply is accumulating at a faster rate than coins being sold.

The 10 plus year cohort reinforces this trend. They now control about 17% of supply, and their share has only increased over time.

By contrast, the 5 to 7 year holders have seen a decline. They held around 10% of supply at the start of 2023, but this has dropped to just 5%. Many of these coins were acquired during the 2019 to 2020 period, most notably when bitcoin traded near $3,000 during the Covid crash. This group appears to be distributing steadily.

In short, while OG coins are indeed being sold, the broader narrative of widespread old-wallet selling seems to be overstated. The data shows a more nuanced picture, with older cohorts continuing to grow their share of supply even as some mid-term holders take profits.

 Bitcoin's march toward $150,000 could gain momentum as soaring G7 bond yields push investors toward hard assets like BTC and gold. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin thrives when yields rise on debt and inflation fears, but struggles when central banks tighten aggressively.

Today's bond market stress looks inflation- and debt-driven, suggesting BTC could follow gold's record run with higher-beta gains.

Long-term government bond yields are ripping across the US, Europe, Japan and the UK, even as central banks slash policy rates. 

The 30-year US Treasury is back near 5%, France's long bond trades above 4% for the first time since 2011, and UK gilts are testing 27-year highs. Japan's 30-year yield has reached record levels, prompting analysts to call it the “collapse of global G7 bond markets.”

But what happens to Bitcoin amid this concerning macroeconomic outlook? Let's examine.

History shows that Bitcoin's reaction to rising government bond yields depends on why yields are climbing. Sometimes it rallies like “digital gold,” other times it struggles like a risk asset.

Take the 2013 taper tantrum. 

When the Federal Reserve hinted it would slow its money-printing program, the US 10-year yield shot toward 3%. Investors grew anxious about inflation and debt, a sentiment that aligned with Bitcoin's price explosion from under $100 to over $1,000.

A similar story played out in early 2021. 

Yields climbed as markets priced in higher inflation during the post-COVID recovery. Bitcoin moved in step with gold, surging to around $65,000 by April.

However, in 2018, the outcome was the opposite. 

Yields rose above 3% not because of inflation or debt fears, but because the Fed was hiking aggressively. Real returns on bonds looked attractive, and Bitcoin plunged by about 85% during the same period.

It shows that Bitcoin behaves like a hedging asset with more upside when yields rise due to inflation, deficits or excess debt supply. Bitcoin usually struggles when yields rise because central banks are tightening into growth.

Bitcoin has risen by 4.2% in the past three days, moving in lockstep with a surge in long-term Treasury debt in the US and other G7 nations. 

At the same time, its holder retention rate is climbing, showing that more traders are choosing to hold onto BTC as a hedge instead of selling. 

The backdrop is hard to ignore. US government debt jumped from $36.2 trillion in July to $37.3 trillion by September, up by over $1 trillion in just two months. 

Across the Atlantic, Europe and the UK are facing similar borrowing waves. 

The result has been record-sized bond auctions that only clear at higher yields. This is a sign that demand for government bonds is weakening. UK's 30-year bond yield, for instance, reached its highest level since 1998 on Wednesday.

Gold has already confirmed the shift in investor behavior, away from trusting government bonds and toward hard assets. 

The metal's surge to record highs above $3,500 this week shows that markets are actively hedging against runaway debt and inflation. 

Historically, Bitcoin benefits from such capital rotations a little later than gold. But once it does, it moves faster and further than the precious metal, acting as the higher-beta refuge from monetary and fiscal excess.

“The central banks are losing control of the long end of the curve,” noted Mark Moss, chief of Bitcoin Strategist at UK-based DeFi firm Satsuma Technology, adding: 

Many analysts see Bitcoin reaching a record high of $150,000-200,000 by 2026.

 Trust Wallet's self-custodial wallet rolled out RWA support in collaboration with Ondo Finance and 1inch, initially available on Ethereum. 

Update (Sept. 3, 1:15 pm UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that Trust Wallet is owned by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and is no longer owned by Binance following its share sale in 2023..

Trust Wallet, the self-custodial crypto wallet owned by Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has integrated tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its platform.

After initially disclosing the plan to introduce real-world assets (RWAs) in June, Trust Wallet has launched tokenized versions of US stocks and ETFs for use around the globe, the company said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on Wednesday.

The integration is carried out in collaboration with Ondo Finance, a major decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on RWAs, and the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch.

“Integrating RWAs into self-custodial wallets is an important step in making global finance more open and efficient,” Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen said.

“The bigger picture is how blockchain democratizes access to financial markets and lays the foundation for a more inclusive future of finance,” she added.

As part of the collaboration, Ondo Finance will supply Trust Wallet with tokenized RWA assets — stocks, ETFs and bonds — initially issued on Ethereum using smart contracts, with Solana support planned next.

In the meantime, 1inch Fusion enhances liquidity and pricing to ensure smooth, efficient swaps into RWAs.

“In short, Ondo brings the assets, 1inch powers the rails, and Trust Wallet makes it accessible in self-custody, acting as a platform or tool,” Trust Wallet's marketing head, Sami Waittinen, told Cointelegraph, adding:

According to the Trust Wallet website, RWA tokens are not available in specific regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area. “Your swap will not go through if you reside in a region where RWA tokens are not available,” Trust Wallet said.

Additionally, RWA swapping follows US market hours, from Monday to Friday, 1:30 pm to 8:00 pm UTC, the company website said. “You can't trade RWAs outside of these hours, but we track off-hours interest for future features like 24/7 trading or limit orders,” it said.

By launching RWA support on its self-custodial wallet, Trust Wallet has emerged as one of the first platforms to integrate the concept of RWAs and self-custody. 

While self-custody enables users to manage their assets independently, free from centralized control, tokenized RWAs are digital representations of real-world properties serving as certificates of ownership.

According to Trust Wallet's Sami Waittinen, the collaboration aligns with the company's mission of promoting freedom of ownership and providing people with direct, secure access to the full spectrum of crypto and Web3 opportunities.

“Tokenized RWAs are a natural next step as they unlock traditionally gated assets like stocks or ETFs, and make them accessible to anyone, anywhere, from their own wallet. It's a powerful extension of what self-custody can mean,” he said.

Lucien Bourdon, an analyst at the hardware wallet company Trezor, distinguished two perspectives when addressing the mix of self-custody and RWAs.

“If a blockchain supports real-world asset tokens, any self-custodial hardware wallet that supports that chain can hold them securely,” Bourdon told Cointelegraph.

From the wallet's perspective, he said there's no difference between an RWA token and any other token, adding that some examples, like gold or Treasury-backed tokens, are already being stored this way.

There is an important distinction between the two from an ownership perspective, though, he said.

“With cryptocurrencies, your keys equal direct ownership of the asset. With real-world assets or stablecoins, your keys secure the token, but the underlying asset remains with an issuer or custodian,” Bourdon said, adding:

A Cosmic Void May Be Skewing Our Understanding of the Universe

Our understanding of cosmology hinges on how well we know our own local universe, which remains poorly mapped and poorly understood

By Paul M. Sutter edited by Clara Moskowitz

“You can journey to the ends of the earth in search of success,” 19th-century Baptist preacher Russell Conwell is said to have proclaimed, “but if you're lucky, you will discover happiness in your own backyard.”

Modern cosmology has stepped far beyond our cosmic backyard. We peer into the light from the earliest moments of the big bang. Our surveys stride across the universe, swallowing millions of galaxies at a time. We have mapped and measured the most subtle accelerations of cosmic expansion.

But our understanding of all of that hinges on how well we know our own local neighborhood, which remains poorly mapped and poorly understood.

In April 2024 the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration made headlines with a stunning announcement. Data from the first year of a galaxy survey that captured precise measurements of more than 13 million galaxies revealed slight but significant evidence that dark energy may be weakening with time. That is, the mysterious force or substance that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate might be fading away.

This new result adds to the growing list of problems faced by the leading model of cosmology, called LCDM for “lambda cold dark matter,” which hypothesizes that around 95 percent of all the stuff in the cosmos is either dark energy or dark matter. For years cosmologists have struggled with the so-called Hubble tension, a discrepancy between measurements of the present-day expansion rate based on the nearby universe compared with extrapolations taken from the ancient, distant cosmos.

But to see out into the wider universe and make these grand measurements, we must first look through the nearby cosmos, and that may bias our observations. Like peering through a distorted lens, our perspective may give us the illusion of problems affecting the grand sweep of the heavens when really we're just misinterpreting the data.

So what does our nearby universe look like?

The trouble with building a comprehensive map of the local cosmos (where “local” means out to a distance of a few hundred million light-years) is that to create a full picture, surveys must be deep, broad and complete. They need to map out every region of sky, going as far into the universe as possible, and capture every single galaxy, no matter how small and dim. Most astronomical surveys, however, typically achieve only two out of those three goals.

For example, in 2013 a team of researchers, Ryan Keenan, Amy Barger and Lennox Cowie, studied the possible existence of what was then known as the “local hole.” Since renamed the KBC void, it's a possible depression in the local density of the universe stretching two billion light-years wide. It's a not a particularly deep depression: this local span of the universe looks to be just 10 to 20 percent less dense than the cosmic average. But it might be enough to mess with our observations of cosmic expansion: the galaxies inside the void could experience an extra gravitational tug outward from all the higher-density regions on the outside, adding a bias that otherwise wouldn't be there and potentially alleviating the Hubble tension.

Shortly after the DESI results, Indranil Banik of the University of Portsmouth in England and Vasileios Kalaitzidis of the University of St Andrews in Scotland invoked the KBC void to explain those findings as well, arguing that these measurements are distorted because they are, essentially, anchored on the wrong assumption.

Cosmologists assume, and comprehensive surveys have shown, that the universe is homogenous at large scales, meaning basically the same in all directions. A patch of sufficiently large volume should be largely like any other patch. Sure, there will be different arrangements of galaxies and clusters and voids, but the statistics of those structures—their sizes and separations, and so on—will be the same. Yet it's not exactly clear where homogeneity kicks in or how far out our local universe can be different without running afoul of LCDM. Once we allow for the existence of the KBC void, Banik and Kalaitzidis argue, then the need for evolving dark energy might go away.

But we're not exactly sure if the KBC void actually exists. It does appear, given our limited surveys of the nearby universe, that there are indeed fewer galaxies in our billion-light-year patch than there are outside of it. But again, comprehensive astronomical surveys are notoriously tricky.

In May 2025 a team of cosmologists published the findings of a multiyear study into the structure of the nearby universe that casts some doubt on the empty spot. The researchers' tool wasn't a new telescope or instrument, though. It was a computer.

The team took existing catalogs of galaxy surveys and fed the data into a computer simulation of the growth of cosmic structure structures and the appearance of galaxies in an attempt to create a complete picture of the local universe. But these simulations contain all manner of tunable variables, such as the amount of dark energy in the universe and the efficiency of galaxies' star production. And the surveys themselves are far from complete, with gaps, holes and missing data; an unknown number of galaxies are too small and dim to be captured.

So the researchers used Bayesian statistics, a kind of statistical approach that cleanly incorporates prior knowledge and assumptions. They ran simulation after simulation, varying every possible parameter, to build up a suite of mock galaxy surveys that were statistically compatible with the actual data.

At the end of their exhaustive analysis, they were able to find matches to most of the known superclusters near the Milky Way with high statistical likelihood, implying that the clusters astronomers think they see in galaxy surveys are indeed the real deal and not a fluke of poor-quality data.

But there was no sign of the KBC void.

This study is not the final word, just a statistical analysis of the likelihood of the KBC void actually existing given the quality of current galaxy surveys. Plus, cosmologists don't know if large density variations in the distribution of galaxies around the Milky Way are enough to account for the Hubble tension and the DESI results.

But the lesson of these studies is clear. As we continue to scan the wider heavens and pierce deeply into the abyss in search of cosmic mysteries, we can't ignore the portion of the nearby universe that we call home.

“Your diamonds are not in the far distant mountains or in yonder seas,” Conwell reportedly said. “They are in your own backyard, if you but dig for them.”

Spouses Tend to Share Psychiatric Disorders, Massive Study Finds

Spouses often share psychiatric diagnoses, according to an analysis of almost 15 million people in three countries

By Mohana Basu & Nature magazine

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

People with a psychiatric disorder are more likely to marry someone who has the same condition than to partner with someone who doesn't, according to a massive study suggesting that the pattern persists across cultures and generations.

Researchers had previously noted this trend in Nordic countries, but the phenomenon has seldom been investigated outside Europe.

The latest study, published in Nature Human Behaviour today, used data from more than 14.8 million people in Taiwan, Denmark and Sweden. It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.

Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.

The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.

Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns around the world. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.

The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.

Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.

Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person's choice of spouse.

Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.

Because genetics is involved in the development of psychiatric disorders, Fullerton says that the tendency for people to select a partner who has similar psychiatric symptoms increases the risk of such disorders occurring in subsequent generations.

The study found that children who have two parents with the same disorder are twice as likely to develop the condition as are children who have only one affected parent.

William Reay, a statistical geneticist at the Menzies Institute for Medical Research in Hobart, Australia, says more research is needed before psychiatrists change how they communicate the genetic risks of mental-health disorders to patients.

But Moinak Bannerjee, a molecular geneticist at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvanthapuram, India, suggests that people in general would not be aware of the risks of marrying someone with the same psychiatric disorders — which means that the results will be helpful for counselling couples about genetic risks.

How to Read Hurricane Maps and Avoid Common Mistakes

Hurricane forecast maps are more complex than they appear. Understanding them could change how you prepare for the next storm.

By Rachel Feltman, Andrea Thompson, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

National Hurricane Center

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

While scientists have gotten much better at predicting where hurricanes will go, there's still a lot of confusion about what forecast maps can actually tell us. That “cone of uncertainty,” for instance? It probably doesn't mean what you think it means.

Here to break down how to read these crucial forecasts—and to explain why you should keep checking them even after you think you know what a storm will do—is Andrea Thompson, senior news editor for sustainability at Scientific American.

Thanks for coming on to chat with us.

Andrea Thompson: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So let's start by just reminding our listeners when hurricane season is, because I feel like a lot of folks just kind of associate hurricanes with summer in, like, a spiritual sense, but we're still really in it, aren't we [laughs]?

Thompson: We are. So hurricane season, the actual dates are sort of artificially imposed. They run from June 1 to November 30 for the Atlantic Ocean, and that's just because those dates encapsulate, you know, the vast majority of hurricane formation. We do sometimes see hurricanes form before June 1 or after November 30, but they're rarer. And we do associate hurricane season with the summer, but the peak of the season is actually at the very end of that: the peak of the season runs from about mid-August until October, so September is really kind of the prime time for hurricane season.

Feltman: Yeah, so people should definitely still be prepared to see some hurricane alerts in the coming weeks, which is why I was so excited to see your piece about, you know, decoding and demystifying what those forecasts mean.

So let's start with: What is the “cone of uncertainty,” which, as you pointed out in your piece, really sounds like something kind of mystical [laughs].

Thompson: Yeah, exactly. So really, it's just meant to say the—show where the hurricane is most likely to go and, specifically, the center of the hurricane. So there's often a misinterpretation of it that, “Oh, it encompasses where the hurricane impacts will be, so if you're outside of the cone, you're safe.” That's not true at all. It's just meant to show, “Okay, this is where we think the center of the storm is most likely to go in the coming days.” And, you know, sort of the center of that cone is the most likely track, but anything within it is sort of possible. And that cone is based not on the range of model output; it's based on the average error that the forecasters have had in their track forecast over the past five years.

Feltman: Hmm, so if I'm looking at this cone of uncertainty, what information can I get out of it? You know, what should my takeaways be about where this storm's going and what it might mean for me?

Thompson: So it's really a good sort of first take. If you see—and we have an example in the story of Hurricane Milton. So you could see that storm last year, and if you were in, say, New Orleans, you could look at that cone of uncertainty and say, “Okay, it's really covering Florida. I am far enough away that it's probably not a big deal to me.” But if you were in, say, Pensacola, you couldn't necessarily do that because you're close enough to the cone that you might still feel some of the influence of the storm, and because storm tracks can change you kind of [could say], “Okay, maybe I need to just be watching this, but it's not a ‘I have to evacuate right now kind of situation.'” Versus, say, if you were in Tampa, you really needed to pay attention to the storm because you were sort of right in the center of that cone of uncertainty.

So it's sort of just a first take of: “Do I need to pay attention to this? Do I not?” And then it's—you know, if you are in the area of threats, it's not gonna tell you that much ...

Feltman: Mm.

Thompson: About what the actual threats are—from this specific graphic.

Feltman: Yeah, we'll definitely get into where you start looking for that information as forecasts, you know, build in more information about threats. But looking at this initial sort of big cone forecast, what can it tell us about the timing of the storm?

Thompson: Yeah, so it will look out over either three to five days, depending on which view you look at on the National Hurricane Center website. And it basically runs every 12 hours: so here's where it'll be at 7:00 A.M. on Monday, at 7:00 A.M. on Tuesday. And that just gives you sort of a look at the progress of the storm and when a storm sort of might be hitting a particular area at sort of designated points in time looking out.

Feltman: And I would assume that, you know, similar to the trajectory being about the center of the storm, the sort of when the storm hits might not necessarily tell you when you might see some impacts from the storm. Is that right?

Thompson: Yeah, so because the cone of uncertainty is talking about the center of the storm, well, the storm extends far out from the center. And, you know, that can range a lot; there's a big variation in the size of storms. And so you are often feeling the outermost what they call bands of the storm well before the center would actually ...

Feltman: Mm.

Thompson: Hit you. That can, you know, start with tropical storm force and build up to hurricane force depending on where you are in relation to the hurricane.

Feltman: Yeah, well, in, in, in August we had a great example of that in the Northeast and along the East Coast, where we had crazy riptides because of Hurricane Erin, even though, you know, if you were looking at sort of the track of the hurricane, you'd be like, “It's still out in the ocean; it's fine.” But apparently, no one could go swimming, so it was not fine [laughs].

And yeah, speaking of strength, what can that cone of uncertainty tell us about what we can expect from the strength of the storm and what information should people actually take away from that versus what's still very much up in the air?

Thompson: Right, so it has color-coded circles with letters in them, and those are just sort of a rough first look at the strength of the storm. So if there's an “S,” it's a tropical storm; “H” is hurricane; “M” is major hurricane, which means Category 3 or higher on the five-category Saffir-Simpson scale. And that's based solely on wind speed. And that's another really important point about the cone of uncertainty, is that the only threat it really gets at is wind-speed threat. And that is definitely not the only threat from a hurricane. Storm surge is another one, and rain is another one. So you're not getting the information, really, on those threats if you're just looking at the cone of uncertainty.

It will also tell you whether the storm is tropical or what they call post-tropical or extratropical, and that just has to do with sort of where the storm is getting its power. A tropical storm is powered by convection, so it's pulling up warm, moist air, and that's sort of driving the engine at its center, versus extratropical storms, which are sort of the weather fronts that we are—typically [experience] day-to-day when you have a rainy day.

Feltman: So the cone of uncertainty, there's a lot of information built in, but it kind of boils down to, like, this is a first-glance, major takeaways [tool]: “Is this anywhere near me? Do I need to be paying close attention to forecasts?” But once people realize that they might be somewhere near the projected path, where should they be looking for more information, and what kind of information should they be looking for?

Thompson: Right, so one of your best points of information is any trusted local weather source. So that could be your local TV weatherperson. That could be the local National Weather Service office because they're the ones that are sort of taking high-level information from the National Hurricane Center and then looking at, “What does that mean for our specific area?” Because the hazards from a hurricane can be really localized, especially things like storm surge or rain. Storm surge is—how high it gets is based not just on, you know, the wind speeds of the storm and how big it is, but the topography of the coast itself. That can vary a lot over a short distance. So, you know, looking at those local sources is gonna give you a much better sense of what you face, specifically, where you are.

There are some other tools that aren't just listening to the TV broadcast or whatnot. The National Hurricane Center does put out detailed maps showing expected storm surge levels, and those are a product of dedicated funding and research into how to better model storm surge and how to present it to people in a way that's helpful. And with those maps you can get [a] pretty detailed look at the coastline and what the expected levels of storm surge is, sort of all the way along a coast.

There is also something called the Hurricane Threats and Impacts tool, and that comes from the National Weather Service, and basically, that takes all of the localized forecasts from a hurricane from all the various weather-service offices that are sort of in the area where the hurricane might hit and puts them all together so you can look at where you are and see, “Here's my storm surge threat; here's my rain threat; here's the wind threat,” and kind of get a sense of all of those and what are the things you need to be paying attention to. And that can be helpful just in terms of, like, “Okay, am I really in the storm surge area, or am I kind of outside it?”

But you really need to pay attention to local emergency managers and other local officials, and if they give orders to, say, evacuate, really heed those because they are looking at this detailed information and saying, “Okay, these areas are under significant enough threat that we don't want people there and in harm's way.”

Feltman: Well, and I think the last point to really hit on is that, as you mention in your piece, forecasts do change and people have a tendency to see a bunch of information, be like, “Great, I have checked the forecast; I know what the storm is doing,” and then sort of move on. But that's not really how storms work, right [laughs]?

Thompson: So storms can and do change pretty quickly. You know, we are pretty good now at forecasting storms and sort of catching some of these changes that, before forecasts, [we] would not have been able to get. But, you know, there are still surprises, and a five-mile difference in where a storm actually makes landfall can make a pretty big difference to the impacts on the ground, depending on where you are.

And storms do still sometimes change intensity really quickly, especially what we call rapid intensification, where they jump up in strength really fast, and that can make a big difference to the impacts that are felt. And if you were looking at a forecast two days ago and said, “Oh, it's only supposed to be a tropical storm when it hits,” and then aren't paying attention, you're gonna get a big surprise [laughs] if it's now, say, a Category 4 hurricane.

Feltman: Right, so we're pretty good at telling people whether the storm is gonna be anywhere near them, but if it's gonna be anywhere near you, the impact it could have is sort of subject to change [laughs], so you wanna pay attention to that.

Well, thank you so much for coming on. You always do such a great job demystifying the weather for us, so I really appreciate it.

Thompson: Yeah, happy to be here. Thanks.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to dive into the recent shake-ups at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scientists sought to work out genetic errors by creating their own artificial genome, which replaced E. coli's original genome and used less genetic material.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The genetic code for just about all forms of life on Earth is fairly universal. It has the same 64 codons (sequences of nucleotides), molecules that both encode the amino acids (which encode the formation of proteins) and create the bases of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. Why mess with something that hasn't changed in billions of years?

Despite nature having its reasons for leaving some things unchanged, biologist Jason Chin from Oxford University, still decided to change things up. It turns out some codons have extra copies of directions for encoding amino acids and signals for switching the formation of proteins on and off. Chin wanted to see if life could still function with less. He already managed to prove that when he synthesized Syn61—E. coli bacteria with three fewer codons than before. But now, he has gone even further with the synthetic organism Syn57—E. coli with a 57-codon genome.

Narrowing down the codons that encode protein synthesis can make some organisms resistant to viruses—synthetic genetic codes transferred to organisms can actually block viruses, which genetically alter an organism by injecting cells with RNA that carries codes for producing viral proteins. It can also enable more efficient protein synthesis and help build protein polymers (chains of at least 500 amino acids). Protein polymers can behave like natural proteins, but they can also be designed to solve problems on a molecular level. 

“Emerging methods for the total synthesis of genomes provide opportunities to explore genome sequences that cannot be accessed by editing,” Chin and his research team said in a study recently published in Science. “Synthetic genomes may be radically different from those accessed by natural evolution, and genome synthesis provides a route to generating sequence and function that is [nonexistant] with respect to extant life.”

Previously, other teams of researchers have removed stop codons, which signal protein synthesis to end, from the E. coli genome. This was done through mutagenesis, or creating gene mutations by tweaking DNA. However, mutagenesis has its downsides—it often ends up with excess mutations, and can have difficulty adjusting the numbers of sense codons (which encode amino acids) versus stop codons. 

Syn61 already showed how organisms could survive with just 61 codons, but the question was whether or not that was the limit. In synthesizing the genetic code for Syn57, Chin swapped out repeating codons and made over a hundred thousand codon changes to the original. Some re-coded groups of codons needed to be tolerated over an entire region of the genome, while in other cases, a codon only needed to be replaced with a viable substitute. He then assembled the DNA into an artificial chromosome, introduced it into the E. coli genome (this was done for each group of codons), and sequenced the clones to see how successful they were.

Several strains of E. coli were cultured before the final version emerged. As bacterial strains within the lab-created genome cloned themselves, they were analyzed for growth. Taking a closer look at two strains revealed that recoded regions of the genome actually limited growth. When more alterations were made to these sections of the genome, however, growth improved in these strains. It was the final synthetic strain that Chin named Syn57. In upcoming research, he plans to continue testing the limits of a genome.

“In future work, we will build on the generation of the deeply recoded strain we have created to explore the generation of deeply [edited] genetic codes, enhanced virus resistance, the genetic coding of [new proteins] and [new polymers],” he said.

This synthetic life had its genome replaced instead of being created from scratch. Maybe it could tell us something about how life—and the genes that determine its traits—originated on Earth.

A grim discovery sheds new light on the dark history of a Nazi fortress.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

Amateur archaeologists were recently searching for stray artifacts in an abandoned building in Poland when they made a sinister discovery beneath the floorboards: five decaying bodies with their hands and feet missing.

The site was an infamous villa that belonged to Nazi Party leader Hermann Göring within Adolf Hitler's secret military headquarters, the Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair), which was deserted after a 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler and later partially destroyed by retreating German forces near the end of World War II.

Reuters reports that the Latebra Foundation, which has scoured the site of the Wolf's Lair “with official permission for several years,” discovered the bodies of three adults, an older child, and a baby buried just below what would have been the floor of Göring's villa. In 1939, Hitler designated Göring, at the time the commander of the German air force, as his successor.

The discovery at the site raises a host of haunting questions, including about what transpired beneath the villa's ruins in the decades since the fall of the Third Reich.

“Everyone wondered what might have happened there ... We tried to think of something, but nothing reasonable comes to mind,” Latebra member Dominik Markiewicz told Reuters. “We didn't know what we were dealing with at all. Were they some occult rituals of Third Reich fanatics? We have no idea.”

Latebra called the police, prompting an investigation and a forensic examination of the remains. Although the case has since been closed, and there are no conclusive answers, a new report has provided additional clues into the potential origins of the bodies.

How did it take so long for the bodies to be discovered? While the Latebra Foundation has been searching the Wolf's Lair site for years, mostly finding “uniform buttons, tools, and machine parts,” per Reuters, the archaeologists only recently focused on Göring's villa due to the sheer amount of ground they had to cover. The villa was just one of approximately 200 buildings scattered across the huge compound, which spans an area of over 617 acres of land.

The Wolf's Lair was off limits to the public for nearly 50 years after World War II. It sustained significant damage at the hands of the Nazis themselves, who didn't want it to fall into the hands of the advancing Soviet forces. Hitler ordered its destruction shortly after his last visit in November 1944, with the actual demolition occurring in late January 1945, after the Soviets began their Vistula–Oder offensive. 

On the same day the Soviets liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp, they captured the Wolf's Lair without firing a single shot. Under Soviet control, the site fell into disrepair and was closed off to any exploration or excavation. The public couldn't access the site until the collapse of communism in Poland in 1990, which may explain how the corpses remained hidden for so long.

Besides, archaeologists wouldn't have necessarily looked to find remains at the Wolf's Lair, as it wasn't a death camp. Designed as Hitler's Eastern Front headquarters, this highly secretive complex served as the strategic center for the Nazi leadership to orchestrate their military campaign against the Soviet Union. 

In fact, the most famous act of violence to take place at the Wolf's Lair during the Third Reich was directed at Hitler himself. On July 20, 1944, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg carried out an assassination attempt on Hitler in a Wolf's Lair conference room, by placing a bomb concealed in a briefcase. Although the explosion resulted in the death of four Nazi officers and injured others, Hitler narrowly escaped with his life, largely due to the fortuitous shielding provided by a sturdy table leg that absorbed the brunt of the blast. 

Who were the five people buried where Nazi leaders once plotted? A new report in National Geographic pieces together some clues from the initial investigation:

So, it's possible the bodies were buried on the site before the Wolf's Lair was even built. (Construction concluded on the compound in June of 1941.)

Some experts have tried to connect the corpses to ritual sacrifice, as leading Nazi figures like Heinrich Himmler reportedly engaged in occult practices, according to NatGeo. They point to the presence of “dart-shaped stones called belemnites” near the bodies, which were reportedly sometimes placed at pagan burial sites as a “good luck charm.” But belemnite also naturally occurs in that area, so it's tough to definitively interpret the stones' proximity to the graves as evidence of ritualistic practices.

Since the corpses date back to a period between 1918 and 1939, the Latebra Foundation plans to proceed with radiocarbon dating. This analysis aims to pinpoint the bodies' time of death more precisely, potentially narrowing it down to a span of just a few years. But, as NatGeo notes, even if these three adults and two children were buried before the Nazis ever set foot within the Wolf's Lair, that also carries a disturbing implication:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A simple metal could solve the world's plastic recycling problem","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250902085150.htm","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 07:39:56 GMT","

The future of plastic recycling may soon get much less complicated, frustrating and tedious.

In a new study, Northwestern University chemists have introduced a new plastic upcycling process that can drastically reduce -- or perhaps even fully bypass -- the laborious chore of pre-sorting mixed plastic waste.

The process harnesses a new, inexpensive nickel-based catalyst that selectively breaks down polyolefin plastics consisting of polyethylenes and polypropylenes -- the single-use kind that dominates nearly two-thirds of global plastic consumption. This means industrial users could apply the catalyst to large volumes of unsorted polyolefin waste.

When the catalyst breaks down polyolefins, the low-value solid plastics transform into liquid oils and waxes, which can be upcycled into higher-value products, including lubricants, fuels and candles. Not only can it be used multiple times, but the new catalyst can also break down plastics contaminated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a toxic polymer that notoriously makes plastics ""unrecyclable.""

The study was published on Sept. 2 in the journal Nature Chemistry.

""One of the biggest hurdles in plastic recycling has always been the necessity of meticulously sorting plastic waste by type,"" said Northwestern's Tobin Marks, the study's senior author. ""Our new catalyst could bypass this costly and labor-intensive step for common polyolefin plastics, making recycling more efficient, practical and economically viable than current strategies.""

""When people think of plastic, they likely are thinking about polyolefins,"" said Northwestern's Yosi Kratish, a co-corresponding author on the paper. ""Basically, almost everything in your refrigerator is polyolefin based -- squeeze bottles for condiments and salad dressings, milk jugs, plastic wrap, trash bags, disposable utensils, juice cartons and much more. These plastics have a very short lifetime, so they are mostly single-use. If we don't have an efficient way to recycle them, then they end up in landfills and in the environment, where they linger for decades before degrading into harmful microplastics.""

A world-renowned catalysis expert, Marks is the Vladimir N. Ipatieff Professor of Catalytic Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. He is also a faculty affiliate at the Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy. Kratish is a research assistant professor in Marks' group, and an affiliated faculty member at the Trienens Institute. Qingheng Lai, a research associate in Marks' group, is the study's first author. Marks, Kratish and Lai co-led the study with Jeffrey Miller, a professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University; Michael Wasielewski, Clare Hamilton Hall Professor of Chemistry at Weinberg; and Takeshi Kobayashi a research scientist at Ames National Laboratory.

The polyolefin predicament

From yogurt cups and snack wrappers to shampoo bottles and medical masks, most people interact with polyolefin plastics multiple times throughout the day. Because of its versatility, polyolefins are the most used plastic in the world. By some estimates, industry produces more than 220 million tons of polyolefin products globally each year. Yet, according to a 2023 report in the journal Nature, recycling rates for polyolefin plastics are alarmingly low, ranging from less than 1% to 10% worldwide.

The main reason for this disappointing recycling rate is polyolefin's sturdy, stubborn composition. It contains small molecules linked together with carbon-carbon bonds, which are famously difficult to break.

""When we design catalysts, we target weak spots,"" Kratish said. ""But polyolefins don't have any weak links. Every bond is incredibly strong and chemically unreactive.""

Problems with current processes

Currently, only a few, less-than-ideal processes exist that can recycle polyolefin. It can be shredded into flakes, which are then melted and downcycled to form low-quality plastic pellets. But because different types of plastics have different properties and melting points, the process requires workers to scrupulously separate various types of plastics. Even small amounts of other plastics, food residue or non-plastic materials can compromise an entire batch. And those compromised batches go straight into the landfill.

Another option involves heating plastics to incredibly high temperatures, reaching 400 to 700 degrees Celsius. Although this process degrades polyolefin plastics into a useful mixture of gases and liquids, it's extremely energy intensive.

""Everything can be burned, of course,"" Kratish said. ""If you apply enough energy, you can convert anything to carbon dioxide and water. But we wanted to find an elegant way to add the minimum amount of energy to derive the maximum value product.""

Precision engineering

To uncover that elegant solution, Marks, Kratish and their team looked to hydrogenolysis, a process that uses hydrogen gas and a catalyst to break down polyolefin plastics into smaller, useful hydrocarbons. While hydrogenolysis approaches already exist, they typically require extremely high temperatures and expensive catalysts made from noble metals like platinum and palladium.

""The polyolefin production scale is huge, but the global noble metal reserves are very limited,"" Lai said. ""We cannot use the entire metal supply for chemistry. And, even if we did, there still would not be enough to address the plastic problem. That's why we're interested in Earth-abundant metals.""

For its polyolefin recycling catalyst, the Northwestern team pinpointed cationic nickel, which is synthesized from an abundant, inexpensive and commercially available nickel compound. While other nickel nanoparticle-based catalysts have multiple reaction sites, the team designed a single-site molecular catalyst.

The single-site design enables the catalyst to act like a highly specialized scalpel -- preferentially cutting carbon-carbon bonds -- rather than a less controlled blunt instrument that indiscriminately breaks down the plastic's entire structure. As a result, the catalyst allows for the selective breakdown of branched polyolefins (such as isotactic polypropylene) when they are mixed with unbranched polyolefins -- effectively separating them chemically.

""Compared to other nickel-based catalysts, our process uses a single-site catalyst that operates at a temperature 100 degrees lower and at half the hydrogen gas pressure,"" Kratish said. ""We also use 10 times less catalyst loading, and our activity is 10 times greater. So, we are winning across all categories.""

Accelerated by contamination

With its single, precisely defined and isolated active site, the nickel-based catalyst possesses unprecedented activity and stability. The catalyst is so thermally and chemically stable, in fact, that it maintains control even when exposed to contaminants like PVC. Used in pipes, flooring and medical devices, PVC is visually similar to other types of plastics but significantly less stable upon heating. Upon decomposition, PVC releases hydrogen chloride gas, a highly corrosive byproduct that typically deactivates catalysts and disrupts the recycling process.

Amazingly, not only did Northwestern's catalyst withstand PVC contamination, PVC actually accelerated its activity. Even when the total weight of the waste mixture is made up of 25% PVC, the scientists found their catalyst still worked with improved performance. This unexpected result suggests the team's method might overcome one of the biggest hurdles in mixed plastic recycling -- breaking down waste currently deemed ""unrecyclable"" due to PVC contamination. The catalyst also can be regenerated over multiple cycles through a simple treatment with inexpensive alkylaluminium.

""Adding PVC to a recycling mixture has always been forbidden,"" Kratish said. ""But apparently, it makes our process even better. That is crazy. It's definitely not something anybody expected.""

The study, ""Stable single-site organo-Ni catalyst preferentially hydrogenolyzes branched polyolefin C-C bonds,"" was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (award number DE-SC0024448) and The Dow Chemical Company.

Certain brain cells are responsible for coordinating smooth, controlled movements of the body. But when those cells are constantly overactivated for weeks on end, they degenerate and ultimately die. This new observation made by scientists at Gladstone Institutes may help explain what goes awry in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease.

Researchers have long known that a particular subset of neurons die as Parkinson's disease progresses, but they aren't sure why. The new work, published in the scientific journal eLife, shows that in mice, chronic activation of these neurons can directly cause their demise. The scientists hypothesize that in Parkinson's, neuron overactivation could be triggered by a combination of genetic factors, environmental toxins, and the need to compensate for other neurons that are lost.

""An overarching question in the Parkinson's research field has been why the cells that are most vulnerable to the disease die,"" says Gladstone Investigator Ken Nakamura, MD, PhD, who led the study. ""Answering that question could help us understand why the disease occurs and point toward new ways to treat it.""

Too Much Buzz

More than 8 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative brain disease that causes tremors, slowed movement, stiff muscles, and problems walking and balancing.

Scientists know that a set of neurons that produce dopamine and support voluntary movements die in people with Parkinson's. Many lines of evidence also suggest that the activity of these cells actually increases with disease, both before and after degeneration begins. But whether this change in activity can directly cause cell death is poorly understood.

In the new study, Nakamura and his colleagues tackled this question by introducing a receptor specifically into dopamine neurons in mice that allowed them to increase the cells' activity by treating the animals with a drug, clozapin-N-oxide (CNO). Uniquely, the scientists added CNO to the animals' drinking water, driving chronic activation of the neurons.

""In previous work, we and others have transiently activated these cells with injections of CNO or by other means, but that only led to short bursts of activation,"" says Katerina Rademacher, a graduate student in Nakamura's lab and first author of the study. ""By delivering CNO through drinking water, we get a relatively continuous activation of the cells, and we think that's important in modeling what happens in people with Parkinson's disease.""

Within a few days of overactivating dopamine neurons, the animals' typical cycle of daytime and nighttime activities became disrupted. After one week, the researchers could detect degeneration of the long projections (called axons) extending from some dopamine neurons. By one month, the neurons were beginning to die.

Importantly, the changes mostly affected one subset of dopamine neurons -- those found in the region of the brain known as the substantia nigra, which is responsible for movement control -- while sparing dopamine neurons in brain regions responsible for motivation and emotions. This is the same pattern of cellular degeneration seen in people with Parkinson's disease.

A Link to Human Disease

To gain insight into why overactivation leads to neuronal degeneration, the researchers studied the molecular changes that occurred in the dopamine neurons before and after the overactivation. They showed that overactivation of the neurons led to changes in calcium levels and in the expression of genes related to dopamine metabolism.

""In response to chronic activation, we think the neurons may try to avoid excessive dopamine -- which can be toxic -- by decreasing the amount of dopamine they produce,"" Rademacher explains. ""Over time, the neurons die, eventually leading to insufficient dopamine levels in the brain areas that support movement.""

When the researchers measured the levels of genes in brain samples from patients with early-stage Parkinson's, they found similar changes; genes related to dopamine metabolism, calcium regulation, and healthy stress responses were turned down.

The research did not reveal why activity of the dopamine neurons might increase with Parkinson's disease, but Nakamura hypothesizes that there could be multiple causes, including genetic and environmental factors. The overactivity could also be part of a vicious cycle initiated early in disease. As dopamine neurons become overactive, they gradually shut down dopamine production, which worsens movement problems. Remaining neurons work even harder to compensate, ultimately leading to cell exhaustion and death.

""If that's the case, it raises the exciting possibility that adjusting the activity patterns of vulnerable neurons with drugs or deep brain stimulation could help protect them and slow disease progression,"" Nakamura says.

One of the first parts of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease is the entorhinal cortex -- a region that plays a big role in memory, spatial navigation, and the brain's internal mapping system.

With support from the Commonwealth of Virginia's Alzheimer's and Related Diseases Research Award Fund (ARDRAF), Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC scientists Sharon Swanger and Shannon Farris are working to understand why this area is especially vulnerable.

Swanger studies how brain cells communicate across synapses in disease-susceptible brain circuits, while Farris focuses on how different circuits in the brain's memory center function at the molecular level. Their overlapping expertise made the collaboration a natural fit.

""We've both been studying how circuits differ at the molecular level for a while,"" said Swanger, an assistant professor at the research institute. ""This new collaborative project brings together my work on synapses and Shannon's on mitochondria in a way that addresses a big gap in the Alzheimer's disease field.""

""This kind of state-level support is critical,"" Farris said. ""It gives researchers in Virginia the chance to ask questions that may eventually make a difference for people living with Alzheimer's. It's meaningful to be part of research that could help people facing that journey.""

A key focus of their research is mitochondria -- tiny structures inside brain cells that provide the energy needed for a variety of cellular functions in neurons including synaptic transmission. In Alzheimer's disease, mitochondria stop working properly in the course of the disease.

Farris and Swanger are investigating whether mitochondria in a vulnerable memory-related circuit may become overloaded with calcium, a key signaling chemical for multiple neuronal and synaptic processes. That overload could contribute to the early breakdown of memory circuits.

""The connection between these cells is one of the first to fail in Alzheimer's,"" Farris said. ""We found that this synapse has unusually strong calcium signals in nearby mitochondria -- so strong we can see them clearly under a light microscope. Those kinds of signals are hard to ignore. It gives us a model where we can really watch what's happening as things start to go wrong.""

To test their hypothesis, the researchers will study brain tissue from healthy mice and mice with certain aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. By comparing how mitochondria function and how brain cells communicate across synapses in each group, they hope to find early signs of stress or failure in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit.

Swanger and Farris are members of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's Center for Neurobiology Research and also faculty in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.

The European Space Agency-led Solar Orbiter mission has split the flood of energetic particles flung out into space from the Sun into two groups, tracing each back to a different kind of outburst from our star.

The Sun is the most energetic particle accelerator in the Solar System. It whips up electrons to nearly the speed of light and flings them out into space, flooding the Solar System with so-called 'Solar Energetic Electrons' (SEEs).

Researchers have now used Solar Orbiter to pinpoint the source of these energetic electrons and trace what we see out in space back to what's actually happening on the Sun. In a paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics on September 1, they explain that they found two kinds of SEE with clearly distinct stories: one connected to intense solar flares (explosions from smaller patches of the Sun's surface), and one to larger eruptions of hot gas from the Sun's atmosphere (known as 'coronal mass ejections', or CMEs).

""We see a clear split between 'impulsive' particle events, where these energetic electrons speed off the Sun's surface in bursts via solar flares, and 'gradual' ones associated with more extended CMEs, which release a broader swell of particles over longer periods of time,"" says lead author Alexander Warmuth of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP), Germany.

A clearer connection

While scientists were aware that two types of SEE event existed, Solar Orbiter was able to measure a large number of events, and look far closer to the Sun than other missions had, to reveal how they form and leave the surface of our star.

""We were only able to identify and understand these two groups by observing hundreds of events at different distances from the Sun with multiple instruments - something that only Solar Orbiter can do,"" adds Alexander. ""By going so close to our star, we could measure the particles in a 'pristine' early state and thus accurately determine the time and place they started at the Sun.""

Flight delays

The researchers detected the SEE events at different distances from the Sun. This let them study how the electrons behave as they travel through the Solar System, answering a lingering question about these energetic particles.

When we spot a flare or a CME, there's often an apparent lag between what we see taking place at the Sun, and the release of energetic electrons into space. In extreme cases, the particles seem to take hours to escape. Why?

""It turns out that this is at least partly related to how the electrons travel through space - it could be a lag in release, but also a lag in detection,"" says co-author and ESA Research Fellow Laura Rodríguez-García. ""The electrons encounter turbulence, get scattered in different directions, and so on, so we don't spot them immediately. These effects build up as you move further from the Sun.""

The space between the Sun and the planets of the Solar System isn't empty. A wind of charged particles streams out from the Sun constantly, dragging the Sun's magnetic field with it. It fills space and influences how the energetic electrons travel; rather than being able to go where they like, they are confined, scattered, and disturbed by this wind and its magnetism.

The study fulfils an important goal of Solar Orbiter: to continuously monitor our star and its surroundings to trace ejected particles back to their sources at the Sun.

""Thanks to Solar Orbiter, we're getting to know our star better than ever,"" says Daniel Müller, ESA Project Scientist for Solar Orbiter. ""During its first five years in space, Solar Orbiter has observed a wealth of Solar Energetic Electron events. As a result, we've been able to perform detailed analyses and assemble a unique database for the worldwide community to explore.""

Keeping Earth safe

Crucially, the finding is important for our understanding of space weather, where accurate forecasting is essential to keep our spacecraft operational and safe. One of the two kinds of SEE events is more important for space weather: that connected to CMEs, which tend to hold more high-energy particles and so threaten far more damage. Because of this, being able to distinguish between the two types of energetic electrons is hugely relevant for our forecasting.

""Knowledge such as this from Solar Orbiter will help protect other spacecraft in the future, by letting us better understand the energetic particles from the Sun that threaten our astronauts and satellites,"" adds Daniel. ""The research is a really great example of the power of collaboration - it was only possible due to the combined expertise and teamwork of European scientists, instrument teams from across ESA Member States, and colleagues from the US.""

Looking ahead, ESA's Vigil mission will pioneer a revolutionary approach, operationally observing the 'side' of the Sun for the first time, unlocking continuous insights into solar activity. To be launched in 2031, Vigil will detect potentially hazardous solar events before they come into view as seen from Earth, giving us advance knowledge of their speed, direction and chance of impact.

Our understanding of how our planet responds to solar storms will also be investigated further with the launch of ESA's Smile mission next year. Smile will study how Earth endures the relentless 'wind', and sporadic bursts, of fierce particles thrown our way from the Sun, exploring how the particles interact with our planet's protective magnetic field.

Solar Orbiter is a space mission of international collaboration between ESA and NASA, operated by ESA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A weirdly shaped telescope could finally find Earth 2. 0","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250903075205.htm","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:14:08 GMT","

The Earth supports the only known life in the universe, all of it depending heavily on the presence of liquid water to facilitate chemical reactions. While single-celled life has existed almost as long as the Earth itself, it took roughly three billion years for multicellular life to form. Human life has existed for less than one 10 thousandth of the age of the Earth.

All of this suggests that life might be common on planets that support liquid water, but it might be uncommon to find life that studies the universe and seeks to travel through space, like we do. To find extraterrestrial life, it might be necessary for us to travel to it.

However, the vastness of space, coupled with the impossibility of traveling or communicating faster than the speed of light, places practical limits on how far we can roam. Only the closest stars to the sun could possibly be visited in a human lifetime, even by a space probe. In addition, only stars similar in size and temperature to the sun are long-lived enough, and have stable enough atmospheres, for multicellular life to have time to form. For this reason, the most valuable stars to study are the 60 or so sun-like stars that are closer to us than approximately 30 light-years. The most promising planets orbiting these stars would have sizes and temperatures similar to the Earth, so solid ground and liquid water can exist.

A needle in the haystack

Observing an Earth-like exoplanet separately from the star it is orbiting around is a major challenge. Even in the best possible scenario, the star is a million times brighter than the planet; if the two objects are blurred together, there is no hope of detecting the planet. Optics theory says that the best resolution one can get in telescope images depends on the size of the telescope and the wavelength of the observed light. Planets with liquid water give off the most light at wavelengths around 10 microns (the width of a thin human hair and 20 times the typical wavelength of visible light). At this wavelength, a telescope needs to collect light over a distance of at least 20 meters to have enough resolution to separate the Earth from the sun at a distance of 30 light-years. Additionally, the telescope must be in space, because looking through the Earth's atmosphere would blur the image too much. However, our largest space telescope - the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - is only 6.5 meters in diameter, and that telescope was extremely difficult to launch.

Because deploying a 20-meter space telescope seems out-of-reach with current technology, scientists have explored several alternative approaches. One involves launching multiple, smaller telescopes that maintain extremely accurate distances between them, so that the whole set acts as one telescope with a large diameter. But, maintaining the required spacecraft position accuracy (which must be precisely calibrated to the size of a typical molecule) is also currently infeasible.

Other proposals use shorter wavelength light, so that a smaller telescope can be used. However, in visible light a sun-like star is more than 10 billion times brighter than the Earth. It is beyond our current capability to block out enough starlight to be able to see the planet in this case, even if in principle the image has high enough resolution.

One idea for blocking the starlight involves flying a spacecraft called a 'starshade' that is tens of meters across, at a distance of tens of thousands of miles in front of the space telescope, so that it exactly blocks the light from the star while the light from a companion planet is not blocked. However, this plan requires that two spacecraft be launched (a telescope and a starshade). Furthermore, pointing the telescope at different stars would entail moving the starshade thousands of miles, using up prohibitively large quantities of fuel.

A rectangular perspective

In our paper, we propose a more feasible alternative. We show that it is possible to find nearby, Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars with a telescope that is about the same size as JWST, operating at roughly the same infrared (10 micron) wavelength as JWST, with a mirror that is a one by 20 meter rectangle instead of a circle 6.5 meters in diameter.

With a mirror of this shape and size, we can separate a star from an exoplanet in the direction that the telescope mirror is 20 meters long. To find exoplanets at any position around a star, the mirror can be rotated so its long axis will sometimes align with the star and planet. We show that this design can in principle find half of all existing Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars within 30 light-years in less than three years. While our design will need further engineering and optimization before its capabilities are assured, there are no obvious requirements that need intense technological development, as is the case for other leading ideas.

If there is about one Earth-like planet orbiting the average sun-like star, then we would find around 30 promising planets. Follow-up study of these planets could identify those with atmospheres that suggest the presence of life, for example oxygen that was formed through photosynthesis. For the most promising candidate, we could dispatch a probe that would eventually beam back images of the planet's surface. The rectangular telescope could provide a straightforward path towards identifying our sister planet: Earth 2.0.

The widely used diabetes drug metformin changes blood metal levels in humans. The Kobe University study is an important step in understanding the drug's many actions and designing better ones in the future.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed diabetes drug in the world. Apart from lowering blood sugar levels, it is also known to have a broad range of beneficial side effects such as against tumors, inflammations and atherosclerosis. However, although it has been used for more than 60 years now, its mechanism of action is still not clear, hampering the development of even better drugs against these conditions.

Kobe University endocrinologist Wataru Ogawa says: ""It is known that diabetes patients experience changes in the blood levels of metals such as copper, iron and zinc. In addition, chemical studies found that metformin has the ability to bind certain metals, such as copper, and recent studies showed that it is this binding ability that might be responsible for some of the drug's beneficial effects. So, we wanted to know whether metformin actually affects blood metal levels in humans, which had not been clarified."" To do so, Ogawa and his team enlisted about 200 diabetes patients at Kobe University Hospital, half of which took metformin and half of which did not, in a study to analyze their blood serum levels for those metals and various metal deficiency indicators.

In the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care, the Kobe University team now published the first clinical evidence of altered blood metal levels in patients taking metformin. They showed that drug-taking patients have significantly lower copper and iron levels and heightened zinc levels. Ogawa says: ""It is significant that we could show this in humans. Furthermore, since decreases in copper and iron concentrations and an increase in zinc concentration are all considered to be associated with improved glucose tolerance and prevention of complications, these changes may indeed be related to metformin's action.""

Recently, Japan has approved the use of imeglimin, a new diabetes drug that is a derivative of metformin but that should not be able to bind metals the same way as its parent. ""Imeglimin is thought to have a different method of action, and we are already conducting studies to compare the effects the two drugs have,"" says Ogawa.

It is not just about understanding the current drugs, however. Ogawa explains the bigger picture, saying: ""We need both clinical trials and animal experiments to pinpoint the causal relationship between the drug's action and its effects. If such studies progress further, they may lead to the development of new drugs for diabetes and its complications by properly adjusting the metal concentrations in the body.""

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 24H00638) and the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation. It was conducted in collaboration with a researcher from the Kagayaki Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic Sannomiya.

A first-of-its-kind, federally funded clinical trial has shown it's possible to identify breast cancer survivors who are at higher risk of their cancer coming back due to the presence of dormant cancer cells and to effectively treat these cells with repurposed, existing drugs. The research, led by scientists from the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn's Perelman School of Medicine was published today in Nature Medicine.

While breast cancer survival continues to improve, thanks to advances in detection and treatment, when breast cancer relapses -- or returns after initial treatment -- it is still incurable. For the 30 percent of women and men who do relapse, the only option is continuous and indefinite treatment which cannot eliminate the cancer completely. Some breast cancers, like triple negative and HER2+, recur within a few years, and others like ER+ can recur decades later. Until now, there has not been a way to identify those breast cancer survivors who harbor the dormant cells that lead to recurrence in real time and to intervene with a treatment that can prevent incurable relapse.

In a randomized phase II clinical trial with 51 breast cancer survivors, existing drugs were able to clear dormant tumor cells from 80 percent of the study participants. The three-year survival rate without any disease recurrence was above 90 percent in patients who received one drug and 100 percent for patients who received both study drugs.

""The lingering fear of cancer returning is something that hangs over many breast cancer survivors after they celebrate the end of treatment,"" said principal investigator Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, FASCO, the Mariann T. and Robert J. MacDonald Professor in Breast Cancer Research. ""Right now, we just don't know when or if someone's cancer will come back -- that's the problem we set out to solve. Our study shows that preventing recurrence by monitoring and targeting dormant tumor cells is a strategy that holds real promise, and I hope it ignites more research in this area.""

Seizing a window of opportunity to wipe out cancer while it's sleeping 

The study builds on previous research that showed how dormant tumor cells continue to lay in wait in some patients after breast cancer treatment. These so-called ""sleeper cells,"" also referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD), can reactivate years or even decades later. Because they are not ""active"" cancer cells and can be scattered throughout the body, they do not show up on standard imaging tests that are used to watch for breast cancer recurrence.

Once the sleeper cells begin to expand and circulate in the bloodstream, it can lead to the spread of metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have MRD are more likely to experience breast cancer recurrence and have decreased overall survival.

Lewis Chodosh, MD, PhD, chair of Cancer Biology and senior author of the study, previously led research to identify the pathways that allow dormant tumor cells to survive in patients for decades.

""Our research shows that this sleeper phase represents an opportunity to intervene and eradicate the dormant tumor cells before they have the chance to come back as aggressive, metastatic disease,"" Chodosh said. ""Surprisingly, we've found that certain drugs that don't work against actively growing cancers can be very effective against these sleeper cells. This tells us that the biology of dormant tumor cells is very different from active cancer cells.""

In the preclinical part of the latest research publication, Chodosh's team conducted a series of experiments in mice to better understand the underlying mechanisms. They showed that two different drugs -- approved by the FDA to treat other conditions -- could effectively clear MRD in mice, resulting in longer survival without cancer recurrence. The drugs target autophagy and mTOR signaling, which the researchers found were key mechanisms to allow the tumor cells to remain dormant.

Translating science into original clinical trials 

DeMichele's team first enrolled breast cancer survivors who had completed treatment within the last five years and had clear scans into a screening study that looked for dormant tumor cells in participant's bone marrow.

If dormant tumor cells were found, patients were then eligible to enroll in the Phase II CLEVER clinical trial, which randomized patients to receive six cycles of either monotherapy with one of two study drugs, or combination therapy with both drugs. The treatment cleared dormant tumor cells in most patients after six to 12 months. After a median follow-up time of 42 months, only two patients on the study have experienced a cancer recurrence.

""We want to be able to give patients a better option than 'wait and see' after they complete breast cancer treatment,"" DeMichele said. ""We're encouraged by these results that we're on the right track.""

The team is already enrolling patients in two larger, ongoing studies to confirm and extend the results of the CLEVER study: the Phase II ABBY clinical trial and the Phase II PALAVY clinical trial, available at several cancer centers across the country. Patients interested in learning more about these or other breast cancer clinical trials at Penn Medicine should contact [email protected].

The research was made possible with funding from the National Cancer Institute (R01CA208273) and Department of Defense (BC160784), with additional support from the V Foundation, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, QVC ""Shoes on Sale,"" Avon Foundation, Raynier Institute & Foundation, and generous philanthropic donations. DeMichele previously reported interim outcomes data from the study at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023.

The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons3,4,5,6. However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.

This study combines a temporal transect of the Elbe-Saale region in Eastern Germany with the wide-angle view of large-scale demographic and cultural transformations that emerged similarly in other Eastern and Central European regions. Traditionally, on the basis of historical writings, this transformation is attributed to the emigration of ‘Germanic' peoples from East-Central Europe and the arrival of a new population that contemporaries described as ‘Slavs'. These newcomers emerged after the dissolution of the Western Roman empire and mark the transition between the Migration Period (MP, late fourth to late sixth century) and the Slavic Period (SP, from the sixth or seventh century onwards).

At least since the first century bce, the lands between the Rhine and Vistula River were settled by numerous peoples and tribes for whom Roman observers used the umbrella term ‘Germani'7. These Germanic peoples were in contact with the Roman Empire west of the Rhine and south of the Danube, and since the late second century ce increasingly raided Roman provinces8,9. In the MP, many of them left and settled on Roman territory7,8,9,10, among them Vandals, Goths, Franks and Longobards11,12. The Thuringians stayed and established a kingdom, which included the Elbe-Saale region13,14. After the Franks subdued this kingdom10,15 in the 530s, the population declined, while some cemeteries continued14,16. During the seventh century, Slavs are first mentioned east of the Saale, but they soon expanded westward17, forming a contact zone between Slavic- and Germanic-speaking groups.

The term Slavs first appears as an ethnonym in the course of the sixth century in Constantinople and later in the west (Box 1 and Supplementary Note 1.1). Written sources locate them initially north of the Lower Danube, and later in the Carpathian Basin, the Balkans and the Eastern Alps1,2 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Many came under the rule of the Avar steppe empire along the Middle Danube (567 ce to around 800 ce). In the seventh century, there is evidence for the presence of Slavs in much of East-Central and Southeastern Europe. Where Slavs lived, Roman, Germanic and other pre-Slavic infrastructures were usually replaced by rather simple ways of life, archaeologically characterized by small settlements of pit houses, cremation burials, handmade, undecorated pottery and modest, low-metal material culture18, known as the Prague-Korchak group3,4. (Supplementary Note 1.2). More complex social systems and regional rulership developed later in the contact zones with Byzantium and the Christian west.

The similarity of early Slavic cultures was often attributed to a swift spread of Slavs from Northeast of the Carpathians, although debates continue, not only about their geographical origin (Supplementary Note 1,1). In Poland19, the non-native (allochthonist) view assumes Slavic origin from Ukraine–Belarus18, whereas the native (autochthonist) concept asserts that their ancestors inhabited Polish territory since the Bronze Age. Some scholars doubt Slavic expansion by migrations and assume that there was ‘Slavicisation' of existing populations5,18,20,21,22,23,24,25 (Supplementary Note 1,2). Previous modern26 and ancient DNA studies have supported gene flow into the Northern Balkans27 and the Russian Volga-Oka region28, but also argued for population continuity in Poland29, so that the scale and sequence of these movements and their association with ‘Slavic' material culture has remained unclear. Eventually, this cultural transformation led to the replacement of Germanic and other languages in East-Central and Southeastern Europe and the introduction of Slavic languages, which today represent the largest linguistic group in Europe30. Yet, this presumed joint spread of language and material culture is difficult to trace, given that the first longer texts in Slavic were written in the late ninth century5,31.

Together with previously published data from Roman and early medieval Europe27,28,29, the newly analysed ancient DNA from the Elbe-Saale region and complementary data transects from the Northwestern Balkans, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine identify large-scale population movement and a major demographic shift. This can be linked to historical information about the spread of Slavic groups in the sixth to eighth centuries and provides a plausible vector for the spread of Slavic languages across much of Eastern Europe21,23,32.

We selected skeletal remains from 591 ancient individuals from 26 different sites from Central and Eastern Europe (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), creating, in combination with previously published data, a dense sampling transect for three regions: (1) Elbe-Saale Region in Eastern Germany as the main study area; (2) the Northwestern Balkans; and (3) Poland–Northwestern Ukraine (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 7–10). Complementary to these three transects, we generated new data and collected published data from the Baltics and Northwestern Russia to form a reference transect in the east. After hybridization DNA capture and quality filtering (Methods), genome-wide data for 555 unique individuals with a median coverage of 538k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (on 1240k data) were available for analysis, including 359 ancient individuals from the SP, as well as 205 individuals predating the cultural transformations connected to the emergence of the Slavs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We analyse the ancient genome-wide data (Supplementary Table 11) together with an extended dataset of more than 11,500 present-day Europeans (Supplementary Table 3), covering all major Slavic-speaking groups, including data from more than 600 individuals belonging to the Sorbian minority in Eastern Germany33.

a, We assign newly reported (n = 550) and published genomic data (n = 723) to three study transects: the Northwestern Balkans (n = 301) (orange to yellow), Elbe-Saale region (Eastern Germany) (n = 483) (light and dark red), and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine (n = 489) (light and dark blue). We further analyse newly reported and published data from the Baltics as well as the Russian Volga-Oka region as reference, in total covering 1,840 ancient individuals. The size of the symbols corresponds to the number of individuals per site.

We selected samples from all three study regions that predate and postdate the transition to the SP.

To visualize genome-wide ancestry diversity before and after the spread of Slavic groups, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on 10,528 present-day Europeans and projected our newly reported and other relevant ancient genome-wide data onto their genetic variation (Fig. 2). When comparing the SP samples to earlier and present-day data from our three study regions, we observe that the genetic composition within the transects changed markedly between about 600 and 800 ce. In general, the Roman and MP samples that predate the arrival of Slavic groups show high genetic heterogeneity in PCA space, with most samples from Germany and Poland29,34 clustering with present-day continental Northern German, Dutch and Scandinavian populations (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 6, 7, 10 and 12), whereas the Roman and MP individuals from Croatia34 cluster with present-day Italian and Eastern Mediterranean populations (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Note 3).

In Eastern Germany and the Northwestern Balkans, most of the genetic diversity within the Roman and MP clusters follows a north–south cline along PC1. For the Northwestern Balkans, this heterogeneity has been attributed to increasing Eastern Mediterranean ancestry that arrived subsequently to the incorporation of the region into the Roman Empire27,35. More unexpectedly, we detect a high number of MP individuals with non-local, Southern European ancestry in the Elbe-Saale region of Eastern Germany, although this area was never part of the Roman Empire. Using qpAdm36,37, we measure on average between approximately 15% and 25% of Southern European ancestry in all 4 MP sites of the region (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Both PCA-based MOBEST38 analysis and F4 statistics indicate that this non-local ancestry was most probably derived from contemporaneous source populations in Italy and/or the Northern Balkan Peninsula (or other areas of the Roman Empire where people of this ancestry were located) (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5). Previous studies already identified mixed communities of northern and southern ancestry in Hungary and Northern Italy that were interpreted as amalgamation between Northern European newcomers and the local romanized population39,40. In contrast to these earlier results, we do not find evidence that the two different ancestries were correlated to differences in material culture (Supplementary Table 4). Applying a generalized linear model, we demonstrate that neither the presence of grave goods overall, nor certain types of artefacts (such as weapons or brooches) are significantly correlated with either PCA position or ADMIXTURE profiles (Supplementary Fig. 60). Instead, we find the only significant (P < 0.05) correlation between ancestry and material culture among the burial constructions, where we show that individuals buried in pits feature on average higher Northern European ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 60c). The spatial organization of the burials was also not determined by similarity in ancestry. Instead, we observe that individuals were buried close to their biological relatives, within small kin groups composed of individuals with Northern European, Southern European or mixed ancestry, reflecting a high degree of admixture between individuals with different ancestry backgrounds during the MP. Consequently, our data from Eastern Germany demonstrate that the cosmopolitan character of the Roman Empire not only affected the incorporated territories but also facilitated exchange and mobility along its borders and beyond into barbarian lands (Barbaricum), resulting in an unprecedented genetic diversity in Central Europe during34 and, in the case of Eastern Germany, even after its existence. Although the causes and circumstances of their movement to the Elbe-Saale region remain open for speculation, these newcomers apparently adapted the fashions and traditions of the local populations, resulting in a rather homogenous material culture within a group of individuals with diverse genetic backgrounds.

However, this diversity had collapsed in the subsequent SP (Supplementary Note 6). In contrast to the preceding MP, the genetic profile of Eastern Germany during the SP has shifted considerably and clusters nearly exclusively with present-day Slavic-speaking populations (for example, Poles and Belarussians), indicative of a fundamental replacement of genetic ancestry (Fig. 2b,c). A similar pattern is seen in the Northwestern Balkans, Poland–Northwestern Ukraine as well as the Volga-Oka region in Russia28, illustrating that this influx of new genetic material was not limited to certain regions but affected wide areas of Central and Eastern Europe, consistent with the rather simple, very similar archaeological horizons observed during the SP (Supplementary Figs. 10–12). To formally test whether these patterns observed from PCA are consistent with gene-flow events from the east into our study regions, we used F-statistics to quantify genetic affinities of SP individuals to preceding MP and succeeding present-day groups (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Tables 17–19). The divergence between pre-Slavic and Slavic-associated groups is verified both in the distribution of genetic distances (FST) (Supplementary Fig. 19) as well as shared alleles (F4) (Supplementary Figs. 17–20) (Supplementary Note 4.2). Both on the population and the individual scale, SP individuals from all three study regions uniformly show less genetic affinity to the preceding local populations than to ancient and present-day groups from Eastern Europe and Baltics (Supplementary Figs. 34–38 and Supplementary Notes 4.2 and 4.4.1).

a, Trajectories of changes in affinity to Eastern Europe in ancient and present-day individuals from the Northwestern Balkans (n = 301), Eastern Germany (n = 483) and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine (n = 489), as measured using F4 statistics of the form F4(Han Chinese, test; Italy, Poland) (for the Northwestern Balkans) and F4(Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB), test; Denmark, Poland) (for Eastern Germany and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine). Error bars indicate 2 × s.d. b, Supervised ADMIXTURE modelling for the study regions. Ancient and present-day samples (n = 1,344) decomposed into 12 ancestral ancestry components. For different time periods, individual results were averaged and plotted according to their mean date. Influx of specific ancestries mentioned in the text are indicated using arrows. Relevant Y chromosome haplogroups associated with these autosomal ancestries are highlighted. Made with Natural Earth. c, Average sum of IBD segments (sIBD (in cM)) shared between nine ancient MP and SP groups. For all pairs of populations, the sum of IBD segments longer than 12 cM shared between members was calculated and normalized to the total number of pairs. The sums are depicted as symmetrical matrix. Hierarchical cluster analysis applying Ward's minimum variance method to the columns is added as a dendrogram.

Our results reveal that SP individuals display Baltic or Northeastern European-related ancestry that was previously absent in the three study regions. To quantitatively estimate this influx, we decomposed ancestral sources using a supervised clustering approach implemented in the software ADMIXTURE41. Specifically, we assembled modern populations into 12 metapopulations that serve as proxies for the source ancestries in Central Europe (Methods and Supplementary Note 4.1). Applying our ancestry decomposition to the ancient genome-wide data, we find that (despite differences in the local trajectories) Northeastern European ancestry (BAL, represented by present-day individuals from Belarus, Lithuania and Latvia) was either completely absent or only a minor ancestry component throughout most of prehistory in our study transects (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 3), accounting for 6 ± 2%, 5 ± 1% and 7 ± 2% of the total MP ancestry in the Northwestern Balkans, Eastern Germany and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine, respectively. However, consistent with PCA (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c) and F4 statistics (Fig. 3a–c), BAL ancestry increased after 600 ce and became the largest ancestry component in all three study regions, reaching 47 ± 2%, 65 ± 1% and 63 ± 2%, respectively, during the SP. Outside our three study transects, we furthermore identify a major surge of BAL ancestry (from 0% in the MP to approximately 27%) in the Avar-associated population of Mödling, Austria42, confirming an early arrival in the Pannonian Basin in the seventh century ce as reported by written sources, followed by substantial admixture with local groups (Extended Data Fig. 4). Only in Northwestern Russia do we detect a different trajectory: in the Volga-Oka area, the Slavic transition coincides with a significant decrease of BAL ancestry (from 65 ± 2% to 55 ± 7%), suggesting that the SP newcomers originated from a region further to the west of the Volga-Oka area where they incorporated additional ancestry not local to Eastern Europe.

The source for the incoming Northeastern European ancestry appears to be the same in all four regions. To showcase this shared descent, we applied ancIBD43 to identify segments that are identical by descent (IBD) that are shared between the MP and SP populations. We highlight that SP groups in Croatia, Eastern Germany and Poland–Ukraine share comparably large amounts of IBD with each other, despite the vast geographic distance between the three study regions, but share nearly no segments with the preceding populations (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 37). This IBD-sharing signal, including a large fraction of segments longer than 16 cM, clearly indicates that ancient individuals from Slavic-associated contexts descend from a common source population that migrated westwards and southwards at most a few generations earlier across Central Europe (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 10). Such evidence for large-scale population movement also explains the previously detected pattern of high levels of sharing of IBD between present-day pairs of individuals across Eastern Europe44 (Supplementary Fig. 56) and rejects the idea that this signal was caused predominantly by consistently low population densities45.

To obtain a finer-scale characterization of genetic ancestries across space and time, we applied a hierarchical cluster detection approach to a network of around 2,500 individuals constructed from these pairwise IBD-sharing similarities (Supplementary Table 38 and Supplementary Note 4.3.2). We identify a large IBD-sharing community that contains most of our new and published SP individuals as well as multiple other contemporary samples from Central and Southeastern Europe. Within this larger cluster, we identify two distinct sub-communities: one primarily includes SP individuals from north of the Carpathian Mountains, whereas the other comprises individuals buried further south. This separation may reflect two geographically diverging waves of expansion or different patterns of incorporation of the local populations (Extended Data Fig. 5). Yet, at least sporadic gene flow from Eastern Europe into Pannonia and the Balkans must have already occurred during the Iron Age and Roman Period, as we identify a substantial number of individuals within the SP cluster buried in Austria, Hungary, Serbia and Montenegro during the time period from 500 bce to 300 ce, predating the large-scale population movements of the sixth and seventh centuries (Supplementary Figs. 29a, 32a,b and 33).

Using newly generated early medieval data from the Polish site Gródek, Hrubieszów County, near the Ukrainian border, which represents some of the oldest Slavic inhumation burials from Poland (dating between the seventh and ninth centuries ce), as a proximal source (both in time and space) for the incoming BAL-enriched ancestry, we calculate using qpAdm that approximately 82 ± 1%, 83 ± 6%, 93 ± 3% and 65 ± 4% of the local gene pool in the Northwestern Balkans, Eastern Germany, Poland–Northwestern Ukraine and the Volga-Oka valley, respectively, were replaced during the SP by migrants from Eastern Europe (referred here to as ‘SP ancestry'; Methods) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Tables 47 and 51). These results contradict a model of substantial population continuation from the Iron Age or MP to the Middle Ages in present-day Western and Central Poland, where previous research claimed an autochthonous origin of the SP gene pool29,46,47 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Yet more samples are needed to assess the overall degree of genetic replacement over the larger area. Applying qpAdm to model present-day groups using ancient source populations, we show that Eastern European ancestry is the dominant genetic component in all Slavic-speaking populations today and is also found in neighbouring non-Slavic-speaking groups in Central Europe and regions bordering to the south (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 5). We measure the highest proportions of Eastern European ancestry in present-day Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, from where it gradually decreases to the east and south (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 41). Notably, we observe a profound duality to the west, in Eastern Germany, with the present-day German-speaking population from Saxony exhibiting around 40% SP ancestry and the Slavic-speaking Sorbs of Upper Lusatia (Saxony) exhibiting 88% SP ancestry (comparable to modern Poles) (Extended Data Fig. 7). This agrees with previous studies on the genetic isolation of the Sorbs33,48 and is consistent with them representing the descendants of these Slavic groups that were minimally (or at least less) integrated into the reproductive networks of the expanding German-speaking settlement east of Elbe and Saale from the twelfth century onwards49,50,51. Conversely, we suggest that the German eastward expansion and earlier Frankish conquest is probably associated with the reduction in SP ancestry observed in the German-speaking population.

This is supplemented by five lines of evidence: (A) ancient and present-day groups from the Baltics show the highest genetic similarity to SP individuals; (B) Bronze Age and Iron Age individuals from Estonia, Ingria and Karelia are less related to SP individuals than groups from Lithuania and Latvia; (C) populations in Western Russia feature too high proportions of Steppe and/or Siberian ancestry; (D) SP individuals are enriched in EEF and depleted in WHG ancestry compared with Bronze Age and Iron Age populations from the Baltics; (E) Putative migration directions inferred using pairwise mean sIBD sharing values between SP sites77 (n > 2). Made with Natural Earth. b, Comparison of linguistic split times (left) and genetic admixture dates in SP groups (right).

The size of the symbols denotes the strength of the sex bias (with |z| > 2 being considered significant).

Both F4 and FST statistics identify the highest genetic similarity between SP individuals and present-day populations from the Baltics, Poland and Belarus (Supplementary Figs. 17–22). These are also the regions where BAL and SP ancestry (here approximated by medieval samples from Gródek) are maximized today and where the highest proportions of R1a haplotypes (specifically R1a-M458 and R1a-M558) are found among the male population. In patterns of haplotype sharing between the ancient and modern individuals, this similarity was mirrored in a distinctive IBD signal (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs. 23–25): SP individuals from all three study regions share more and longer IBD fragments with Eastern Europeans than with any other Eurasian group, establishing direct genetic relatedness between present-day Balto-Slavic speakers and SP individuals in Central and Southeastern Europe (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 4.3.1). This pattern of excess affinity to Northern and Northeastern Europeans is not only evident in the comparison with present-day data but also in the archaeogenetic record: Comparing the SP individuals to other ancient samples, we show that they, independent of their geographic origin, share the highest drift and largest sum of IBD with Bronze and Iron Age groups from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia52,53, and are (as shown by F-statistics) more closely related to these individuals than to any other population in post-Neolithic Europe (for IBD see Supplementary Fig. 32c; for F3 and F4 see Supplementary Figs. 34–38; Supplementary Note 4.4.1).

Yet, in contrast to the Bronze Age Baltic samples, we note that SP individuals from all study regions exhibit substantially less Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) and more early European farmer (EEF) ancestry (Supplementary Figs. 41 and 42a and Supplementary Note 4.4.2). This suggests that the SP groups in Central Europe were already admixed, most probably between a WHG and Steppe ancestry-enriched Baltic Bronze Age-related source from the sub-Neolithic forest zone and at least one EEF-enriched source from the south. Using qpAdm, we identify various groups in Southeastern and East-Central Europe that constitute working proxies for such an EEF-enriched donor, yet we are not able to precisely identify the most likely representative (Supplementary Fig. 43). Across all fitting two-way models (P > 0.01) (and most non-fitting), the admixture proportions are highly similar, with the Eastern German and Polish-Northwestern Ukrainian SP samples receiving around 71% Baltic (95% confidence interval: 66.5%–76%) and around 29% (95% confidence interval: 24%–33.5%) EEF-enriched ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 43b and Supplementary Table 34). However, we highlight that the demographic trajectories that led to the formation of the SP gene pool were potentially more complex than a simple two-way admixture event. Although we calculate similar estimates of Baltic Bronze Age-derived ancestry applying a non-negative least squares approach based on PCA- and ADMIXTURE results54, mirroring previous results from genome-wide genealogies55, all models profit from the inclusion of an additional Western European source (Supplementary Figs. 40, 45 and 46). Thus, which vector population(s) ultimately transmitted EEF-enriched ancestry to the Northeast cannot be resolved fully for now (Supplementary Note 4.4.2-3).

Assuming a two-way admixture process, using DATES (distribution of ancestry tracts of evolutionary signals)56 we obtained an average date of approximately 1000 bce for this admixture event that formed the SP gene pool (972 bce ± 250 for Niederwünsch and 906 bce ± 362 for Poland_EMA, respectively) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 35). Of note, these DATES estimates overlap with the more recent part of the distribution of divergence estimates between Baltic and Slavic languages (Fig. 4b). Both phylogenetic analysis of cognate-coded basic vocabulary data (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8) and most Indo-European linguists date the disintegration of Proto-Balto-Slavic57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64 to the second millennium bce57,64. However, since the Bayesian linguistic estimates are on average shifted a few centuries older than the admixture estimates, we highlight the possibility that the admixing Baltic-related groups spoke a language that had already begun to diverge from the language or dialect continuum of the populations further north, the former eventually becoming the Slavic languages and the latter the (present-day) Baltic languages. To identify the most plausible geographic location for this initial formation of the SP gene pool, we applied MOBEST to perform spatiotemporal interpolation of the genetic affinities of SP individuals from the study regions to approximately 5,660 previously published ancient samples from Western Eurasia, obtaining similarity probabilities across Europe that can be interpreted as proxies for geographical origin at a specific time. We set the prediction time to 1,950 years before the present, providing us the most likely origin of an individual at this time point (and thus before the demographic transition in Central Europe). Averaging the probability surfaces, we infer a region spanning the south of Belarus and north of Ukraine as the best spatial proxy for the origin of the SP individuals in our three study transects (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34). Such a range would agree well with the area where many linguists propose the earliest development of Slavic languages and archaeologists locate the origin of Slavic-associated material culture5 (Supplementary Fig. 44); however, more ancient DNA (aDNA) data are needed to conclusively assess the genetic landscape of this region.

From there, Northeastern European ancestry is likely to have spread east, west and south, admixing with or even replacing the local gene pools (Fig. 4a). Although we cannot precisely measure the onset of this expansion or its duration, we highlight that DATES estimates for admixture between local and immigrant ancestries in SP individuals are generally recent and similar across the study transects, consistent with admixture processes starting in the sixth and early seventh century and agreeing with historically recorded arrival dates of Slavic groups in these regions (Extended Data Fig. 1). The detection of substantial genetic introgression from the northeast into regions in which Slavic came to be spoken26,27,44,65,66 indicates that the diffusion of Slavic language and Eastern European-derived ancestry were related, although the degree of their overlap cannot be ascertained. This provides a plausible explanation for the high genetic relatedness across present-day Slavic-speaking groups26,44, which was previously linked to the spread of the Slavic languages44,65. However, we highlight that such a simplified model does not capture the more complex regional dynamics that emerge from historical and archaeological evidence, and are still evident in language boundaries that do not correspond to genetic differences across the Balkans and Central Europe66. To investigate possible sex biases in these expansion and admixture processes, we compared estimates of SP-related ancestry on the X chromosomes and the autosomes to identify proportion differences indicative of male-biased admixture (Fig. 4c). Notably, we find no evidence for sex bias in any of the SP populations in Germany, Croatia, Poland or Russia (|z | <2; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 47). However, we observe that the previously undetected gene flow of Southern European-related ancestry into the MP population of Eastern Germany was significantly female-biased in most studied sites (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 59d).

The Slavic groups that we studied also showed fundamentally different social organization compared with the preceding MP population (Supplementary Note 8). Most notably, we highlight more intense inter-site and intra-site genetic relatedness in the Elbe-Saale region (Extended Data Fig. 2c), reflected by patrilineally organized pedigrees that comprise large numbers of individuals (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10a,b). The cemeteries of the preceding MP in Eastern Germany were characterized by small units of biological relatedness, mostly consisting of fewer than four first- and second-degree relatives. At the site level, we identified for each individual an average of 1.16 ± 0.18 close relatives (here defined as all relationships up to third degree) (in Brücken specifically: 0.64 ± 0.14; Supplementary Fig. 62). This pattern is also mirrored in IBD sharing within sites (which also captures distant genetic relatedness greater than third degree), with the proportion of pairs of individuals that share any IBD larger than 12 cM ranging between 1 ± 0.4%, 6.8 ± 1.8% and 5.2 ± 1.8% in Brücken, Deersheim and Obermöllern, respectively.

By contrast, during the SP, we show that the number of close relatives at the sites increased nearly sixfold to 6.41 ± 0.4%. We even observe one case of seven offspring from the same couple (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10b). Notably, four of the seven siblings had reached reproductive age, with three of them having offspring. As most of them were male, we can assume that several grown-up daughters might had gone elsewhere to marry. Moreover, the majority of offspring being male points towards additional unsampled female siblings (to statistically account for an equivalent number of females born). Notably, for all unions (in which at least one parent was identified on site), we find 52 sons (62% of the offspring; 95% confidence interval: 51–72%) but only 32 daughters (38% of the offspring; 95% confidence interval: 28–49%) (exact binomial test; P = 0.03753).

More distant genetic relationships also increased. For Niederwünsch and Steuden (approximately 8 km apart), 18.3 ± 0.6% and 15.3 ± 2.1% of the pairs of individuals share IBD fragments indicative of recent common descent (more than 12 cM apart). Although occupation periods in MP sites were shorter than in Niederwünsch (preventing the emergence of large-pedigree structures), the rather short-lived site of Steuden demonstrates that the differences in intra-community relatedness between MP and SP cemeteries were not caused exclusively by differences in the duration of site occupation.

Although these extensive kinship networks evidenced a high degree of relatedness among all individuals within sites, we do not find a single case of close consanguinity (defined here as offspring of first cousin unions or closer) (Supplementary Fig. 54d). This shows profound knowledge of the lineages and deliberate avoidance of consanguinity. We also identify at least 11 cases of individuals reproducing with multiple partners, pointing to polygamy or serial monogamy. Despite a 2.7:1 ratio of half-siblings sharing the same father (95% confidence interval: 0.43–0.91) versus those sharing the same mother (95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.57), we do not find a single instance of levirate marriages as practiced in late Avar-period communities in the Carpathian Basin67.

In parallel with the increase of genetic interconnectedness within the sites, we also observe that the organization of the cemeteries changed, reflecting in the spatial layout the extended pedigrees. Although close relatives were buried significantly closer together than non-related individuals in both the MP and the SP, only during the SP did cemeteries feature a significant correlation between genetic and spatial distances, suggesting that the cemeteries were planned and structured around these larger kin groups (Mantel statistic based on Spearman's rank correlation; P = 0.0001 for both Niederwünsch and Steuden) (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Figs. 63 and 65). This signal is most prominent in the site of Steuden, where at least 27% of all variance in spatial distances between graves is explained by genetic relatedness.

Although the sex ratio of adults across the SP sites is balanced (Exact binomial test; P = 1 for Steuden, P = 0.08794 for Niederwünsch), females have on average significantly fewer close relatives than males (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.008) and feature overall an increased pairwise mismatch rate compared with males (Wilcoxon rank sum test; test statistic (W) = 13,976,553, P = 0.04218; Supplementary Fig. 67) and a lower sum of IBD segments shared within sites (Welch two-sample t-test; t = −3.707, d.f. = 355.82, P = 0.0002431) (Extended Data Fig. 10c). However, females share more IBD segments between different sites than males, thereby demonstrating higher inter-site relatedness among females in contrast to higher intra-site relatedness among males (Welch two-sample t-test; t = 2.9513, d.f. = 64.952, P = 0.004398) (Extended Data Fig. 10c).

This demonstrates that exogenous origin was more common for females than for males, suggesting a patrilocal inheritance organization, and agrees well with the nearly exclusively patrilineally organized pedigrees (for example, 88% patrilineal lineages (95% confidence interval: 68–97%) versus 12% matrilineal lineages (95% confidence interval: 4–32%)) and the significant underrepresentation of female offspring at the sites (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10b and Aupplementary Fig. 54). Across all SP sites in Eastern Germany, we find only one instance of mitochondrial haplogroups being transmitted further than one daughter generation. This contrasts with the preceding MP population, for which we detect no difference in the number of close relatives between males and females (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.74) and no difference in pairwise mismatch rate in general (Wilcoxon rank sum test; W = 3,215,752, P = 0.06), potentially suggesting a less strictly patrilineal social system before the arrival of Slavic groups (Supplementary Fig. 67). However, owing to the overall smaller number of identified relatives, these tests might be less statistically conclusive and underestimate signals of MP female exogamy and patrilineal practices.

Patterns of patrilocal organization into kin groups are broadly similar across regions and might have contributed to the previously described turnover and homogenization of the paternal gene pool (Extended Data Fig. 10b). In particular, we find an identical pattern of correlation of spatial and genetic distances in SP Velim, Croatia (Mantel statistic based on Spearman's rank correlation; P = 0.0001; Supplementary Figs. 64 and 65d) as well as evidence for patrilocality and female exogamy (for example, more close biological relatives among males than among females (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.027) and higher pairwise mismatch rates among females compared to males (Wilcoxon rank sum; W = 156,550, P = 0.02377; Supplementary Fig. 67g–i)), mirroring the social stratification observed in the Elbe-Saale region. By contrast, at Velim the mean number of close relatives in the site is significantly lower than in Niederwünsch or Steuden (1.01 ± 0.17). Within a shared pattern of patrilocality, SP fine-scale organization differed substantially across Central Europe owing to the complex, regionally contingent nature of this expansion. Rather than simple replacement, partial integration of the local population was probably dependent on the fortunes of specific groups or families. However, the substantial number of individuals from sites across Eastern Germany, Croatia and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine who share comparably large amounts of IBD with each other confirms that these Slavic-associated groups were closely linked as the result of a shared biological origin and recent geographical expansion.

Here we present several results in a wide chronological and topographical range, based on fine-grained genetic transect studies of a number of complete cemeteries. Across Central Europe, we show that during the Roman Iron Age and subsequent MP genetic diversity increased not only within the empire, but also outside it. Southeastern Europe experienced an influx from the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas large parts of East-Central Europe were inhabited by people mainly related to modern inhabitants of Northern and Northwestern Europe. We also show a fifth and sixth century admixture of Mediterranean ancestry in Eastern Germany, prevalently but not exclusively through females. They and their offspring became well-integrated in the regional societies, and their burials show no signs of inferior status or cultural differences, a finding very different from those at early medieval cemeteries in Hungary, Italy39 and England68 with respect to incoming Northern versus local, Southern and Western European ancestry. Yet, after the fall of the Thuringian kingdom this diverse population gradually disappeared, and the SP began.

Most importantly, our results are relevant for the debate on whether the spread of Slavs was due to large migratory movements and the expansion of a homogeneous population, or to the gradual acculturation of regional populations. We were able to connect the fundamental transformations of culture in large parts of Eastern Europe to a substantial movement of people most plausibly from regions between the Eastern Baltics and the Northwestern Pontic region. This genetically inferred area agrees well with archaeological hypotheses for the origins of Slavic material culture east of the Vistula River, for instance, in the Kyivan culture (second or third to fifth centuries ce)4,5,20,21. However, without aDNA from this region and period, more precision remains impossible.

SP ancestry spread to many directions from the sixth century onwards. Yet we can only detect it when the immigrants stopped cremating their dead at different stages between the eighth and tenth centuries. Only few early inhumation burials (for example, Velim and Gródek) provide insights in line with more recent sites. Consequently, it remains unclear whether most of the SP ancestry arrived in a single pulse or over a prolonged time span. As described in previous publications27, our results indicate that sporadic individual percolation from Eastern Europe into the Balkans preceded (and potentially succeeded) any large-scale movements, pointing to long-term mobility accompanying the sixth and seventh century demographic transformation. To what extent the previous population disappeared, continued to live alongside the newcomers or mixed with them depended on the region69,70,71. Among our study regions, the shift was most marked close to the areas of origin, as in Poland and Eastern Germany. By contrast, we found more admixture with local populations in the Northwestern Balkans, the Carpathian Basin and the Volga-Oka area. Remarkably, the Slavic population buried in Eastern Germany in the late tenth to twelfth century, nearly four centuries after the first Slavic groups settled in the wider region, had little genetic exchange with the neighbouring Thuringian population, although archaeological finds demonstrate regular interactions between these groups. To some extent, this discrepancy might be caused by the selection of studied sites within a more heterogeneous genetic landscape. However, our results agree with the drastic break between the preceding Germanic material culture and that of the Early SP, probably after an intermediate phase of scarce settlement in most of the Northwestern Slavic area after the mid-sixth century69,70,71,72,73,74,75, and disagree with the model of a Slavicisation of the existing population.

This change was driven by substantial movements of people and can be linked with the dispersion of Slavic languages and the spread of a new material culture. However, our data do not support total population replacement across Eastern Europe, but point to a complex, regionally contingent demic diffusion with partial integration. SP ancestry in the Balkan Peninsula and Western Russia did not form the majority in all areas. Consequently, besides large-scale movements, several other mechanisms, including genetic and cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations by the expanding SP gene pool, are needed to explain the ancient and present-day genetic patterns observed on the margins of the diffusion area. Where the newcomers mixed with local populations, they did so without significant gender bias.

Unlike in the MP, the SP communities in the Elbe-Saale region relied more on biological relatedness in their organization, and their large pedigrees provide valuable information about their reproductive practices and social structure. Similar to earlier Avar communities in Pannonia67,76, the multi-generational SP communities we studied in Eastern Germany practiced a consistent reproductive strategy based on patrilineal and local descent, female exogamy, strict avoidance of consanguinity, and—in several cases—multiple reproductive partners. Not all of these patterns observed in Eastern Germany were shared with the SP societies in the Northern Balkans, which, in many aspects of their organization, appear more similar to preceding MP groups in Croatia, Eastern Germany, Hungary or Italy39,40. In some of these cases, previously established social practices may have survived the substantial demographic and linguistic changes, adding another level of genetic complexity to the new set of questions concerning social organization and interaction within and between Slavic-related societies across Europe.

In modern ethnic and national terminology, ‘Slavs' denotes all speakers of Slavic languages and/or citizens of the Slavic nation states. This concept of an ethnic collective spanning several nations is much more marked than among the Germanic or Romance speakers in the rest of Europe (Supplementary Note 1). The extent to which Slavic identity mattered diverged; it was important for nineteenth and twentieth century Slavic nationalisms, Pan-Slavism and Russian imperialism, but regional or national allegiances often carried more weight. The prejudices of their western neighbours who tended to regard Slavs as culturally inferior reinforced sentiments of Slavic commonality. The question of Slavic origins, addressed in this Article, had a crucial role in ideological debates about the unity and the significance of the Slavs. It is therefore important to be precise in the scholarly use of the term. In research about the early Slavs, the meanings of the term diverge. In written sources since the sixth and seventh century in Byzantium and the west, groups of Slavs or Wends increasingly appear in a wide range of lands beyond and along the Danube and the Elbe rivers. We can make use of different sources to understand how large parts of Europe became Slavic: outside perceptions about Slavs in texts; archaeological traces of shared cultural practices among early Slavs (particularly the Prague-Korchak culture); linguistic reconstructions of a common Slavic language prior to the particular Slavic idioms; and shifts in ancestry of the medieval gene pool, which point to migrations. We should not take these disciplinary results as proxies for each other as attributes of a coherent people called Slavs; yet, they provide different perspectives on the Slavicisation of Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Combining them allows us to overcome simplistic theories of an expansion of the Slavs and instead understand the common dynamic and the different ways in which Slavic peoples began to form in many parts of Europe. We therefore use Slavs for populations named in this way in contemporary texts, without implying that they self-identified as such. These Slavic groups can be localized, but hardly circumscribed. We do not use genetic or archaeological features in regions where Slavs spread to distinguish between Slavs and non-Slavs, or between speakers and non-speakers of Slavic languages, although we assume that these phenomena overlapped to a considerable degree.

For better comparison of genetic differences between groups pre- and post-dating the proposed expansion of groups associated with Slavic material culture, we refer to samples dating between 300 and 600 ce as MP individuals or groups, and samples dating between 600 and 1200 ce as SP individuals or groups. Although this naming scheme is simplified compared to the well-established historical and archaeological chronologies of our three study transects, it facilitates the quantification of the genetic turnover between groups pre- and post-dating 600 ce across Central Europe. We highlight that our SP samples were selected to represent sites that are considered Slavic in an archaeological sense. Besides this cultural attribution, sites were selected for their completeness and state of archaeological description or publication. However, we do not know if the buried individuals considered themselves as belonging to a Slavic ethnic or cultural community and whether or how they understood their common descent from groups of earlier periods in Eastern Europe. Similarly, whether they spoke a Slavic language can only be hypothetically assumed. We thus prefer a temporal nomenclature that is agnostic as to genetic, cultural or linguistic designations.

When necessary, we refer collectively to SP samples with Eastern Europe-specific ancestry as having SP ancestry. This term describes an Eastern European-derived ancestry component due to a recent common origin shared among most SP individuals in all three study transects. In our analyses this ancestry is approximated using data (n = 8) from the Polish site Gródek, Hrubieszów County, dating between 600 and 900 ce and representing the spatially and temporally closest surrogate in our dataset to the (so far) unsampled source population in Eastern Europe. This naming system is intended to differentiate medieval SP ancestry from the present-day genetic landscape of Eastern Europe, which is (at least partially) derived from this ancient source.

In the text, we label large-scale movements of people during the Early Middle Ages as migration, adhering to the traditional use of the term in population genetics79. We use the term with intention since the observed movements caused significant and lasting demographic change in the genetic landscape of Europe due to the large-scale, permanent translocation of people from one region to another.

Within tables and figures, we refer to groups of published individuals by the names given in the Allen Ancient DNA resource v.54.180. Sample sizes, context information and publication names can be found in Supplementary Tables 7–11. In the main text and Supplementary Notes, we used the following abbreviations for archaeological time periods: N, Neolithic; C, Chalcolithic; EBA, Early Bronze Age; MBA, Middle Bronze Age; LBA, Late Bronze Age; IA, Iron Age; RA, Roman Age; EMA, Early Middle Ages; MA, Middle Ages; H, historical.

Provenance information for samples from all archaeological sites is given in Supplementary Information Note 2, together with short descriptions of each site, the institution owning the samples (or custodians of the samples), the responsible co-author who obtained permission to analyse and the year of the permission granted.

We obtained all permissions for the work with archaeological and anthropological material in this study. Sampling of bone and teeth samples took place in the clean room facilities of the ArcheoGen laboratory at the Department of Archeology and Museology, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic as well as in the clean room facilities of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The sampling workflow included documenting and photographing the provided samples. For teeth, we either cut along the cementum–enamel junction and collected powder by drilling into the pulp chamber or accessed the pulp chamber by drilling the tooth transversally. For the petrous bones, we drilled from the outside of the bone towards the cochlear region in parallel to the auditory canal81. Other skeletal material such as long bones were used when no teeth or petrous bones were available. In these cases, areas with best preserved compact bone tissue were drilled. We collected between 25 and 50 mg of bone or tooth powder per sample for DNA extractions. The pulverized bone samples were sent to clean room facilities dedicated to ancient DNA work at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology for further processing and aDNA acquisition.

New radiocarbon dates for this study were measured on the bone and tooth fragments sampled for DNA. These dates were obtained at the Curt-Engelhorn-Center Archaeometry gGmbH, Mannheim, using MICADAS-AMS. Collagen was extracted from the previously sampled bones, purified by ultrafiltration and freeze-dried. 14C ages were normalized to δ13C = −25‰. The calibration was done using the IntCal20 calibration curve82 and the Oxcal program83.

Ancient DNA was extracted following a modified protocol of Dabney et al.84, as described at https://www.protocols.io/view/ancient-dna-extraction-from-skeletal-material-baksicwe, where we replaced the extended-MinElute-column assembly for manual extractions with columns from the Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit85, and for automated extraction with a protocol that replaced spin columns with silica beads in the purification step86.

We generated double-indexed87 single-stranded88 libraries using 25 µl of DNA extract and following established protocols89. We applied the partial UDG (UDG half)90 protocol to remove most of the aDNA damage while preserving the characteristic damage pattern in the terminal nucleotides.

We enriched libraries using in-solution capture probes synthesized by Agilent Technologies for 1,237,207 SNPs along the nuclear genome91. Libraries were sequenced in-house on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform to an average depth of 20 million reads and after demultiplexing processed through EAGER92.

After demultiplexing based on a unique pair of indexes, raw sequence data were processed using EAGER92. This included clipping sequencing adaptors from reads with AdapterRemoval (v.2.3.1)93 and mapping of reads with BWA (Burrows–Wheeler aligner) v.0.7.1294 against the Human Reference Genome Hs37d5, with seed length (-l) disabled, maximum number of differences (-n) of 0.01 and a quality filter (-q) of 30. We removed duplicate reads with the same orientation and start and end positions using DeDup v.0.12.292. Terminal base deamination damage calculation was done using mapDamage v.2.0.695, specifying a length (-l) of 100 bp. For the ten libraries that underwent UDG half treatment, we used BamUtil v.1.0.14 (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamUtil:_trimBam) to clip two bases at the start and end of all reads for each sample to remove residual deaminations, thus removing genotyping errors that could arise due to ancient DNA damage.

To determine the genetic sex of the ancient individuals, we calculated the coverage on the autosomes as well as on each sex chromosome and subsequently normalized the X- and Y-reads by the autosomal coverage96. For that, we used a custom script (https://github.com/TCLamnidis/Sex.DetERRmine) for the calculation of each relative coverage as well as their associated error bars97. Females are expected to have an X rate of 1 and a Y rate of 0, while males are expected to have a rate of 0.5 for both X and Y chromosomes.

We used the ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data) package98 (v.0.923) to test for heterozygosity of polymorphic sites on the X chromosome in male individuals, applying a contamination threshold of 5% at the results of method 1. For male and female samples, we estimated contamination levels on the mtDNA using Schmutzi99 (v.1.5.4) by comparing the consensus mitogenome of the ancient sample to a panel of 197 worldwide mitogenomes as a potential contamination source, applying a contamination threshold of 5%.

We used the program pileupCaller (v.1.4.0.2) (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools.git) to genotype the trimmed BAM files of 10 UDG half libraries. A pileup file was generated using samtools mpileup with parameters -q 30 -Q 30 -B containing only sites overlapping with our capture panel. From this file, for each individual and each SNP on the 1240k panel36,37,100, one read covering the SNP was drawn at random, and a pseudo-haploid call was made—that is, the ancient individual was assumed homozygous for the allele on the randomly drawn read for the SNP in question. We used the parameter -SingleStrandMode, which causes pileupCaller to ignore reads aligning to the forward strand at C/T polymorphisms and at G/A polymorphisms to ignore reads aligning to the reverse strand, which should remove post-mortem damage in ancient DNA libraries prepared with the non-UDG single-stranded protocol. To maximize our resolution, we filled missing data in the single-stranded libraries with additional genotypes present in the trimmed, double-stranded but not in the single-stranded libraries.

To process the mitochondrial DNA data, we extracted reads from 1240k data using samtools (v.1.3.1)101 and mapped these to the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS). We subsequently called consensus sequences using Geneious R9.8.1102 and used HaploGrep 2 (v.2.4.0)103 (https://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/; with PhyloTree version 17-FU1) to determine mitochondrial haplotypes. For the male individuals, we used pileup from the Rsamtools package to call the Y-chromosome SNPs of the 1240k SNP panel (mapping quality ≥30 and base quality ≥30). We then manually assigned Y-chromosome haplogroups using pileups of Y-SNPs included in the 1240k panel that overlap with SNPs included on the ISOGG SNP index v.15.73 (Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2019-2020; 2020.07.11).

We used the ancient-DNA-specific genotype caller MLE function of ATLAS104 (https://bitbucket. org/wegmannlab/atlas/) to call genotype likelihoods. ATLAS can also calculate the base-quality recalibration (the recal function) that we performed in batches among libraries sequenced in the same sequencing run, accounting for specific sequencing errors. ATLAS recalibration also corrects the base qualities accounting for the empirical ancient DNA damage pattern observed from the data and reduces the effect of reference bias introduced by genome mapping by relying on a list of 10 million highly conserved genomic positions across 88 mammal species downloaded from ensembl (https://grch37.ensembl.org/). We called genotype likelihoods on the whole 1000 Genomes SNPs panel of around 20 million SNPs and used these calls as input data for GLIMPSE105 (v.2.0.0) (https://github.com/odelaneau/GLIMPSE), applying the default parameters and using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. The function GLIMPSE_phase was used to perform simultaneous imputation and phasing on genomic chunks of 2,000,000 base pairs with a buffer of 200,000 base pairs. Samples with more than 600k SNPs exhibiting a genotype posterior of ≥0.99 after imputation were included in downstream IBD analysis. We then estimated segments that were IBD either in the context of: (1) other ancient individuals; or (2) present-day populations.

To investigate IBD sharing between pairs of ancient individuals we used the program ancIBD43. We applied the HapBLOCK function of ancIBD to perform the pairwise estimation with default parameters and only shared blocks of more than 8 cM containing more than 220 SNPs per centimorgan were considered. To further filter for possible false-positive hits in our IBD network analysis, we considered only shared IBD segments longer than 12 cM, and if a pair of individuals had segments of less than 16 cM, we included them only if they had more than one such segment.

To compare IBD segments shared with present-day individuals as well as estimates of effective population size, we used BEAGLE106,107 (v.5.2) to phase the newly imputed genotypes. Following Morez et al.108, the window and overlap lengths were set as wider than any chromosome (window length 380 cM and overlap length 190 cM) to maximize the information used for phasing the genomes. The 1000 Genomes phase 3 dataset (http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/1000_Genomes_phase3_v5a) and GRCh37 genomic maps (http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/genetic_maps/) provided by BEAGLE were used for phasing. We phased ancient and present-day data together since the BEAGLE phasing algorithm (hidden Markov model-based haplotype clustering) improves widely as the sample size increases. The identification of IBD segments was done using RefinedIBD109, which can also detect IBD fragments shorter than 8 cM. The window size was set to 3 cM. The minimal size for a segment to be considered shared by IBD is 1 cM, the same threshold used in Margaryan et al.110 and Morez et al.108. Finally, we removed gaps between IBD segments that have at most one discordant homozygote and that are less than 0.6 cM in length and aggregated the sum and number of IBD segments between each pair of ancient and present-day individuals.

To infer biological relatedness between individuals, we applied two independent approaches:

We calculated the pairwise mismatch rate111 in all pairs of individuals from our pseudo-haploid dataset to double-check for potential duplicate individuals and to determine first-, second- and third-degree relatives. For this purpose, we also used BREADR112 which utilizes Bayesian posterior probabilities for the classification of the genetic relationships.

We estimated the parts of the genome that are IBD in all pairs of individuals. We used KIN113 as the primary IBD-based method, although we validated the relatedness estimates with the method LcMLkin114. Both methods use genotype likelihoods to estimate the three k coefficients (k0, k1 and k2), which define the probability that two individuals have zero, one or two alleles that are IBD at a random site in the genome.

We calculated estimates of genetic diversity and effective population size using three different approaches.

Inbreeding estimation. We calculated the length of runs of homozygosity (RoH) using the software HapROH115 (v.0.6) in our pseudo-haploid data. A SNP cutoff of 300k SNPs was used, as well as the default 1000 Genomes reference panel. The number of RoH of size 4–8 cM per individual reflects the rate at which distant relatives have children, providing information about the sizes of mate pools (Ne) averaged over the hundreds of years prior to when individuals lived; offspring of close kin unions are reflected by sums of RoH >50 cM across the genome in runs of homozygosity of >12 cM.

Variability in population structure. We used the FSTruct116 package to quantify the variability of the Q matrix (which contains the row vectors of ancestry coefficients for each individual) outputted by supervised ADMIXTURE. The ancestry variability is measured in the ratio \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}/{F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) (where \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) is the maximal value of the fixation index FST). We generated 1,000 bootstrap replicate matrices for computing \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}/{F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) to compare bootstrap means and identify significantly different variabilities.

Effective population size. We used the method IBDNe117 to estimate ancestry-specific historical effective population size from around 4 generations to around 50 generations ago using identity-by-descent segments inferred from our imputed diploid data. We removed IBD segments shorter than 2 cM as well as IBD segments from avuncular and closer relationships using the parameter filtersamples: true. Confidence intervals for the estimated effective population size were calculated using 500 bootstrap replicates.

We merged our ancient DNA data with previously published datasets of ancient individuals reported by the Reich Lab in the Allen Ancient DNA Resource v.54.1 (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) (1240k SNP panel)80. For comparisons with present-day groups, we compiled and curated a high-resolution, quality-filtered reference dataset containing genotypes for 426,135 SNPs (the intersection of several different Affymetrix and Illumina chip types) from 12,176 contemporary individuals sampled from 49 (mostly European and West Asian) populations from previously published datasets as described in Gretzinger et al.68. Sample sizes are given in Supplementary Table 3. We produced four different datasets:

The whole 1240k panel (1240 K; 1.2 M SNPs). Used exclusively for comparison between ancient individuals as well as ancIBD and qpAdm analysis.

The overlap between the 1240k and HO panel (1240KHO; 0.6 M SNPs). Used for HO West Eurasian PCA.

The overlap between the 1240k and high-resolution panel (1240KEU; 0.4 M SNPs). Used for most analyses including ancient and present-day populations, e.g. PCA, F4 statistics and ADMIXTURE.

The overlap between the 1240KHO and the high-resolution panel (1240KHOEU; 0.3 M SNPs). Used for the calculation of SP ancestry proportions in present-day populations as well as FST and RefinedIBD analysis.

We carried out PCA using the smartpca software v.16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v.6.0.1)118. We computed principal components on three different sets of European and West Asian populations and projected ancient individuals using lsqproject: YES and shrinkmode: YES.

F3 and F4 statistics were computed with ADMIXTOOLS v.3.0119 (https://github.com/DReichLab). F3 statistics were calculated using qp3Pop (v.435). For F4 statistics, we used the qpDstat (v.755) and with the activated F4 mode. Significant deviation from zero can be interpreted as rejection of the tree population typology ((Outgroup, X);(Pop1, Pop2)). Under the assumption that no gene flow occurred between Pop1 and Pop2 and the Outgroup, a positive F-statistic suggests affinity between X and Pop2, whilst a negative value indicates affinity between X and Pop1. Standard errors were calculated with the default block jackknife 5 cM in size. As outgroups for F3 and F4 statistics, we either used haploid genotypes from YRI or CHB.

We calculated FST using smartpca software v.16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v.6.0.1)118 with the fstonly, inbreed, and fsthiprecision options set to YES.

We estimated ancestry proportions using qpWave36,120 (v.410) and qpAdm36 (v.810) from ADMIXTOOLS v.3.0119 with the allsnps: YES and inbreeding: YES options. Standard errors were calculated with the default block jackknife 5 cM in size. We used three basic sets of outgroups:

OldAfrica, WHGB, Turkey_N, Afanasievo79. This set was adapted from Patterson et al.79 and used to infer ancestry components from WHGs, EEFs and Yamnaya/Poltavka pastoralists (OldSteppe).

YRI.SG, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Wales, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands68. This set was adapted from Gretzinger et al.68 and used to infer ancestry components from SP individuals in present-day Central and Eastern Europeans.

OldAfrica, WHGB, Russia_Ust_Ishim.DG, CHG, EHG, Iran_GanjDareh_N, Israel_Natufian_published, Jordan_PPNB, Laos_Hoabinhian, OldSteppe, Turkey_N, Russia_MA1_HG, Morocco_Iberomaurusia. This set was adapted and modified from Antonio et al.34 to investigate the formation of the SP gene pool.

To analyse potential sex bias in the admixture process, we used qpAdm to estimate SP admixture proportions on the autosomes (default option) and on the X chromosome (option “chrom: 23”) using the abovementioned outgroups. Following the approach established by Mathieson et al.121, z-scores were calculated for the difference between the autosomes and the X chromosome using the formula \({\rm{z}}=\frac{pA-pX}{\sqrt{\sigma {A}^{2}+{\sigma X}^{2}}}\) where pA and pX are the SP admixture proportions on the autosomes and the X chromosome, and σA and σX are the corresponding jackknife standard deviations121. Thus, a negative z-score means that there is more SP admixture on the X chromosome than on the autosomes, indicating that the SP admixture was female-biased.

We performed model-based clustering analysis using two different approaches in ADMIXTURE:

We applied ADMIXTURE41 in unsupervised mode using modern and ancient individuals at K = 2 to 12. Variants with minor allele frequency of 0.01 were removed and PLINK was used for linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning with a window size of 200, a step size of 5 and an R2 threshold of 0.5.

We applied ADMIXTURE41 in supervised mode using modern reference populations at K = 12. This analysis was run on haploid data with the parameter “haploid” set to all (=“*”). To obtain point estimates for populations, we averaged individual point estimates and calculated the s.e.m. As modern references we used the groupings listed in the Supplementary Notes 4.1. The Q matrix of this ADMIXTURE analysis was also used as input for FSTruct as described by the authors116.

We constructed maximum likelihood trees using TreeMix (v.1.12)122. For each tree, we performed a round of global rearrangements after adding all populations (-global) and calculated 100 bootstrap replicates to assess the uncertainty of the fitted model (-bootstrap). Sample size correction was disabled.

Admixture dates were calculated using DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals) (v.4010)56, which calculates the decay of ancestry covariance coefficients between every pair of available overlapping SNPs between the test individuals and the source populations over increasing-genetic-distance window. We used standard settings with default bin size of 0.001 Morgans applied in our estimates (flag “binsize: 0.001”). We used a standard of 29 years per generation to convert the generation times in years since admixture.

We use Bayesian phylogenetic inference to estimate the ages of language divergence as described78. Analyses were performed on the IE-CoR database that stores data on cognate relationships (shared word origin) between 161 Indo-European languages, in a reference set of 170 basic meanings (https://iecor.clld.org). Divergence date distributions for the Balto-Slavic and Slavic subgroups were extracted from the sample of 37,004 trees resulting from the main analysis of Heggarty et al.78. A critical evaluation of this approach is discussed in Supplementary Note 9. However, we highlight that these computational estimates for the splits of the Baltic and Slavic languages compare well with estimates produced by methods of traditional Indo-European linguistics. These estimates are based on the reconstructed rapidity of diversification relative to that observed in the other branches of Indo-European (some of which is recorded in writing thousands of years before Baltic and Slavic), the nature of contacts and convergence between Balto-Slavic and other languages (IE and non-IE), and the character of the reconstructible Proto-Balto–Slavic vocabulary—but also attempted links to the archaeological picture57. The dating of the split of Proto-Balto–Slavic is generally in agreement with the results of traditional historical linguistics as described above; and earlier glottochronological approaches have yielded similar dating—for example, an estimation at the fifteenth and fourteenth century bce123.

The timeline lists major historical events associated with the Slavs in Central Europe. The map features schematized historical attestations for the appearance of Slavs (Sklavenoi – Slavi – Winedi). Italic numbers indicate the date of the attested event, with the respective report date in brackets. Made with Natural Earth.

a, Temporal distribution of samples analysed in this study, with site occupancy ranges indicated by bars. Non-transparent symbols indicate radiocarbon-dated samples; transparent symbols are scattered uniformly along site occupancy ranges. b, Temporal distribution of published samples analysed in this study. c, Spatial distribution of Eastern German sites analysed in this study. Made with Natural Earth.

a, West Eurasian PCA (present-day individuals are depicted as grey background points) with projection of BRC (n = 56), DRH (n = 49), OBM (n = 30), and RTW (n = 15) and other relevant Iron Age, Roman Period, and Late Antique populations (coloured symbols). b, Schematic overview of the geographic origin of ancient individuals with South European ancestry from Eastern Germany. The contours indicate the averaged maximum probability at search time 200 CE (multiplied by 100) for 10 individuals from BRC, DRH, OBM and RTW (denoting the mean prediction of the geographic regions where the ancestors of these individuals originated) as inferred using MOBEST. Results from two-way qpAdm analyses are shown as pie charts for each site. Made with Natural Earth. c, Schematic distribution of different artifact types among BRC, DRH, and OBM burials. The respective ancestry composition of each individual in respect to northern (WBI, CNE, NOR, BAL & FIN) and southern ancestry (CWE, WAS, NEA & AFR) (from supervised ADMIXTURE) is indicated as bar chart.

a, Trajectories of Northeastern European (BAL), East Mediterranean (WAS & NEA), and Northwest European (CNE & NOR) ancestry in ancient individuals from the Northwestern Balkans (n = 301), Eastern Germany (n = 483), and Poland-Northwestern Ukraine (n = 489), as measured using a supervised clustering approach implemented in ADMIXTURE. Error bands represent two standard errors. Made with Natural Earth. b, Averaged ancestry estimates from supervised ADMIXTURE analyses are shown as pie charts for sites in Central Europe before (n = 268) and after 600 CE (n = 975). Northwest European ancestry (CNE & NOR) is shown in blue, Northeastern European ancestry (BAL) in violet, and other ancestry in grey. The size of the pie charts correspond to the sample size per site.

a, Left: map highlighting the “Slavic Period” IBD-sharing community (1.1) (n = 602) identified applying a hierarchical cluster detection approach to a network constructed from pairwise IBD-sharing similarities between 2,657 ancient, post-Neolithic Eurasian individuals. A “Northern SP” sub-cluster (1.1.1) (n = 329) is highlighted in blue, a “Southern SP” sub-cluster (1.1.2) (n = 264) in orange. A boxplot comparison of Latitude coordinates in both clusters is indicated, showing significant differentiation among a North-South gradient (Welch Two Sample t-test; t = 16.331, df = 589.69, p < 2.2e-16). Right, ancient individuals from the Northern SP sub-cluster and Southern SP sub-cluster projected onto the modern European genetic variation. Made with Natural Earth. b, Hierarchical cluster analysis applying Ward's minimum variance method to the normalized, average sIBD sharing (> 1 cM) between IBD clusters (n = 24) identified using community detection. The dendrogram and statistical support for the bifurcations from multiscale bootstrap resampling are shown. The ancestry compositions of selected relevant clusters (inferred using supervised ADMIXTURE) are indicated as pie charts. c, Average sIBD (> 1 cM) between the Slavic Period cluster and 23 major IBD clusters identified using community detection. Error bars indicate three standard errors.

a, Hierarchical cluster analysis applying Ward's minimum variance method to the normalized, average IBD sharing (> 1 cM) between relevant ancient (n = 14) and present-day (n = 45) populations from Eastern and Northwestern Europe. The dendrogram and statistical support for the bifurcations from multiscale bootstrap resampling are shown. Made with Natural Earth. b, Normalized, average IBD sharing (> 1 cM) between SP individuals (n = 182) from Niederwünsch, Eastern Germany, and present-day European, Asian, and North African populations (n = 215).

a, Results from qpAdm analyses. Two- and three-way models of ancient source groups were fitted on relevant present-day groups from Southeast, Central, and East Europe (n = 48). The proportion of GRK-related (SP) ancestry is shown. For groups with multiple significant qpAdm models (p > 0.01), the GRK proportions from all feasible models are shown as box plots. Bounds of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. The centre represents the median. Whiskers represent the smallest value greater than the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range and largest value less than the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, respectively. Outliers present the minimum and maximum values in the data. b, Pie charts depicting the median ancestry proportions from all significant (p > 0.01), feasible qpAdm models for present-day European groups. GRK-related (SP) ancestry is shown in black, summed non-SP ancestry is shown in white. The pie charts are plotted on the sampling locations. Made with Natural Earth.

a, Divergence date distributions for the Balto-Slavic family from other Indo-European languages, extracted from 37,004 trees generated in Heggarty et al.78. Posterior probabilities of sister-group relationship, median split times and respective 95% Highest Posterior Distributions (HPD) are indicated above. Divergence dates are given independently for each of six sister group relationships found in the posterior tree sample, in decreasing order of probability. b, Schematic of the underlying Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree from all tree distributions. The posterior probabilities of Balto-Slavic forming a clade with Germanic-Italic-Celtic (0.63) and Indo-Iranic (0.11) are indicated. c, Divergence date distributions for the Baltic and Slavic languages (left) and the South and East/West Slavic languages (right), extracted from 37,004 trees generated in Heggarty et al.78. Median split times and respective 95% HPD are indicated above.

a, Reconstructed pedigrees of Niederwünsch, Eastern Germany, coloured according to family lineages. The site layout is shown on the left, representing the spatial distribution of family lineages coloured as in the pedigrees. Numbers correspond to the Genetic IDs listed in Supplementary Table 1. b, Distribution of mtDNA (n = 146) and Y chromosome haplogroups (n = 75). c, Trajectories of BAL ancestry over 5 generations across three major pedigrees of families A (n = 41), B (n = 19) and C (n = 33).

a, The network on the left shows all pairs of ancient individuals (n = 674) sharing IBD segments longer than 12 cM. We note that early medieval individuals from England, Northern and Eastern Germany form a loose cluster, while Slavic Period individuals from Croatia, Eastern Germany, and Poland-Northwestern Ukraine plot tightly together. The pedigrees on the bottom were constructed from the ancient genomic data and demonstrate the shift from small to large, patrilineally-organized pedigrees in Eastern Germany following the arrival of Slavic groups. Males are shown as squares, females as circles. Empty symbols denote reconstructed individuals that are not present in the genetic data. Patrilineal sequences are highlighted in blue, matrilineal in red. b, The pie charts show the proportion of the total intra-site IBD shared between pairs of males and females for the SP sites Niederwünsch (n = 182), Steuden (n = 36), and Obermöllern (n = 22) in Eastern Germany. The lines connecting the pie charts depict the proportion of the total inter-site IBD shared between pairs of males and pairs of females between the three different sites. Line thickness is proportional to the fraction of shared IBD. Shown below are trends in mtDNA and Y chromosome haplotype diversity (h) calculated for seven MP & SP sites in Eastern Germany and MP & SP Gródek in Eastern Poland. Made with Natural Earth.

For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet1,2,3. On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid4,5,6,7, but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies.

The existence of an inner core (IC) within a planet holds importance in planet evolution, as its growth affects the thermal state and dynamo processes of the planet1,8. As a consequence of core crystallization, the current size and physical state of the IC serve as direct indicators of the thermal and compositional properties of the planet. Although Earth has a well-established IC9, decisive identification of an IC has not been made for other planetary bodies, apart from the Moon10.

The core structure of Mars may differ markedly from that of the Earth, given their distinct magnetic histories. Despite its strongly magnetized ancient crust, the current lack of a global dynamo field on Mars implies the cessation of a past dynamo11,12,13. The processes occurring within the Martian core, including potential crystallization, and their implications for dynamo activity remain poorly understood3,14. Geodetic observations rule out a fully solid core4,5,15, and cosmochemistry data suggest that the core is probably liquid, given its content of light elements16,17,18. Recent findings from the InSight mission to Mars19 further confirm the existence of a liquid Martian core, with detections of seismic reflected wave at the core–mantle boundary (CMB)7, core-transiting wave20 and constraints from the free core nutation6. The discovered low-density liquid core implies the presence of light elements such as carbon (C), oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) apart from sulfur (S) (refs. 7,20), raising the possibility of crystallization under Martian core condition21. However, the question of whether Mars possesses a solid IC remains unanswered.

The discovery of the IC-transiting seismic phase (PKIKP), which passes the core shadow caused by the liquid outer core (OC), has been critical in defining the IC structure of Earth, whereas normal modes and PKJKP observations further confirm the presence of a solid IC9,22,23,24,25,26. However, on Mars, the observation of normal modes is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (ref. 27). Moreover, even the most distant event S0976a, with an epicentral distance (Δ) of 146 ± 7° from InSight28,29, remains situated within the shadow zone7,20. At a distance less than 40°, at which most Martian seismicity is located29, core phases PKPPKP (P′P′) and PKKP (detailed phase names can be found in the caption of Fig. 1), with extra reflection at the nearly antipodal surface and the CMB, respectively (Fig. 1a), could sample the deepest parts of the Martian core twice. Therefore, these short-distance data offer a unique opportunity to test the existence of the IC. Here we present observations of these core phases, particularly highlighting the detection of the reflection wave at the inner core boundary (ICB) and the transiting wave through the IC, which provides robust constraints on the size and physical properties of the IC.

a,b, Models without (a) and with (b) an IC are compared. Here, P′P′r represents rays leaving from the event towards the station along the major arc and sampling different depths of the core, whereas P′P′n represents a ray taking off along the minor arc. In the presence of an IC, the PKiKP phase reflects at the ICB (red curve in b). In b, the labelled PKKP phase transiting the IC should be PKIKKIKP, but we use PKKP here for consistency with a model without IC. Moreover, an extra P′P′r_df phase (green dashed curve) transits the faster IC and arrives much earlier than the P′P′r_ab (blue dashed curve). The red star and black triangle denote a marsquake at a depth of 33 km and a seismometer at an epicentral distance of 27°, respectively. c, Locations of the marsquakes used in vespagram analysis (Methods) (white circles), two impacts (red circles), four large-distance events (magenta and blue circles) and the InSight seismometer (red triangle). The red and orange diamonds represent the bouncing points of PKiKP at the inner-core boundary and P′P′ at the surface near the antipode of the InSight location (Fig. 1b), respectively. White lines mark equal-distance circles around InSight with epicentral distances of 20°, 40°, 70° and 90°. Most Martian seismicity is at the epicentral distance range of 27°–40° (blue-shaded region in Extended Data Fig. 1). The thin blue and orange lines denote the great circle paths for event S0235b PKiKP and PKKP phases, respectively. The locations of the marsquakes are plotted based on ref. 48. The heavy green line marks the equatorial dichotomy boundary on Mars based on ref. 49.

To better capture weak core phases and minimize contamination from the mantle phases (Supplementary Information section A2), we leverage the substantial number of low-frequency marsquakes at Δ of 27°–40° (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Table 1) and treat them as a source array for array analysis30. By implementing array analysis on the waveform or envelope data (Methods), we can generate vespagrams, in which a robust energy peak at a certain time represents coherent seismic phases with the characterized horizontal slowness. Thus, different phases with different ray parameters can be effectively isolated (Supplementary Information section A2), as supported by the robust identification of multiple mantle phases (Supplementary Fig. 9). Although locating a marsquake with a single station could have large uncertainties in back-azimuth, its epicentral distance is relatively well determined29, which makes the vespagram analysis feasible. Moreover, when taking P as the reference phase, the uncertainties of the event depth have negligible effects on both the travel time and slowness of the core phases (Supplementary Information section A2.5). Bootstrap resampling tests provide support for robust identifications of these core phases and enable us to estimate the uncertainties in travel time and slowness (Methods and Supplementary Information section A3). In each vespagram generated from the resampling tests, grids with energy exceeding 85% of the peak are assigned a value of 1. By analysing the occurrence percentage of these grids, we identify the phases with the highest occurrence and fit Gaussian functions to derive their mean travel times and slownesses and uncertainties (Fig. 2e). Examples of P′P′r_ab and P′P′n are shown in Supplementary Fig. 17, with travel time of 1,835 ± 4 s and 2,008 ± 3 s, slowness of −12.1 ± 0.7 s per degree and −5.0 ± 0.6 s per degree, relative to P, respectively. These arrivals fall within the predicted travel times and are slightly below the predicted slowness of −10.8 to −9 s per degree and −4.0 to −3.7 s per degree for both phases, derived from the available seismic core models7,20,31,32.

a, PKKP vespagram constructed from 23 events with distance <40° in Extended Data Table 1, showing two distinct peaks at (about 1,290 s, −8 s per degree) and (about 1,340 s, −7 s per degree). The later arrival is interpreted as PKKP or alternatively as PKKPMSL, a reflection from the top of the proposed molten silicate layer overlying core31,32. Orange shading outlines predicted PKKP travel time or slowness at the reference distance of 29° for available velocity models. Top panel shows the envelope stack for the picked PKKP slowness in b. b, Occurrence percentage of grids with energy exceeding 85% of the peak value in the vespagram, with white cross marking the identified PKKP arrival and the associated 1σ errors from Gaussian fitting (Methods and Supplementary Information section A3.2.2.3). c, Synthetic vespagram for the BS_SKS_GD_IC model (Extended Data Table 2, case 8). Orange crosses denote predicted PKKPCMB and PKKPMSL for case 6. d–f, Same as a–c, but for PKiKP. White shading in d shows the expected PKiKP slowness range for IC size of 0–900 km. The energy at (600 s, −4 s per degree) has a similar slowness to that of ScS (see Supplementary Information section A3.3 for possible origins of this arrival). g, Polarization analysis on event S0235b confirms PKKP identification: top, bandpass-filtered waveforms (grey line); middle, polarization-filtered waveforms (blue line) with envelopes; and bottom, vertical–horizontal summed FDPA intensity (VRM–HRM) (Methods), showing a strong polarized signal at about 1,348 s with large VRM–HRM. Red dashed lines mark the predicted travel time from the PKKP slowness in c. Black-dashed line marks the mean plus one standard deviation of VRM–HRM values in the 100-s window preceding PKKP. h, Same as g but for event S1015f, showing a PKiKP arrival at about 605 s.

Despite the evidence provided by vespagrams for observing core phases, the direct identification of these phases in individual waveforms offers the most compelling confirmation, as demonstrated by the detections of ScS (ref. 7) and SKS (ref. 20) phases. Therefore, we also use two complementary approaches7,20,33: (1) polarized waveforms and their time-domain envelopes (filter bank); and (2) frequency-dependent polarization analysis (FDPA) (Methods), to detect core phases of individual events. The detections of individual events are shown in Supplementary Information section B2, which further validates the identified core phases in the vespagrams.

Strong arrivals with the PKKP slowness can be observed only at a time window of 50–200 s earlier than predictions for models featuring a pure liquid core (Fig. 2a,b). In particular, a strong signal appears at about 1,340 s. An example of PKKP identification for event S0235b is shown in Fig. 2g. In a model with a molten silicate layer (MSL) above the core31,32, two PKKP arrivals are anticipated: the earlier reflection at the CMB (PKKPCMB) and the later reflection at the top of the MSL (PKKPMSL), with an interval of around 60 s (Supplementary Fig. 12). Thus, two arrivals at 1,290 ± 3 s and 1,341 ± 5 s in Fig. 2b may correspond to PKKPCMB and PKKPMSL, respectively. Although similar two arrivals are also observed for several individual events (Supplementary Fig. 11), their relatively low amplitudes make the MSL interpretation less definitive. Nevertheless, the significantly early arrival of PKKP indicates a much faster core towards the centre, such as a velocity gradient of 0.25 km s−1 faster over 100 km in the central 880 km of the core compared with the shallow core (Supplementary Information section A3.2.2.1.3). However, having a much steeper velocity gradient towards the centre may be difficult for a pure liquid core16,34,35,36. Alternatively, an IC with a higher velocity, which is sampled by the PKKP, provides a more feasible explanation, further supported by the identification of other IC-related phases.

If a fast IC does exist, a reflection from the interface of the IC and OC (ICB), that is, PKiKP phase (Fig. 1b), would be anticipated. The PKiKP phase has been used as the decisive phase for determining the presence of the lunar IC10. In the vespagram, we find a prominent arrival at about 604 ± 2 s after P (Fig. 2e). This arrival is characterized by a relative slowness of −6.5 ± 0.6 s per degree, aligning with the anticipated slowness range (−7.4 to −6.4 s per degree) for PKiKP, considering an IC radius ranging from 0 km to 900 km. Bootstrap tests and waveform analysis for individual events (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2) confirm the robustness of this PKiKP phase (Supplementary Information section A3.3). Moreover, the vespagram analysis following the deconvolution of the PKiKP waveform (Methods) shows that PKKP and PKiKP exhibit opposite polarities and an amplitude ratio of about 0.5 (Extended Data Fig. 3), which is consistent with the prediction and further supports the identification of these core phases.

By having the travel times of PKKP transiting the IC, PKiKP reflecting at the ICB and OC transiting phases (that is, P′P′r_ab and P′P′n), we can invert for the size and velocity of the IC. Here, rather than performing an entire Martian velocity structure inversion by combining our new measurements with those from previous studies, we focus on only inverting the P-wave velocity of the core (Methods). To assess sensitivity to mantle structure, we test a range of possible mantle models and obtain consistent results (Supplementary Information section A4), suggesting that jointly inverting for mantle structure does not have a large impact on the final core model. Furthermore, we use the differential time between the core phase and direct P phase, rather than the absolute travel times, to reduce the effects of possible location errors. With four sets of differential travel times, ΔTP′P′r_ab-P, ΔTP′P′n-P, ΔTPKKP-P and ΔTPKiKP-P, we conduct Bayesian inversions to determine the P-wave velocity (VP) structure of the core (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4). Figure 3 shows an example of inversion from the vespagram measurements by adopting the SKS_GD20 mantle velocity model. Results using various mantle velocity models and different inversion strategies are listed in Extended Data Table 2, which shows a mean IC radius (RIC) of 613 ± 67 km (Extended Data Fig. 5). The consistent inverted RIC using different mantle models primarily arises from jointly including both ΔTPKKP-P and ΔTPKiKP-P in the inversion, as PKKP and PKiKP share similar paths through both the mantle and the OC beneath the event and station (Fig. 1b). Our inverted IC size also agrees with the upper limit on the radius, estimated at around 750 km, based on the maximum depth reached by SKS for event S1000a (ref. 20). However, we recognize that three-dimensional mantle structures or uncertainties in the OC velocity could increase the uncertainty in the estimated IC size (Supplementary Fig. 32).

a, Example of case 1 from Extended Data Table 2. In this case, the P-wave velocity for the Martian core is inverted by adopting the SKS_GD model20 as the mantle velocity model and using the M_vesp strategy (Methods). By fitting the travel time measurements from vespagram (four cyan solid symbols in c), five core parameters (Extended Data Fig. 4), including OC radius (ROC), VP at the CMB (VP_CMB), the VP on the OC side at the ICB (VP_OC_ICB), IC radius (RIC) and the percentage of VP jump across the ICB (δVP_ICB) are inverted. The mean VP gradient in the IC is assumed to be the same as that in the OC. b, Marginal distribution of inverted RIC. The red and grey histograms represent the marginal distribution of the inverted RIC and the priori distribution of the RIC, respectively. Mean values and 85% confidence intervals are indicated with red text at the top. c, Observed (symbols) and predicted (lines) differential travel times for different phases. Open symbols and cyan solid symbols denote the individual event picks and vespagram measurements, respectively, with error bars indicating the uncertainties in travel times. Note that this example uses only the four travel times (cyan solid symbols) from the vespagram measurements for the inversion. Predicted travel times from 100 sampled models with the lowest travel time misfits in a are plotted. The light-blue-shaded region denotes the epicentral distance range of the events used for vespagram analysis and inversion. Three events with epicentral distances larger than 70° are not included in the inversion but are used to support the inverted Martian IC model.

The other three OC parameters, OC radius (ROC), VP at the CMB (VP_CMB), the VP on the OC side at the ICB (VP_OC_ICB), however, are less well constrained (Supplementary Information section A4.2 and Supplementary Information section B3). Strong trade-offs among these parameters suggest that a seismological core model derived solely from the limited measurements of core phases may be subject to large uncertainties. Nonetheless, the mean value of our inverted ROC of 1,799 ± 66 km (Supplementary Fig. 33), is similar to 1,780–1,810 km in ref. 20. Furthermore, as only PKKP travel time provides constraint on the IC velocity and its trade-offs with OC parameters, the percentage of VP jump across the ICB (δVP_ICB) is not well resolved. To address this, we adopt the OC parameters from the best geodynamical inverted model presented in ref. 20, which efficiently explains our P′P′ measurements (Supplementary Fig. 42), and invert only for RIC and δVP_ICB. This inversion yields a δVP_ICB of 32 ± 8%, equivalent to an IC VP of 7.3–8.3 km s−1 (Supplementary Fig. 43). In the subsequent discussion, we use these IC parameters for the sake of simplicity.

IC phases at distances beyond the range used for the inversion are also observed. Here, to avoid possible influences from mantle heterogeneities on travel times, we do not include them in the inversion. Rather, we assess how our IC models predict these phases (Supplementary Information section A5). First, three events, S1102a (73.3°), S1153a (84.8°) and S1415a (88.2°) (Fig. 1c), all exhibit visible PKiKP phases occurring at ±10 s around the predictions (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Second, we observe the presence of P′P′r_df (Fig. 1b) across a wider range of epicentral distance. Should a high-velocity IC exist, one branch of the P′P′r could sample the IC as an early arrived P′P′r_df (Fig. 1b) and extend to much larger distance compared with models without an IC (Extended Data Fig. 1). This is evident from an array analysis on the data within a distance range of 27°–40°, showing a robust energy peak aligned with the predicted arrival times and slowness of P′P′r_df (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Third, a bottom reflection from the ICB, named PKIIKP (Fig. 1b), can be identified in the vespagram, despite possible interference of the strong PcSScP (Extended Data Fig. 6h). However, we note that the amplitude of PKIIKP is half of PKKP in the synthetics, making its identification challenging.

Apart from seismic velocity, variation in density within the core plays an important part in constraining its composition. A notable aspect of this determination involves analysing the amplitude ratio between PKKP and PKiKP (APKKP/APKiKP) (Methods). Alongside the measurement from the vespagram analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), event S0235b offers concurrent, well-defined observations of both PKKP and PKiKP. To match the observed APKKP/APKiKP, a density jump across the ICB (δρ_ICB) of 7 ± 5% is preferred (Extended Data Fig. 7), despite large uncertainties due to noise and potential anomalous structures at the CMB. Furthermore, the potential presence of IC anisotropy and scatterers, similar to those observed in Earth9,22,37, could also affect the accuracy of determining δρ_ICB. This small δρ_ICB is also supported by the need to reconcile the mean density and moment of inertia of Mars (Supplementary Information section A6).

Our identification of about 0.18 Mars radii solid IC, proportionally similar in size to 0.19 Earth radii IC (Fig. 4), confirms the existence of core crystallization. The obtained VP and density jump across the ICB provide further constraints on the composition of the Martian core. Our calculation suggests that a pure solid Fe–Ni IC cannot explain the observed IC properties, which require the presence of substantial light elements in the core (Supplementary Information section A7). Based on cosmochemical and experimental constraints, S, C, O and H are candidate light elements in the Martian core38,39. However, the presence of H substantially depresses the melting point of Fe, potentially inhibiting the formation of a solid IC21,40,41. Although a small amount of H cannot be ruled out, its abundance is probably low, and our models focus on S, C and O. Previous experimental results suggest that the crystallization of an Fe3C-dominated solid IC requires more than 4 wt% C (refs. 42,43), resulting in an Fe–S–O–C OC. Under these conditions, the Martian core is estimated to contain approximately 12–16 wt% S, less than 6 wt% O and 4.0–4.7 wt% C (ref. 21). However, this composition would, on crystallization, produce density and velocity jumps across the ICB of 20–27% and around 22%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 49), which are inconsistent with our observations. By contrast, models with 12–16 wt% S, 6.7–9.0 wt% O and ≤3.8 wt% C (ref. 21) favour the crystallization of an FeO-rich solid IC under Martian core pressure–temperature conditions. Accounting for the partitioning of O and C between the OC and IC, the resulting density (3–9%) and velocity (24–31%) jumps across the ICB match our seismic observations (Extended Data Fig. 8). Meanwhile, the absolute velocity of an FeO-rich solid IC is also consistent with our observed seismic velocity. Therefore, an O-enriched core with distinct distributions of S and C between the OC and IC provides a possible explanation for the presence of a solid Martian IC with a radius of about 600 km. Although Martian core temperature estimates remain uncertain, the liquidus of the Fe–O–C–S system suggests that even if the core temperature is approximately 10% higher than current estimates, FeO can still crystallize to form a solid IC21. This high core temperature might also support the existence of an MSL at the CMB31,32. However, given the limited constraints on light element partition, elasticities and melting behaviour under Martian IC conditions, alternative compositional scenarios remain possible and should be considered in future interpretations. Moreover, large uncertainties in estimating the velocity and especially the density jumps across the ICB further complicate precise estimates of core composition.

With an IC, Mars appears as a scaled-down Earth, featuring proportional reductions in the IC, OC and mantle, and their corresponding core-transiting and reflecting phases are also similar.

Although a solid IC implies past or even present core crystallization, this is not necessarily incompatible with the absence of a dynamo today because a crystallization-driven dynamo depends on many factors, including the rate and style of core crystallization and the way light elements are partitioned between the solid and liquid phases14,18,44 (Supplementary Information section A7.2). Our results are consistent with previously considered scenarios in which the Martian core initially cooled rapidly, driving an early thermal dynamo11,12,13,14, but is now cooling too slowly to drive thermal convection and, in spite of ongoing crystallization, is unable to drive a dynamo now due to some combination of the crystallization proceeding too slowly or a lack of density contrast associated with the formation (or remelting) of crystals in the core3,14,18,44,45,46,47 (Supplementary Information section A7.2). Further understanding the formation of the Martian IC and its implications for dynamo evolution requires more detailed modelling and improved knowledge of Martian core composition as well as mantle viscosity. These investigations are important not only for clarifying Martian interior dynamics but also for understanding dynamo generation in other planetary bodies such as Mercury and Ganymede.

To avoid pitfalls related to transient one-sided pulses, typically referred to as glitches50, we first use two glitch-removal algorithms sequentially: the MPS, followed by the UCLA method proposed in ref. 51. Next, the UVW components are rotated to the ZNE components52. A Butterworth bandpass filter is then used to filter the glitch-reduced data to 0.2–0.8 Hz to avoid the 1-Hz tick noise, high-frequency idiosyncratic signals and long-period noises. Finally, we apply a time-domain polarization filter method53, routinely used in planetary seismology7,10,20,54,55,56, to suppress the non-linearly polarized noise and enhance the linearly polarized body wave phases.

Vespagram analysis30,57 can efficiently distinguish different seismic phases based on their unique travel time and slowness. By stacking the traces shifted along a specified slowness, a given phase is enhanced. Vespagram analysis has been applied to the detection of core-reflected phase ScS on Mars7. Unlike typical receiver array analyses for earthquakes, which allow for direct stacking waveforms to preserve important information about the amplitude and polarity, the vespagram analysis here is based on a source array30. Variations in marsquake properties, such as focal mechanism, magnitude and depth, combined with complicated propagation effects from possible three-dimensional structures, cause large differences in absolute amplitudes and waveforms among different events, making vespagram analysis more challenging.

To minimize absolute amplitude differences among different marsquakes, we normalize each polarization-filtered trace within the targeted time window as

where μ and σ are the mean value and standard deviation of waveform data X, respectively. In the subsequent section on determining the amplitude and polarity of PKKP and PKiKP, we also normalize the entire waveform record using the amplitude of the reference phase or by deconvolving the reference phase.

Both polarization-filtered waveforms from the vertical component and their envelopes (Supplementary Information section A3.2.2.1) are tested as inputs for vespagram analysis. To improve the slowness resolution, non-linear stacking methods are applied. For waveform data, we test both fourth-root vespagram and phase-weighted stack (PWS)30, whereas envelope data use only the fourth-root vespagram. It is important to note that differences in waveform polarities and source durations among events may reduce the stacking energy even when they are aligned with a specified slowness. Vespagrams for synthetic P waveforms, assuming different source mechanisms and durations for different events, demonstrate that envelope data produces stronger and more focused energy than waveforms. Moreover, owing to the variation and incoherence in waveforms across different events, PWS cannot produce focused energy (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Moreover, FDPA (see section ‘Analysis for individual events' for details) shows distinct differences in vertical (VRM) and horizontal (HRM) rectilinear motion between compressional and shear waves. To further enhance vertically polarized signals, we test multiplying the VRM–HRM to the polarization-filtered waveforms and conduct vespagram analysis subsequently (Supplementary Fig. 24).

Here we select 23 low-frequency marsquakes (Extended Data Table 1) and focus on using the fourth-root vespagram to detect core phases (Supplementary Information section A3.2.2). The traces are aligned with the direct P provided in the MQS29. Therefore, the travel time and slowness derived from the vespagram analysis are relative to those of the direct P. The reference epicentral distance is set at 29°. The grid exhibiting the highest coherent energy within the targeted time-slowness window, and demonstrating the most consistent presence in the bootstrap tests, is then picked as our candidate phase.

To address uncertainties and assess the reliability of our vespagram results, bootstrap resampling test58 is used. We conduct three types of bootstrap resampling tests.

In type I, we randomly select two-thirds of the events to generate a vespagram, minimizing the influence of events with anomalous amplitudes.

In type II, given that most events are concentrated at a distance range of 29°–32° (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7), which could bias the vespagram results, we randomly select half of the events from this distance range, along with events at other epicentral distances, to generate the vespagram.

In type III, we randomly shift each trace within a range of −10 s and 10 s before stacking to mitigate possible uncertainties in the epicentral distance and picked P-arrival time.

For all tests, we repeat the random resampling process 200 times and calculate the mean vespagram along with the corresponding 95% confidence levels.

Contamination from glitches could potentially introduce artefacts50, even with the application of glitch-removal processes. To evaluate possible effects of glitches, we conduct additional vespagram analysis on the raw data, and the data contain only identified glitch signals (Supplementary Fig. 23). The results indicate that the energy of the core phases identified on the vespagram is not attributable to these glitches.

Guided by the results from the vespagram analysis, we apply complementary approaches to identify core phases for individual events, including time-domain envelopes (filter bank)56 and polarized analysis33.

In the filter bank approach, we first apply a zero-phase-shift bandpass filter to the vertical velocity trace of each event, using a bandwidth half an octave wide around each central frequency, ranging from 1/16 Hz to 2 Hz. Next, we use a time-domain polarization filter to construct a filter bank and compute envelopes in 5-s-long time windows. Given the uncertainty in marsquake locations, to better identify the arrivals, we select the time-domain envelope peaks within a ±15 s time window around the predictions from the vespagram analysis, focusing on a frequency band from 1/4.8 Hz to 1/1.2 Hz, for which clear energy packages are consistently observed.

We further use the FDPA method7,20,59. We start by computing the S-transform of three-component waveforms and a 3 × 3 cross-spectral covariance matrix using 90% overlapping time windows, with duration varying inversely with frequency. The relative sizes of the eigenvalues of this covariance matrix indicate the degree of polarization (DOP) of the particle motion, ranging from 0 and 1, whereas the complex-valued components of the eigenvectors describe the particle motion ellipsoid. A polarized wave results in a notably larger eigenvalue and a DOP close to 1. The orientation of the semi-major axis provides information on the inclination, with the back-azimuth derived from the projection of the axis onto the horizontal plane and the deviation from the vertical plane determining the inclination. We then identify seismic arrivals with rectilinear particle motion dominantly polarized in vertical (VRM) and horizontal directions (HRM). Given the nearly vertical incidence of the core phases, a strong peak in the VRM–HRM plot would confirm their presence (Extended Data Fig. 2).

For the vespagram results, we estimate the uncertainties in the slowness and travel time of the candidate phases using the bootstrap resampling test type I (refs. 60,61). In each vespagram from the resampling tests, grids with energy exceeding 85% of the peak are assigned a value of 1, whereas others receive a value of 0. We then sum the values at each grid and calculate their percentage occurrence among all tests (Fig. 2b,e), showing a concentrated distribution at the slowness and travel time of the candidate core phases. To evaluate the effect of the threshold selection, we also test two alternative levels: 50% and 70% (Supplementary Fig. 16). Although lower thresholds yield higher percentage occurrences, they also produce more dispersed energy distributions. Accordingly, we adopt the 85% threshold as an optimal balance between robustness and precision. Focusing on a window around these phases, we fit the distribution separately along the travel time and slowness axes with Gaussian functions (Fig. 2e) to derive mean values for each. The uncertainties are represented by the 1σ values obtained from these analyses.

In the analysis for individual events, the RMS value of envelope peaks from 1/4.8 Hz to 1/1.2 Hz in the filter bank is used to determine the arrival time of our candidate phase (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The corresponding standard deviation is computed to estimate the travel time uncertainty for subsequent inversions.

To better capture the relative amplitude between different phases, we first normalize the time window for a reference phase (for example, P or PKiKP) using equation (1). Other phases are then normalized using the same ratio as the reference phase. Both stackings produce similar results, which shows that a stacked amplitude ratio of around 0.5 between PKKP and PKiKP (APKKP/APKiKP) (Supplementary Fig. 28).

For the polarity, we first adjust the traces to ensure all P waveforms have positive polarity. However, the polarity of PKiKP can vary, either positive or negative, depending on the focal mechanism. Therefore, this approach does not yield focused energy. We then test by setting the polarity of all targeted PKiKP arrivals to positive, and analyse the corresponding vespagram for PKKP. Nevertheless, this adjustment does not markedly improve the results because of possible source complexity and complicated propagation effects (Supplementary Fig. 29).

Source complexity and propagation effects at shallow depths can be partially removed by deconvolving the P (using −2 s to 8 s of the P-arrival time here) or PKiKP (−5 s to 5 s) waveforms. Vespagrams from deconvolved waveforms show more focused energy than those from the original waveforms (Supplementary Fig. 30). Notably, deconvolving PKiKP shows that the vespagram of PKKP has opposite polarity to PKiKP, with an APKKP/APKiKP of about 0.5, consistent with the individual event measurement (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 31). However, we exercise caution about whether the selected P or PKiKP waveforms accurately represent the source. Consequently, extracting amplitude and polarity information for marsquakes with low signal-to-noise ratios and unknown source mechanisms remains challenging. Moreover, using envelope data proves to be more effective and stable for vespagram analysis in detecting core phases.

We also measure the APKKP/APKiKP for event S0235b, which has concurrent and clear observations of both phases. In the bandpass-filtered data (Extended Data Fig. 7a), the amplitudes of PKiKP and PKKP are determined as the maximum amplitude in the target windows. We estimate the amplitude uncertainties as the maximum amplitude in the noise window, defined as 5–15 s before the main phases. This allows us to calculate the APKKP/APKiKP, along with its uncertainty, as shown in the blue-shaded region in Extended Data Fig. 7c.

To solve the inverse problem of determining core seismic velocity profile, we use the probabilistic approach62, with a solution given by

where k is a normalization constant, f(m) is the prior model parameter probability distribution, L(m) is the likelihood function, which is a measure of the similarity between the data and the predictions from model m, and σ(m) is the posterior probability distribution.

Assuming that data noise is uncorrelated and described by a Laplace distribution (L1-norm), the likelihood function takes the form

where φ is the misfit function. The general expression for the misfit is

where dobs and dcal denote the vectors of observed and synthetic travel times relative to the P, with N expressing the total number of travel times, which comprises all possible combinations of phases with respect to P: ΔTPKiKP–TP, ΔTPKKP–TP, ΔTP′P′r_ab–TP, ΔTP′P′n–TP and σ is the travel time uncertainty obtained from either vespagram or individual event analysis.

We use two strategies to define the travel time dataset and the associated σ. The first strategy, referred to as M_vesp, uses travel time picks of core phases and their uncertainties from the vespagram as dobs and σ, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). In this case, each core phase has only one travel time pick and the corresponding dcal represents the theoretical travel time at a single epicentral distance of 29°. Alternatively, the second strategy, M_pick, uses travel times relative to P for selected individual events at their epicentre distances as dobs (Supplementary Tables 3–6).

As the slowness of PKiKP offers additional constraints on IC size, we also incorporate the slowness into the M_vesp by modifying the misfit function φ as

where pPKiKP_obs and σp represent the observed slowness and its corresponding uncertainty derived from the vespagram analysis in Fig. 2e, whereas pPKiKP_cal is the calculated slowness for a select model; w denotes the weight balancing the contributions of travel time and slowness in the misfit function. By incorporating the slowness of PKiKP (Extended Data Table 2, case 9), the inverted IC radius is consistent with those obtained by inverting only travel times, but with a more concentrated posterior distribution.

Finally, to sample the posterior distribution (equation (2)), we use the Metropolis sampling algorithm62. This algorithm randomly samples the model space, ensuring more frequent sampling of models that align with previous information while simultaneously fitting the data.

Given that our target seismic phases are primarily related to the Martian core, a crucial consideration is whether to invert the Martian mantle structure simultaneously. As PKiKP and PKKP travel with nearly identical paths in the mantle (Fig. 1b), their differential travel time are primarily affected by the core structure, with only minimal impact from the one-dimensional mantle structure variations (see Supplementary Information section A4.1 for more details). This supports our decision to focus solely on inverting core velocity structure with ΔTPKKP–P and ΔTPKiKP–P. By opting for differential travel times over absolute travel times, we also mitigate the effects of the uncertainties of the mantle model. Furthermore, the mantle near the antipode sampled by the P′P′ could potentially be heterogeneous59,63,64,65,66. Therefore, we refrain from amalgamating travel times obtained in previous studies7,20,31,32,56,59 and our new measurements to invert the entire Martian velocity structure. Instead, we invert the P-wave velocity (VP) structure of the core based on different mantle models and assess how different models can affect the inverted core models. Seven representative mantle models: the mean, lower and upper bound VP models from the AK_subset models7; the two inverted VP models incorporating SKS travel times20; and the two models with MSL31,32 are selected to perform inversion separately. These mantle models encompass a range of models produced in previous studies.

The Martian core P-wave velocity structure is then parameterized with five model parameters (Extended Data Fig. 4): the OC radius (ROC), the VP at the CMB (VP_CMB), the VP of the OC side at the ICB (VP_OC_ICB), the IC radius (RIC), and the VP jump at ICB (δVP_ICB). Here, the model spaces of the OC are based on the results in ref. 20. In the case of the model with an MSL overlying the liquid OC (Extended Data Fig. 4c), the thickness of MSL, the mean velocity gradient in MSL and the VP jump at the bottom of MSL (the real CMB) are set according to the two models, MSL_ETH31 and MSL_IPGP32. To simplify the travel time calculation using TauP67, we treat the MSL as a part of the liquid OC. Thus, our identified PKKP corresponds to PKKPMSL in this case and the inverted ROC contains the thickness of MSL.

We further assume that the mean velocity gradients in the OC and IC are the same. The core velocity at a certain depth r is interpreted with a smooth function as

Here, r1 and r2 are the depths of the CMB and ICB, respectively. \({V}_{{{\rm{P}}}_{1}}\) and \({V}_{{{\rm{P}}}_{2}}\) denote the corresponding velocities at these interfaces.

The inverted core velocity profiles, based on different mantle models and strategies, are listed in Extended Data Table 2.

The presence of H substantially lowers the melting point of Fe, making it difficult to form a solid IC41. Therefore, in our density and velocity models, we considered only O, C and S as light elements in the Martian core. We examined two distinct core composition models. In the first model, when the C content exceeds 4 wt%, a C-rich IC may precipitate42,43. Under this scenario, the O and S contents range from 0 to 6 wt% and 12 to 16 wt%, respectively21. The second model assumes an O-enriched core. A solid O-rich IC will precipitate when the oxygen content exceeds about 6.7 wt% (ref. 21). Based on the seismologically inferred radius of the IC, we estimate the O content in the Martian core to be 6.7–9.0 wt%, corresponding to C and S concentrations of approximately 0–4 wt% and 12–16 wt%, respectively21. Both models account for the partitioning of O and C between the Martian OC and IC. The density and velocity profiles of solid Fe3C and FeO under high pressure and temperature conditions are as follows68,69:

The influence of O, C and S on the OC velocity and density are calculated as follows54:

where Cont.O, Cont.C and Cont.S are mole per cent of O, C and S used in our modelling.

Light and heavy lines represent travel times for models without and with IC, respectively. The travel times are calculated for a marsquake at a depth of 33 km, using the best “geodynamical” inversion model (SKS_GD model) from ref. 20 as the mode without IC and assuming a + 30% velocity jump across the ICB for the IC model with an IC radius of 618 km.

a, Filter bank analysis. The coloured waveforms represent filtered data with narrow bandpass filters with different centre frequencies, as indicated by the coloured text. The grey dashed line denotes the travel time computed by vespagram analysis and the blue dashed line denotes the root-mean-square value of time-domain envelope peaks (black circles) in a frequency range from 1/4.8 Hz to 1/1.2 Hz (heavy coloured lines). The pink shaded region outlines the time distribution of the peaks. b, Waveform and FDPA analysis. The upper panel shows the vertical component waveforms and corresponding envelopes of the bandpass- (grey line) and polarization- (blue line) filtered traces within a frequency band indicated by the black rectangles circled in c. The back-azimuth is provided by MQS29. The lower panel is the vertical-horizontal summed FDPA intensity as a function of time. c, Polarization analysis. From top to bottom, spectrum, azimuth, inclination angle of the major axis of particle motion, and ellipticity (DOP) obtained from polarization analysis. We reject all parts of the signal with a DOP < 0.6 by setting the corresponding part of the S-transformed data to zero, which allowed us to suppress some weakly polarized signals. The inclination angle represents the angle deviating from the horizontal plane. The black dashed lines denote the travel-time picks obtained from filter bank analysis. The black rectangles outline the travel-time pick uncertainties of ± s in the frequency range 0.5–0.7 Hz. The blue dashed lines in b,c denote the travel-time picked from filter bank analysis in a. d, The particle motions on the vertical and radial components in a time window of ±2.5 s based on the travel time picked from filter bank analysis. The red line denotes the fitted line and its incident angle deviating from the vertical plane (θ) and error (δθ) are annotated below. e, Kernel density estimation. The black dashed lines denote the maximum values of probability density computed by marginalizing over the frequency and time axes as the black rectangle shown in c.

Here, the ROC is the sum of the real core radius and the thickness of MSL. The core velocity at a certain depth is interpreted with a smooth function as defined in Methods.

a, Bandpass and b, polarization filtered data in a frequency range of 0.2–0.8 Hz, with all data traces are aligned on PKKP or PKiKP arrival times. Both data (black) and synthetics (red) are normalized on the amplitude of PKKP. Our inverted model BS_SKS_GD_IC, with +30% P-velocity jump across the ICB exhibits an excellent fit to the travel times, requiring −0.2 s shift of PKKP in the synthetics to match the waveform of PKKP and PKiKP simultaneously. The density jump (δρ) at the ICB used for generating synthetics is indicated by the number following each trace. c, Amplitude ratio of PKiKP and PKKP (APKKP/APKiKP). The blue open circles denote the synthetics APKKP/APKiKP assuming different δρ.

The dashed and dashed-dotted lines represent the measured APKKP/APKiKP obtained from vespagram analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3b) using linear and 4th-root stacking, respectively. A density jump at the ICB of 7 ± 5% is preferred to explain the observed APKKP/APKiKP.

Geologically storing carbon is a key strategy for abating emissions from fossil fuels and durably removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere1,2. However, the storage potential is not unlimited3,4. Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2 storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.

Storing carbon for centuries to millennia in geologic formations will be required if the world is to achieve the goals of the United Nations (UN) Paris Agreement. Key milestones include reaching net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, at which point global temperatures are likely to stop increasing5,6, and pursuing mitigation strategies to reach net-negative CO2 and net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, at which point global mean surface temperature could start to decline7. This need has been recognized by scientists and policymakers for decades8, including in recent UN climate negotiations9.

Net-zero CO2 emissions will occur when gross sources of CO2 equal removals by sinks. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has a role in both reducing sources (through, for example, storing captured CO2 from cement production and fossil-fuel combustion) and durably removing CO2 from the atmosphere (for example, storing CO2 captured from the atmosphere or biomass combustion). Despite its prominence in scientific and policy discourse, present deployment of CCS is small, with 49 MtCO2 yr−1 of capture capacity in operation and 416 MtCO2 yr−1 either planned or in construction10. Almost all facilities are planned to store carbon in sedimentary rock formations, the focus of our analysis, with the largest planned basalt-based storage facility having a capacity of less than 0.036 MtCO2 yr−1. The majority of operational storage facilities are utilized for enhanced oil recovery, a process that overall results in net-positive CO2 emissions11. However, the technical potential for geologic carbon storage is commonly assumed to be vast, with estimates of available storage of around 10,000–40,000 GtCO2 in the scientific literature3,12. Industry estimates are around 14,000 GtCO2, of which 13,400 GtCO2 is undiscovered4 and just 253 MtCO2 is considered currently economically viable13.

Many scenarios that limit climate change to the goals set out by governments in the Paris Agreement1 assume a large scale-up of the use of CCS to abate further combustion of fossil fuels, reduce emissions from industrial sectors that have limited or no mitigation alternatives, and durably store CO2 that was removed from the atmosphere, contributing to carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Planning to use storage for both reducing sources of emissions and for CDR presents risks should storage infrastructure fail to be deployed at scale. This risk can be somewhat mitigated by sustainably deploying a portfolio of approaches, including storing carbon in the built environment through what is referred to as the forestry–construction pump14, enhancing the carbon content of soils, and conserving and expanding land and coastal carbon sinks, which would reduce dependence on geologic storage by using less-durable carbon-storage media.

The scale of deployment of CCS (and thus geologic storage) in future scenarios is not absolute and depends on policy and political choices. While nearly all scenarios limiting warming below 2 °C deploy some level of CCS, some scenarios that exceed the 1.5 °C warming limit by a large margin and subsequently hope to reverse global warming utilize up to 2,000 GtCO2 of storage by the end of the century. The higher the so-called overshoot of a specific acceptable level of warming, the bigger the need for atmospheric CO2 removal and hence cumulative carbon storage. Demand for geologic carbon storage can also increase in these scenarios based on other mitigation choices, such as deploying blue (fossil-gas based) versus green (renewable-energy based) hydrogen, electrifying steel production versus capturing carbon from existing processes, and reducing demand for cement versus capturing carbon from cement production. Even more storage will be needed than shown in scenarios if the Earth system responds differently than expected by the current state-of-the-art climate models15.

Large-scale utilization of carbon storage comes with sizable risks and deep uncertainty of feasible storage potential and injection rates16,17, which are not well captured in models that describe how future emissions reductions could be achieved. Leakage of CO2 from storage sites due to seismic activity, well-head failure or other factors would potentially reintroduce carbon into the atmosphere18, where annual leakage rates greater than 0.01% can negate the climate benefits of stored CO2 (refs. 18,19). For storage locations near population centres, the potential seepage of stored carbon into municipal aquifers can change groundwater quality and pose health concerns20. These risks and other considerations such as environmental conservation, risk of project failure21, public perception and the geopolitics of transnational sedimentary basin boundaries22 could severely restrict the total available carbon-storage volume that can be assumed when developing national energy plans and climate strategies.

The Paris Agreement establishes a number of specific requirements for parties when making climate pledges, including that they are fair, ambitious and in line with the best available science. Norms of international law go further, requiring “high standards of due diligence to prevent transboundary environmental harm”23. Although previous studies have estimated global3,24 or regional25,26 technical storage potential, so far, no consistent estimate of the global carbon-storage potential assesses this variety of different risk factors to determine the available storage potential from a precautionary harm-prevention perspective as expected under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Country plans for utilizing carbon storage in their climate strategies can thus at present not be evaluated against potential risks and storage limits. When assessed globally, our estimates can inform an understanding of prudent and precautionary planetary limits for geologic carbon storage.

Here we provide a spatially explicit estimation of carbon-storage potential in sedimentary basins consistent with the principle of harm prevention, which can guide policymakers in considering the amounts of CO2 storage in their emissions targets that are robust to multiple sources of uncertainty and risk. We argue that nations should make explicit plans for geologic carbon storage for both mitigating continued sources of fossil-fuel emissions as well as durably removing and storing CO2. Treating geologic carbon storage as a limited global resource that should be managed on an intergenerational timescale requires considering the trade-offs of continuing to emit carbon from fossil-based sources versus utilizing storage space for removing carbon from the atmosphere to ultimately lower the global mean temperature for this and future generations.

We conceptualize a planetary limit for geologic carbon storage in the context of harm prevention and risk avoidance. When carbon storage is understood as a consumable and depletable common good, transgressing this limit results in permanent trade-offs with other dimensions of sustainable development such as human health and biodiversity27. Future impacts of climate change, their potential reversibility and respective consequences will be critically dependent on this limit.

We perform a spatially explicit analysis, identifying and systematically applying multiple exclusion layers based on preventative risk analysis to a global map of sedimentary basins suitable for carbon storage (Methods, Supplementary Figs. 1–6 and Supplementary Tables 1–3, including for assessed sensitivities). We then estimate a planetary limit for geologic carbon storage by assessing the remaining onshore and offshore basin volumes that meet all risk criteria (Fig. 1).

The most prevalent present-day target sites for CO2 storage are depleted hydrocarbon fields or deep saline aquifers within geologically stable sedimentary basins. Several criteria must be considered when assessing the suitability of basins for CO2 storage, such as storage capacity based on pore volume, depth of target formation, seal integrity, tectonic hazards and basin type28,29. A typical high-quality reservoir for CO2 storage would have presence of a seal (layers of impermeable cap rock), favourable petrophysical parameters for injectivity and storage, sufficient depth, and low risk for reactivation of existing faults. Cautionary approaches restrict injection to minimum depths of about 1 km to ensure that the CO2 is in a supercritical state and maximum depths of about 2.5 km to avoid destabilizing bedrock and to limit potential seismic activation of deep-rooted faults30, which we use to constrain our volumetric calculation. We also limit our central estimate to ocean depths of 300 m or less, where the vast majority of current offshore oil and gas infrastructure are predominantly sited, owing to both economic and risk considerations. We assess uncertainty ranges for storage depth based on an extensive literature review and ocean depth based on a geographic information system analysis of current oil and gas infrastructure (Methods).

Basins in the proximity of active seismic zones, for example, close to plate subduction areas, have elevated in situ stress, making them prone to complex fault systems and tectonic events. The pressure increase during CO2 injection can lead to induced seismicity via fault reactivation, potentially triggering low-intensity earthquakes. Furthermore, fault reactivation can also compromise the storage complex, creating pathways for the CO2 to escape31. As such, we exclude basin areas where historic seismic activity is larger than ‘moderate' severity based on US Geological Society's scale32.

Following a long history of environmental protection and conservation, and in line with international agreements such as the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, we exclude sensitive environmental areas based on protected areas as well as the Arctic and Antarctic polar circles.

We further exclude a 25-km buffer area (central case) around built-up areas of human settlement under a high-population future scenario (Methods) to minimize the risks for human health from direct leakage from aboveground infrastructure or release of carbon from the reservoir in which it will be stored for centuries to millennia. CO2 that escapes to the surface can pose a threat to shallow groundwater reservoirs by lowering the pH of the groundwater through the formation of carbonic acid. This might have several secondary effects, for example, the mobilization of toxic metals, sulfate or chloride33, which may contain impurities of other gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide, which increase the effect of toxic metal mobilization34.

These environmental considerations and perceived risks, as well as general concerns about delaying the scale-up of renewables and the perception that CCS may prolong the use of fossil fuels, have been linked to low levels of public and political support of geologic carbon storage35,36. For example, CCS is currently banned or majorly restricted in some European countries (see Supplementary Table 4 for current countries with restrictive CCS policies), but there are growing discussions to adjust the existing regulations to allow onshore and offshore storage to achieve climate targets. However, these policy developments remain politically contested, highlighting the volatile and uncertain nature of public and political support of geologic carbon storage.

If supported by domestic policy, countries have legal authority to store carbon within their own boundaries (including, for example, their marine exclusive economic zones (EEZs)). However, it remains largely unclear how international treaties would perform in a future with multiple state actors injecting carbon into a common basin, on land but especially at sea, given a recent advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea37. The London Convention and London Protocol has, so far, been the most proactive international body addressing carbon storage in subsea geologic formations38, having adopted a resolution permitting countries to bilaterally agree on sharing such transboundary storage. So far, though, only very few countries have applied for such an allowance39. We include all basins within EEZs exclusive of contested territorial claims in our central assessment with certain restrictions in our sensitivity case, but note that any policy outcome that severely limits offshore storage locations would strongly limit the total global storage potential.

We find that the initial global physical storage potential of 11,800 GtCO2 is reduced by about an order of magnitude after combining all our spatial risk layers to a planetary limit of 1,460 GtCO2 (1,290–2,710 GtCO2), of which about 70% occurs onshore and about 30% occurs offshore (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 1). Our multi-dimensional risk-prevention approach results in heterogeneous outcomes across countries (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Table 5). Many countries with rich natural carbon-storage reserves maintain relatively high levels of storage potential even after our risk analysis, notably, Russia, USA, China, Brazil and Australia. A number of countries have high levels of storage potential that are left largely untouched by our risk analysis, including Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kazakhstan. Other regions see large decreases in available storage affecting a significant portion of their total storage potential, with India, Norway, Canada and countries within the European Union experiencing the largest impact. When we apply exclusion layers in the order presented here, we find that that the largest increase in storage would be realized if our assumptions regarding storage and ocean depth were relaxed, followed by assumptions regarding storage in polar regions and protected areas (Supplementary Table 1).

The majority of mitigation strategies consider geologic carbon storage to some extent in support of the transformation towards net-zero and net-negative CO2 futures2. Which carbon capture approaches are utilized in future mitigation scenarios depends on a variety of factors, including assumed costs, scale-up rates and the efficiency of capture. Coupling carbon capture with hydrogen and synthetic fuel production provides efficient pathways to achieve deep mitigation in heavy industry and transportation sectors40 and can enable net-negative sectoral outcomes when using biomass instead of fossil feedstocks41. Future scenarios tend to utilize large-scale carbon capture at individual point sources in the power (for example, biomass and fossil-fuelled generation) and industry (for example, cement production) sectors owing to the relatively high concentrations of carbon in the effluent flue gases42. Net-negative emissions futures are increasingly being studied that utilize direct air capture with CCS, which removes and durably stores ambient CO2 from the atmosphere43,44,45,46. The regional allocation of the ultimate storage depends on assumptions of regional storage capacity and infrastructure needs, which vary in their level of detail across different modelling frameworks47.

Cumulative storage demand in scenarios is driven by factors including the peak temperature achieved in a scenario, the ultimate level of temperature decline thereafter, and the chosen mitigation strategy regarding the phase out of the use of fossil fuels, be it abated or unabated. The amount of geologic storage needed at the point of net-zero CO2 emissions is a function of the amount of fossil-energy emissions abated through CCS, the remaining positive (residual) CO2 emissions, and the amount of carbon removal owing to conventional, land-based methods such as reforestation and soil carbon sequestration. Scenarios tend to use storage primarily for carbon removal and fossil point-source capture, with industrial capture having an important but smaller role (Supplementary Fig. 7). The durability of carbon sequestered via geologic storage tends to be significantly better compared with land-based removals as geologically stored carbon is not subject to the same environmental and human factors that can lead to leakage of land-based carbon removals into the atmosphere48, a distinction that is not generally considered in mitigation scenarios or strategies.

To maintain net-zero and achieve net-negative CO2 emissions implies a persistent demand for storage resources (Fig. 3a) based on the continued use of abated fossil fuels and residual emissions for five primary purposes: counterbalancing residual emissions from fossil-fuel use (limiting CO2 pollution and temperature increase); counterbalancing other residual CO2 (limiting CO2 pollution and temperature increase); counterbalancing residual long-lived non-CO2 GHGs (limiting climate forcing and temperature increase); achieving net-negative CO2 emissions beyond point 2 (reversing CO2 pollution and enhancing temperature decrease); and achieving net-zero total GHG emissions (a key milestone in the Paris Agreement, reversing CO2 pollution and enhancing temperature decrease).

a, Schematic highlighting the assumed use of carbon storage in mitigation strategies based on a future trajectory of net CO2 emissions and whether a temperature limit is achieved and maintained or whether a limit is exceeded after a peak and temperature drawdown occurs thereafter (top). Total yearly carbon storage is further differentiated by the strategy of fossil-fuel consumption pursued towards and after achieving net-zero CO2 emissions (middle and bottom). b, Cumulative stored carbon (scale of 1,000 GtCO2) distributed across scenarios until the time of net-zero CO2 emissions (left-side distributions) and until the last modelled year (2100, right-side distributions) against different thresholds: all non-excluded basins that currently have operational oil and gas facilities (purple), additional storage consistent with all remaining onshore basins (yellow), remaining offshore basins (red) and the prudent planetary limit (grey). In each distribution, the full range, median and interquartile lines are shown. c,d, The number of years it would take to reach each of the shown limits if storage levels were maintained after achieving net-zero CO2 emissions (c) or if storage levels were extrapolated beyond the year 2100 (d). The bars represent interquartile ranges and whiskers represent the 5th–95th percentile in c and d. Although we aggregate thresholds globally here, carbon storage is regionally deployed in integrated models with different regions exceeding thresholds at different points in time (Supplementary Figs. 8–12), with storage in the IPCC's Asia region (including China and India) exceeding even our planetary limit threshold this century (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Nearly all 2-°C-and-lower temperature scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stay within at least a 50% margin of our assessed planetary limit when net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (Fig. 3b). Even so, scenarios limiting warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot (>33% to stay below 1.5 °C until 2100, >50% in 2100) sequester 8.7 (5.9–13) GtCO2 yr−1 when reaching net-zero CO2 emissions around 2050–2055. This represents a 175-fold increase from today's levels and an industrial capacity on par with current global crude oil production49. Carbon injection rates at net-zero CO2 systematically increase with decreasing policy stringency as delayed near-term mitigation action results in stronger dependence on carbon storage.

Maintaining this level of storage (as in the limited fossil, stabilization scenario of Fig. 3a) results in an eventual breach of our proposed threshold in the next 250 years across more than 75% of all assessed scenarios (Fig. 3c). Scenarios with the strongest climate action take the longest time to reach this limit, on average about 150 years after reaching net-zero CO2 emissions. Scenarios of less stringent climate action reach this limit earlier, with scenarios limiting warming to likely 2 °C (that is, with >67% probability), reaching it on average about 120 years after net-zero CO2.

Much more storage will probably be needed after net-zero CO2 emissions is achieved to help draw down global mean temperatures by continuing to counterbalance residual emissions and actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Although there is no agreed-upon limit to global temperature stabilization, the Paris Agreement and subsequent UN decisions outline that 1.5 °C is a threshold that should be returned to—if breached. A proportion of scenarios assessed by the IPCC that achieve net-zero CO2 emissions this century breach our proposed planetary limit by the end of the century (Fig. 3b) to enable temperature drawdown. In 2100, carbon storage activity is continuing to grow, with 1.5-°C and 2-°C scenarios storing on average 15 (11–18) GtCO2 yr−1. The exceedance is not regionally uniform, with more than 50% of all scenarios breaching our assessed limit in the IPCC's Asia region (Supplementary Fig. 8, and Supplementary Figs. 9–12 for other regions), which includes some of the largest emerging economies with high levels of current emissions and future emissions under current climate policies and targets50,51, such as China and India.

Crucially, although scenarios describe mitigation pathways until the end of the century, they represent a continued future beyond this time horizon under which limitations on carbon storage persist52. The continued demand for storage resources can proceed indefinitely if either fossil resources continue to be consumed or there is a need to deploy CDR to further draw down temperature. Following the end-of-century carbon-storage trends in scenarios shows that nearly all scenarios would exceed available storage in basins with existing oil and gas infrastructure by 2125 and would exceed the planetary limit for geologic storage before 2200 (Fig. 3d).

Our prudent limit to geologic carbon storage of 1,460 GtCO2 brings profound implications for robust mitigation strategies that depend on the most durable forms of carbon storage. This limit sets a cap of about 0.7 °C (0.6–1.2 °C based on assessed exclusion criteria uncertainties; Supplementary Table 2) on the total warming that can ever be sustainably reversed if the full prudent potential is used for durable CO2 removal, assuming the IPCC's central estimate of the temperature response to cumulative emissions of CO2 (0.45 °C per 1,000 GtCO2) and that climate response to net-negative emissions is similar in magnitude to its response to net-positive emissions, which might not always be the case53. Any share of this prudent potential that is used for continued fossil-fuel use with CCS reduces this maximum amount proportionally, as does any level of residual CO2 and other long-lived non-CO2 emissions that are not eliminated.

Taking a more precautionary interpretation of the climate response to cumulative emissions of CO2 and its effectiveness in reversing warming shows an even starker outcome. Assuming the lower end of the assessed likely range of temperature response (that is, the lower end of the central 66% range) of 0.27 °C per 1,000 GtCO2 indicates that the prudent potential of geologic carbon storage at best can facilitate a temperature reversal from peak warming of about 0.4 °C (0.35–0.7 °C), which is by all means an overestimate of the real-world reversal potential given the anticipated persistence of residual emissions from several industrial and agricultural activities.

Recognizing that geologic carbon storage may be a limited resource requires careful consideration to be taken by nation states when developing domestic energy transition and climate plans. Given the millennial timescales for which carbon storage is needed to counteract the impact of released CO2 on climate change, decisions made on carbon management today will affect the human population for more than ten generations into the future. This raises the question of which countries, sectors and generations should be entitled to utilize available geologic storage resources.

There is unequal impact on countries' geologic carbon-storage reserves across dimensions of both capabilities to mitigate and historic responsibility for emissions based on our analysis (Fig. 4a). Some high-gross-domestic-product countries with high historic emissions such as Russia, USA and Canada are better placed to implement geologic storage solutions, whereas other relatively rich historic emitters such as the European region have substantially reduced storage potential. At the same time, some developing countries with robust storage potential such as Indonesia and Brazil, and some countries in Africa, have historically contributed little to global emissions and thus may have weak domestic incentive to exploit their storage resources unless the removals can be traded. In a future that significantly exploits available storage resources, our results indicate that large-scale transfers of captured carbon may occur, resulting in higher risks for leakage during transmission, either through shipping or via pipelines, and raising question of distributive justice and equity.

a, The relationship between responsibility for historical emissions (x axis)66 and the remaining storage potential (y axis) is shown, with the size of each point in the scatter plot being proportional to per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Countries in the top-right quadrant of the plot have relatively high historical responsibility for current warming levels and relatively high amounts of carbon storage available to support high-durability carbon removal, which in principle would lead to reducing future responsibility. Countries in the bottom-right quadrant have high responsibility, but limited capacity to store carbon domestically based on our analysis, implying the need to transport carbon elsewhere. Countries in the top-left quadrant have low responsibility but high remaining storage potential, and thus could in principle provide storage for appropriate financial transfers to countries without available resources under the Paris Agreement's principle of common-but-differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities to arrive at fairer outcomes aligned with its long-term temperature goal. Individual three-letter country codes are provided in Supplementary Table 5. b, The same plot as in a but using the emissions embedded in extracted fossil fuels by industrial carbon majors (https://carbonmajors.org/Downloads), showing which nations have the highest responsibility for historical fossil-fuel extraction—and thus who has reaped the largest revenues from sale of fossil resources—rather than territorial emissions.

We also find that oil-producing nations in the Arabian Peninsula, who have the know-how to pursue carbon storage also have storage reserves that are largely robust to our risk-prevention analysis. Other countries with a long history of an active domestic oil and gas industry and also relatively large storage potential include USA, Australia and Canada. For global policy limiting warming to well below 2 °C to be successful, these incumbent industry actors must be appropriately incentivized to become net injectors, rather than extractors, of subsurface carbon. Pre-existing norms in international climate agreements, such as the polluter-pays principle, provide avenues for establishing needed financial frameworks.

Even with well-designed policies and markets that incentivize such a reversal in business models, large-scale industries situated in storage-rich nations can develop financial flows in the billions to trillions of dollars per year, which could enhance inequality between and within nations54. Still, opportunities exist to enable growth in removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it today based on principles of fairness, responsibility and respective capabilities. For example, countries with large sovereign funds based on oil and gas revenues could set aside a small portion of their valuations to support the nascent CDR industry55.

Although we focus on carbon storage in sedimentary basins because of their desirable storage properties56 and long experience of their exploration by the oil and gas sector57, our estimates of a prudent planetary limit would expand beyond our explored sensitivities (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) if other carbon sequestration media become available. Perhaps most promising is the sequestration of carbon through mineralization in basalt formations, as is being piloted at the CarbFix injection site in Iceland58 and the USA59. The potential size of this storage media is highly uncertain with strong dependencies on site-specific characteristics60. At present, this technology is still in the development phase, having stored since its operations in 2014 a total of 10−4 GtCO2.

However, our assessment also does not consider the potentially large barriers to scaling up a carbon-storage industry to the gigaton scale as depicted by most future scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 13). For example, we do not take into account explicitly the substantial governance challenges that are faced by large-scale deployment of carbon storage, including incentive structures and trade-offs with other Sustainable Development Goals61 nor the distributive justice62 and equity implications of storage locations63. We also do not consider long timescales and high costs for subsoil characterization and seismic surveying required for identifying areas of highest potential injectivity rates16. Although we focus on volumetric limits, a large body of recent literature also highlights concerns regarding the technoeconomic feasibility of scaling up subsurface injection to the levels shown in future scenarios16,21,47, with most scenarios breaching assessed feasibility limits, although some argue that these levels are geophysically feasible64. More explicit consideration of injection feasibility would probably further reduce our estimate of usable storage potential.

Most critically, though, the scenarios we assess do not account for the substantial uncertainties in the climate system response to continued GHG emissions, which may require several hundred gigatons of additional carbon-storage capacity to meet expected temperature outcomes15. There is still uncertainty about whether removing one unit of net carbon reverses warming to the same extent that emitting one unit of net CO2 increases it53. This potential asymmetry is further compounded by the possibility of several tenths of a degree of additional warming occurring after global CO2 emissions reach net-zero levels6. Should this uncertainty in the climate response work to our disadvantage, substantially more carbon than currently estimated will need to be removed to reach desired climate outcomes15,65. Each of these considerations would further limit the amount of carbon storage that should be used by policymakers in planning their long-term climate strategies.

Our findings highlight the critical importance of transparency in carbon management planning and motivates treating geologic carbon storage as a scarce resource that needs to be deployed strategically to maximize climate benefits rather than treating geologic carbon storage as a limitless commodity. For example, understanding whether nations plan to maximize their use of storage resources for abating continued sources of emissions that could be avoided (for example, through the pursuit of blue, fossil-based hydrogen and fossil CCS) or strategically minimize the dependence of their climate strategies on carbon storage (for example, by deploying green, renewable-based hydrogen, other renewable-energy strategies and minimal CDR) will enhance understanding of the robustness of mitigation plans. Policymakers can make explicit their expectations for utilizing geologic carbon storage in their national energy transition plans, nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies, and communicate the degree to which these plans address environmental and societal risks when allocating what is a fundamentally finite resource.

Applying our prudent planetary limit framework demonstrates that following current climate policies will not only overshoot the 1.5-°C limit of the Paris Agreement by a wide margin but also may prohibit returning to it thereafter. Robust mitigation strategies are needed that weigh interregional, intersectoral and intergenerational consumption of this limited resource while staying within livable planetary boundaries for humans today and allowing high-quality livelihoods for generations to come.

In developing a map of potential sedimentary basins that would be acceptable for CO2 storage, we focus on broad exclusions based on the geohazards, basin quality and potential engineering challenges. Mature sedimentary basins are the best candidates for CO2 storage as they are the best understood and researched basins with the most available data. If they have been used for hydrocarbon exploration, some of the most crucial elements for CO2 storage are already proven and in place, such as reservoir and sealing units with favourable petrophysical characteristics. Primary targets are stable, cold and under pressured basins. These types of basin are located mid-continent behind mountain ranges formed by plate collisions or at the edge of stable continental plates. Good examples in the Americas are the basins located behind the Rocky Mountains, Andes or Appalachian Mountains. In Europe, basins north of the Alps or west of the Ural and in Asia south of the Himalaya and south of Zagros Mountain chains are suitable candidates20. Present-day targets for CO2 storage are depleted hydrocarbon fields or deep saline aquifers within geologically stable sedimentary basins, for example, the Sleipner Project on the Norwegian Continental Shelf67. However, one of the challenges in areas of extensive hydrocarbon exploration is the high number of abandoned wells. Although new drilled wells for the purpose of CO2 injection will follow standards designed for this process, abandoned wells from the past exploration might be subject to well integrity failure during CO2 injection and long-term storage. Possible risks are the appearance of fractures in the well cement matrix owing to chemical degradation under the influence of CO2 or mechanically owing to increased reservoir pressure, which might lead to the escape of the stored CO2 (ref. 68). A typical high-quality reservoir for CO2 storage would have redundancy in the seal (layers of impermeable cap rock), favourable petrophysical parameters for injectivity and storage, sufficient depth, and low risk for reactivation of existing faults.

We start our geospatial analysis by first collecting the geospatial spread of the sedimentary deposits69 and dividing them between onshore and offshore regions of interest at a global level using aggregated boundaries from the Global Administrative Area Project (GADM, v4.1, gadm.org). Several criteria must be considered when assessing the suitability of basins for CO2 storage28,29,70. Basin characteristics such as storage capacity based on pore volume, depth of target formation, seal integrity, tectonic hazards and basin type are the most fundamental and non-negotiable criteria. Equally important is the assessment of existing resources of the basin, such as hydrocarbon or geothermal exploration, and groundwater with which CO2 storage may compete. Finally, existing infrastructure, proximity to CO2 emitters, and other socioeconomic factors such as local community acceptance for CO2 storage may be critical. In our study, the selections for exclusion zones are made based on generalized global applicability of preventative boundaries for storage of underground CO2 attributed to sedimentary basins and are categorized into three main groupings, which we discuss in detail further in this section.

Application of surface-level exclusion zones provide us with the suitable sedimentary available area metric, disaggregated by offshore and onshore geospatial attribution. To convert the suitable area into storage potential for CO2, we utilized a modified volumetric storage calculation methodology, which assumes a lower level of storage potential per volume of sedimentary basin owing to limitation attributed to pressure increase and its effects on reduced injection rate within a closed system71. Here a closed system is defined by limitations on lateral flow owing to low permeability of basins and seals owing to faults. For this, we first converted the assessed suitable sedimentary deposit available area to volume using sedimentary depth mapping at 1° resolution72. Additional exclusion limits were then applied to the sedimentary depths to realize the effective assessed volume metric, which incorporated both areal exclusions and sedimentary depth exclusions. Conversion of assessed volumetric metric into storage potential was done with an assumption of 0.037 GtCO2 storage potential per 1,000 km3 of assessed sedimentary basin volume for a 50-year injectivity period including pressure-related injectivity considerations based on lower estimates in the available literature aligned with our precautionary assumptions3,73.

Next, we briefly describe the type and reasoning for applying each exclusion layer. A summary of each layer's global impact on our estimation of a planetary limit is described in Supplementary Table 1, including a central, lower and upper sensitivity estimate (‘Consistent storage assumptions across spatial scales and sensitivities'). Because each operation is computationally expensive, we apply exclusion layers sequentially. Thus, each estimate of volume removal is dependent on the previous layer applied. If each layer was applied only to the global technical potential, it would by definition exclude a larger volume than we estimated in our sequential application.

The first exclusion layer we apply is the policy based protected areas74. In this exclusion layer, we included areas that have the designation of protected areas as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Convention on Biological Diversity. A comprehensive open-source dataset cataloguing the geospatial spread of the protected sites is developed under a joint project between International Union for Conservation of Nature and the United Nations Environmental Program. The database is entitled ‘World Database on Protected Areas', which comprised 293,692 protected sites in May 2024 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We overlayed this exclusion mask on our global dataset comprising onshore and offshore sedimentary deposit boundaries to demarcate sedimentary deposit areas outside of the protected zones.

The second layer we apply is the global EEZs. The offshore territorial claim of a country is governed by the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea. The conventions allow for 3 boundaries on the territorial claims of a country: (1) territorial sea, up to 12 nautical miles from the coastline; (2) contiguous zone, up to 24 nautical miles from the coastline; and (3) EEZ, up to 200 nautical miles from the coastline. Within the EEZ, the coastal state has sovereign rights of exploration, exploitation and management of natural resources in both the waters themselves and the seabed below.

States have rights regarding the protection and preservation of the marine environment in their EEZ, as well as the construction, operation and use of installations and structures at sea. In this study, we assumed that the maximum country-specific area attributable towards offshore sedimentary deposit will be within the boundaries of country's EEZ. Any offshore sedimentary deposit area outside of the EEZ will be considered international waters, hence unavailable for exploration and construction of deep-sea carbon injection infrastructure (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To mitigate the issues arising from overlapping claims over EEZ of a neighbouring coastal state, we have removed the EEZ area75 where overlapping claims or a joint regime is present (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d).

The third layer we apply is the area within polar circles. Polar circles, namely, the Arctic and Antarctic circles demarcate the global circles of latitude at 66.5° N and 66.5° S, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1e). In our study, we assume that the sedimentary basins north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle do not contribute to the CO2 storage potentials. This assumption is partly derived from the point of view of preserving polar ecosystems that are already sequestering large amount of CO2 and partly owing to the intra-annual climatic and land-cover inaccessibility and associated increased costs of CO2 storage.

We next apply exclusions based on seismic-hazard zones. Basins in the proximity of active seismic zones, for example, close to plate subduction areas, are less suitable for CO2 storage owing to compromise of sealing units or the reactivation of existing faults during CO2 injection31. The reactivation of existing fault structures in areas under far field stress poses a risk for leakage and for failure of these fault structures, potentially leading to low-intensity earthquakes. While in the hydrocarbon sector these geohazards are well understood, there remains uncertainty for the stability of geologic structures for the injections of reactive CO2-rich water (for example, ref. 76). Future use of saline aquifers will therefore force future compromise between the risk of failure of seals that could cause leakage of CO2. To approximate future choices to mitigate the risk of leakage, we assume that areas of moderate seismic hazard would be avoided. To incorporate such an exclusion zone, we use the global map of seismic hazard77 to exclude areas that have a more than 10% of chance of peak ground acceleration breaching 0.115 g and 0.401 g (moderate in the US Geological Survey Instrumental Intensity scale78) in the next 50 years (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Population centres have a crucial role in site suitability of carbon capture and storage facilities and form the basis of our next exclusion layer. Owing to the potential for toxicity mobilization, underground utility services provision, supply of fresh water, extensive human-made modifications to the topsoil and densely developed neighbourhoods preclude the global site suitability of carbon capture and storage facilities79. We utilize high-resolution datasets of built-up urban areas under different future population and urbanization scenarios80 and choose our exclusion layer based on the urban area boundaries in 2100 based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways narrative 5 (SSP5) entitled ‘fossil-fuelled development' that incorporates high reliance on fossil fuels and CCS for future global growth81. In our central case, we assume a 25-km distance buffer around the urban boundary to account for a safety margin around the urban conglomerations. A sensitivity for this layer is also conducted by assuming a 5-km buffer zone to account for a less restrictive policy regime. Global maps of both the central case and sensitivity case, as well as a zoom-in to the Cairo metropolitan region is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Here we assess exclusions related to the ocean-depth or water-depth boundary above the offshore basins. The offshore storage of CO2 is advantageous as there is a very low risk of damage to infrastructure owing to induced earthquakes generated from the overpressure within the reservoir. Pumping in shallow seas will be relatively feasible, whereas in deep water the costs will increase. In the pre-salt basins offshore Brazil, drilling for hydrocarbons has been achieved down to water depths of 2,000 m (ref. 82). At the same time, some of the most environmentally damaging events in the history of oil and gas extraction have occurred due to extraction at depth, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred at 1,500 m ocean depth in the Gulf of Mexico and was exacerbated owing to issues of reaching the well head83. In general, to achieve CO2 storage within such deep-water reservoirs will, however, require a substantial shift in economic incentives, as the costs might be restrictively high.

To develop a prudent limit for offshore storage depth, we assessed >121,000 geospatial data points of discovered, abandoned, depleted and under-exploration offshore oil and gas wells84,85,86 (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). We then generated a histogram of water depth versus count of total offshore installations to derive cut-off for water-depth exclusion zones (Supplementary Fig. 4d). We find that about 70% of the installations globally are situated at a water depth of 100 m or less and about 95% are located in water of a depth of 500 m or less. The vast majority of oil and gas installations (>90%) are situated at water depths up to 300 m. Given these considerations, we use a central estimate for water-depth exclusion of 300 m with sensitivities of 100–500 m87,88 (Supplementary Fig. 4d).

Here we investigate the upper and lower cut-off for storage depth within the sedimentary deposit basins. Storage of CO2 is ideally suited in aquifers below 800 m depth, beyond which the overpressure compresses the gas, its density decreases rapidly and CO2 reaches a supercritical state, maximizing the storage volumes. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 25 °C km−1 and 15 °C surface temperature, the CO2 takes about 30-times less volume compared with surface conditions. Starting at 1.5 km depth, the density and occupied volume stay constant at about 36-times less volume compared with surface conditions89. On the basis of the sedimentary depth map for both onshore and offshore sedimentary basins, we estimate a mean depth of 1.9 km for onshore and 2.5 km for offshore basins for a 1 decimal degree global spatial areal grid (Supplementary Fig. 5a). A relatively small number of areal grid cells are present beyond 5 km sedimentary depth. Current literature (Supplementary Table 3) bound minimum and maximum estimates at 800 m and 4 km, respectively. We therefore apply a conservative depth requirement (minimum) of 1,000 m as a global mask to the database of sedimentary basins for our central case. For our central estimate, we apply absolute depth limit (maximum) to which CO2 can be injected of 2.5 km to avoid bedrock and limit potential seismic activation of deep-rooted faults30 based on the reviewed literature and following similar precautionary principles as for other exclusions. Additional sensitivity analysis is conducted for a range of minimum and maximum injection depths bounding our central estimate (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c).

The territorial integrity of an important but relatively small number of maritime areas are at present in dispute, for example, in the South China Sea90 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Owing to the extreme uncertainty of potential carbon storage in these areas as well as those under war-like conditions, we exclude them from our analysis.

It remains largely unclear how international treaties would perform in the future with multiple state actors injecting carbon into a common basin, either connected on land and especially at sea. The London Convention and the London Protocol has, so far, been the most proactive international body addressing carbon storage in subsea geologic formations. In 2006, the London Protocol parties adopted amendments to regulate subsea carbon storage, including introducing a risk assessment and management framework. In 2009, the parties amended London Protocol Article 6 on the export of wastes for dumping purposes, to enable parties to share transboundary subseabed geologic formations for CO2 storage (LP.3(4)). However, this amendment has not entered into force, as the prerequisite two-thirds of the contracting parties have yet to ratify it. In 2019, parties to the London Protocol therefore adopted another resolution (LP.5(14)), which permits the provisional application of the amendment to Article 6, stipulating that two countries can now bilaterally agree to export and import CO2 for subseabed geologic storage. To do so, they must deposit a formal declaration of provisional application with the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization and demonstrate they follow the guidance outlined in the London Protocol carbon storage risk assessment and management framework. However, as of January 2024, only 8 parties have done so39. We assume that parties would follow maritime law to allow transboundary usage based on common EEZs.

Common territorial boundaries on land require agreements between all parties sharing respective borders, and thus are not supported under a common international policy regime. Considering the uncertainties associated with the transboundary use of common sedimentary deposit basins and the country-level public perception towards CCS projects, we have assumed an exclusion buffer of 6 nautical miles along the terrestrial international boundaries in our central case to evaluate the scenario where international cooperation for shared storage resource is not achieved in an effective manner. The choice for 6 nautical miles is derived from the definition of territorial waters boundary description within the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, which sets the territorial waters to be within 12 nautical miles. This assumption would effectively mean that sedimentary basin resources along the international boundary up to 11.1 km on both sides will not be used for injection and storage of CO2, irrespective of the depth of storage and angle of approach to the storage site. We recognize that the pressure plume associated with CO2 storage would reach farther than our assumed limit of 6 nautical miles, which is a limitation to our analysis should this consideration be built into future transboundary storage agreements. In addition to the central case, we include sensitivities of this exclusion layer to cover full 22.2 km (12 nautical miles) and no buffer considerations on both sides of the national boundaries (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We compile global carbon-storage limits for a central estimate and sensitivity cases in Supplementary Table 1. We apply sensitivities using both numerical thresholds below or above a given central estimate and binary (included or excluded) thresholds (Supplementary Table 2), depending on the risk consideration. We begin Supplementary Table 1 with the total estimate of technical potential for carbon storage (see above). Each subsequent row presents the remaining storage available after excluding storage area based on the relevant risk consideration geospatial layer. Each exclusion layer is applied sequentially; thus the volumes reported depend on the order in which the layers are applied. When presenting the sensitivity performed for each risk consideration layer, we report the total storage considering only the sensitivity layer in question applied to the previous layer from the main calculation. We thus isolate the difference in storage volume owing to only the different calculation method for the layer in question.

Because our analysis framework is global and spatially explicit, we can summarize storage estimates at a country level. We combine all available storage per country administrative boundary for onshore storage and per country EEZ for offshore storage. We then perform the same calculation based on our final exclusion layer representing our assessment of the global planetary limit. We further identify existing sedimentary basins with current oil and gas infrastructure84,87, which are prime candidates for initial exploration of CO2 storage, and present their prudent storage potential. All values are summarized in Supplementary Table 5.

We analyse scenarios assessed by the IPCC Working Group III, provided in its assessment database91. Scenarios are categorized by their global mean surface temperature characteristics by the IPCC, and we use the same categories with slightly clarified names in this paper as shown in Supplementary Table 6. We assess CO2 emission in scenarios based on the variable ‘Emissions|CO2' and annual geologic carbon storage based on the variable ‘Carbon Sequestration|CCS'. For all analyses, we take variable trajectories (based either on the IPCC R5 region classifications or global values) and interpolate any missing years using the ‘interpolate' function Python library, pyam92. We calculate cumulative estimates of carbon sequestration from cumulative summing all yearly values until the year 2100, which corresponds to our estimate of total carbon storage in each scenario. We estimate the value of any given variable at the time of net-zero CO2 emissions based on the first interpolated year at which CO2 emissions cross from a positive value to a negative value for each scenario.

To estimate carbon-storage exceedance at net-zero levels, we calculate the remaining carbon-storage volume at the time of net-zero CO2 emissions in each scenario and divide by the level of yearly geologic CO2 injection at that point, resulting in the number of years of storage remaining if injection levels were held constant at these levels. We estimate carbon-storage needs in a given scenario after its time horizon by using a first-order spline interpolation extrapolating beyond the model horizon until 2300 (so-called slinear interpolation in the Python library scipy). We then estimate the resulting cumulative carbon-storage trajectories from these trajectories and identify at which point they cross specified thresholds.

IPCC scenarios provided data beyond global levels at the scale of five macroregions. Countries are allocated to each macroregion as described in Supplementary Table 7. We analysed the global carbon-storage thresholds as shown in Fig. 3 also for every IPCC macroregion in Supplementary Figs. 8–12. In particular, the R5ASIA region sees levels of carbon storage beyond the regional boundary consistent with our assessed global planetary limit even in the modelled time horizon up to 2100.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems1,2,3,4,5,6,7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.

Computing today is digital, but analog has a future. Exponential advances in digital hardware have both driven and benefited from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), but its escalating energy and latency demands push digital specialization to its limits8. Analog approaches—leveraging optics1,2,3,4,9, analog electronic crossbars5,6 and quantum annealers7—promise orders-of-magnitude gains in efficiency and speed. Existing hardware demonstrations focus either on AI inference1,2,3,10,11,12,13, which accounts for 90% of energy in commercial deployments14, or combinatorial optimization7,15, but none efficiently accelerate both on the same analog hardware.

Here we introduce the analog optical computer (AOC), a non-traditional computing platform designed for both AI inference and combinatorial optimization. By combining optical and analog electronic components within a feedback loop, the AOC rapidly performs a fixed-point search without digital conversions. In each loop iteration of approximately 20 ns, optics handle matrix–vector multiplications, whereas analog electronics perform nonlinear operations, subtraction and annealing (Fig. 1a–c). Over multiple iterations, the fixed-point nature of the AOC enhances noise robustness, which is essential for analog hardware.

The microLED array (1) is the light source and represents neural network activations or optimization variables. The spatial light modulator (2) stores neural network weights or optimization problem coefficients, and multiplies them with the incoming light. The photodetector array (3) adds and transfers optical signals into the analog electronic domain. The nonlinearity, subtraction, annealing and other computations are applied in analog electronics (4). d, ML inference as a fixed-point search. The AOC hardware is used to accelerate ML inference, using an ML equilibrium model that entails finding their fixed points. e, Quadratic optimization as a fixed-point search. A schematic of the convergence to minima over time for an optimization problem with continuous (horizontal bars) and binary (vertical arrows) variables, experiencing gradients (red) from other variables until convergence to the fixed point (green). f, Applications realized on the AOC hardware. The AOC hardware performs inference for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST classification tasks and nonlinear regression, and also solves industrial optimization problems, including medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement between financial institutions.

The AOC's fully analog architecture and fixed-point abstraction address two key challenges in unconventional computing. First, hybrid architectures typically accelerate linear operations but rely on digital nonlinearities, resulting in energy-intensive conversions2,13, which are eliminated in the AOC. Second, they often face an application-hardware gap: memory-bound AI models are hard to accelerate14, and prevalent binary optimization formulations limit practical applicability16. With its unifying fixed-point abstraction, the AOC closes this gap (Fig. 1d,e).

For inference, the AOC accelerates emerging iterative models, including fixed-point models such as deep-equilibrium networks17, which are compute-bound and costly on digital chips but naturally suited for the AOC. These models enable iterative reasoning with dynamic inference time computation18,19. For optimization, the AOC supports quadratic unconstrained mixed optimization (QUMO), a flexible formulation with binary and continuous variables that captures real-world problems20.

The current small-scale AOC accelerates equilibrium models with up to 4,096 weights at 9-bit precision, performing image classification and nonlinear regression tasks (Fig. 1f). To enable these inference tasks, we design a differentiable digital twin (AOC-DT) that achieves over 99% correspondence with the physical hardware. For optimization, the AOC solves QUMO problems with up to 64 variables, tackling real-world applications such as medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. The AOC-DT is used to demonstrate scalable solutions for industrial problems, such as reconstruction of a brain scan with over 200,000 problem variables. Compared with well-known heuristics21 and commercial solvers22, we set state-of-the-art results on several instances from a standard quadratic optimization benchmark23.

Designed with consumer-grade optical and electronic components, the AOC leverages mature manufacturing processes, with future scalability relying on tighter coupling of integrated analog electronics with integrated three-dimensional (3D) optics. By eliminating digital–analog conversions and merging compute and memory to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck, the AOC can achieve substantial efficiency gains albeit specialized. With projected performance around 500 tera-operations per second (TOPS) per watt at 8-bit precision—over 100-times more efficient than leading graphics processing units (GPUs)24—the AOC represents a promising step towards sustainable computing.

The AOC hardware unifies machine learning (ML) inference and optimization paradigms through an iterative fixed-point search. In ML, the inference of equilibrium17 and energy-based25 models entails finding their fixed points, whereas in optimization, objective minima represent fixed points of gradient-descent-based methods. The core AOC abstraction realizes the following iterative update rule:

At each iteration t, the continuous real-valued state vector \({{\bf{s}}}_{t}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) is updated to st+1, with each iteration corresponding to a signal round-trip time in hardware. Although equation (1) is discrete, the AOC operates in a continuous clock-free manner. The annealing schedule \(\alpha (t):[0,T]\to {\mathbb{R}}\) controls the state magnitude reduction per iteration, similar to residual connections in neural networks26, where T is the number of timesteps in the annealing schedule. The factor β determines the matrix–vector product scale, where the matrix W encodes neural network weights or an optimization problem, and \(f:{{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\to {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) is an element-wise nonlinear function. The coefficient γ ∈ (0, 1) introduces momentum which, in continuous time, corresponds to the second-order differential equation dynamics (Supplementary Information section G.10), generalizing the AOC abstraction beyond first-order models such as Hopfield networks. The bias vector \({\bf{b}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) represents additional problem-specific information.

The introduced fixed-point abstraction is ideally suited for analog feedback devices, such as the AOC, as it is compute-bound, requires no intermediate memory and is noise-tolerant: the attracting fixed point pulls the trajectory closer at every iteration, counteracting analog noise.

The AOC hardware combines 3D optical and analog electronic technologies to accelerate all the compute operations in the fixed-point abstraction described by equation (1): matrix–vector multiplication, nonlinearity, annealing, addition and subtraction. In each fixed-point iteration, the analog signal alternates between optical and electrical domains, giving the system state st a dual opto-electronic nature.

Matrix–vector multiplication occurs in the optical domain, where the state vector st is encoded in the light intensity of arrays of micro light-emitting diodes (microLEDs), whereas the weight matrix W is represented by spatial light modulator (SLM) pixels (Fig. 1a). Light from each microLED fans out across an SLM row for element-wise multiplication, and the resulting light signals are summed column-wise by a photodetector array27. In contrast to planar optical architectures, the AOC leverages 3D optics with its efficient fan-in and fan-out of light in the third dimension through the use of spherical and cylindrical optics, thus enabling inherently parallel and scalable multiplication operations of larger matrices28.

The result of the optical matrix–vector multiplication is measured in the electrical domain using a photodetector array, where the state vector st is represented as a voltage per detector. The remaining operations in equation (1) are implemented via analog electronics: a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function for the element-wise nonlinearity, summing and difference amplifiers for addition and subtraction of analog signals, and variable gain amplifiers for the annealing schedule α(t) and the β factor. The circuit layout, with highlighted voltage readout position, is detailed in Extended Data Fig. 3.

The AOC hardware executes the iterative update rule from several to thousands of iterations until convergence to a fixed point, when the signal amplitudes are read out digitally. This all-analog operation minimizes the overhead of analog-to-digital conversions. The current hardware includes 16 microLEDs and 16 photodetectors, supporting a 16-variable state vector st, along with two SLMs to handle positive and negative entries of the matrix W (Fig. 1b,c). This configuration is sufficient to support inference for ML models and optimization tasks with up to 256 weights and can extend to 4,096 weights via problem decomposition, maintaining fully analog fixed-point iterations.

The AOC fixed-point abstraction targets a balance between generality and efficient hardware implementation. To illustrate its versatility, the remainder of the paper presents four case studies highlighting how equilibrium ML models can be applied to classification and regression tasks, and how the QUMO paradigm can represent real-world applications in finance and healthcare, while utilizing the same AOC hardware.

The AOC supports neural equilibrium models, which have been widely applied across various domains from language17 to vision29. Equilibrium models typically follow a fixed-point iterative update rule, st+1 = Network(st), with examples including classic Hopfield networks30 and their modern variants31, as well as deep-equilibrium models17. These models operate as self-recurrent neural networks with constant input, driving the hidden state to a fixed point that represents the network output (Fig. 1d). Their dynamic depth enables recursive reasoning, leads to improved scaling laws32 and enhances out-of-distribution generalization compared with feedforward models18,33. Recent self-recurrent language models with billions of parameters show impressive reasoning capabilities, surpassing fixed-depth models in representation power34,35. We demonstrate that the AOC supports models with such recurrent nature and achieves greater out-of-distribution generalization (Extended Data Fig. 6).

As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the complete neural network architecture includes an input projection (IP) layer, the equilibrium model and an output projection (OP) layer. The network training is performed digitally using the AOC-DT, whereas the equilibrium model is deployed on the AOC hardware for inference.

a, Top: the neural network architecture used for training and inference. During training, input data are projected into the latent space via an IP layer, processed by the AOC hardware's digital twin (AOC-DT) and passed through the OP layer. Bottom: the inference process on the AOC hardware: the IP and OP layers interface with the hardware, which updates its initial state s0 until reaching the fixed-point state s*. b, During inference, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images are passed through the IP layer and are fed into the AOC hardware. Intermediate states may be projected out to monitor progress, schematically showing evolution from a higher to a lower entropy distribution. Once converged, a softmax nonlinearity in the OP layer selects the highest-probability class, whereas in regression, the OP layer outputs a continuous value y, with the MSE evaluated against ground truth (GNDTH) to assess performance. GNDTH is the true curve we want to regress against. c, The nonlinear regression results are demonstrated for the AOC hardware over a Gaussian curve (left) and sinusoidal curve (right) with MSE losses of 3.75 × 10−3 and 1.21 × 10−2, respectively. The shaded area around the AOC predictions represents the observed variability, that is, the standard deviation across the sampling window and repeated AOC runs with the same input (Methods). d, For the full test datasets of MNIST (left) and Fashion-MNIST (right), the AOC classification accuracy is compared with the performance of the AOC-DT and the feedforward model (FFM). Higher accuracies are achieved for larger models (4,096 weights), which are realized with a time-multiplexing technique. Hardware results align with AOC-DT simulations; the 4,096-weight hardware result slightly exceeds the AOC-DT, as it reflects the best of 2 seeds, whereas the AOC-DT accuracy is averaged. The dashed lines show the linear classifier performance; the error bars reflect the random-seed variability for the AOC-DT and experimental repeats for hardware (Methods).

Source Data

For equilibrium models, the fixed-point iterative update follows from equation (1) by setting α(t) → α, γ(t) → 0, b → b + xproj, and using the element-wise tanh nonlinearity:

Here b is the trained bias and xproj encodes the equilibrium model input. The trained weight matrix W is quantized to 9-bit integers (Methods), separated into positive and negative components, and loaded into the corresponding SLMs. The initial state is set to s0 = b + xproj.

During inference, the original data x go through the IP layer as xproj = WIPx + bIP, where WIP and bIP are the trained IP weights and biases. For the given xproj, the equilibrium model iterates on the AOC hardware until convergence, with the fixed-point state s* read out as voltages (Extended Data Fig. 5). Finally, the inference result is obtained by applying the OP layer to the AOC solution as y = WOPs*  + bOP, where WOP and bOP are the trained OP weights and bias.

In the current hardware, the equilibrium model is implemented for a single-layer network with a 256-weight matrix, without symmetry constraints. A recurrent multilayer neural network can be constructed using a lower subdiagonal block-wise matrix (Fig. 3), whereas a continuous-valued Hopfield network arises for a symmetric matrix. We note that neural networks conventionally apply the activation function and weight matrix in a different order than in equation (2). However, this leads to only a minor difference in practice owing to the self-recursive process36.

The left panel shows a multilayer deep neural network (DNN) with recurrence, where orange, green and blue denote different layers. Here, s0 is the initial network state, x is the network input and s* represents the fixed point to which the network converges. This network structure can be realized on the AOC hardware by arranging the layers along the lower subdiagonal of a larger matrix W, placing the final layer as a recurrent block in the top-right corner, with its time evolution shown in the middle panel. The right panel further represents this architecture through a single block iterated over time, capturing the recurrent multilayered model structure. All three panels depict equivalent representations of the recurrent multilayer network.

The hardware realizes the equilibrium model as in equation (2) for two ML inference tasks: image classification and nonlinear regression (Fig. 2b). In both cases, models are trained digitally through the AOC-DT and are deployed on the hardware without further calibration, which requires high hardware precision and high fidelity of the AOC-DT (Methods).

We show that the AOC hardware can run nonlinear regression models. Regression tasks require continuous-valued outputs, which are challenging owing to the inherently noisy nature of analog computations. This is in contrast to classification tasks discussed below where the output labels are discrete and only the class of the largest probability is selected. From a model perspective, nonlinear regression tasks are well suited to the 256-weight AOC as they require small input (\({W}_{{\rm{IP}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{16\times 1}\)) and output (\({W}_{{\rm{OP}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{1\times 16}\)) projection matrices.

We select two nonlinear functions for regression: Gaussian and sinusoidal curves. In agreement with the AOC-DT results (see Supplementary Table 2), the hardware reproduces accurately both functions, as shown in Fig. 2c. The sinusoidal curve presents a greater challenge for accurate fitting than the Gaussian curve owing to its multiple minima and maxima, requiring higher AOC-DT fidelity. This may explain why the AOC hardware struggles to accurately fit the region near the right minimum of the sinusoidal curve. However, at no point does the AOC-DT curve fall outside the AOC standard deviation. We note the digital IP and OP layers alone would only be able to fit linear functions, highlighting the contribution of the equilibrium model running on the AOC hardware.

For the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST datasets, the inputs \({\bf{x}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{28\times 28}\) are rescaled to [−1, 1] range and flattened into vectors. Hence, the IP and OP layers have dimensions 16 × 784 and 10 × 16, respectively. The test dataset results on the 256-weight AOC hardware are shown in Fig. 2d (see also Supplementary Table 4). The AOC-predicted labels match the AOC-DT results for 99.8% of the inputs.

The AOC results demonstrate the viability of digital training with subsequent weight transfer for opto-electronic analog inference. The contribution of the equilibrium model running on the AOC further becomes apparent when comparing the AOC results with a linear classifier, which consists of digitally trained IP layer, a middle layer and an OP layer. We also train a simple feedforward model comprising an IP layer, a middle layer with tanh nonlinearity and an OP layer. Both linear classifier and feedforward models have the same number of parameters as the AOC hardware. Although the AOC achieves slightly higher accuracy (Fig. 2d), the simple nature of the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets is unlikely to demonstrate the full potential of self-recurrent models. Looking ahead, this potential may materialize in a form of test-time compute in sequence modelling tasks34,35 or inference of generative diffusion models.

In practice, model sizes tend to exceed what a given hardware can support, including traditional GPUs. To address this, we demonstrate time-multiplexing on the AOC by training a 4,096-weight ensemble equilibrium model, composed of 16 independent 256-weight equilibrium models. The overall architecture mirrors the previous 256-weight model, but the middle layer now consists of 16 independent equilibrium models, executed sequentially on the AOC for each slice of the input \({{\bf{x}}}_{\mathrm{proj}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{4096}\). Classification accuracies for these time-multiplexed models are shown in Fig. 2d. The time-to-solution increases linearly with the number of independent blocks in the ensemble. Across all architectures considered for classification tasks, the IP layer accounts for the majority of parameters, whereas nonlinearities within the AOC primarily drive performance differences compared with a linear classifier. Additional classification results, including ablation studies of the optical and electronic contributions with untrained IP layers, are provided in Supplementary Information section C.1.

Across all classification and regression tasks, the AOC-DT requires around nine iterations per input to reach convergence. On the AOC hardware, these fixed points can be achieved in 180 ns and, ideally, their sampling would occur immediately afterwards. In practice, to ensure the state stability and mitigate noise, we sample over a fixed 6.4-μs window at 6.25-MHz frequency (Extended Data Fig. 5). As the sampling rate is about eight-times slower than the hardware round-trip time, individual iterations cannot be resolved on the AOC. Compared with classification tasks, the regression tasks show greater sensitivity to noise, requiring up to 11 repeated runs for averaging to obtain smooth curves (Supplementary Fig. 6). We note that owing to the iterative process, the training and inference times of the AOC-DT running in silico are approximately nine-times slower than an equivalent feedforward model.

Equilibrium models, beyond being compute heavy, are also suitable for analog acceleration owing to the attractor nature of their iterative inference process. This provides enhanced robustness to analog noise compared with deep feedforward networks, which is a critical property for the AOC performance at scale (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

The QUMO formulation represents a wide class of combinatorial optimization problems aimed at minimizing the objective function \(F({\bf{x}})=-\frac{1}{2}{{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{T}}}W{\bf{x}}-{{\bf{b}}}^{{\rm{T}}}{\bf{x}}\), where the vector x includes binary and continuous variables, and the information about the optimization problem is encoded in the weight matrix W and the constant vector b. Without loss of generality, one may consider the values {0, 1} for binary and the interval [0, 1] for continuous variables. These variables are represented through the element-wise nonlinearity over the system state vector st in equation (1). The solution to the QUMO problem is the assignment of the variables x that minimizes the objective F(x). If the components of x are all binary variables, the problem reduces to the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. We note that the QUBO problem is equivalent to the well-known problems of minimizing the Hamiltonian of the Ising model37 and finding the maximum cut of a weighted graph38.

Besides being nonlinear, most optimization problems are constrained. A problem with linear inequality constraints highlights the greater expressiveness of the QUMO over the standard QUBO formulation, commonly used across many non-traditional platforms. For example, only one additional continuous variable, typically referred to as slack variable, is required for mapping one inequality constraint to the QUMO problem with a penalty method. In contrast, the QUBO formulation suffers from a large mapping overhead: 10 to 100 binary variables are needed to represent a single constraint with either binary or unary encoding (Supplementary Information section G.8). We next demonstrate solving QUMO problems on the AOC hardware for two applications: medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement.

We implement compressed sensing on the AOC hardware, a technique enabling accurate signal reconstruction from fewer measurements than traditionally required39,40. Compressed sensing accelerates image acquisition, reducing scan times and enhancing patient comfort. For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a sparse image representation is typically achieved using techniques such as wavelet regularization that penalize ‘unnatural' reconstructions. The standard regularization choice is the ℓ1-norm, which promotes sparsity and enables optimization via convex solvers. However, the original compressed-sensing method employs the ‘ℓ0-norm', which counts the number of non-zero elements in a vector. Minimizing the ℓ0-norm may yield better reconstruction in theory41,42, although the optimization problem is deemed impractical in this case and, hence, remains largely unexplored in applied image reconstruction tasks. With the AOC hardware, we can address this original hard problem by formulating the compressed-sensing approach as the QUMO optimization problem:

Here the first term ensures data fidelity between measurements \({\bf{y}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{M}\) and the image \({\bf{x}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) in the wavelet domain, and the matrix \({\bf{A}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{M\times N}\) represents the MRI acquisition process consisting of Fourier and inverse wavelet transforms with an undersampling mask (Methods). To reduce the MRI scan time, the number of measurements M needs to be smaller than the number of pixels N; hence this data-fidelity term has infinitely many solutions on its own. The image pixels are normalized to x ∈ [0, 1]N in the wavelet domain and σ ∈ {0, 1}N is a binary vector that controls the sparsity of x. When σi = 0, the λ1 penalty disappears and the corresponding non-zero pixel value xi penalizes the objective owing to the λ2 penalty. For σi = 1, the λ2 penalty disappears and the pixel xi can take any value to match the measurements, albeit at λ1 penalty cost to the objective. Lastly, 1 and (⋅)T denote the vector of ones and the transpose operation in equation (3), respectively. The generalization of this reconstruction problem to the complex-valued variables is presented in Supplementary Information section G.3.

We realize the compressed-sensing approach on the AOC hardware for a line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image of 32 × 32 pixels (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 10), formulated as a 64-variable 9-bit QUMO problem with equal split between binary and continuous variables. As an example of a realistic MRI process, we omit 37.5% of the measurements. By minimizing the data-fidelity term only, we obtain a poor reconstruction (Fig. 4a), highlighting the importance of the interactions between continuous and binary variables in the QUMO formulation.

a, Medical image reconstruction. Top: the AOC hardware realizes a compressed-sensing algorithm with the ‘ℓ0-norm' to reconstruct a line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image. The reconstruction process is formulated as optimization of the 64-variable QUMO instance and compared with the minimization of the data-fidelity term only in equation (3), achieving an MSE of 0.008 in the former and 0.079 in the latter cases. The greyscale bar denotes brightness values in the image, with 0 corresponding to black and 1 to white. Bottom: reconstructions by the AOC-DT for a real brain image from the FastMRI dataset at typical acceleration rates. b, Transaction settlement. Top: a schematic of the transaction-settlement process among multiple financial parties, with settled (green) and unsettled (red) transactions. Bottom: the number of settled transactions achieved by the AOC hardware for a 41-variable QUMO instance as a function of block coordinate descent steps. c, The AOC hardware solves synthetic 3-bit to 8-bit precision QUMO and QUBO instances with 16 variables, requiring fewer than 1,000 samples to reach at least ≥95% and 100% objective proximities for the QUMO and QUBO instances, respectively. The shaded regions indicate the 50% confidence interval. d, The time trace of 16 variables during the optimization process on the AOC hardware for a QUMO instance. The system converges to the fixed point within 30 μs, with the sampling window occurring over the last 6 μs. e, The relative speed-up of the AOC-DT compared with the Gurobi solver is shown for a QUMO-reformulated subset of QPLIB benchmark instances (QBL). The state-of-the-art solutions are found for instances 3,860 and 3,584. f, The hardest QBL instances require more than 60 s for the Gurobi solver to find the best-known solutions of 10 QBL instances in their original formulation.

Source Data

For the non-zero λ1 and λ2 penalties, we split the 64-variable QUMO problem into smaller subproblems and solve them all in the AOC hardware using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method43. Solutions to each subproblem, corresponding to one step of BCD, are used to create the subsequent ones, all of which are solved using the fixed-point abstraction realized on the AOC hardware. The convergence to the optimal solution takes around 30 –40 BCD steps with 1,000–1,500 AOC iterations per BCD step. The final image reconstruction closely matches the original line, as shown in Fig. 4a. We note that all QUMO instances are solved in an entirely analog manner without any digital post-processing.

To validate the QUMO formulation for compressed sensing at scale, we use the AOC-DT to reconstruct a brain scan image of 320 × 320 pixels from the FastMRI dataset44, which results in the QUMO problem with more than 200,000 variables. For the typical undersampling rates of 4 and 8, we achieve reconstructions with mean squared error (MSE) below 0.07 (Fig. 4a).

For optimization in the financial domain, we use the AOC hardware to solve a transaction-settlement problem. Each securities transaction is an exchange of securities for a payment, known as a delivery-versus-payment transaction. Clearing houses process batches of such transactions; for example, the subsidiaries of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) processed securities transactions valued at US$3 quadrillion in 202345. Within each batch, the transaction-settlement objective is to maximize the total number or total value of settled transactions, which is NP-hard46. This is a difficult optimization problem given the volume of transactions, legal constraints and additional requirements (for example, collateral and credit facilities).

A prevalent approach for solving the transaction-settlement problem is to formulate it as a linear optimization problem with binary variables and linear inequality constraints46. This formulation can be mapped to a QUMO problem, where the inequality constraints are efficiently incorporated into the objective function by introducing continuous slack variables (Supplementary Information section G.8).

We design a transaction-settlement instance generator that produces industrially relevant transaction-settlement scenarios for the given numbers of transactions, financial parties and assets. We also implement a pre-processing technique to eliminate trivial constraints. As an example, we generate a scenario with 46 transactions between 37 parties (Fig. 4b), resulting in 30 constraints, which is reduced to an effective 41-variable QUMO instance. As shown in Fig. 4b, the AOC hardware finds the globally optimal solution in seven BCD steps for this transaction-settlement scenario. Similar to reconstruction of the Shepp–Logan image, the QUMO instances across all transaction-settlement scenarios are solved in an entirely analog manner.

In addition, we evaluate several smaller-size scenarios derived from real settlement data47. After pre-processing, these reduce to QUMO instances of 8 variables, on which the AOC hardware achieves a 100% success rate (see Supplementary Table 8). In contrast, quantum hardware performance on the same problems yields success rates of 40–60% (ref. 47).

For the AOC hardware, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted on a diverse set of challenging synthetic QUMO and QUBO problems. The optimization problems include instances with 16 binary and continuous variables, with dense and sparse weight matrices up to 8-bit precision. For 100 instances, the AOC hardware achieves over 95% and 100% proximity to the optimal objectives of QUMO and QUBO instances, respectively, under 1,000 samples (Fig. 4c). The typical time trace of 16 variables during the optimization process on the AOC hardware is shown in Fig. 4d.

Using the AOC-DT, algorithmic performance is validated on the hardest quadratic binary problems with linear inequality constraints from the quadratic programming library (QPLIB) benchmark23, formulated as QUMO instances. The AOC approach is compared with the commercial Gurobi solver22, which requires over a minute to reach the best-known solutions for these problems. Figure 4e,f shows that the AOC-DT is up to three orders of magnitude faster in all instances, except for two, one of which it is unable to solve. Moreover, the AOC solver discovers the new best solutions for two heavily constrained instances (3,584 and 3,860), each with over 500 binary and 10,000 continuous variables in the QUMO formulation, in about 40 s. For instance, for 3,584, Gurobi matches the AOC solution in about 54,000 s, whereas proving its global optimality takes 4.5 days. The details of the AOC-DT parameters are provided in Supplementary Information section G.4 with additional benchmarks in Supplementary Information section G.5.

Addressing practical applications with the AOC necessitates hardware scalability from hundreds of millions to billions of weights. For example, typical MRI scans with resolutions around 100,000 pixels require systems capable of processing around 20,000 variables when using decomposition techniques such as BCD, which is equivalent to handling around 400 million weights. Similarly, deep learning models with a few billion weights are standard for real-world applications48, which, with mixture of experts models or techniques such as ensembling, could be reduced to many parallel models that are an order of magnitude smaller. The AOC hardware has the potential to scale to these requirements through a modular architecture that decomposes the core optical matrix–vector multiplication operation into multiplication of smaller subvectors and submatrices.

At scale, the AOC hardware will consist of multiple modules, each performing a part of the full-weight matrix multiplication. Each module will include a microLED array, a photodetector array and an SLM. With current SLMs supporting 4 million pixels, matrices with up to 4 million weights could be realized. When combined with integrated driving electronics, this results in a miniaturized module with dimensions of around 4 cm. Utilizing the third dimension for matrix–vector multiplication thus enables scalable in-memory computing. In contrast, emerging planar optical computers1,2 are constrained by the reticle-size limit of the chip area that is used for both routing and computing, which limits the matrix size28. Furthermore, as microLEDs are incoherent light sources, optical paths need to be matched only within the system bandwidth (gigahertz) rather than the source wavelength (hundreds of terahertz), which is a fundamental manufacturability advantage over coherent systems. Achieving the required miniaturization, however, is both a challenge and an opportunity to drive advancements in 3D optical technologies with broader applications. The miniaturized optical modules are coupled with integrated analog electronic models in a 3D mesh (Extended Data Fig. 4). These modules further aggregate the output vectors from the optical modules and perform the remaining compute primitives.

We envision that the AOC can support models with 0.1 billion to 2 billion weights, requiring 50 to 1,000 optical modules. The module count can be halved if a single optical module supports both positive and negative weights13. All AOC components, including microLEDs, photodetectors, SLMs and analog electronics, have an existing and growing manufacturing ecosystem with wafer-scale production. At the same time, complementing optics with analog electronics offers numerous opportunities to expand the compute primitives, including nonlinearities, the hardware can support, thereby enhancing its expressiveness.

The operational speed and power consumption of the AOC dictate its energy efficiency. The speed is limited by the bandwidth of the opto-electronic components, typically 2 GHz or higher49. For a 100-million-weight matrix with 25 AOC modules, the power consumption is estimated to be 800 W, resulting in a computing speed of 400 peta-OPS and an efficiency of 500 TOPS W−1 (2 fJ per operation) at 8-bit weight precision (Supplementary Information section A.1). In contrast, the latest GPUs achieve a system efficiency of up to 4.5 TOPS W−1 at the same precision for dense matrices24.

In conclusion, the AOC architecture shows promise for scaling to practical ML and optimization tasks, offering a potential 100-fold improvement in power efficiency. The current AOC hardware uses a rapid fixed-point search to power inference tasks, such as regression and classification, using equilibrium models with promising reasoning capabilities, and to successfully solve QUMO problems including medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement. Cross-validation with the digital twin, coupled with evaluation on large problems, offers confidence in the hardware's performance as it scales. Looking ahead, the AOC's co-design approach—aligning the hardware with the ML and optimization algorithms—could spur a flywheel of future innovations in hardware and algorithms, pivotal for a sustainable future of computing.

The key components of our experimental set-up are shown in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1.

The optical subsystem performs matrix–vector multiplication. The basic components are the optical sources (input vector), a system of fan-out optics to project the light onto the modulator matrix and a system of fan-in optics to project the light onto a photodetector array (output vector). The corresponding schematic is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2.

The incoherent light sources are an array of 16 independently addressable microLEDs. Each microLED is driven with a bias current and an offset voltage. The variable value is encoded by the light intensity, with a value of zero corresponding to the microLED bias point. Mathematical positive values are represented by microLED drive currents greater than the bias value. Negative values are represented by drive currents less than the bias value. The diameter of each emitter is 50 μm and the pitch is 75 μm. The sources are fabricated in gallium nitride wafers on a sapphire substrate and the die is wire-bonded onto a printed circuit board (Fig. 1c). The emission spectrum is centred at 520 nm with a full-width of half-maximum of 35 nm and the operational −3-dB bandwidth is 200 MHz at 20 mA, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

After the sources, there is a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS). From this point, there are two equivalent optical paths in this set-up. Each path performs two functions: first, they allow us to use both polarizations of the unpolarized light output; second, they allow us to perform non-negative and non-positive multiplications with only intensity modulation. Each path contains one amplitude modulator matrix and one photodetector array. The modulator matrix is a reflective parallel-aligned nematic liquid-crystal SLM. We refer to the first part of the optical system as the fan-out system. The task of this fan-out system is to image the microLEDs onto the SLM, where the weights are displayed, and to spread the light horizontally into lines. The microLEDs are arranged in a one-dimensional line (let this be the y axis) and are imaged onto the SLM using a 4F system composed of a high-numerical-aperture (Thorlabs TL10X-2P, numerical aperture 0.5, ×10 magnification, 22-mm field number) collection objective and a lower-numerical-aperture lens group composed of 2 achromatic doublets with combined focal length 77 mm. There is a cylindrical lens, Thorlabs LJ1558L1, in infinity space of this 4F system. This lens adds defocus to the image of the source array on the SLM but only in the x direction, so that the projected light pattern is a set of long horizontal lines, one per microLED. Each matrix element occupies a patch of 12 (height) × 10 (width) pixels of the modulator array. An 8-bit look-up table is used to linearize the SLM response as a function of grey level.

The SLM is imaged onto the photodetector array using a 4F system (the fan-in system). The first lens group of the fan-in is the same as the second lens group of the fan-out system as this is in double pass. From here, the light is directed towards the intended photodetector array through a second PBS. The light from each column of the SLM is collected by an array of 16 silicon photodetectors to perform the required summation operation. The active area of each element is 3.6 × 0.075 mm2. The photodetectors are on a pitch of 0.125 mm. The operation bandwidth is 490 MHz at −10 V measured at 600 nm.

After the photodetector array, the signals are in the analog electronic domain. The photocurrents from each photodetector element are amplified by a linear trans-impedance amplifier (Analog Devices MAX4066). Each trans-impedance amplifier provides 25-kΩ gain and is characterized by an input referred noise of \(3\,{\rm{pA}}\,\sqrt{\text{Hz}}\) and has differential outputs. The corresponding 2 sets (1 per photodetector board) of 16 differential pairs of signals are fed to the main boards where the per-channel nonlinear operation and other analog electronic processing is carried out. Each of the 16 signals sees the following circuitry: (1) a variable gain amplifier (VGA; Texas Instruments VCA824) to allow the input signal range to be set and equalized across channels; (2) a difference amplifier to perform the operation of subtracting the negative input signal from the positive one and achieve signed voltages (signed multiplications); (3) a VGA that adds and subtracts signals from the described path, referred to as gradient term, to the annealing and momentum terms, as per equation (1), while providing a common gain control to all these paths; (4) an electronic switch (ADG659) to open and close the loop to set and reset the solving state; (5) a buffer amplifier to distribute the signal to the gradient, annealing and momentum paths; (6) a bipolar differential pair to implement the tanh nonlinearity; (7) a VGA to adjust the signal level between the nonlinearity and the required voltage and current onto the microLED alternating-current input circuit. Both the annealing and momentum paths have VGAs with a common external control so that we can implement time-varying annealing and momentum schedules.

Each channel also has an offset to the common control signal added to allow minor adjustment or correction of channel-to-channel variations. The other VGAs are set with digital-to-analog converters controlled over an inter-integrated circuit (I2C) bus. This allows slower control at per-experiment timescales.

The per-channel nonlinear function is an approximation to a tanh. This is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5d. The system is designed so that all signals follow the same path through the solver. For ML workloads, the input domain of the tanh function is unrestricted by hardware; there are no gain variations across channels. The trained weights and equilibrium model input ensure that signals evolve accurately. For optimization workloads, binary and continuous variables require different handling in hardware. Here we set the gain after the trans-impedance amplifier and before the tanh nonlinearity to be lower for continuous variables than for binary variables. This adjustment ensures that the input domain of the nonlinearity results in a more linear output for continuous variables than for binary variables.

We characterized and calibrated the key opto-electronic and electronic components to equalize the gain of each AOC path. For example, we calibrate the optical paths by applying a set of 93 reference matrices and for each we digitally compute the result of the vector–matrix product. We then adjust the gain per channel slightly so that, averaged over the set of 93 computed vectors, the AOC result is as close as possible to the digital result.

Following this, the accuracy of the matrix–vector multiplication is characterized using the same 93 reference matrices on each SLM and measuring the output of the system, shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a. For each reference matrix in the set, we calculate the MSE between the known and the measured output. The mean MSE across all dot products is 5.5 × 10−3, and the matrix–vector multiplication MSE as a function of matrix (instance) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3b. For these experiments, we configure the system in open-loop mode without feedback and turn off the annealing and momentum paths.

In commercial deployments, training consumes less than 10% of the energy and, hence, is not targeted by the AOC. The equilibrium models are trained through our digital twin, which is based on equation (2). In the digital domain during training, the convergence criterion is set to ∣∣st+1 − st∣∣ < ε, with ε = 10−3. The AOC-DT models up to seven non-idealities measured on the AOC device; each non-ideality can be switched on and off (Supplementary Fig. 5). The AOC-DT is implemented as a Pytorch module with the weight matrix W and bias terms b, as well as the gain β as trainable parameters. The weight matrix is normalized to fulfil ∥W∥∞ = 1 throughout training to simulate the passive SLM. The numeric scale of the matrix is instead modelled by the gain β. This separation of scale is necessary as several nonlinear non-idealities occur between the matrix multiplication and the gain in equation (2), as discussed in Supplementary Information section D.

The weight matrix is initialized with the default Pytorch initialization for a 16 × 16 matrix, the bias term is initialized to 0 and β is initialized at 1. We trained all models with a batch size of B = 8, at a learning rate of η = 3 × 10−4 for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST and η = 7 × 10−4 for regression tasks. We used the Adam optimizer50. In all cases, models are trained end-to-end, with the equilibrium-section trained through our AOC-DT using the implicit gradient method17, which avoids storing activations for the fixed-point iterations. This decouples memory cost from iteration depth as intermediate activations do not need to be stored. In all experiments, the α gain in equation (2) is set to 0.5 to strike a balance between overall signal amplitude and speed of convergence. Low α values cause the signal to be too weak, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (Supplementary Information section D).

Once training has completed, the weight matrix W is quantized to signed 9-bit integers using

with the rounded and clamped matrix on the right-hand side being the quantized weight matrix WQ. Whenever we report AOC-DT results, we report results obtained with the quantized matrix.

Exporting trained models to the AOC requires several further steps. First, the model inputs x and the bias term b need to be condensed into a single vector bAOC = b + x followed by clamp to ensure the values fit into the dynamic range of the AOC device (Supplementary Information section D). Second, as the optical matrix multiplication is implemented using SLMs, elements of the weight matrix are bounded by one such that all quantization-related factors disappear. However, the original maximum element of the matrix max(W) needs to be re-injected, which we achieve via the β gain in equation (2), approximately restoring the original matrix W.

The quantized matrix is split into positive and negative parts, \({W}_{{\rm{Q}}}={W}_{{\rm{Q}}}^{+}-{W}_{{\rm{Q}}}^{-}\), and each part is displayed on its respective SLM.

Each classification instance (that is, MNIST or Fashion-MNIST test image) is run once on the AOC, and the fixed point is sampled at the point marked in Extended Data Fig. 3 after a short 2.5-μs cooldown window after the switch is closed, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5a,b. The sampling window extends over 40 samples at 6.25 MHz, corresponding to 6.4 μs. This ensures that the search of fixed points for the equilibrium models happens entirely in the analog domain. Once sampled, we digitally project the vector into the output space. For classification, the input is projected from 784 to 16 dimensions, the output is projected from 16 to 10 classes. The label is then determined by the index of the largest element in the output vector (argument-max). For regression tasks, the IP and OP layers transform a scalar to 16 dimensions and back, respectively. The MSE results in Fig. 2c were obtained by averaging over 11 repeats for each input. This means that we restart the solution process 11 times, including the sampling window, and average the resulting latent fixed-point vectors. Importantly, the solve-to-solve variability appears to be centred close to the curve produced by the AOC-DT, enabling us to average this variability out (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We can expand the model sizes supported by the hardware by using an ensemble of small models that fit on it. These smaller 256-weight models are independent at inference time but are trained jointly by receiving slices 16-sized slices of a larger input vector and stacking their outputs before the OP. To scale to a 4,096-weight equilibrium model, we expand the input space from 16 to 16 × 16 = 4,096 dimensions and the output space from 10 to 10 × 16 = 160 dimensions. The IP matrix is consequently a 784 × 4,096-shaped matrix and the OP matrix is shaped 160 × 10. MNIST or Fashion-MNIST images are scaled to the range [−1, 1] and, projected to 4,096 dimensions and split into 16 slices of 16 dimensions. Each of the 16 equilibrium models then runs its respective slice of input vectors to a fixed-point. Once all 16 models are run on the AOC, we concatenate outputs and project them into the 10-dimensional output space where the largest dimension determines the predicted cipher.

The first curve (I) is a Gaussian rescaled such that the Gaussian curve approximately stretches from −1 to 1, \({f}_{{\rm{I}}}(x)=2{{\rm{e}}}^{-{x}^{2}/2{\sigma }^{2}}-1\) for σ = 0.25 and x ∈ [−1, 1]. The second curve (II) is given by \({f}_{{\rm{II}}}(x)=\sqrt{| x| }\,\sin (3{\rm{\pi }}x)\). For training sets, we choose 10,000 equidistant points xi in the range [−1, 1] whereas for test regression datasets, we choose 200 points randomly xi ≈ U([−1, 1]).

For regression tasks, we concatenate the 40 samples from all 11 repeats and calculate the standard deviation per point on the curve.

We trained the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST models on 48,000 images from their respective training set, validated on a set of 12,000 images and tested them on the full test set comprising 10,000 images.

For experimental results, the error bars in Fig. 2d were estimated using a Bayesian approach for the decision variable ct ∈ {0, 1, …, 9} for each sample t along the sampling window per image. We assume an uninformative prior p(ct) = beta(1, 1), which we then update with the observed number of correct decisions nsuccess and failures nfailure over the sampling window. The variance of the conjugate posterior of a beta distribution is given by \(\mathrm{Var}({c}_{t}| {n}_{\mathrm{success}},{n}_{{\rm{failure}}})=\frac{(1+{n}_{\mathrm{success}})(1+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}{{(2+{n}_{\mathrm{success}}+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}^{2}(3+{n}_{\mathrm{success}}+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}\). We use this to estimate the variance and, by taking the square root, the standard deviation per input image. The dataset error bars are then estimated as the mean of the standard deviations over all members of the dataset.

To address optimization problems involving positive and negative weights on the AOC hardware, QUMO instances without linear terms can have up to eight variables, which applies to both transaction-settlement scenarios and reconstruction of one-dimensional line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image. The weight matrices are unsigned in synthetic QUMO and QUBO hardware benchmarks; hence the AOC hardware can accommodate up to 16-variable instances in the absence of linear terms. Such instance size difference arises because, when both positive and negative weights are present, non-idealities in the dual-SLM configuration reduce the accuracy of matrix–vector multiplication. To mitigate this, a single SLM is used to process both positive and negative weights, effectively halving the number of variables per instance.

For the transaction-settlement scenario and the Shepp–Logan phantom image slice, their 41-variable and 64-variable QUMO instances are decomposed into smaller 7-variable QUMO instances. For each of these subinstances, the 7 variables are connected with the rest of the variables via a linear vector b, which is incorporated into the quadratic matrix W via an additional binary variable. This decomposition is repeated for each subinstance and the linear vector b is updated at the end of each BCD iteration to create the next QUMO instance. Such an approach yields 8-variable QUMO instances and a single SLM is used to represent their positive and negative matrix elements, with analog electronics handling their subtraction, which effectively utilizes the full 16-variable capacity available in hardware. The required number of BCD iterations varies depending on factors such as the initial random state of the optimization instance variables, the selection of variable blocks among subinstances, and the order in which they are optimized.

For the one-dimensional Shepp–Logan phantom image, 12 out of 32 measurements are omitted, corresponding to a 37.5% data loss or a 1.6 undersampling (acceleration) rate. Although typical MRI acceleration ranges from 2 to 8, this rate is used here owing to the image's non-smoothness at a 32-pixel resolution.

In the AOC, binary variables are encoded using a hyperbolic tangent function, whereas continuous variables utilize the near-linear region of the function, connecting optimization variables to state variables via x = f(s). In simulations at scale with the AOC-DT, linear and sign functions are used for continuous and binary variables, respectively.

To ensure that some variables take indeed continuous values in the global optimal solution, we plant random continuous values and generate synthetic 16-variable QUMO instances. As the number of continuous variables increases for a given problem size, the problem instances become computationally easier to solve. Consequently, we consider instances with up to eight continuous variables.

We generate up to 8-bit dense and sparse instances. The sparse instances belong to the QUBO model on three-regular graphs that are NP-hard51, although NP-hardness does not imply that every random instance is difficult to solve. To make these instances more challenging to solve, we verify that their global objective minimizer is distinct from the signs of the principal eigenvector of the weight matrix52.

The QPLIB is a library of quadratic programming instances23 collected over almost a year-long open call from various communities, with the selected instances being challenging for state-of-the-art solvers. As described in the main part of the paper, we consider only the hardest instances within the QPLIB:QBL class of problems, which contains instances with quadratic objective and linear inequality constraints. The QPLIB:QCBO class of problems, which contains instances with quadratic objective and linear equality constraints, and the QPLIB:QBN class of problems, which contains QUBO instances, are considered in Supplementary Information section G.5.

The distinction of the AOC-DT algorithm is the simultaneous inclusion of both momentum and annealing terms, which markedly improves the performance of the standard steepest gradient-descent method on non-convex optimization problems. Typically, multiple hyperparameters need to be calibrated for heuristic methods to achieve their best performance in solving optimization problems. We consider \(\alpha (t)=1-\widehat{\alpha }(t)\), where \(\widehat{\alpha }(t)\) is a linearly decreasing function from some initial value α0 to 0 over time. From the hardware perspective, such an annealing schedule provides an explicit stopping criteria, which is an advantage for an all-analog hardware implementation as it avoids the complexity of multiple intermediate readouts that stochastic heuristic approaches suffer from53. In principle, the three main parameters {α0, β, γ} of the AOC fixed-point update rule need to be adjusted for each optimization instance. In our simulations, we notice that the algorithm is less sensitive to the momentum parameter value, whereas the α0 and β values substantially affect the solution quality. We further perform a linear stability analysis of the algorithm to evaluate reasonable exploration regions for these two parameters and find that by scaling the β parameter as β = β0/λlargest, where λlargest is the largest eigenvalue of the weight matrix W, we get scaled parameters β0 and α0 being in a similar optimal unit range across a wide range of problems.

We design a two-phase approach for the AOC-DT to operate similar to a black-box solver that can quickly adjust the critical parameters within the given time limit. During the ‘exploration' phase, we evaluate the relative algorithm performance across a vast range of parameters (α0, β0). A subset of ‘good' parameters is then passed for more extensive investigation in the ‘deep search' phase (Supplementary Information section G.1).

We note that for two QPLIB:QUMO instances, namely, 5,935 and 5,962, we developed a pre-processing technique that greedily picks variables with the highest impact on the objective functions and considers their possible values, which is accounted in the reported time speed-up of the AOC-DT.

For a fair comparison, we ensure that all methods use similar computing resources. Although the implementation of GPU- or central-processing-unit-based solvers can require highly varying engineering efforts, we try to estimate the cost of running solvers on the hardware, on which they are designed to run, and vary the time limit across solvers accordingly to ensure similar cost per solver run. In what follows, the Julia-based AOC-DT runs on a GV100 GPU for 5–300 s per instance across all benchmarks. In the case of Gurobi, our licence allows us to use only up to eight cores, and its time to achieve the best solution for the first time is used (not the time to prove its optimality).

More details about the AOC hardware and the AOC-DT performance on different optimization instances are provided in Supplementary Information section G.5.

a, Photo of AOC, used to simultaneous run ML models and solve optimization instances. Key highlighted components are: the microLED array, the SLMs, the photodetector array, and the analog electronic block. b, AOC photo inside a rack, with all required equipment included.

Light from the sources is collected by the objective. The sources are imaged onto the SLM using the combined 4F system of the objective and lens group 1 (LG1). Polarizing beamsplitter 1 (PBS 1) splits the light by linear polarization state and sends light to one of two modulators. The reflected light is modulated by polarization (multiplication) and the action of PBS 1 makes this an amplitude modulation. Each SLM is imaged onto its corresponding detector using LG1 and LG2 through PBS 1 and PBS 2. Summation happens at the detector.

a, Example trace of an MNIST example. We selected four time points of the trace where we projected the measured state into classification space using the output projection and applied a softmax to obtain probabilities. The most likely class stays on the wrong label 7 until the fully-sampled result is evaluated in which the correct class label 9 is reached. b, Example trace of a Fashion MNIST example. Here, the initial entropy of the class-probability distribution is high but drastically falls off over iterations. The correct class with label 2 emerges early on and is maintained throughout the iterations and in the sampled result. c, Example traces of a sinusoidal regression task for x = − 0.55. While the trace sampled during evolution averages multiple iterations and is asynchronously sampled, we can observe some correspondence between the evolution of the AOC-DT for the same point. The plot on the right shows the evolution of the entire curve over AOC-DT iterations. The point of interest is marked by the vertical dashed line and appears to follow the same trajectory from close to −1 to its target value. d, Multi-seed study of the Gaussian regression task for 100 independently trained and tested equilibrium models to test how reliable the AOC-DT models the AOC device.

A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions1. It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.

It is unclear how hundreds of interconnected brain areas that are processing information related to sensation, decisions, action and behaviour lead to coherent and effective outputs2,3,4. To answer this question, we need to know how the activities of individual neurons and populations of neurons across the brain reflect variables such as stimuli, expectations, choices, actions, rewards and punishments5. Electrophysiological recordings from animals have been instrumental in this exploration. Until recently, however, technical limitations have restricted these recordings to a limited number of brain areas, which leaves much of the mammalian brain uncharted or described by fragmentary maps. For example, the mouse brain comprises over 300 identified regions6, of which only a minority has been systematically recorded in comparable behavioural settings. The regions studied were typically chosen on the basis of a priori hypotheses derived from previous recordings and anatomical connectivity. This approach can identify a localization of function and reveal brain regions that are engaged in computations such as the accumulation of sensory evidence in favour of a decision7. Nevertheless, studies have shown that such regions can sometimes be silenced without substantial behavioural consequences8,9,10,11,12, which suggests that other regions are involved. Overall, it has proven difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of neural processing based on different reports from different laboratories recording in different brain regions during different behaviours and analysing the data with different methods.

A broader search for the neuronal correlates of variables such as sensation and decision-making therefore requires the systematic recording of brain regions at a wider scale using a single task with sufficient behavioural complexity. Moreover, the data should be analysed using the same methods. Obtaining such a comprehensive dataset has recently become possible with advances in recording technology. In a species with a small brain such as the mouse, Neuropixels probes13,14 have enabled larger-scale recordings, such as sampling activity across eight visual areas15 or across tens of brain regions in mice performing behavioural tasks1,16,17 or experiencing changes in physiological state18. Modern imaging techniques also provide a wider view of activity across dorsal cortical regions19,20,21. Results from these broad surveys suggest that the encoding of task variables varies substantially. Some variables have correlates only in a few brain areas, whereas others are encoded in sparse sets of cells or distributed much more broadly. It is critical to obtain more comprehensive recordings because past recordings may have missed essential regions that are focused on the coding of certain variables and have not fully characterized the nature of distributed coding.

Here we present a publicly available dataset22 of recordings from 699 Neuropixels probe insertions spaced across an entire hemisphere of the brain in mice performing a behavioural task that requires sensory, cognitive and motor processing23. This approach enabled the detection of brain-wide correlates of sensation, choice, action and reward, as well as internal cognitive states, including stimulus expectation or priors (this ‘block' prior is described in the companion paper24). We also describe initial analyses of these data. Neural correlates of some variables, such as reward and action, were found in many neurons across essentially the whole brain. By contrast, correlates of other variables, such as the input stimulus, could be decoded from a narrower range of regions and significantly influenced the activity of fewer individual neurons. These data, which can be examined online (viz.internationalbrainlab.org) and downloaded from GitHub (https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/notebooks_external/data_release_brainwidemap.html), are intended to be the starting point for a detailed examination of decision-making processes across the brain and represent a valuable resource to enable the community to perform a broad range of further analyses with single-neuron resolution at a brain-wide scale.

First, we describe the task, the recording strategy and the analysis methods used to provide different views of this rich and complex dataset. Further details of how we ensured reproducible behaviour, electrophysiology and videography are available separately23,25 and are summarized in the Methods. Then we report the neural correlates of the main events and variables in the task: visual stimulus, choice, feedback and wheel movement.

We trained 139 mice (94 male and 45 female) on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) decision-making task23 (Fig. 1a,b). On each trial, a visual stimulus appeared to the left or right on a screen, and the mouse had to move it to the centre by turning a wheel with its front paws within 60 s (Fig. 1c). After an initial 90 unbiased trials, the prior probability for the stimulus to appear on the left or right side was constant over a block of trials at a ratio of 20:80% (right block) or 80:20% (left block). Blocks lasted for between 20 and 100 trials, which were drawn from a truncated geometric distribution (empirical mean of 51 trials). Block changes were not cued. Stimulus contrast was uniformly sampled from 5 possible values (100, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 0%). The 0% contrast trials, when no stimulus was presented, were assigned to a left or right side following the probability distribution of the block. This allowed mice to perform above chance by incorporating this prior in their choices. Following a wheel turn, mice received positive feedback in the form of a water reward, or negative feedback in the form of a white-noise pulse and a 2-s time out. The next trial began after a delay, followed by a quiescence period during which the mice had to hold the wheel still.

As previously shown23, mice learnt to both indicate the position of the stimulus and to exploit the block structure of the task. After training, they made correct choices on 81.4 ± 0.4% (mean ± s.d.) of the trials, performing better and faster on trials with high visual stimulus contrast (Fig. 1d). Recorded sessions lasted on average 645 trials (median of 602, range of 401–1,525). Towards the end of the sessions, performance decreased and first wheel-movement times increased (Fig. 1e,f). On 0% contrast trials, in which no visual information was provided, mice gained rewards on 58.7 ± 0.4% (mean ± s.e.m) of trials, significantly better than chance (t-test t138 = 20.18, P = 5.2 × 10−43). After a block switch, mice took around 5–10 trials to adjust their behaviour to the new block, as revealed by the fraction of correct choices made on 0% contrast trials after the switch (Fig. 1g). Mice were also influenced by their previous estimate in the presence of visual stimuli. That is, for all contrast values, mice tended to answer left more often on left blocks than right blocks (Fig. 1h).

In these mice, we inserted 699 Neuropixels probes (see an example of one recording of three trials in Fig. 1i), following a grid that covered the left hemisphere of the forebrain and midbrain, which typically represent stimuli or actions on the contralateral side, and the right hemisphere of the cerebellum and hindbrain, which typically represent the ipsilateral side (Fig. 2a). Recordings were collected by 12 laboratories in Europe and the USA, with most recordings using 2 simultaneous probe insertions. To ensure reproducibility, one brain location was targeted in every mouse in every laboratory, as described elsewhere25. Only sessions with at least 400 trials were retained for further analyses. Data were uploaded to a central server, preprocessed and shared through a standardized interface26. To perform spike sorting on the recordings, we used a version of Kilosort27 with custom additions28. This process produced 621,733 units (including multineuron activity), averaging 889 per probe. To separate individual neurons from clusters of multineuron activity, we then applied stringent quality-control metrics (based on those described in ref. 15), which identified 75,708 well-isolated neurons, averaging 108 per probe.

A total of 699 insertions were performed across 139 mice. b, For each region, the number of neurons recorded (full bar length) and the number of well-isolated neurons used for analysis (filled portion; for reference, the black line on each bar shows 10% of the number of recorded neurons, which is the average number of neurons that were well-isolated) are shown. Additional information and definitions for brain regions are provided in a table on GitHub (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-brain-wide-map/blob/main/brainwidemap/meta/region_info.csv). The same table reports the so-called Cosmos hierarchical grouping of the regions, which distinguishes the isocortex, the olfactory areas (OLF), the hippocampal formation (HPF), the cortical subplate (CTXsp), the cerebral nuclei (CNU), the thalamus (TH), the (hypothalamus (HY), the midbrain (MB), the hindbrain (HB) and the cerebellum (CB). The coloured text labels of brain regions are used in other figures. c, Flatmap of one hemisphere showing the acronyms used for the regions.

After recordings, probe tracks were reconstructed using serial-section two-photon microscopy29, and each recording site and neuron was assigned a region in the Allen Common Coordinate Framework6 (a table of regions is available online on GitHub (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-brain-wide-map/blob/main/brainwidemap/meta/region_info.csv); statistics are shown in Fig. 2b). Our main analyses were restricted to regions with 20 or more neurons assigned to them in at least 2 sessions, with at least 5 neurons per session. Owing to the grid-based insertion strategy of the probes, more recordings were made in larger regions, which typically led to more neurons being analysed in such regions. Note that it was harder to extract well-isolated neurons from some regions than others; therefore, the yield substantially differed. Although information about molecular cell types can sometimes be gleaned from spike waveforms, we did not attempt to do so for the analyses here. For example, although we performed recordings in some of the main neuromodulatory regions, we do not make specific claims about which neurons release which neurotransmitter.

To illustrate our main results, we plotted them into a flatmap of the brain30 (Fig. 2c). The Extended Data figures present some of the results on more conventional two-dimensional (2D) sections (which are detailed in Extended Data Fig. 1). For reference, the average activity across all regions aligned to the major task events—stimulus onset, first wheel-movement time and feedback—is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. To visualize continuous temporal dynamics across different task epochs, that figure also shows time-warped average activity, which was simultaneously aligned to stimulus, movement and feedback onsets.

The processed data for each trial consisted of a set of spike trains from multiple brain regions together with continuous behavioural traces and discrete behavioural events (Fig. 1i). These were recorded using a variety of sensors, including three video cameras and a rotary encoder on the wheel. The data were processed using custom scripts and DeepLabCut31 to generate the times of major events in each trial along with wheel velocity, whisker motion energy, lick timing and the positions of body parts. We only analysed trials in which the first wheel-movement time (which is our operational definition of a reaction time) was between 80 ms and 2 s (Fig. 1c).

To obtain an initial appraisal of the brain-wide map, we performed single-cell and population analyses to assess how neural activity encodes task variables and how it can be analysed to decode these variables. We considered four key task variables (Fig. 3a): visual stimulus; choice (left or right turning of the wheel); feedback (reward or time out); and wheel movement (speed and velocity). The main figures show the results of these analyses in a canonical dataset of 201 regions for which we had at least 2 sessions with 5 well-isolated neurons each and at least 20 well-isolated neurons after pooling all sessions (for a total of 62,857 neurons; Supplementary Table 1). Supplementary information shows results for a wider range of neurons and regions appropriate for each analysis.

See also Supplementary Fig. 2. a, Schematic of the task structure, with the time windows used for analysis in grey. In b–d, left (blue) and right (red) stimuli are used as example task variables, and the neural traces are coloured accordingly. b, Schematic of the decoding model, which quantifies neural population correlates with task variables. Regularized logistic or linear regression is used to map spike counts in the relevant time windows (grey zone) from cells in each area into predictions of the values of the variables. c, Schematic of the single-cell analysis, which quantifies single-cell neural correlates with task variables. A conditioned combined Mann-Whitney U statistic is used to compute how sensitive the activities (in the grey zone) of single cells are to individual task variables, controlling for the values of other variables. d, Schematic of the population trajectory analysis, which describes the time evolution of the across-session neural population response, pooling cells across all recordings per region. The mean activities of every cell across their entire session for the different values of task variables are segmented into short bins, and used to define trajectories in a high-dimensional state space (projected, purely for visualization, into 3D). The distances between the trajectories for the different values of the task variables (arrows) define the separation. e, Schematic of the encoding model, which uses multiple linear regression of task-defined and behaviourally defined temporal kernels (the multicoloured traces) to fit the activity of single neurons.

To provide complementary views on how these task variables are represented in each brain region, we used four analysis techniques (Fig. 3b–e; see Supplementary Fig. 2 for a fuller picture). The details of each technique are provided in the Methods, along with a discussion of the corresponding null distributions, permutation tests and false discovery rate (FDRq at the level q using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure) that we used to limit statistical artefacts.

First, we used a decoding model to predict the value of the task variable on each trial from the neural population activity using regularized logistic or linear regression (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). This analysis can detect situations in which a variable is robustly encoded but only in a sparse subset of neurons. We assessed decoding for each variable separately without considering the correlations between the task variables. This quantifies what downstream neurons would be able to determine from the activity, but does not disentangle factors that are related such as the stimulus side and choice. We performed decoding in each region and then corrected the R2 of the fit to a variable by the R2 of the fit to a suitable null distribution. We then used Fisher's combined probability test32,33 to combine decoding results across sessions. To correct for the comparisons over multiple regions, we chose a level of 0.01 for the FDR (FDR0.01).

Second, we computed single-cell statistics. For this, we tested whether the firing rates of single neurons correlated with three task variables (visual stimulus side, choice side and feedback) in the appropriate epochs of each trial (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2c). As the task variables of interest are themselves correlated, we used a condition combined Mann–Whitney U-test1 for analysis, which compares spike counts between trials differing in just one discrete task variable with all others held constant. Using a permutation test, we determined the fraction of individual neurons in a region that were significantly selective to a variable, using a threshold specific to each variable. For each session with recordings in a specific region, we computed the significance score of the proportion of significant neurons by using the binomial distribution to estimate false-positive events. We then combined significance scores across sessions with Fisher's combined probability test32,33 to obtain a combined P value for each region. We report a region as being responsive to a variable if this combined P value was below the chance level, correcting for multiple comparisons using FDR0.01. This method has lower statistical power than decoding as it only examines noisy single neurons; therefore, it may miss areas that have weak but distributed correlates of a variable. However, it controls for correlated variables in a way that the decoding method does not. Therefore, it is able to exclude neurons that appear to represent a variable by virtue of the correlation of that variable with a confound.

Third, we performed a population trajectory analysis (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2d). To that end, we averaged firing rates of single neurons in a session across all trials in 20-ms bins and then aggregated all neurons across sessions and mice per brain region. We examined how trajectories in the high-dimensional neural spaces reflected task variables. We did this by measuring the time-varying Euclidean distance between trajectories, d(t), in the interval of interest, normalized by the square root of the number of recorded cells in the given region to obtain a distance in units of spikes per second. From this time-varying distance, we extracted differential response amplitude and latency statistics. For significance testing, we permuted trials for the variable of interest while keeping the other variables fixed to minimize the effect of correlations among the variables (as done for single-cell statistics), using FDR0.01 to control for multiple comparisons. For visualization, we projected the trajectories into a three-dimensional principal components space. This analysis combined all recordings into one supersession before computing the effect of a variable for each brain region, weighting each cell equally, thus combining recordings at the cell level for each region. This approach can produce a strong signal-to-noise ratio, but it cannot distinguish results obtained in individual sessions. It further stands out by providing the temporal evolution of the sensitivity of a region to a variable during the interval of interest.

Finally, we used an encoding model34 to fit the activity of each cell on each trial as a linear combination of a set of temporal kernels locked to each task event (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2e). This generalized linear model quantifies the dependency at a temporally fine scale at the cost of a potentially low signal-to-noise ratio. We measured the impact of a variable by removing its temporal kernels and quantifying the reduction in the fit of the activity of a neuron (typically assessed using ΔR2). This method lacks a convenient null distribution; therefore, we report effect sizes rather than significance.

The results from the different analysis methods are not expected to agree perfectly, because they focus on different aspects of the responsivity of individual neurons and populations thereof. Moreover, for the population trajectory analysis, information across multiple sessions rather than within single sessions was combined. However, this strategy allowed us to test the robustness of our results by comparing findings based on subsets of the data (Supplementary Fig. 3). The results from the methods therefore should be collectively interpreted. For a direct comparison of analysis scores, see flatmaps in Extended Data Fig. 2 and scatter plots of scores for analysis pairs in Extended Data Fig. 3.

On the basis of the four main analyses, we also performed a basic, inter-area analysis using Granger interactions for simultaneously recorded brain areas (Extended Data Fig. 4). High Granger interaction scores were obtained for region pairs from all major brain regions, which were weakly correlated with anatomical distance and mostly bidirectional. A similar analysis was performed for the prior over the block in a companion paper24.

Below, we describe the results of our four analyses applied to the coding of each of the four task variables.

We first considered neural activity related to the visual stimulus. Classical brain regions in which visual responses are expected include the superior colliculus35,36, the visual thalamus37,38,39 and visual cortical areas40,41,42,43, with latencies reflecting successive stages in the visual pathway15,44. Correlates of visual stimuli have also been observed in other regions implicated in visual performance, such as parietal45 and frontal46,47,48,49 cortical areas and the striatum50,51. Substantial encoding of visual stimuli may also be present beyond these classical pathways, as the retina sends outputs to a large number of brain regions52. Indeed, an initial survey1 of regions involved in a similar task uncovered visual responses in areas such as the MRN (information and definitions for brain regions are provided in a table on GitHub: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-brain-wide-map/blob/main/brainwidemap/meta/region_info.csv). Thus, we proposed that visual coding would extend to diverse regions beyond those classically described.

Consistent with this hypothesis, a decoding analysis based on the first 100 ms after stimulus onset revealed correlates of the visual stimulus side in many cortical and subcortical regions. Strong signatures were observed in the visual cortex (VISam, VISI, VISa and VISp), the prefrontal cortex (MOs), the thalamus (LGd, LGv and CL), the midbrain (NOT, SNr, MRN, SCm and APN) and the hindbrain (GRN and PGRN) (Fig. 4a,f). For example, the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (VISp) could be used to predict the stimulus side (Fig. 4i). Note that among the analyses we performed, the decoding analysis is distinct because it does not control for variables correlated with the visual stimulus, such as choice and block. Therefore, some of the regions with significant results from this analysis might instead encode these variables.

Early responses are observed across visual areas, with ramping modulation in others. m, Maximal population trajectory distance and modulation latency (diamonds, significant regions; dots, not significant regions). Extended Data Figure 10a,d,g shows a longer time window and more neurons.

Decoding performance varied across sessions; therefore, in Extended Data Fig. 5, we show performance across sessions for all regions, even those that are not significant after the FDR0.01 correction for multiple comparisons. Supplementary Figure 4 presents data for a subset of these results split by sex. These results did not reveal differences between male and female mice. Given that some regions may represent visual information in localized sites that were only occasionally covered by our probes, we also report the fraction of sessions in which we were able to decode the stimulus from a region significantly to assess the spatial distribution (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

To distinguish the possible contributions of variables correlated with the visual stimulus, we next analysed responses in the same 100-ms window using single-cell analysis, which controlled for other variables by holding them constant in each comparison of stimulus side. This analysis produced a consistent picture but revealed fewer significant areas, with 0.5% of all neurons correlated with a stimulus side (Fig. 4b). Significant regions included visual cortical areas (VISp, VISpm, VISam and VISl) and the visual thalamus (LGd, LGv and LP), but also other structures such as the auditory cortex (AUDv), the dorsal thalamus (PF), parts of the midbrain (SCm, APN and NOT) and the hindbrain (CS, PRNr, GRN, IP and ANcr1). However, even in the regions that contained the largest fractions of responsive neurons (such as the visual cortex), this fraction did not exceed  about 10%. Given our grid-based approach to probe insertion, this low percentage of neurons could be the result of neurons having receptive fields (RFs) that did not overlap with the stimulus position.

To provide an overview of the variability across sessions, Extended Data Fig. 7 presents the fraction of significant neurons broken down by sessions without applying the FDR0.01 correction.

The results of the population trajectory analysis were consistent with the decoding analysis (Fig. 4c) and provided further information about the time course during which visual signals were encoded (Fig. 4d). For example, the responses in the visual area VISp to right visual stimuli compared with left visual stimuli showed early divergence shortly after stimulus onset, followed by rapid convergence (Fig. 4j,k). The shuffled control trajectories (shown in grey) are close to the true trajectories (Fig. 4j) because this analysis controls for choice, which is tightly correlated with the stimulus. Altogether, this analysis indicated that distance was a significant result in 104 regions (Fig. 4c,f).

The evolution of trajectories over time could be distilled into two numbers (Fig. 4l,m): the maximal response (maximum distance or dmax) and the response latency (first time to reach 70% of dmax; mapped across the brain in Fig. 4d). This characterization of the dynamics of visual representations revealed that some areas had short latencies and early peaks, including classical areas (LGd, LP, VISp, VISam and VIpm). A spatiotemporally finely resolved view of latency differences was obtained, such that LGd < VISp ≈ LP < VISpm < VISam (latencies of around 34, 42, 42, 57 and 78 ms, respectively; Fig. 4d,l,m). This early wave of activity was followed substantially later by significant visual encoding in other areas, including the MRN, SCm, PRNr, IRN and GRN (latencies of about 100−120 ms; Fig. 4d,l,m).

The encoding analysis characterized visual encoding in individual neurons across the brain (Fig. 4e). We asked whether a prediction of single-trial activity can be improved by adding a temporally structured kernel that unfolds over 400 ms after stimulus onset, on top of activity related to feedback, wheel movement speed and block identity. As there is no convenient null distribution that could be used to test the significance of this improvement, we only report effect sizes. For instance, as expected, an example VISp neuron showed large differences between stimuli on the left and right (Fig. 4g) such that removing the visual kernel resulted in a poor fit of the firing rate of the neuron (Fig. 4h). This analysis indicates that the visual stimulus variable improved fits of encoding models for neurons across a wide range of brain regions (Fig. 4e,f).

These results were broadly consistent with RF measurements. At the end of the decision-making task, we performed RF mapping in most recording sessions (504 out of 699 sessions). We thereby computed the visual RFs of neurons across the brain (204 regions covered), including classical visual areas and beyond. We estimated the significance of the RF of each neuron by fitting the RF to a 2D Gaussian function and comparing the variance explained to the fitting of 200 random shuffles of each RF. Overall, we found a relatively small fraction of cells with significant RFs (Supplementary Fig. 5). The regions with large fractions tended to be classical visual regions (VISp, VISl and SCs). We also observed non-zero fractions in diverse areas beyond classical visual regions, including the auditory cortex (AUDv), the auditory thalamus (MG), parts of the midbrain (MRN, SCm, APN and NOT) and the hindbrain (ANcr1) (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8). These results provide further support for the findings from the neural analysis of coding of visual stimuli during the task.

To determine whether trials with rapid responses were associated with distinct patterns of activity, we separated effect sizes according to a median split of the first wheel-movement time (Extended Data Fig. 9). Regions with high explained variance from stimulus onset on all trials also mostly appeared in the early first wheel-movement time model (for example, RSPv, VISl, PAG and RN). By contrast, a handful of new cortical regions in motor areas (namely MOs, and ORBm and ILA to a lesser extent) seemed to be explained only when fitting early-response trials. Late-response trials showed fewer regions with well-explained (>0.03 change) variance, but in those trials, significant variance in the subiculum and post-subiculum was explained, which was not true when considering all trials.

Taken together, the decoding, single-cell statistic and population trajectory analyses reveal a largely consistent picture of visual responsiveness. That is, it includes large and short-latency responses in classical areas but also extends to other diverse regions, even when controlling for correlated variables, particularly at later times relative to the stimulus onset.

Next, we examined which regions of the brain represented the mouse's choice and in which order. Choice-related activity has been observed in parietal, frontal and premotor regions of the primate cortex7,53,54 where many neurons show ramping activity consistent with evidence accumulation7,55. These choice signals develop across frontoparietal regions and appear later in frontal eye fields56. Similar responses were found in rodent parietal57, frontal58,59 and premotor60,61 cortical regions. However, in both rodents and primates, choice-related activity has also been found in the hippocampal formation62 and subcortical areas, in particular in the striatum1,63, the superior colliculus1,64,65 and other midbrain structures1. Subcortical regions show choice signals with similar timings as the cortex1,17 and have a causal role in making choices65. This evidence indicates that decision formation engages a distributed network of cortical and subcortical brain regions. Our recordings enabled us to determine in detail where and when choice-related activity emerges across the brain.

The decoding analysis suggested a representation of choice (left versus right upcoming action) in a larger number of brain regions than the representation of the visual stimulus (Fig. 5a,f). The animal's choice could be decoded from neural population activity during a 100-ms time window before the first wheel-movement time in many analysed regions. The strongest effect sizes were observed in the hindbrain (GRN, VII, PRNr and MARN), the thalamus (CL), the midbrain (SNr, RPF and MRN), the hypothalamus (LPO) and the cerebellum (CENT2). For example, the activity of neurons in the GRN of the medulla could be readily decoded to predict choice in an example session (Fig. 5g,i). Choice was also significantly decodable from somatosensory (SSp-ul), prelimbic (PL), motor (MOp, MOs), orbital (ORBvl) and visual (VISp) cortical areas.

Some of the decodable choice information, however, could be due to responses to the visual stimulus or block, which correlate with choice. We therefore performed single-cell analyses that controlled for correlations between all these task variables. More single neurons significantly responded to choice than to the visual stimulus (Fig. 5b,f). That is, firing rates of 4% of all neurons recorded across all brain regions correlated with choice direction during the 100 ms before the first wheel-movement time when controlling for correlations with the stimulus and block. The largest fractions of neurons that significantly responded to choice were in the hindbrain, cerebellar, midbrain and thalamic regions, consistent with the results of the decoding analysis. Neurons with significant responses to choice were highly prevalent in the thalamus (CL and SPF), the midbrain (SCm, MRN, SNr, RPF and NPC), the pons and the medulla and cerebellar nuclei (GRN, IRN, SOC, VII, TRN and FOTU), most of which did not show visual responses. The prevalence of choice-selective neurons in these subcortical regions was further confirmed by the single-cell encoding model (Fig. 5e). For instance, an example neuron in GRN showed stronger responses for right choices than left choices (Fig. 5g). The encoding model captured this preference but only in the presence of the kernel associated with choice (Fig. 5h), thereby indicating choice selectivity.

The population trajectory analysis enabled us to compare the magnitude of choice representation across brain regions on the population level. This parameter was measured as the distance between trajectories in the neural population state space on left versus right choice trials (Fig. 5c,f). The population-level choice representation was evident in many regions across the brain, with the strongest separation of neural trajectories in the hindbrain (IRN, GRN and PRNc) and the midbrain (APN, MRN and SCm). A similar magnitude of population-level choice encoding was observed in many other areas (Fig. 5c,f). In our example region, the GRN, the trajectories for left and right choice trials separated significantly more than in the shuffled control (Fig. 5j,k; controlling for correlations with stimulus and block), and the magnitude of this separation was greatest across all brain regions (Fig. 5l). Thus, all our analyses consistently point to a distributed choice representation, with some of the strongest choice signals in the midbrain, the hindbrain and the cerebellum, and relatively weaker encoding of choice across many cortical areas.

Next, we analysed when the choice signals emerged across the brain by measuring the latency at which neural population trajectories separated on the left versus right choice trials during the time preceding the first wheel-movement time (Methods). Some of the earliest choice signals developed nearly simultaneously in the thalamus (LD) and the cortex (VISl, VISam and ECT), and later appeared in a larger distributed set of brain areas (Fig. 5d,l,m). The regions GRN and MRN in the reticular formation showed moderate choice latencies and some of the strongest magnitude of population-level choice representations (Fig. 5j,l,m). This result suggests that these brainstem structures have a role in decision formation or movement preparation.

For the encoding model, we also separated out the differences in variance explained according to a median split of the first wheel-movement time (Extended Data Fig. 9). Regions that showed a high degree of variance explained by rightward movement onset in the RSPv again appeared when fitting all trials and early-response trials, but not late-respose trials. In the case of movement onset, however, the secondary visual areas VISam and VISal were consistently involved in all trials along with motor areas. Notably, the high variance explained in the subiculum extended to the hippocampal CA1 and the post-subiculum only in late-response trials, and did not appear at all in early-response trials. Subcortical involvement seemed to be limited to early-response trials in some regions like the PAG, which did not appear in the model fit to all trials.

At the end of each trial, the mouse received feedback for correct or incorrect responses: a liquid reward at the lick port or a noise-burst stimulus with a time-out period. These positive or negative reinforcers influence the learning of the task66,67,68,69,70. The liquid is consumed through licking, an activity that probably involves prominent neural representations that, in this study, we were not able to distinguish from the more abstract representation of reward. Feedback also activates neuromodulatory systems such as dopamine71,72, which have widespread connections throughout cortical and subcortical regions. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether direct encoding of feedback signals in the brain is widespread.

The decoding analysis revealed nearly ubiquitous neural responses associated with reward delivery on correct versus incorrect trials, and probably the motor responses associated with its consumption (Fig. 6a,f). Using the neural responses in the 200 ms after feedback onset, we were able to decode whether the trial was correct from nearly all recorded brain regions (Fig. 6a,f). In many regions, decoding was almost perfect. An example is the activity of the IRN in a selected session shown in Fig. 6i.

See also Extended Data Figs. 5, 7 and 14 and data in the IBL Brain Atlas (https://atlas.internationalbrainlab.org/?alias=bwm_feedback). Figure parts and statistics are as described in Fig. 4. The analysed feedback interval is 0–200 ms following feedback onset. a, Decoding. Null-corrected median balanced accuracy. b, Single-cell statistics.

Extended Data Figure 10c,f,i shows a longer time window and more neurons.

Our single-cell statistics applied to the same trial interval confirmed the decoding results. Neurons with significant response changes to correct versus incorrect feedback or reward consumption were widespread (Fig. 6b,f), with only a small handful of regions not significant for feedback type. The same was true for feedback versus the inter-trial interval baseline (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Population trajectory analysis also showed significant response differences for correct versus incorrect responses across every recorded brain region, which was predominantly consistent with the other analyses (Fig. 6c,f). It confirmed the relative strength of hindbrain, midbrain and thalamic responses to feedback seen across analyses. Population trajectory analysis also revealed asymmetries in response to negative versus positive feedback. For positive feedback, the response was overall stronger, and multiple brain areas exhibited coherent approximately 10 Hz oscillatory dynamics during reward delivery that was phase-locked across brain areas (Fig. 6j,k,l) and sessions (Extended Data Fig. 12). Across-session coherence was visible as a large oscillatory signal in an example area: the IRN (Fig. 6j,k). These oscillatory dynamics were missing during negative feedback and were closely related to licking behaviour73,74,75,76 (Extended Data Fig. 12), being stronger when reward was delivered. This result suggests that motor-related activity is the dominant factor over more abstract influences of reward on neural activity.

Assessing response latencies on the basis of the divergence of the trajectories over time showed that the saccade-reorienting and gaze-reorienting brainstem region the PRNr and the primary auditory region the AUDp exhibited the earliest and strongest responses (Fig. 6l,m). Some early responsivity is probably a carry-over from choice-related activity because the latencies were short and several identified areas exhibited high choice responsivity. The responses from auditory areas probably reflect responses to the error tone and the click from the reward delivery valve. This was particularly clear for the IC (a region that is known to relay auditory signals), which had a peak at the start and end of the 0.5-s-long error noise burst (Fig. 6l). After these initial responses, latencies across other brain regions appeared roughly similar, which suggests that there is a common signal broadcast across the brain (Fig. 6d). More detailed trajectory distance and latency scatterplots are provided in Extended Data Fig. 10.

We then applied the encoding model to the responses measured in the 400 ms after stimulus onset. The kernel for correct feedback was the largest single contributor to neural response variance across each trial (mean ΔR2 of 8.6 × 10−3 averaged across all neurons; Extended Data Fig. 13), which exceeded all other kernels (left or right stimulus, left or right wheel movement, incorrect feedback, block probability and wheel speed). This high variance-explaining response to reward delivery or consumption held across both wide regions of the cortex and subcortical areas. Midbrain and hindbrain areas exhibited particularly strong responses to reward delivery, with many additional regions, including the thalamus and the sensory (AUDp and SSs) and motor (MOp) cortices, also showing sensitivity (Fig. 6e). Removing the regression kernel for correct feedback then refitting the encoding model of an IRN neuron confirmed the large influence of correct feedback on activity (Fig. 6g,h).

In summary, we found that feedback signals are present across nearly all recorded brain regions, with a stronger response to positive feedback (that is, to reward delivery and consumption) and with particularly strong responses in the thalamus, the midbrain and the hindbrain. Further research will be needed to distinguish between responses for an internal expectation of feedback or the initiation of choice-related action versus responses to external feedback.

A consistent finding from previous large-scale recordings in mice has been the macroscopic impact of movement on neural activity. That is, both task-related and task-unrelated movements influence activity beyond premotor, motor and somatosensory cortical areas19,20,77,78. Here we started from the task-dependent component of movement, namely the movement of the wheel to register a response. We observed that different mice (and potentially the same mouse on different sessions) adopted different strategies for moving the wheel. For instance, some used both front paws, whereas others used only one paw. Turning the wheel is also a relatively complex operation, rather than being a simple, ballistic movement. Thus, one should not expect a simple relationship between these movements and activity in laterally specific motor areas. For simplicity, we restricted our analyses to the activity associated with wheel velocity (signed to distinguish left from right movements) and its absolute value, wheel speed. Furthermore, unlike the other task variables, movement trajectories change relatively quickly, which necessitates different analysis and null control strategies. Accordingly, we only report simple decoding and encoding analyses.

Wheel speed was decodable from 81% of the reportable areas (163 out of 201), with the strongest effect sizes in the hypothalamus (LPO), the hindbrain (MARN and GRN), the midbrain (CLI), the thalamus (CL, PF), the cortex (ORBvl, VISC and VISrl) and the cerebellum (VeCB) (Fig. 7a,e). For example, we could readily decode wheel speed from single trials of activity in the GRN (Fig. 7f).

See also Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 7 and the IBL Brain Atlas website for speed data (https://atlas.internationalbrainlab.org/?alias=bwm_wheel_speed) and velocity data (https://atlas.internationalbrainlab.org/?alias=bwm_wheel_velocity). For a–d, colour indicates the effect size; grey not significant at FDR0.01; ratios on the upper right indicate significant/total regions; white, regions not analysed.

The encoding analysis confirmed that many regions across the brain were sensitive to the wheel speed during the task, with ΔR2 showing values up to several times larger than for the other variables considered besides feedback (Fig. 7b,e and Extended Data Fig. 13). The PRNc and GRN in particular stood out in our analysis for the mean ΔR2 for neurons in these regions (mean ΔR2 = 9.4 × 10−3 in the PRNc and ΔR2 = 179 × 10−3 in the GRN). Many other cortical (for example, MOs) and subcortical (for example, GPe, GPi and CP) regions had less substantial, but still above-average, correlations with the wheel speed relative to other regressors (Fig. 7b,e).

Wheel velocity was also significantly decodable from a similar collection of areas as wheel speed (Fig. 7c,e,g and Supplementary Fig. 7a) and was also duly encoded (Fig. 7d,e), albeit with generally smaller values of ΔR2 (Fig. 7h). The apparently high decodability of velocity was unexpected given the complexities of wheel movement (as mentioned above). Indeed, the uncorrected values of R2 for decoding speed were substantially larger than those for velocity in most regions (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, the null distribution based on imposter sessions (that is, wheel movements from other sessions, including from other mice; Methods) could be decoded more accurately for speed than for velocity (Supplementary Fig. 7c), which reduced the significance of the decoding of speed. We attributed this excess decodability of the null distribution to the more stereotyped, that is, less variable, trajectory of speed (Supplementary Fig. 7d).

We also correlated neural activity with behavioural movement traces extracted from videos (nose, paw, pupil and tongue). To test for significance, we used the linear-shift method to compare the correlation of spiking activity with behavioural movement variables against a null distribution in which the movement variables were shifted in time79 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 15a). More than half of the neurons in most brain regions were significantly correlated with at least one behavioural variable (Extended Data Fig. 15b).

The widespread relationship between neural activity and motion has various potential sources. These include the specific details of motor planning and execution, efference copy80, somatosensory feedback and the suppression of input associated with self-motion81. More subtle effects such as the change in other sensory inputs caused by the movement19 or even prediction errors associated with incompetent execution that can fine-tune future performance82, may also be involved. Others are more general, including arousal and the calculation and processing of the costs of movement (which would then be balanced against future gain)83. More generally, of the components that are indeed specific, only a fraction is likely to be associated with the wheel movement that we monitored compared with other task-related motor actions. This is especially true given the results of previous studies19,20 showing how important uninstructed movements are in modulating a swathe of neural activity.

Building on previous efforts to build large-scale maps of activity in the mouse at neuronal resolution using Neuropixels probes1,16,17 and in other species using imaging (for example, refs. 84,85,86), we assembled a brain-wide electrophysiological map by pooling data from numerous laboratories that used the same standardized and reproducible perceptual decision-making task for mice23. Rigorous statistical analyses of this brain-wide consensus map of neural activity showed that neural activity throughout the entire brain correlates with some aspects of the task but with large differences in the ubiquity of representation of different task variables (Figs. 4–7; see Extended Data Figs. 2, 5 and 7 for side by side comparisons).

The neural representations of feedback (Fig. 6) and movement1,19,20 (Fig. 7) were particularly widespread. The former may also partially or primarily reflect the licking movements required for reward consumption rather than the hedonic aspects of reward as such. Distinguishing these possibilities would require experiments that involve recording activity during the presentation of reinforcement with no motor correlates, such as optogenetic stimulation of dopamine systems87,88. Alternatively, correlates of rewards with a motor correlate to the same movements when their hedonic reward is devalued, for example, by satiation, can be compared. The brain-wide correlates of movement could potentially reflect a brain-wide change in the state of neural processing during movement periods along with specific encoding of motor features. The hypothesis of a brain-wide state change is consistent with findings that the neural representation of upcoming movements in the cortex is widespread, although not all of this activity is causally related to the performance of the movements47. Our strategy of reducing individual differences in performance impedes a complete analysis of the relationship between neural activity in particular regions and factors such as the reward rate.

The upcoming choice for a mouse was represented in the activity of neurons across brain systems that included the cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the midbrain, the hindbrain and the cerebellum (Fig. 5). These representations cannot reflect sensory reafference (that is, responses related to sensory stimuli that occur as part of the movements, such as pressure on the paws and movements of the visual stimuli across the screen). This is because we only analysed the time period before the earliest detectable first wheel-movement time. Moreover, our carefully controlled task design and pseudo-session statistical methods meant that choice coding reported in the single-cell and population trajectory analyses cannot reflect processing of the visual stimulus or nonspecific brain states such as arousal. Instead, these responses reflect aspects of decision formation or motor preparation, which potentially include corollary discharge specific to the chosen action89,90. Although many studies have focused on the role of the cortex, the basal ganglia or the midbrain in visual perceptual decisions1,7,55,56,63,64,65,91,92, here we discovered that parts of the medulla, the pons and the cerebellum are all selectively responsive with similar timing to those areas. Our data were not able to determine whether these different systems make specific contributions to decision formation and execution. However, they rule out a model in which only a limited set of systems subserve a given behaviour according to specific task demands.

The visual stimulus (Fig. 4) was represented (before movement) in a more restricted manner. Its processing followed a temporal sequence through traditional visual areas from the visual thalamus to the cortex and to midbrain and hindbrain regions, the activity of which also correlated with choices. Notably, the temporal structure of activity in these two groups of regions differed. Visual representations in classical visual regions showed a transient representation of the stimuli, whereas activity in the midbrain and hindbrain showed later, ramping activity, consistent with a role of this activity in decision-making. The fact that visual information was found in hindbrain regions such as the GRN and the PRNr, even after accounting for correlates of choice, suggests that these regions have a role in all phases of the cognitive decision-making process rather than simply low-level motor control.

Although more than half of the recorded neurons in most brain regions were significantly modulated by at least some aspect of the task, our ability to explain the total variance of single neurons was limited (Extended Data Fig. 13). This finding indicates that the bulk of activity in the brain is not modulated by the task. It may instead be related to uninstructed movements19,20 or other processes that are not timed to the task events. Even for the activity that is modulated by the task, it is notable that external cue-driven responses were consistently smaller than internally generated signals, such as those arising in relation to the integration of the stimulus and movement planning. However, the absence of evidence for a neural representation of a task variable in a given region cannot be taken to indicate evidence of absence. This is particularly important to keep in mind because here, for robustness, we used simple variants of analysis methods rather than, for instance, extensively parameterized deep neural networks. Furthermore, our recordings may include implicit biases; for example, spike sorting may be more challenging where cell bodies are more densely packed. Nevertheless, our freely available dataset provides a rich resource for in-depth investigations of brain-wide neural computations. Such studies may include detailed analyses at the level of subregions (for example, cortical layers or functional zones of the striatum) and cell types (as identifiable from extracellular waveforms, such as broad versus narrow spike shapes in the cortex).

The University of California at Los Angeles granted approval through IACUC licence 2020-121-TR-00. Additional approvals were obtained from the University Animal Welfare Committee of New York University (licence 18-1502), the IACUC at the University of Washington (licence 4461-01), the IACUC at the University of California, Berkeley (licence AUP-2016-06-8860-1) and the Portuguese Veterinary General Board (DGAV) for experiments conducted at the Champalimaud Foundation (licence 0421/0000/0000/2019).

Mice were housed under a 12–12-h light–dark cycle (normal or inverted depending on the laboratory) with food and water available ad libitum, except during behavioural training days. Electrophysiological recordings and behavioural training were performed during either the dark or light phase of the cycle depending on the laboratory. The data from n = 139 adult mice (C57BL/6; 94 male and 45 female, obtained from either Jackson Laboratory or Charles River) were used in this study. Mice were aged 13–178 weeks (mean 44.96 weeks, median 27.0 weeks) and weighed 16.1–35.7 g (mean 23.9 g, median 23.84 g) on the day of electrophysiological recordings. We did not attempt to standardize other variables such as temperature, humidity and environmental sound, but we regularly documented and measured them23.

A detailed account of the surgical methods for the headbar implant is provided in appendix 1 of ref. 23. In brief, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. The fur was then removed from their scalp, which was subsequently removed along with the underlying periosteum. Once the skull was exposed, Bregma and Lambda were marked. The head was positioned along the anterior–posterior and left–right axes using stereotaxic coordinates. The head bar was then placed in one of three stereotactically defined locations and cemented (Super-Bond C&B) in place. Future craniotomy positions were marked on the skull relative to Bregma. The exposed skull was then covered with cement and clear UV curing glue (Norland Optical Adhesives).

For detailed parts lists and installation instructions for the training rigs, see appendix 3 of ref. 23; for the electrophysiology rigs, see appendix 1 of ref. 25.

Each laboratory installed a standardized electrophysiological rig, which differed slightly from the apparatus used during behavioural training23. The structure of the rig was constructed from Thorlabs parts and was placed on an air table (Newport, M-VIS3036-SG2-325A) surrounded by a custom acoustic cabinet. A static headbar fixation clamp and a 3D-printed mouse holder were used to hold a mouse such that its forepaws rested on the steering wheel (86652 and 32019, Lego)23. Silicone tubing controlled by a pinch valve (225P011-21, NResearch) was used to deliver water rewards to the mouse. Visual stimuli were displayed on an LCD screen (LP097Q  × 1, LG). To measure the timing of changes in the visual stimulus, a patch of pixels on the LCD screen flipped between white and black at every stimulus change, and this flip was captured with a photodiode (Bpod Frame2TTL, Sanworks). Ambient temperature, humidity and barometric air pressure were measured using a Bpod Ambient module (Sanworks), and the wheel position was monitored with a rotary encoder (05.2400.1122.1024, Kubler). Videos of mice were recorded from 3 angles (left, right and body) with USB cameras (CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, Point Grey) sampling at 60, 150 and 30 Hz, respectively (for details, see appendix 1 of ref. 25). A custom speaker (Hardware Team of the Champalimaud Foundation for the Unknown, v.1.1) was used to play task-related sounds, and an ultrasonic microphone (Ultramic UM200K, Dodotronic) was used to record ambient noise from the rig. All task-related data were coordinated using a Bpod State Machine (Sanworks). The task logic was programmed in Python, and the visual stimulus presentation and video capture were handled by Bonsai93 and the BonVision package94.

Neural recordings were made using Neuropixels probes, either v.1.0 (3A or 3B2, n = 109 and n = 586 insertions, respectively) or v.2.4 (n = 4 insertions) (Imec13), which were advanced into the brain using a micromanipulator (Sensapex, uMp-4). Typically, the probes were tilted at a 15° angle from the vertical line. Data were acquired using an FPGA (for 3A probes) or PXI (for 3B and 1.0 probes, National Instruments) system using SpikeGLX, and stored on a PC.

For a detailed protocol on animal training, see the methods in refs. 23,25. In brief, at the beginning of each trial, the mouse was required to not move the wheel for a quiescence period of 400–700 ms. After the quiescence period, a visual stimulus (Gabor patch) appeared on either the left or right (±35° azimuth) of the screen, with a contrast randomly sampled from a predefined set (100, 25, 12.5, 6 or 0%). A 100-ms tone (5-kHz sine wave) was played at stimulus onset. Mice had 60 s to move the wheel and make a response. Stimuli were yoked to the rotation of the response wheel, such that a 1-mm movement of the wheel moved the stimulus by 4 visual degrees. A response was registered if the centre of the stimulus crossed the  ±35° azimuth line from its original position. If the mouse correctly moved the stimulus 35° to the centre of the screen, it immediately received a 3-μl reward; if it incorrectly moved the stimulus 35° away from the centre, it received a time out. If the mouse responded incorrectly or failed to reach either threshold within the 60-s window, a white-noise burst was played for 500 ms and the inter-trial interval was between 1 and 1.5 s. In trials for which the visual stimulus contrast was set to 0%, the mouse had to respond as for any other trial by turning the wheel in the correct direction (assigned according to the statistics of the prevailing block) to receive a reward, but the mouse was not able to perceive whether the stimulus was presented on the left or right side of the screen. The mouse also received feedback (noise burst or reward) on 0% contrast trials.

Each session started with 90 trials in which the probability of a visual stimulus appearing on the left or right side was equal. Specifically, the 100%, 25%, 12.5% and 6% contrast trials were each presented 10 times on each side, and the 0% contrast was presented 10 times in total (that is, the ratio of the 100, 25, 12.5, 6 and 0% contrasts were set at 2, 2, 2, 2 and 1, respectively). The side (and thus correct movement) for the 0% contrast trials was chosen randomly between the right and left with equal probability. This initial block of 90 trials is referred to as the unbiased block (50:50).

After the unbiased block, trials were presented in biased blocks: in right-bias blocks, stimuli appeared on the right on 80% of the trials, whereas in left-bias blocks, stimuli appeared on the right on 20% of the trials. The ratio of the contrasts remained as above (2:2:2:2:1). Whether the first biased block in a session was left or right was randomly chosen, and blocks were then alternated. The length of a block was drawn from an exponential distribution with scale parameter of 60 trials, but truncated to lie between 20 and 100 trials.

The automated shaping protocol for training23 involved two collections of sessions. In the first session, the animals started performing a version of the task without biased blocks and were then progressively introduced to harder stimuli with weaker contrasts as they became progressively more competent. They also experienced a debiasing protocol, which was intended to dissuade them from persisting with just one of the choices. Once they were performing sufficiently well on all non-zero contrasts, they were faced with the biased blocks. When, in turn, performance on those was adequate (including on 0% contrast trials, which are informed by the block), they graduated to recording. Supplementary Figure 8a shows a joint histogram of the number of sessions the mice took in the first and second collections (these were not correlated). Supplementary Figure 8b shows a joint histogram of the number of sessions the mice took in the second collection and the performance during the recording sessions. These were also not correlated.

For details on the craniotomy surgery, see appendix 3 of ref. 25. In brief, on the first day of electrophysiological recording, the animal was anaesthetized using isoflurane and surgically prepared. The mouse was subcutaneously administered with analgesics (typically Carprofen). The UV cured glue was removed (typically using a biopsy punch (Kai Disposable Biopsy Punches (1 mm)) or a drill), exposing the skull over the planned craniotomy site (or sites). A test was made to check whether the implant could hold liquid; the bath was then grounded either through a loose or implanted pin. One or two craniotomies (approximately 1 × 1 mm) were made over the marked locations. The dura was left intact, and the brain was lubricated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A moisturising sealant was applied over the dura (typically DuraGel (Cambridge NeuroTech) covered with a layer of Kwikcast (World Precision Instruments). The mouse was left to recover in a heating chamber until locomotor and grooming activity were fully recovered.

Mice were head-fixed for recording after a minimum recovery period of 2 h. Once a craniotomy was made, up to four subsequent recording sessions were made in that same craniotomy. Once the first set of craniotomy was fully recorded from, a mouse could undergo another craniotomy surgery in accordance with the institutional licence. Up to two probes were implanted in the brain on a given session. CM-Dil (V22888, Thermo Fisher) was used to label probes for subsequent histology analyses.

Mice were given a terminal dose of pentobarbital and perfuse-fixed with PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde solution (Thermo Fisher 28908) in 0.1 M PB pH 7.4. The whole mouse brain was dissected and post-fixed in the same fixative for a minimum of 24 h at room temperature. Tissue samples were washed and stored for up to 2–3 weeks in PBS at 4 °C before shipment to the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for image acquisition. For full details, see appendix 5 of ref. 25.

For imaging, brains were equilibrated with 50 mM PB solution and embedded into 5% agarose gel blocks. The brains were imaged by serial section two-photon microscopy29,95. The microscope was controlled with ScanImage Basic (Vidrio Technologies) and BakingTray, a custom software wrapper for setting up the imaging parameters96. Image tiles were assembled into 2D planes using StitchIt97. Whole brain coronal image stacks were acquired at a resolution of 4.4 × 4.4 × 25.0 μm in xyz, with a two-photon laser wavelength of 920 nm and approximately 150 mW at the sample. The microscope cut 50-μm sections but imaged two optical planes in each slice at depths of about 30 μm and 55 μm from the tissue surface. Two channels of image data were simultaneously acquired using multialkali PMTs (green at 525 ± 25 nm; red at 570 nm low pass).

Whole brain images were downsampled to 25-μm isotropic voxels and registered to the adult mouse Allen Common Coordinate Framework6 using BrainRegister98, which is an elastix-based99 registration pipeline with optimized parameters for mouse brain registration. For full details, see appendix 7 of ref. 25.

Neuropixels probe tracks were manually traced to produce a probe trajectory using Lasagna100, a Python-based image viewer equipped with a plugin tailored for this task. Traced probe track data were uploaded to an Alyx server101 (a database designed for experimental neuroscience laboratories). Neuropixels channels were then manually aligned to anatomical features along the trajectory using electrophysiological landmarks with a custom electrophysiology alignment tool102,103. For full details, see appendix 6 of ref. 25.

The spike-sorting pipeline used at IBL is described in detail in ref. 28. In brief, spike sorting was performed using a modified version of the Kilosort 2.5 algorithm14. We found that it was necessary to improve the original code in several aspects (scalability, reproducibility and stability, as discussed in ref. 25); therefore, we developed an open-source Python port (the code repository is provided in ref. 104).

We applied a set of inclusion criteria to sessions, probes and neurons to ensure data quality. Supplementary Table 1 lists the consequences of these criteria for the number of sessions and probes that passed the criteria.

Each Neuropixels insertion was repeated in at least two laboratories, with reproducibility of outcomes across laboratories verified with extensive analyses that we have previously reported25.

Sessions were included in the data release if the mice performed at least 250 trials, with a performance of at least 90% correct on 100% contrast trials for both left and right blocks, and, to be able to analyse the feedback variable, if there were at least 3 trials with incorrect choices (after applying the trial exclusions below). Furthermore, sessions were included in the release only if they reached threshold on a collection of hardware tests (definitions are available from GiHub (https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/_autosummary/ibllib.qc.task_metrics.html)).

Insertions were excluded if the neural data failed the whole recording per visually assessed criteria of the ‘Recording Inclusion metrics and Guidelines for Optimal Reproducibility' (RIGOR) from ref. 25, by presenting major artefacts (see examples in ref. 28) or if the probe tract could not be recovered during the histology procedure. Furthermore, only insertions for which alignments had been resolved (see appendix 6 of ref. 25 for definitions) were used in this study.

After applying these criteria, a total of 459 sessions, 699 insertions and 621,733 neurons remained, constituting the publicly released dataset.

For the analyses presented here, trials were excluded if one of the following trial events could not be detected: choice, probabilityLeft, feebackType, feeback times, stimON times and firstMovement times. Trials were further excluded if the time between stimulus onset and the first movement of the wheel (the first wheel-movement time) were outside the range of 0.08–2.00 s.

Neurons generated by the spike-sorting pipeline were excluded from the analyses presented here if they failed one of the three criteria described in ref. 28 (the single unit computed metrics of RIGOR25): amplitude > 50 μV; noise cut-off < 20 μV; and refractory period violation. Neurons that passed these criteria were termed well-isolated neurons (or often just ‘neurons') in this study. Out of the 621,733 units collected, 75,708 were considered well-isolated neurons. Final analyses were additionally restricted to regions that were designated grey matter in the adult mouse Allen Common Coordinate framework6, contained at least five well-isolated neurons per session and were recorded from in at least two such sessions.

We briefly describe the video analysis pipeline (full details can be found in ref. 105). The recording rigs contained three cameras: one called ‘left' at full resolution (1,280 × 1,024) and 60 Hz, filming the mouse from one side; one called ‘right', filming the mouse symmetrically from the other side at half resolution (640 × 512) and 150 Hz; and one called ‘body' at half resolution and 30 Hz, filming the body of the mouse from above. We developed several quality-control metrics to detect raw video issues such as poor illumination (as infrared light bulbs broke) or accidental misplacement of the cameras105.

We computed the motion energy (the mean across pixels of the absolute value of the difference between adjacent frames) of the whisker pad areas in the ‘left' and ‘right' videos (Fig. 1d). The whisker pad area was empirically defined using a rectangular bounding box anchored between the nose tip and the eye, both found using DeepLabCut106 (DLC; see more below). This metric quantifies motion in the whisker pad area and has a temporal resolution of the respective camera.

We also performed markerless pose estimation of body parts using DLC31, which is used in a fully automated pipeline in IBL (v.2.1) to track various body parts such as the paws, nose, tongue and pupil (Fig. 1d). In all analyses using DLC estimates, we excluded predictions with likelihood < 0.9. Furthermore, we developed several quality-control metrics for the DLC traces105.

At the end of the behavioural task session, for most of the recordings (504 out of 699 insertions), we performed an RF mapping experiment for 5 min. During the RF mapping phase, visual stimuli were random square pixels in a 15 × 15 grid occupying 120° of visual angle both horizontally and vertically. There were three possible colours for each pixel: white, grey and dark. The colour of pixels randomly switched at the frame rate of 60 Hz, with an average duration of around 100 ms (Supplementary Fig. 5a).

To compute the RF, we identified the moments when colour switching occurred for each pixel. We defined the moments when colour brightness increased as the on stimulus onset time, which included the transition from dark to grey and grey to white. Similarly, we defined the moments when colour brightness decreased as the off stimulus onset time, which included the transition from grey to dark and white to grey. We then computed the average spike rate aligned with on and off stimulus onset for each pixel, from 0 to 100 ms. We defined two types of RFs, on and off, as the average on and off spike rates, respectively, across pixels.

To estimate the significance of the RF, we fitted the RF to a 2D Gaussian function then compared the variance explained to the fitting of a randomly shuffled receptive field (200 shuffles) and computed the P value of significance. We defined a neuron as having a significant RF if either an on or off RF had P < 0.01.

In this work, we studied the neural correlates of task and behavioural variables. To assess the significance of these analyses, we needed to properly account for spurious correlations. Spurious correlations can be induced in particular by slow continuous drift in the neurophysiological recordings due to various factors, including movement of the Neuropixels probes in the brain. Such slow drifts can create temporal correlations across trials. Because standard correlation analyses assume that all samples are independent, they can produce apparently significant nonsense correlations even for signals that are completely unrelated107,108.

Null distributions were generated, which we used to test the significance of our results. Specifically, we used distinct null distributions for each of the three types of variables we considered: a discrete behaviour-independent variable (the stimulus side); discrete behaviour-dependent variables (for example, reward and choice); and continuous behaviour-dependent variables (for example, wheel speed and wheel velocity). For the rest of the section, we denote the aggregated neural activity across L trials and N neurons by \(S\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{L\times N}\), and denote the vector of scalar targets across all trials by \(C\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{L}\).

For the discrete behaviour-independent variable, we generated the null distribution from so-called pseudo-sessions. These are sessions generated from the same generative process as the one used for the mice. This process ensured that the time series of trials in each pseudo-session shared the same summary statistics as the ones used in the experiment. We generated M (typically M = 200) pseudo-targets \({\widetilde{C}}_{i},i\in [1,M]\), and performed the given analysis on the pair \((S,{\widetilde{C}}_{i})\) and obtained a fit score \({\widetilde{F}}_{i}\). In pseudo-sessions, the neural activity S should be independent of \({\widetilde{C}}_{i}\) as the mouse did not see \({\widetilde{C}}_{i}\) but rather C. Any predictive power from \({\widetilde{C}}_{i}\) to S (or from S to \({\widetilde{C}}_{i}\)) would arise, for instance, from slow drift in S unrelated to the task itself. These pseudo-scores \({\widetilde{F}}_{i}\) were compared with the actual score F obtained from the neural analysis on \((S,C)\) to assess significance.

For discrete behaviour-dependent variables (such as choice or reward), we could not use the pseudo-session procedure above as we did not know the underlying generative process in the mouse. We therefore used ‘synthetic' sessions to create a null distribution. These depended on a generative model of the process governing the choices of the animals. In turn, this required a model of how the animals estimated the prior probability that the stimulus appears on the right or left side of the screen, along with a model of its response to different contrasts given this estimated prior. In a companion paper on the subjective prior24, we found that the best model of the prior across all animals uses a running average of the past actions as a subjective prior of the side of the next stimulus, which we refer to as the ‘action-kernel' model. The subjective prior πt follows the update rule:

with \({a}_{t}\in \{-1,1\}\) {(left, right)} the action performed by the mouse on trial t and α the learning rate, which we fitted on a session-by-session basis. This effectively modelled how mice use information from previous trials to build a subjective prior of where the stimulus is going to appear at the next trial. The details of how this prior is integrated with the stimulus to produce a decision policy is described in the companion paper24.

We fit the parameters of this model of the mouse's decision-making behaviour separately for each session and then created ‘synthetic' targets \({\widetilde{C}}_{i}\) for that session by applying the model (with those fitted parameter values) to stimuli generated from pseudo-sessions to obtain time series of choice and reward. Then, as for the pseudo-sessions above, we obtained pseudo-scores \({\widetilde{F}}_{i}\) based on \((S,{\widetilde{C}}_{i})\) and assessed significance by comparing the distribution of pseudo-scores to the actual score F obtained from the neural analysis on (S, C).

For the third type of variable—continuous behaviour-dependent variables such as wheel speed—generating synthetic sessions was harder as we did not have access to a reasonable generative model of these quantities. We instead used what we call ‘imposter' sessions, which were generated from the continuous behaviour-dependent variable from another mouse on another session. In detail, an imposter session for an original session of L trials was generated by performing the following steps:

Concatenating trials across all sessions analysed in this study (leaving out the session under consideration).

Randomly selecting a chunk of L consecutive trials from these concatenated sessions.

Returning the selected chunk, the imposter session.

The continuous behaviour-dependent variable could then be extracted from the imposter session. As with the pseudo-sessions and the synthetic sessions, we obtained pseudo-scores \({\widetilde{F}}_{i}\) from a collection of imposter sessions and assessed significance by comparing the distribution of pseudo-scores to the actual score F obtained from the neural analysis on \((S,C)\).

To apply the linear shift method79,109 to compare spiking with movement variables, we first truncated both the movement and spiking time series by removing n = 20 samples from both ends of both time series. We computed the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the central segments and compared the square of this coefficient to a null distribution obtained by repeatedly shifting the spiking time series linearly from the beginning to the end of the full behavioural time series. Significance was assessed using the approximate criterion, rejecting the null with significance α = 0.05 if the unshifted correlation was in the top α(2n + 1) of the shifted values.

Additional information about assessing significance for individual analyses are detailed in the analysis-specific sessions below. For decoding, single-cell and population trajectory analyses, the results come in the form of per-region P values. We used the FDR to correct for comparisons across all the regions involved in each analysis (201 for the main figures) at a level of q = 0.01. We used the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure110 as we expected substantial independence among the tests. As noted, we were not able to assess significance for the encoding analysis because of a lack of a convenient null distribution.

We performed a decoding analysis to measure how much information the activity of populations of neurons contained about task variables such as stimulus side and choice. To do this we, used cross-validated, maximum-likelihood regression with L1 regularization (to zero out the contribution from noisy neurons). The neural regressors were defined by binning the spike counts from each neuron in each session in a given region in a specific time window on each trial. The duration of the time window, the number of bins in that time window (that is, the bin size) and the trial event to which it was aligned depended on the variable that is the target of our regression (Supplementary Table 2). These factors are discussed further below and include a variety of behavioural and task variables: stimulus side, choice, feedback and wheel speed and velocity. Although a session may have included multiple probe insertions, we did not perform decoding on these probes separately because they are not independent. Instead, neurons in the same session and region were combined across probes for our decoding analysis. Decoding was cross-validated and compared with a null distribution to test for significance. A given region may have been recorded on multiple sessions; therefore, in the main figures (Figs. 4–7) the region P value was defined by combining session P values using Fisher's combined probability test, and the region effect size was defined by subtracting the median of the null distribution from the decoding score and reporting the median of the resulting values across sessions. The P values for all regions were then subjected to FDR correction for multiple comparisons at q = 0.01.

Stimulus side, choice and feedback were treated as binary target variables for logistic regression. For stimulus side, trials that had zero contrast were excluded. We used the LogisticRegression module from scikit-learn111 (v.1.1.2) with 0.001 tolerance, 20,000 maximum iterations, “l1” penalty, “liblinear” solver and “fit_intercept” set to True. We balanced decoder classes by weighting samples by the inverse of the class frequency, 1/(2Pi,class). Decoding performance was evaluated using the balanced accuracy of classification, which is the average of the recall probabilities for the two classes. Supplementary Figure 9 shows histograms of the regression coefficients for all the variables.

Wheel values (speed and velocity) change over the course of a trial, unlike the previous decoding targets, and we therefore had to treat these target variables differently. We averaged wheel values in nonoverlapping 20-ms bins, starting 200 ms before first wheel-movement time and ending at 1,000 ms after first wheel-movement time. Spike counts were similarly binned. The target value for a given bin (ending at time t) was decoded from spikes in a preceding (causal) window spanning W bins (ending at times t, …, t-W). Therefore, if decoding from n neurons, there were (W + 1)n predictors of the target variable in a given bin. In practice, we used W = 10. To decode these continuous-valued targets, we performed linear regression using the Lasso module from scikit-learn111 (v.1.1.2) with 0.001 tolerance, 1,000 maximum iterations and “fit_intercept” set to True. Decoding performance was evaluated using the R2 metric.

We performed all decoding using nested cross-validation. Each of five outer folds was based on a training and validation set comprising 80% of the trials and a test set of the remaining 20% of trials. We selected trials at random in an interleaved manner. The training and validation set of an outer fold was itself split into five inner folds, again using an interleaved 80:20% partition. When logistic regression was performed, the folds had to be selected such that the trials used to train the decoder included at least one example of each class. Because both outer and inner folds were selected at random, it was possible that this requirement was not met. In those circumstances, we re-sampled the outer or inner folds. Likewise, we disallowed pseudo and synthetic sessions that had too few class examples. We fit regression models on the 80% training set of the inner fold using regularization coefficients (10−5, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2, 10−1, 100 and 101) for logistic regression (input parameter C in sklearn) and (10−5, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2 and 10−1) for linear regression (input parameter α in sklearn). We then used each model to predict targets on the remaining 20% of the trials of the inner fold (that is, the validation set). We repeated this procedure such that each trial in the original training and validation set of the outer fold was used once for the validation set and four times for the training set. We then took the regularization coefficient that performed best across all validation folds and retrained a regression model using all trials in the training and validation set of the outer fold. This final model was used to predict the target variable on the 20% of trials in the test set of the outer fold. We repeated the above train–validate–test procedure five times, each time holding out a different 20% of test trials such that, after the five repetitions, each trial had been included in the test set exactly once and included in the training and validation set exactly four times. The concatenation of all test set predictions, covering 100% of the trials, was used to evaluate the decoding score.

We found that for some regions and sessions, the resulting decoding score was sensitive to the precise assignment of trials to different folds. Therefore, to provide additional robustness to this procedure, we repeated the full fivefold cross-validation over multiple separate runs, each of which used a different random seed for selecting the interleaved training, validation and test splits. We then took the average decoding score across all runs as the final reported decoding score. When decoding stimulus side, choice and feedback, we performed ten runs, and for decoding wheel speed and wheel velocity, we used two runs owing to the added computational burden of decoding the wheel values, which included multiple bins per trial.

To further reduce the sensitivity of decoding scores due to fold allocation, the companion prior paper24 used a minimum of 250 trials to perform decoding of a given session. We waived that requirement for the decoding analyses in this study to match the same neurons used in the other analyses. We found that relaxing this requirement only affected the significance of a small number of regions for each target variable (Supplementary Fig. 10).

We assessed the significance of the decoding score that resulted from the multirun cross-validation procedure by comparing it to those of a bespoke null distribution of decoding scores. To construct appropriate null distributions, we fixed the regressor matrices of neural activity and generated new vectors of target values that followed similar statistics (Supplementary Table 2), as described above. Once the new target values were generated, we carried out the full multirun cross-validation procedure described above to obtain a new decoding score. This was repeated multiple times to produce a null distribution of decoding scores: stimulus side, choice and feedback were repeated 200 times, whereas wheel speed and velocity were repeated 100 times to reduce the computational burden (Supplementary Table 3).

The null distribution was used to define a P value for each region–session pair, in which the P value was defined as 1 − ρ where ρ was the percentile relative to the null distribution. Each brain region was recorded in ≥2 sessions, and we used two different methods for summarizing the decoding scores across sessions: (1) the median-corrected decoding score among sessions, which was used as the effect size in the main figures (the values were corrected by subtracting the median of the decoding score of the null distribution); and (2) the fraction of sessions in which decoding was significant, that is if the P value was less than α = 0.05, which is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. We combined session-wide P values using Fisher's combined probability test (also known as the Fisher's method32,33) when computing a single statistic for a region. Finally, the combined P value for a region was subjected to a FDR correction for multiple comparisons at q = 0.01. We note that the combined P value may be significant but the computed effect size may be negative. This is because many sessions used for decoding in that region may have been insignificant, thereby driving the effect size down, whereas a small number of sessions may have been significant, thereby causing the Fisher's combined probability test to produce a significant combined P value.

We quantified the sensitivity of single neurons to three task variables: visual stimulus (left versus right location of the visual stimulus); choice (left versus right direction of wheel turning); and feedback (reward versus non-reward). We computed the sensitivity metric for each task variable using the condition combined Mann–Whitney U-statistic1,112,113 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,c). Specifically, we compared the firing rates from those trials with one task-variable value V1 (for example, trials with the stimulus on the left side) to those with the other value V2 (for example, with the stimulus on the right side) while holding the values of all other task variables fixed. In this way, we could isolate the influence of individual task variables on neural activity. To compute the U-statistic, we first assigned numeric ranks to the firing rate observations in each trial. We then computed the sum of ranks R1 and R2 for the observations coming from n1 and n2 trials associated with the task-variable values V1 and V2, respectively. The U-statistic is defined as:

The probability that the firing rate on V1 trials is different (greater or smaller) from the firing rate on V2 trials is computed as 1 − P, where P is given by

which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve114,115. The null hypothesis is that the distributions of firing rates on V1 and V2 trials are identical.

To obtain a single probability across conditions, we combined observations across different trial conditions j by a sum of U-statistic in these conditions1:

Here n1,j and n2,j are the numbers of V1 and V2 trials, respectively, in the condition j.

For the visual stimulus, we compared firing rate in trials with the stimulus on the left versus stimulus on the right during the time window 0–100 ms aligned to the stimulus-onset time. For choice, we compared firing rates in trials with the left versus right choice during the time window −100 to 0 ms aligned to the first wheel-movement time. For the feedback, we compared firing rate in trials with reward versus non-reward during the time window of 0–200 ms aligned to the feedback-onset time.

To estimate significance, we used a permutation test in which trial labels for one task variable were randomly permuted 3,000 times in each subset of trials with fixed values of all other task variables, and the Mann–Whitney U-statistic was computed for each permutation. We computed the P value for each task variable as the fraction of permutations with the statistic P greater than in the data. This approach controlled for correlations among task variables and allowed us to isolate the sensitivity of the neuron to a stimulus that is not due to sensitivity to block and choice and vice versa. Random permutations, however, do not control for spurious correlations that can arise owing to autocorrelations in the time series of the firing rate and task variable107. To control for spurious correlations, we used a within-block permutation test to simultaneously control for both temporal correlations and correlations among task variables. Specifically, we generated the null distribution by randomly permuting trial labels with fixed values of all other task variables in each individual block, which effectively reduced the serial dependencies of task variables at the time scale of block duration.

The combined condition Mann–Whitney U-statistic is known to have a relatively high false-positive rate owing to the limited number of trials in each condition. To obtain a sufficient number of trials, we also computed a simple Mann–Whitney U-statistic without separating different conditions. We defined P < 0.001 (αMW = 0.001) as the criterion of significance for the simple Mann–Whitney U-statistic, and P < 0.05 (αCCMW = 0.05) for the combined condition Mann–Whitney U-statistic. We defined neurons that were significant in both tests to be sensitive neurons for a specific task variable.

To quantify the overall responsiveness of single neurons to the behavioural task, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare firing rates between the baseline (–200 to 0 ms window aligned to the stimulus onset) and the following different task periods: 50–150 ms and 0–400 ms aligned to the stimulus onset; –100 to 50 ms and –50 to 200 ms aligned to the first wheel-movement time; and 0–150 ms aligned to the reward delivery. These time windows are selected on the basis of the test of responsiveness in previous work on large-scale neural coding with a similar task structure1.

To measure the behavioural movement correlates of single neurons in the entire recording sessions, we computed zero time-lag Pearson's correlation coefficients between time series of spike counts in 50-ms bins and time series of four behavioural variables (nose, pupil, paw and tongue) each extracted from videos of the mouse using DLC software31. To assess the significance of these correlations, we applied a time-shift test79 and computed 2K = 40 time-shifted correlations, varying the offset between time series of spiking activity and behavioural variables from 50 to 1,000 ms (both positive and negative offsets). We then counted the number of times m where the absolute value of time-shifted correlation exceeded that of zero time-lag correlation and assigned the P value as the fraction of the absolute value of permuted correlations greater than in the data P = m/(2K + 1). We then assigned each neuron as being significantly responsive relative to a particular threshold on this P value.

We then computed the fraction of neurons in each brain region that were significantly responsive to the behavioural task, movement, visual stimulus, choice and feedback, and identified brain regions that were most responsive to these conditions. Specifically, for each region, we computed the P value of the fraction of neurons (fi) in i-th session by comparing the fraction to a binomial distribution of fractions due to false-positive events: Binomial(Ni, α), where Ni is the number of neurons in i-th session, and α is the false-positive rate:

We defined the P value Pi as the probability of the fraction fi that is larger than the distribution Binomial(Ni, α). Next, we used Fisher's combined probability test to compute a combined P value of each brain region by combining the P values of all sessions (i = 1, 2, … m).

After computing combined P values of each brain region, these P values were then subjected to the FDR procedure (Benjamini–Hochberg) at q = 0.01 to correct for multiple comparisons. We defined a list of regions to be significant on the basis of this FDR procedure.

We examined how responsive different brain regions were to a task variable v of interest. To do so, we constructed a pair of variable-specific supersessions (\({s}_{v},{s}_{v}^{{\prime} }\)): We partitioned all the IBL data into two, corresponding to the opposing pair of conditions for the variable (for example, for stimulus discrimination, we split the trials into the left and right stimulus conditions) and replaced the trial-by-trial responses of each cell in the condition and in each session with one trial-averaged response (Fig. 3e). These trials were aligned to a variable-specific reference time (for example, the stimulus-onset time for stimulus discrimination). We used the canonical time windows shown in Fig. 3a around the alignment time for the main figures unless stated otherwise (for example, for feedback, we used a longer time window in the temporal evolution plot to illustrate licking), time bins of length 12.5 ms and stride of 2 ms. The supersessions \({S}_{v},{S}_{v}^{{\prime} }\) had a number of rows equalling the number of IBL sessions that passed quality control for that variable condition times the number of cells per session; columns corresponded to time bins.

We then subdivided the supersessions by brain region r (\({S}_{v,r},{S}_{v,r}^{{\prime} }\)). These defined a pair of across-IBL response trajectories (temporal evolution of the response) to the pair of variable v conditions for each brain region.

We next computed the time-resolved difference in response of brain region r to the opposing conditions of task variable v. We restricted our analyses to regions with ≥20 rows in (\({S}_{v,r},{S}_{v,r}^{{\prime} }\)) for all analyses. Our primary distance metric, which we call dv,r(t), was computed as a simple Euclidean distance in neural space, normalized by the square root of the number of cells in the given region.

Given a time-resolved distance curve, we computed the maximum and minimum distances along the curve to define a variable-specific and region-specific modulation amplitude:

We obtained a variable-specific and region-specific response latency by defining it as the first time t at which \({d}_{v,r}(t)={\min }_{t}[{d}_{v,r}(t)]\,+\,\)\(0.7({\max }_{t}[{d}_{v,r}(t)]-{\min }_{t}[{d}_{v,r}(t)])\). Using modulation amplitude as a measure of effect size, we then quantified the combined modulation amplitude and latency of regions as a function of task variable.

To generate a significance measure for the variable-specific and region-specific distance measures, we used a pseudo-trial method for generating null distance distributions, as described below. Distances were significant if they were greater in size than the corresponding null distance distribution with P < 0.01. Although the significance of regions was therefore controlled for the effects of other task variables, note that the distance amplitudes and latencies were not.

Below we list the three task variables examined and the associated null distributions:

Stimulus supersession: \({S}_{v},{S}_{v}^{{\prime} }\) corresponded to trials with the stimulus on the left or right, respectively, aligned by the stimulus-onset time and including 0 ms before to 150 ms after onset. To generate pseudo-trials, we permuted the stimulus side labels among trials that shared the same block and choice side.

Choice supersession: \({S}_{v},{S}_{{v}^{{\prime} }}^{{\prime} }\) corresponded to trials with the animal's response (wheel movement) to the left or right, respectively, aligned by the first wheel-movement time and including 0 ms before to 150 ms after onset. To generate pseudo-trials, we permuted the choice labels among trials with the same block and stimulus side.

Feedback supersession: \({S}_{v},{S}_{v}^{{\prime} }\) corresponded to trials in which the animal's response was correct (recall that the feedback was water delivery) or incorrect (recall that the feedback was tone and time out delivery), respectively, aligned by feedback onset and including 0 ms before to 150 ms after onset. To generate pseudo-trials, we permuted the choice labels among trials with the same block and stimulus side and then compared these pseudo-choices with the true stimulus sides to obtain pseudo-feedback types.

For each \({S}_{v,r},{S}_{v,r}^{{\prime} }\) pair, we repeated the pseudo-trial process M (1,000) times, then followed the same distance computation procedures described above to obtain a null distribution of M modulation amplitude scores. We obtained a P value by counting n (as the number of pseudo-scores that were greater than the true score for this region) as: \(P=\frac{n+1}{M+1}\).

For regions with significant and large effect sizes to a given variable, we generated visualizations of the population dynamics by projecting the trajectories in \({S}_{v,r},{S}_{v,r}^{{\prime} }\) into a low-dimensional subspace defined by the first three principal components of the pair \({S}_{v,r},{S}_{v,r}^{{\prime} }\). In addition to the main figure results, population trajectory results on the maximal dataset are shown in Extended Data Fig. 10.

We fit linear regression models to single-neuron activity, measured as spikes binned into 20-ms intervals. These models aimed to express {slt}, the neural activity in time bin t ∈ [1, T] on trial l ∈ [1, L] based on D time-varying task-related regressors \(X\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{L,T,D}\). We first represented the regressors across time using a basis of raised cosine ‘bump' functions in log space116. Each basis function was associated with a weight in the regression model, with the value of the basis function at time t described by \(\cos \left(\frac{2(t-\tau ){\rm{\pi }}}{2w}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\). The basis functions were computed in log space and then mapped into linear time to more efficiently capture both fast neuronal responses in the  <100-ms range and slow changes beyond that time (Fig. 3c). The width w and centre τ of each basis were chosen to ensure even coverage of the total duration of the kernel. In an example kernel with three bases, three separate weights would be fit to the event in question with weights describing early, middle and late activity predicted by the event. These bases were convolved with a vector describing the effects of each regressor. In the case of timing events, the bases were convolved with a Kronecker delta function, which resulted in a copy of the kernel at each time when the event occurred. We describe the simple case that each regressor has the same number B of basis functions. This produced a new regression tensor \(\widehat{X}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{L,T,D,B}.\)

We then sought regression weights \(\beta \in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{D,B}\) such that, as closely as possible, \({s}_{lt}={\beta }_{0}+{\sum }_{d,b}{\beta }_{db}{\widehat{x}}_{ltdb}\), where {βdb} are linear regression weights. Each single-neuron model used regressors for stimulus onset (left and right separately), first wheel-movement time (left or right), correct feedback, incorrect feedback, value of the block probability, movement initiation and wheel speed. Fitting was performed using an L2-penalized objective function (as implemented in the scikit-learn Python ecosystem as \(\Vert {\bf{s}}-{\beta }_{0}-\widehat{X}\cdot \beta {\Vert }_{2}^{2}+\alpha \times \Vert \beta {\Vert }_{2}^{2}\)), with the weight of the regularization α determined through cross-validation. Note that the intercept of the model is not included in the regularization to capture fully the mean of the distribution of s.

We used a kernel composed of five basis functions to parameterize left and right stimulus onset, and correct and incorrect feedback. These bases spanned 400 ms and corresponded to 5 weights per regressor for each of these 4 regressors in the model.

Previous work has shown that difficulty in perceptual decision-making tasks117, along with neural responses, does not change linearly with contrast. To account for this, we modulated the height of the stimulus-onset kernels as a function of contrast c with height \(h=\frac{\tanh 5c}{\tanh 5}\). The resulting kernels would produce a response that was lower at low contrasts for the same set of weights {βdb}.

To capture statistical dependencies between wheel movements and spiking, we used anticausal kernels (in which the convolution of signal and kernel produces a kernel peak before peaks in the signal) describing the effect of first wheel-movement time for leftward and rightward movements. These kernels described 200 ms of activity preceding first movement using 3 basis functions. We also used an additional anticausal kernel of 3 bases covering 300 ms describing the effect of wheel speed, and was convolved with the trace of wheel speed for each trial. With these regressors, we aimed to capture preparatory signals that preceded movements related to the wheel.

Models were fit on a per-neuron basis with the L2 objective function using fivefold cross-validation. Trials for cross-validation were chosen from a uniform distribution, and not in contiguous blocks. Models were then fit again using a leave-one-out paradigm, with each set of regressor weights βd1…βdB being removed as a group and the resulting model fit and scored again on the same folds. The change between the base model score \({R}_{{\rm{full}}}^{2}\) and the omission model \({R}_{-{\rm{regressor}}}^{2}\) was computed as \(\Delta {R}_{{\rm{regressor}}}^{2}={R}_{{\rm{full}}}^{2}-{R}_{-{\rm{regressor}}}^{2}\). Moreover, the sensitivity for several pairs of associated regressors, such as left or right stimulus onset and correct and incorrect feedback, were defined as \(\log | \Delta {R}_{A}^{2}-\Delta {R}_{B}^{2}| \). This computation was applied to the following pairs: right and left stimulus, right and left first wheel-movement time, and correct and incorrect feedback.

Granger causality has been suggested as a statistically principled technique to estimate directed information flow from a pair of time series118. We used nonparametric spectral Granger causality119, implemented in Python120, to compute a Granger score for all simultaneously recorded region pairs in the IBL's brain-wide dataset.

For a given session, binned spikes (12.5-ms bin size) from both probes were averaged across regions to obtain a firing rate time series for the complete recording (excluding regions with fewer than ten neurons per recording). These series (typically 1.5-h long) were then divided in nonoverlapping 10-s segments (irrespective of task contingencies or alignment), which resulted in a data input of shape no. of regions × no. of segments × no. of observations from which a Granger score as a function of frequency was computed for each directed region pair with the Spectral Connectivity Python package120. We obtained a single Granger score per directed region pair by averaging across frequencies121.

Significance for a Granger score and region pair for a given session was established using a permutation test. That is, a null distribution of pseudo Granger scores was obtained by randomly swapping the two region labels across segments. A total of 1,000 of these pseudoscores were computed, and a P value was obtained by counting the number of pseudoscores that were greater than the true Granger score and dividing this count by the number of pseudoscores plus 1. P values across all Granger scores were corrected for multiple comparison using the Benjamini–Yekutieli method. Measurements were combined across sessions by taking the mean Granger score and using Fisher's combined probability test to combine the P values.

To facilitate comparisons of neural analyses across brain regions, for each task variable, we visualized effect sizes in a table (for example, Fig. 4f), specifying the effect size for each analysis and brain region. Cells of the table were coloured according to effect size using the same colour map as in the corresponding flatmap. Before summing, the effect sizes for each analysis were normalized to lie in the interval from 0 to 1. This method highlights regions with large effects across all analyses and indicates the extent to which the analyses agree. For a direct comparison of analyses scores, see flatmaps in Extended Data Fig. 2 and scatter plots of scores for analysis pairs in Extended Data Fig. 3.

Each column corresponds to a particular neural analysis and each row a task variable. For each analysis, the colour scale is fixed across all variables to enable comparison of effects between variables. For most analyses, the feedback variable has the largest effect amongst all task variables. The numbers at the top right indicate the fraction of significant regions across all analysed regions.

For a given analysis pair, say encoding and population trajectory, and a variable, say stimulus, all regions for which both analyses were significant are shown as dots in a scatter plot with the amplitudes as coordinates, colored using our canonical region coloring. There are 6 possible analysis pair combinations (rows) and 3 main variables (columns).

a) Firing rates in two regions (CP and MOp) for an example session (eid = af55d16f-0e31-4073-bdb5-26da54914aa2); first 10 sec of recording. b) Directed spectral Granger prediction for an example region pair from this example session as a function of frequency. This is the average across consecutive 10 sec windows of the whole recording, irrespective of trial-structure. The mean Granger prediction across frequencies is the Granger score, used in all other panels. c) Binarised significant Granger score adjacency matrix, canonical region ordering (as in circular graph plot). Note the near-symmetry. d) Symmetry of Granger scores for all significant region pairs, log scale. Correlation scores in panel title. e) Granger scores for region pairs as averages across recordings, edge width proportional to Granger score, black if significant. Only region pairs with at least 2 recordings are shown. f) Graph of e) restricted to incoming/outgoing Granger scores for subsets of regions (Cosmos hierarchical level). g) Significant Granger scores for all region pairs, black dots are individual recordings, gray bars are mean across recordings, ordered by mean. Only region pairs with at least 3 recordings are shown. h) Granger scores in relation to two other connectivity metrics: axonal (axonal projection tracing, Fig. 3 in124) and cartesian (inverse Euclidean distance between centroids of region pairs). Weak but significant correlations (Pearson, Spearman, on top of panels, together with number of directed region pairs for the plot) are found for cartesian/Granger (.25, .33), cartesian/axonal (.14, .35) and Granger/axonal (.12, .23). All results are further listed in this online table.

Decoding analysis as performed for stimulus in Fig. 4, choice in Fig. 5, feedback in Fig. 6, and wheel-speed and wheel-velocity in Fig. 7. No FDR correction has been applied in the bar plots, but the bold ticks indicate those regions that survive FDR0.01 (and are shown in the main figures). Black dots and x's indicate decoding performance on individual sessions; dots are significant at α = 0.05 and x's are insignificant. The bar height is the median of all sessions within that region, and the white dot is the across-session median of the null distribution medians.

a) Fraction of sessions with significant decoding performance for the stimulus variable relative to the null. b) 2d-brain slices of analysis results for the stimulus variable in Fig. 4a–e. Instead of Swanson flat map, here we use 3 sagittal slices with coordinates ML=−1.8 mm, −0.8mm, −0.2mm, and the top view of the dorsal cortex to visualize the representation of task variables across the brain. The locations of sagittal brain slices are optimised to display 252 brain regions. The region acronyms for these slices are listed in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Summary of single-cell analysis for stimulus in Fig. 4, b) choice in Fig. 5, c) feedback in Fig. 6. No FDR correction has been applied in the bar plots; but the red colour labels indicate those regions that survive FDR0.01 (and are shown in the figures in the main paper). Black dots and x's indicate single-cell analysis is done on individual sessions where dots are significant at α = 0.05 and x's are insignificant. The bar height is the mean of all sessions within that region.

a) Example of receptive fields in auditory cortex (AUDv) and auditory thalamus (MG) (d.v.a. stands for degrees of visual angle). Each pixel in the receptive field denotes 8 × 8 d.v.a. The receptive field is computed by averaging spike rate aligned with On and Off stimulus onset for each pixel, from 0 to 100 ms (Methods). b) Example of receptive fields of single neurons in hindbrain. c) Example of receptive fields of single neurons in midbrain.

a) Mean ΔR2 from the right stimulus onset kernel per region in trials with response time below median (left), above median (middle), and all trials (right). b) Mean ΔR2 from the right first wheel movement time kernel per region in trials with response time below median (left), above median (middle), and all trials (right).

Using all well-isolated units and considering regions with at least 20 neurons after pooling across sessions, results in about 446 more neurons (in 9 more regions) than in the canonical set of cells that are used across analyses and shown in the main figures. a-c) Visualizations (through low-dimensional PCA-embedding) of whole-brain population dynamics (combined across all cells, all sessions, all regions) for three task variables (left versus right stimulus, left versus right choice, correct versus wrong feedback. Blue/red dots represent one time-bin of the population response for left/right (or correct/wrong) trials; colour gradient indicates temporal evolution (darker is later). Grey dots: pseudo-trials. d-f) Quantification of the time-resolved distance between opposite trajectories for each variable, based on Euclidean distance (in spikes/second) in the full-dimensional space (dimension = number of cells) for example brain regions, selected based on response magnitude and to illustrate different response profiles. Curves are annotated by region name and number of cells. Scalebars in all panels represent spikes/s/cell. g-i) Summary of variable discriminability for stimulus side, choice side, and feedback type, respectively, by magnitude and latency of response across all recorded brain regions. Diamonds indicate all regions that have statistically significant discrimination (p < 0.01 relative to pseudo-trial controls), and line plot examples are labelled by region name. Dots indicate responses of non-significant regions.

Analysis of the choice variable, with conventions as in Extended Data Fig. 6.

a) Example lick activity for a single session, top trial-averaged, bottom per trial. Animals lick more for correct trials (blue) with a clear rhythm around 10 Hz. Licks were detected using tongue tracking via DLC from side videos. b) Population trajectory distance between correct and incorrect trials for example regions selected manually for visible oscillations, with the number of cells (pooled across sessions) next to the region acronym in the title, aligned to feedback. Right to each panel is the power spectral density of the distance curve, all having a peak around 10 Hz, correlating with licking. c) One example neuron's activity (pid = ‘3b729602-20d5-4be8-a10e-24bde8fc3092', region VPL) to show activity is physiological and not an artefact. Left panel, raster per trial with rhythmic 10 Hz activity, also shown in the middle panel by the power spectral density of the raster, averaged across trials. Right panel, waveforms of this neuron across adjacent traces, illustrating that the spikes we counted are physiological rather than being caused by an electrical artefact. Artefacts could arise, for example, from current flowing through the drinking spout into the Neuropixels probe, which would result in all traces having a strong waveform. We exclude saturated segments prior to analysis and after this found no evidence for such artefacts when sampling various neurons and inspecting the waveforms. d) Single-session population trajectory distance for select regions with trial-averaged lick activity in blue on top. E.g. in MRN a clear correlation with licking was found when restricting the analysis to a single session, while much less so when considering the session-averaged results (not shown).

a) Schematic of within-trial windows in which different regressors in the encoding model apply to firing predictions. b) Additional variance explained in a leave-one-out paradigm by each regressor for the full distribution (left) and zoomed-in to the medians of the distributions (right). Note that the range on the right panel is depicted on the left via dotted lines. c) Statistical tests to measure responsiveness in different task windows. The schematics show the summary of all tests, superimposed on the task timeline. Each row represents a separate Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing firing rates in two different periods over which firing rates were estimated. d) The flat brain map of the fraction of neurons that show significant task response during at least one of the task epochs (test of responsiveness: c), using FDR0.01 to correct for multiple comparisons.

Analysis of the feedback variable, with conventions as in Extended Data Fig. 6.

a) Statistical tests to measure the behavioural correlates of single neurons across all sessions. We compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of neural activity and five behavioural variables (nose position, pupil diameter, paw position, and licks, extracted from behaviour video by using DLC; see Methods). The significance of correlation is estimated by a time-shift test79 (Methods), using FDR0.01 to correct for multiple comparisons. b) The flat brain map of the fraction of neurons significantly correlates with at least one of the movement variables. c) The flat brain map of the fraction of neurons that significantly correlate with one of the movement variables: nose, pupil, paw, tongue.

The spatial resolution of omics analyses is fundamental to understanding tissue biology1,2,3. The capacity to spatially profile DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation4,5, is lacking. Here we introduce a method for whole-genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and the transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.

DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism that modulates gene expression and lineage specification by regulating chromatin structure and accessibility to transcriptional machinery4,5. This epigenetic modification varies dynamically across cell types, developmental stages and environmental conditions6. Abnormal cytosine-methylation patterns are associated with various diseases, including cancer7, autoimmune diseases8 and inflammation9. Furthermore, altered DNA-methylation levels have been observed in ageing tissues10, contributing to biomarkers and predictive clock models for chronological and biological age11.

Despite advances in single-cell methylome analysis5,12, the lack of spatial information regarding intact tissues limits our understanding of gene regulation during tissue development and disease progression. Emerging spatial multi-omics technologies now enable profiling of molecular features in native tissue microenvironments, significantly enhancing our understanding of biological complexity in situ. However, current spatial methods are limited to histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, transcriptomes and selected protein panels1,2,3. Direct spatial mapping of DNA methylation has not been available, leaving this crucial epigenetic layer underexplored.

Here we introduce a technology for spatial joint profiling of the DNA methylome and transcriptome (spatial-DMT) on the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. We used spatial-DMT to profile mouse embryos and postnatal mouse brains. The spatial maps uncovered intricate spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in a native tissue context. Spatial-DMT investigates interactive molecular hierarchies in development, physiology and pathogenesis in a spatially resolved manner.

Spatial-DMT combines microfluidic in situ barcoding1, cytosine deamination conversion12 and high-throughput next-generation sequencing to achieve spatial methylome profiling directly in tissue. The experimental workflow of spatial-DMT is illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, with a step-by-step protocol provided in Extended Data Fig. 1 and detailed reagent information provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4.

a, Spatial-DMT workflow. A tissue section is fixed, permeabilized, treated with HCl treatment, and subjected to Tn5 transposition and reverse transcription (RT). Spatial barcodes are sequentially ligated, after which cDNA and gDNA are separated using streptavidin beads. cDNA is processed using template switching, after which a cDNA library is prepared; gDNA is processed using enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) conversion and splint ligation, after which a library is constructed. b, Chemistry workflow of DNA methylation and RNA library preparation. BCA, barcode A; BCB, barcode B; TSO, template switch oligo. c, Comparison of the number of CpGs per tissue pixel per cell across spatial-DMT and other single-cell DNA-methylation datasets5,10,12,14 (number of cells: mouse muscle stem cells10, n = 260; mouse brain5, n = 103,560; human brain LA12, n = 1,049; human brain SL12, n = 1,920; mouse brain12, n = 491; number of pixels: E11 embryo (10 µm), n = 2,493; E11 embryo 1 (50 μm), n = 1,954; E11 embryo 2 (50 µm), n = 1,947; E13 embryo (50 µm), n = 1,699; P21 brain (20 µm), n = 2,235). The solid line indicates the maximum number of CpGs in the mouse genome, large dashed line indicates 10% of the total number of CpGs and small dashed line indicates 1% of the total number of CpGs. d, Box plots showing CG/CH retention rates in E11 and E13 embryos and P21 brain tissues. Number of pixels are as stated in part c for these datasets. e, Number of genes (left) and UMIs (right) per pixel. For data from previous studies1,2, the numbers of pixels are as follows (left to right): ref. 1, n = 901, 1,789, 1,837, 1,840; ref. 2, n = 2,373, 2,187. For the other datasets, number of pixels are as stated in part c. The box plots show the median (centre line), first and third quartiles (box limits) and 1.5× interquartile range (whiskers). f, Spatial clusters (top) and UMAP analysis (bottom) of DNA methylation (DNAm, left), RNA transcription (RNA, middle) and integrated data (spatial DNAm + RNA (WNN), right) in E11 mouse embryo (pixel size, 50 μm; ROI (red dashed box), 5 × 5 mm2; technical replicates, n = 2). Integrated analysis reveals more-refined spatial clusters and distinct anatomical regions, including brain, spinal cord, heart and craniofacial regions. Scale bars, 500 µm. D, DNA; R, RNA; W, WNN. g, Spatial mapping and joint clustering of DNA methylation and RNA data in E11 facial and forebrain regions (pixel size, 10 μm; ROI (red dashed box), 1 × 1 mm2).

Specifically, hydrochloric acid (HCl) was applied to fixed frozen tissue sections to disrupt the nucleosome structures and remove histones to improve Tn5 transposome accessibility for DNA-methylation profiling13. Next, Tn5 transposition was performed and adapters containing a universal ligation linker were inserted into genomic DNA (gDNA). To further reduce the size of the large gDNA fragment and improve yield, we adopted a multi-tagmentation strategy as previously described13. Specifically, we implemented two rounds of tagmentation to balance DNA yield with experimental time and minimize the risk of RNA degradation. mRNAs were then captured by the biotinylated reverse transcription primer (poly-biotinylated deoxythymidine (dT) primer with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and a universal linker sequence; Supplementary Table 1), followed by reverse transcription to synthesize the complementary DNA (cDNA). Both genomic fragments and cDNA in the tissue were then ligated to spatial barcodes sequentially. In brief, two sets of spatial barcodes (barcodes A1–A50 and B1–B50; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) flowed perpendicularly to each other in the microfluidic channels. They were covalently conjugated to the universal linker through the templated ligation. This results in a two-dimensional grid of spatially barcoded tissue pixels in the region of interest (ROI), each defined by the unique combination of barcodes Ai and Bj (i = 1–50, j = 1–50; barcoded pixels, n = 2,500). Barcoded gDNA fragments and cDNA were then released after reverse crosslinking. Afterwards, the biotin-labelled cDNA was enriched by the streptavidin beads and separated from the gDNA-containing supernatant. Subsequently, cDNA was subjected to a template switching reaction and the cDNA library was constructed (Fig. 1b, right, and Extended Data Fig. 1). gDNA was treated with enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) conversion, splint ligation and DNA library construction (Fig. 1b, left, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods).

To minimize DNA damage during methylome profiling, we used enzymatic methyl-seq, an enzyme-based alternative to bisulfite conversion (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). In this process, modified cytosines (the sum of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) were both oxidized by the ten–eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) protein and protected from deamination by the APOBEC protein, whereas unmodified cytosines were deaminated to uracil. After the conversion, a SLP5 adapter with ten random H (A, C or T) nucleotides was ligated to the 3′ end of the gDNA, adding the other PCR handle12. The gDNA fragments were then amplified using uracil-literate VeraSeq Ultra DNA polymerase. Because C residues on the PCR handle of barcode B were changed to T residues after deamination and PCR, we modified the P7 primer (N70X-HT) by replacing C residues with T residues to complement the A residues on the PCR handle and amplify the fragments. Barcodes have been designed such that no crosstalk under C-to-T deamination is possible.

To demonstrate the ability of spatial-DMT to co-profile DNA methylation and transcription in complex tissues, we profiled mouse embryos on embryonic days 11 (E11) and 13 (E13) and mouse brain on postnatal day 21 (P21). Mouse embryos were profiled at two pixel resolutions: 50 μm for the head and upper body and 10 μm for zoomed-in mapping of the facial and forebrain region. Postnatal mouse brains were profiled at 20 μm pixel resolution. We developed a computational pipeline to preprocess and analyse the data (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Spatial-DMT is reproducible. DNA methylation and RNA expression had high concordance (Pearson's r = 0.9836 for DNA methylation and r = 0.9752 for RNA expression; Methods) between the replicate E11 embryo maps with matched body parts (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) co-embedding of the two replicate spatial maps revealed co-localization of pixels from similar body parts but from different datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Notably, marker genes, including Frem1 (face), Ank3 (brain) and Trim55 (heart), showed spatial expression patterns consistent with their known tissue-specific expression profiles (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f).

DNA-methylation analysis generated 2.8–3.9 billion raw reads per sample for E11 (10 μm and 50 μm), E13 (50 μm) and P21 brain (20 μm) samples (Supplementary Table 5). Low-signal pixels were filtered on the basis of the knee-plot cut-off threshold (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After stringent quality control, 32.2–65.7% of reads (887,671,712–1,882,630,968) were retained, yielding 355,069–753,052 reads per pixel across 1,699–2,493 pixels in the E11, E13 and P21 samples (Supplementary Table 5). On average, 136,639–281,447 CpGs were covered per pixel across E11, E13 and P21 samples (Supplementary Table 5), comparable to previous single-cell DNA-methylation studies of mouse embryos and brain samples5,10,12,14 (Fig. 1c). Duplication rates ranged from approximately 20 to 53% across samples (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The retention rate, defined as the percentage of unconverted cytosines owing to methylation or incomplete conversion12, of mitochondrial DNA was minimal (below 1%; Extended Data Fig. 3c). The CpG retention rates were consistently between 70% and 80% across all samples, whereas the methylation level of non-CpG sites (mCH; H denotes A, C or T) remained low (mCA < 1% in embryos; mCA ≈ 3–4% in the postnatal brain; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3d). The mCA level was higher in the P21 mouse brain, consistent with the known increase in non-CpG methylation in postnatal neuronal tissues5,15. Analysis of the methylation-free linker sequences showed that more than 99% of cytosines were successfully converted, further confirming conversion efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Furthermore, no evidence of RNA contamination, such as poly(A), poly(T) or template switching oligonucleotide sequences, was detected in the DNA-methylation libraries (Extended Data Fig. 3f).

We further assessed the genomic distribution of CpG coverage and found it to be uniformly distributed across genomic regions (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Furthermore, methylation levels across various chromatin states were consistent with known biology and comparable to those reported in published databases5,10,12,14,16 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). For instance, DNA-methylation levels were low at transcription start sites but increased upstream and downstream of these regions (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Collectively, our approach yielded accurate and unbiased profiling of DNA methylation across the genome.

Simultaneously, we generated high-quality RNA data from the same tissue sections, enabling direct comparisons between transcriptional activity and epigenetic states. Specifically, we identified expression of 23,822–28,695 genes in our spatial maps (Supplementary Table 5). At the pixel level, the average number of detected genes per pixel ranges from 1,890 (E11 embryo, 10 μm; 3,596 UMIs) to 4,626 (E11 embryo, 50 μm; 16,709 UMIs), comparable to previous spatial transcriptomic studies of the mouse embryo and brain1,2 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 5). Lower-resolution pixels (for example, 50 μm) captured more UMIs and expressed genes, probably owing to the inclusion of more cells in each pixel.

Mammalian embryogenesis is an intricately programmed process with complex gene-expression dynamics regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, at spatiotemporal scales17. We applied spatial-DMT to produce spatial tissue maps of the DNA methylation and gene expression of the E11 mouse embryo. The DNA methylome and transcriptome define cell identity independently, with pixels clustered by methylation read-outs sampled from variably methylated regions (VMRs)18 and expression levels from variably transcribed genes (Fig. 1f, left and middle, and Extended Data Fig. 4d). The two modalities can be integrated to achieve improved discrimination of intercellular and spatial diversity using a weighted nearest neighbour (WNN) method19 (Fig. 1f, right). Superimposing the WNN clusters over histological images suggests clear correspondence with anatomical structures, for example, craniofacial region (W0), hindbrain–spinal cord (W2) and embryonic heart (W6), consistent with the tissue histology (Fig. 1f, bottom left).

The correlations between single-modality (RNA and DNA methylation) clusters and their integrated WNN clustering results were evaluated (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Each modality captured distinct yet complementary aspects of cellular identity and their integration through WNN analysis yielded clusters with enhanced resolution. RNA-expression profiles had a broader dynamic range, which may result in distinct clustering granularity across modalities. To quantify the relative contributions of each modality to the integrated clusters, we computed modality weights for individual spatial pixels (Extended Data Fig. 4g). This analysis revealed that some clusters were defined predominantly by gene expression (for example, W6, cardiac tissue), whereas others by DNA methylation (for example, W11, craniofacial region). Collectively, these results highlight the advantage of spatial multi-omics integration in resolving cellular heterogeneity missed by single-modality analyses.

We examined VMR methylations specific to the brain (W2), craniofacial (W0) and heart (W6) regions (Fig. 1f) and neighbouring gene expression (Fig. 2a,b, cluster W2; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b, cluster W0; and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b, cluster W6). Spatial cluster-specific gene expression is frequently associated with low DNA methylation at the neighbouring VMRs, as exemplified by signature genes Runx2, Mapt, and Trim55, which mark the craniofacial regions (jaw and upper nasal), the brain and spinal cord, and the heart, respectively (Fig. 2c and see Extended Data Figs. 5a, 6c and 7c for additional signature gene examples). Testing the epigenetically regulated genes from each cluster for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment identified the developmental process related to the anatomical structures (Extended Data Figs. 5b, 6d and 7d). Although the canonical negative correlations between DNA methylation and RNA expression have been observed in many genes, we also identified genes, for example, Ank3, Atp11c, Cyfip2, Lmln and Khdrbs2, for which expression is positively correlated with the methylation levels of the associated VMRs (Fig. 2d). For instance, Ank3, primarily located at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems20, had high levels of expression and DNA methylation in the brain region (Fig. 2c). The positive correlations between DNA methylation and RNA expression have been documented at enhancers21, gene bodies22 and Polycomb targets23, suggesting a complex mechanism of DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation, contingent on its interaction with transcriptional factor (TF) binding and histone modifications.

The y axis shows the enrichment P values from Homer one-sided hypergeometric test of TF motifs and the x axis shows the average gene expression of the corresponding TFs.

To directly assess the influence of cell-type-specific methylation on TF binding, we performed motif enrichment analysis on differentially hypomethylated VMRs and examined the gene expression of each TF gene. Our findings uncovered a relationship between the expression of TFs and the DNA methylation at their binding sites. For example, TFs associated with heart development, Hand2, Tbx20 and Meis1, were expressed in cluster W6, the corresponding hypomethylated VMRs of which were enriched in the binding motifs of these TFs (Fig. 2e, right). Similar sets of tissue-specific TFs are identified for other embryo structures, for example, Ebf1 and Pbx1 in the brain and spinal cord and Sox9, Ebf1 and Zeb2 in the craniofacial region (Fig. 2e). Notably, Ebf1 was expressed and its binding motif was also enriched across all three tissue regions (Fig. 2e). EBF1 was reported as an interaction partner for TET2 and was suggested as a sequence-specific mechanism for regulating DNA methylation in cancer24.

To precisely resolve the fine structure of transcriptional regulation in the craniofacial and forebrain regions of the E11 embryo, we used a 10 μm pixel size microfluidic chip to produce a spatial map with near single-cell resolution (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Integration of our spatial dataset with a single-cell reference25 revealed a strong concordance between the two datasets (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). For example, W11 maps to neuroectoderm and glial cells in the single-cell reference, W7 to CNS neurons, W5 to olfactory sensory neurons and W10 to epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Cell-type deconvolution using the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference25 identified distinct clusters that correspond precisely to known anatomical structures of the developing mouse brain. Notably, two spatially defined clusters, W7 and W11, captured key telencephalic compartments. W11 was enriched for telencephalon progenitors in the ventricular zone of the pallium, a neurogenic niche characterized by active cell division and proliferation, whereas W7 corresponded to γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) cortical interneurons localized in the mantle zone, where newborn neurons migrate, accumulate and differentiate to establish cortical architecture26 (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 8d). GO enrichment analysis further supported these regional identities, highlighting biological processes associated with neurogenesis and progenitor proliferation in W11, and neuron projection and migration in W7 (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Moreover, the cell-type lineage tree constructed from the scRNA-seq reference confirmed the developmental trajectory, positioning telencephalon progenitors as direct precursors to GABAergic cortical interneurons25. Beyond the forebrain, our spatial analysis also resolved refined sensory structures in the developing olfactory system (cluster W5 and W10; Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Sensory neurons were notably enriched in W5 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), spatially localized adjacent to the forebrain. This spatial pattern aligns closely with the established developmental trajectory of the olfactory system, in which olfactory sensory neurons progressively form connections with the forebrain as embryogenesis progresses27. Together, these findings provide a high-resolution view of neural and sensory system formation, underscoring the power of spatial-DMT in resolving intricate anatomical structures and capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics.

Mammalian embryogenesis is a precisely timed process with dynamic DNA methylation and gene expression underlying cell differentiation and tissue development16. By using pseudotime and spatial-DMT analyses on embryos of two different gestational ages (E11 and E13), we can investigate the dynamics of DNA methylation, gene expression and their interactions at both spatial and temporal scales. We first analysed the developing brain, focusing on the differentiation trajectory from oligodendrocyte progenitors to premature oligodendrocytes. Spatial mapping of the pseudotime of each pixel revealed the organized migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from the subpallium to the pallium during oligodendrogenesis (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5c). This pseudotemporal process is associated with coupled DNA methylation and gene expression in different patterns. For example, loss of DNA methylation can be both associated with gene activation (for example, Nrg3, an oligodendrocyte marker28) and silencing (for example, Pdgfra, an oligodendrocyte precursor marker29; Fig. 3b, red boxes). The presence of both the positive and the negative couplings between DNA methylation and gene expression is aligned with the above comparisons across spatial pixels, reinforcing the regulatory diversity of mouse embryogenesis and oligodendrogenesis29.

To further illustrate the temporal molecular dynamics of embryonic development, we performed spatial mapping of the E13 mouse embryo (Extended Data Fig. 9a). First, we validated our RNA dataset by integrating it with a published spatial ATAC–RNA (ATAC, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin) reference2, which revealed a strong concordance (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Co-clustering the two datasets identified 11 distinct cluster populations, each corresponding to the histological location in both samples (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). By integrating spatial data from E11 and E13 embryos (Fig. 3c,d), we identified genes upregulated in E13 (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9b,d, left) associated with notable loss of DNA methylation (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d, right). These genes are implicated in the corresponding tissue functions. For example, Usp9x, Ank3 and Shank2 are critically involved in neuronal development, synaptic organization, morphogenesis and transmission30,31,32 (Fig. 3e,f). Ctnna1, Pecam1 and Lamb1 are pivotal for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity33, vascular development34 and cardiac tissue structuring35, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). Functional analysis of upregulated genes further corroborated their association with biological processes, for example, synapse organization, neuron projection organization and dendritic spine morphogenesis in the brain (Fig. 3g), and sphingolipid metabolic processes in the heart (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Our tissue map data more precisely timed these gene and pathway activations to a specific stage of embryo development, tissue location and shed light on their epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Notably, besides regulators of tissue development, some DNA methylation writers36, readers37 and eraser enzymes38, for example, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Mecp2 and Tet1, showed higher expression in the E13 embryo, suggesting elevated biochemical activity that drove the global DNA methylation dynamics (Fig. 3h).

mCH methylation, particularly mCA, is uniquely abundant in the brain5,15. To evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of non-CpG cytosine methylation, we applied spatial-DMT to the cortical and hippocampal regions of a P21 mouse brain (Fig. 4a). Initial analysis of global mCA and mCG levels revealed relatively low methylation in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis (CA)1/2 and CA3 regions, compared with the cortex (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

These plots demonstrate how differential methylation at CpG and CpA sites correlates with changes in gene expression, illustrating the complex regulatory landscape across different brain regions. f–h, Spatial mapping of CpG (left) and CpA (middle) methylation and RNA-expression levels (right) for selected genes in different brain regions.

The spatial distribution of methylome and transcriptome clusters matched anatomical structures shown by the histology image, reflecting the arealization of this brain region (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Expression of known cell-specific marker genes is spatially distributed in regions in which these cell types were enriched. For instance, Prox1, a TF crucial for neurogenesis and the maintenance of granule cell identity39, was prominently expressed in the DG (Fig. 4f, right). Satb1, which has a role in cortical neuron differentiation and layer formation40, was strongly enriched in the cerebral cortex (Extended Data Fig. 10b, right). Bcl11b, a TF essential for neuronal progenitor cell differentiation41, demonstrated elevated expression in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 10c, right).

To elucidate the regulatory roles of mCG and mCA on gene transcription, we compared the two modifications for the signature genes of each cluster against all other clusters combined. By correlating the modification levels with gene expression, we identified genes potentially regulated by mCG, mCA or both (Fig. 4c–e). Prox1 and Bcl11b expression was significantly associated with both mCG and mCA (Fig. 4c,f and Extended Data Fig. 10c), broadly marking the DG and CA1/2 regions, respectively. By contrast, Ntrk3, a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for nervous system function42, was highly expressed in the hippocampal CA1/2 and DG regions, correlating primarily with mCG levels but not with mCA (Fig. 4d,g). Similarly, Satb1 expression in the cortex was strongly correlated with mCG but not with mCA levels (Extended Data Fig. 10b). The silencing of Cux1, a TF involved in neuronal development and function43, had a negative correlation with CA and CG hypermethylation in the CA3 region. By contrast, in the CA1/2 region, Cux1 expression showed a negative correlation only with CA hypermethylation and seemed independent of mCG levels (Fig. 4e,h). Across both sequence contexts, negative correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression are more prevalent than positive ones, highlighting the predominantly repressive nature of these epigenetic modifications (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Collectively, mCG and mCA regulate transcription in a gene-specific manner, jointly defining the cell identity across cell types and brain regions.

Further analysis of neuronal and glial populations revealed cell-type- and region-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic variation. For example, Syt1 and Rbfox3 are broadly expressed across neurons in all cortical layers (Supplementary Fig. 3a). By contrast, Cux2, Cux1 and Satb2 were highly expressed in upper-layer neurons, whereas Bcl11b was enriched in the deeper cortical layers (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Oligodendrocytes (Mbp and Plp1) and fibrous astrocytes (Gfap) were specifically enriched in the corpus callosum and hippocampal regions (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). To further resolve cell identities, we integrated our spatial-DMT dataset with a reference scRNA-seq dataset44 to associate spatial clusters with previously defined cell types. For instance, W0, W3 and W5 were identified as oligodendrocytes, DG granule neurons and telencephalon-projecting excitatory neurons, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Aggregated gene-expression and DNA-methylation levels across pixels in each cluster were highly correlated with the corresponding scRNA-seq transcriptomes44 (Supplementary Fig. 4d) and single-cell DNA methylome profiles5 (Supplementary Fig. 4e), as illustrated by W3 (DG) and W5 (CA1) (Fig. 4b, right). Cell-type deconvolution using the same scRNA-seq reference44 revealed spatial organization of diverse cell types, consistent with known brain anatomy (Supplementary Fig. 4f). For example, cortical excitatory neurons showed expected laminar distribution: TEGLU7, TEGLU8, TEGLU4 and TEGLU3 were enriched in layers 2/3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. In the hippocampus, TEGLU24 and TEGLU23 mapped to CA1/2 and CA3 regions, whereas in granule neurons, DGGRC2 localized to the DG. Furthermore, DEGLU1 was enriched in the thalamic region. All cell types were mapped to expected brain anatomical regions in agreement with the scRNA-seq reference44. These observations underscore the robustness of spatial-DMT in resolving complex tissue architectures and simultaneously profiling the epigenome and transcriptome with their spatial context, which remains challenging for conventional anatomical and single-cell approaches.

The spatially resolved methylation landscape enables the identification of subtle, region-specific epigenetic variations that may otherwise be undetected. To illustrate this, we performed regional differential methylation analysis, comparing the ventricular and mantle zone of the hindbrain–spinal cord (Fig. 5a). This analysis identified differential methylation at promoters and enhancers specific to neural progenitor cells, as shown by the enrichment of corresponding methylated histone H3 K4 (H3K4me1). These differential methylated loci co-localized with enhancers functionally implicated in brain and neural tube development (mEnhA9), which are associated with TF binding sites crucial for neuronal differentiation, including for the TFs FOXO4 (ref. 45), NEUROG2 (ref. 46) and HOXC9 ref. 47).

Spatial methylation profiles may reveal subtle differences between distantly located pixels in the same WNN cell cluster. We examined two W7 pixel groups located in the forebrain and spinal cord, respectively (Fig. 5b). In the forebrain, regions with loss of methylation were enriched for binding sites of FOXI1, TFs crucial for auditory development48. By contrast, spinal-cord-specific hypomethylation correlated with occupancy by TLX1, a TF essential for spinal cord maturation and neuronal differentiation49. These findings demonstrate that spatial-DMT can resolve subtle epigenetic heterogeneity across distinct tissue microenvironments.

Besides capturing regional TF-mediated cell state differences, spatial-DMT enables the analysis of diverse cell traits through other methylation-based features. For example, partially methylated domains (PMDs), which lose methylation over successive mitotic divisions, serve as indicators of mitotic activity50. By spatially mapping PMD methylation in E11 and E13 embryos (Fig. 5c,d), we identified distinct regional patterns. For instance, regions such as the forebrain and hindbrain–spinal cord had higher PMD methylation, whereas embryonic heart tissue demonstrated lower PMD methylation levels, reflecting active cardiogenesis at these developmental stages51 (Fig. 5c,d). Notably, we observed spatial gradients in PMD methylation, decreasing from the centre to the periphery in the heart, and from the mantle to the ventricular zone in the forebrain and hindbrain–spinal cord. These gradients potentially reflect the spatial organization of progenitor cells and their differentiation trajectories. In the P21 brain (Fig. 5e), cortical layers displayed higher PMD methylation, consistent with reduced proliferative capacity typical of differentiated neurons52. By contrast, the DG has comparatively lower PMD methylation, consistent with the presence of neural stem and progenitor cells in the subgranular zone that continue to undergo mitotic division and neurogenesis53.

Finally, the spatially resolved variations in the methylome and transcriptome can complement each other in distinguishing differentiated cell states (Fig. 1f, left and middle). Despite originating from the same RNA-defined clusters (R3), DNA methylation-defined cluster 0 (D0) and 4 (D4) cells had distinct subpopulations when stratified by their VMRs. Motif enrichment analysis of low-methylation sites in D0 and D4 identified regulatory elements associated with facial and cardiac morphogenesis (Fig. 5f), whereas corresponding gene-expression changes were limited (Fig. 5g). This may reflect epigenetically primed subpopulations that share similar transcriptional states. Together, these findings highlight the power of spatial-DMT in delineating cell identity beyond the resolution of transcriptomic analysis alone.

Understanding how epigenetic regulation is spatially organized in tissues remains a major challenge. Although single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptomic technologies have revealed diverse regulatory architectures in both health and disease4,5,16, they require tissue dissociation, disrupting the native context. Here we developed spatial-DMT, a pioneering spatial multi-omics technology that enables simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same intact tissue sections, preserving cellular and anatomical architectures.

Spatial-DMT generated high-quality data, with strong reproducibility across technical replicates and concordance with established single-cell and spatial transcriptomic references. When applied to mouse embryos at E11 and E13, it revealed methylome dynamics during embryogenesis. In the postnatal brain, it resolved the neuronal mCH landscape, consistent with elevated mCA levels in mature neurons5. With 10 μm resolution, spatial-DMT approaches single-cell granularity, enabling precise delineation of fine tissue structures and region-specific epigenetic features that are typically obscured by tissue dissociation. Our data indicate that gene expression may be differentially influenced by mCG and mCA for different cell types in a spatially restricted manner, potentially owing to the distinct genomic distribution of these methylation marks. Although the observed associations are correlative, they offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between regulatory elements on gene expression. This integrative data analysis also demonstrated that each modality captures distinct yet complementary aspects of cellular states, enhancing cell state differentiation beyond what is achievable with single-modality approaches. This may reflect regulatory redundancy, in which distinct epigenetic mechanisms converge to produce similar transcriptional outcomes. Conversely, the opposite scenario is equally plausible—transcriptional states may diverge despite similar epigenetic landscapes, as epigenetic regulation represents only one layer influencing gene expression. As a result, spatial‐DMT offers a cost-effective strategy for high-resolution, unbiased genome-wide methylome analysis.

Future development of spatial-DMT may incorporate additional molecular modalities, including chromatin conformation (HiC), accessibility (ATAC-seq), histone modifications (CUT&Tag), metabolome (mass spectrometry imaging) and surface proteins (CITE-seq), to enhance the resolution of gene regulatory mechanisms in situ. The current enzymatic approach does not distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, this limitation may be overcome by using emerging methods that enable simultaneous measurement of the full spectrum of cytosine base modifications54. Coupling our method with long-read sequencing technologies, such as Nanopore or PacBio, could simplify detection and improve coverage of epigenetic modifications. Adaptation of the protocol to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens would broaden its clinical use, whereas optimizing tagmentation and data-processing pipelines will further improve sensitivity and interpretability. The development of advanced spatial computational deconvolution strategies is essential to resolve signals from lower-resolution pixels, minimize potential biases and enhance biological interpretability. Broader application across tissues, developmental stages and species will further establish the generalizability of spatial-DMT for spatial multi-omics profiling in both basic and translational research.

In summary, spatial-DMT advances spatial omics analyses by enabling the simultaneous mapping of DNA methylation and transcription in the native tissue context. This approach provides a powerful framework for exploring epigenetic regulation, facilitates the discovery of methylation biomarkers, deepens our understanding of disease mechanisms and benefits both fundamental and translational research.

Mouse C57 embryo sagittal frozen sections (MF-104-11-C57 and MF-104-13-C57) were purchased from Zyagen. Freshly collected E11 or E13 mouse embryos were snap frozen in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compounds and sectioned at 7–10 μm thickness. Tissue sections were collected on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 63478-AS).

The moulds for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices were fabricated using standard photolithography. The manufacturer's guidelines were followed to spin-coat SU-8-negative photoresist (Microchem, SU-2025 and SU-2010) onto a silicon wafer (WaferPro, C04004). The heights of the features were about 20 and 50 μm for 20- and 50-μm-wide devices, respectively. PDMS microfluidic devices were fabricated using the SU-8 moulds. We mixed the curing and base agents in a 1:10 ratio and poured the mixture onto the moulds. After degassing for 30 min, the mixture was cured at 66–70 °C for 2–16 h. Solidified PDMS was extracted from the moulds for further use. The detailed protocol for the fabrication and preparation of the PDMS device can be found in our previous research24.

Frozen tissue slides were quickly thawed for 1 min in a 37 °C incubator. The tissue was fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS containing 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) for 10 min and quenched with 1.25 M glycine for another 5 min at room temperature. After fixation, tissue was washed twice with 1 ml of DPBS–RNase inhibitor and cleaned with deionized H2O.

The tissue was subsequently permeabilized with 100 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor for 30 min at room temperature, then washed twice with 200 μl DPBS–RNase inhibitor for 5 min each. After permeabilization, the tissue was treated with 100 μl of 0.1 N HCl for 5 min at room temperature to disrupt histones from the chromatin, then washed twice with 200 μl of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20) plus 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 50 μl of transposition mixture (5 μl of assembled transposome, 16.5 μl of 1× DPBS, 25 μl of 2× Tagmentation buffer, 0.5 μl of 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl of 10% Tween 20, 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) and 1.87 μl nuclease-free water) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After 60 min incubation, the first round of transposition mixture was removed and a second round of 50 μl of fresh transposition mixture was added and incubated for another 60 min at 37 °C. To stop the transposition, 200 μl of 40 mM EDTA with 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor was added with incubation for 5 min at room temperature. After that, 200 μl 1× NEB3.1 buffer plus 1% RNase inhibitor was used to wash the tissue for 5 min at room temperature. The tissue was then washed again with 200 μl of DPBS–RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature before proceeding with the in situ reverse transcription reaction.

For the in situ reverse transcription, the following mixture was added: 12.5 μl 5× reverse transcription buffer, 4.05 μl RNase-free water, 0.4 μl RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics), 1.25 μl 50% PEG-8000, 3.1 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 6.2 μl 200 U μl−1 Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 25 μl 0.5× DPBS–RNase inhibitor and 10 μl 100 μM reverse transcription primer (biotinylated-dT oligo). The tissue was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then at 45 °C for 90 min in a humidified container. After the reverse transcription reaction, tissue was washed with 1× NEB3.1 buffer plus 1% RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature.

For in situ ligation with the first barcode (barcode A), the first PDMS chip was covered at the tissue ROI. For alignment purposes, a 10× objective (KEYENCE BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope, BZ-X800 Viewer Software) was used to take the bright-field image. The PDMS device and tissue slide were clamped tightly with a custom acrylic clamp. Barcode A was first annealed with ligation linker 1 by mixing 10 μl of 100 μM ligation linker, 10 μl of 100 μM individual barcode A and 20 μl of 2× annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5–8.0, 100 mM NaCl2 and 2 mM EDTA). For each channel, 5 μl of ligation master mixture was prepared with 4 μl of ligation mixture (27 μl T4 DNA ligase buffer, 0.9 μl RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics), 5.4 μl 5% Triton X-100, 11 μl T4 DNA ligase and 71.43 μl RNase-free water) and 1 μl of each annealed DNA barcode A (A1–A50, 25 μM). Vacuum was applied to flow the ligation master mixture into the 50 channels of the device and cover the ROI of the tissue, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified container. Then the PDMS chip and clamp were removed after washing the tissue with 1× NEB 3.1 buffer for 5 min. The slide was then washed with deionized water and dried using compressed air.

For in situ ligation with the second barcode (barcode B), the second PDMS chip was covered at the ROI and a bright-field image was taken with the 10× objective. An acrylic clamp was applied to clamp the PDMS and tissue slide together. Annealing of barcode B (B1–B50, 25 μM) and preparation of the ligation mixture are the same as barcode A. The whole device was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified container. The PDMS chip and clamp were then removed, and the slide was washed with deionized water and dried using compressed air. A bright-field image was then taken for further alignment.

For tissue lysis, the ROI was digested with 100 μl of the reverse crosslinking mixture (0.4 mg ml−1 proteinase K, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 1% SDS) at 58–60 °C for 2 h in a humidified container. The lysate was then collected in a 0.2-ml PCR tube and incubated on a 60 °C shaker overnight.

For gDNA and cDNA separation, the lysate was purified with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit and eluted with 100 μl nuclease-free water. Next, 40 μl of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were used and washed three times with 1× B&W buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (50 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2,000 μl 5 M NaCl, 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 50 μl 10% Tween 20 and 7,890 μl nuclease-free water). After washing, beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× B&W buffer (50 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2,000 μl 5 M NaCl, 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA and 2,940 μl nuclease-free water) containing 2 μl of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor, then mixed with the gDNA–cDNA lysate and allowed to bind for 1 h with agitation at room temperature. A magnet was then used to separate the beads, which bind to the cDNA that contains dT, from the supernatant that contains the gDNA.

Supernatant (200 μl) was collected from the above separation process for further methylated gDNA detection and library construction. Next, 1 ml of DNA binding buffer was added to the 200 μl supernatant and purified with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit again, then eluted in 84 μl (3 × 28 μl) nuclease-free water. The NEBNext enzymatic methyl-seq conversion module (EM-seq) was then used to detect methylated DNA in the sample by converting unmethylated cytosines to uracil; the manufacturer's guidelines were followed. Then, 28 μl of DNA sample was aliquoted into each PCR tube, TET2 reaction mixture (10 μl TET2 reaction buffer containing reconstituted TET2 reaction buffer supplement, 1 μl oxidation supplement, 1 μl DTT, 1 μl oxidation enhancer and 4 μl TET2) was added to the DNA sample on ice. In brief, 5 μl of diluted 1:1,300 of 500 mM Fe (II) solution was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermocycler. After the reaction, the sample was transferred to ice and 1 μl of stop reagent from the kit was added. The sample was then incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. TET2 converted DNA was then purified with 90 μl of solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads and eluted with 16 μl nuclease-free water. The thermocycler was preheated to 85 °C, 4 μl formamide was added to the converted DNA and incubated for 10 min at 85 °C in the preheated thermocycler. After the reaction, the heated sample was immediately placed on ice to maintain the open chromatin structure, then reagents from the kit were added (68 μl nuclease-free water, 10 μl APOBEC reaction buffer, 1 μl BSA and 1 μl APOBEC) to deaminate unmethylated cytosines to uracil for 3 h at 37 °C in a thermocycler. Deaminated DNA was then cleaned up using 100 μl (1:1 ratio) of SPRI beads and eluted in 20 μl nuclease-free water.

The gDNA tube was heat-shocked for 3 min at 95 °C and immediately put on ice for 2 min. Then, 10 μl of 0.75 μM pre-annealed Splint Ligate P5 (SLP5) adapter was added. This adapter was diluted from a 12 μM stock, which contained 6 μl of 100 μΜ SLP5RC oligo, 8.4 μl of 100 μΜ SLS5ME-A-H10 oligo, 5 μl of 10× T4 RNA Ligase Buffer and 30.6 μl nuclease-free water in a PCR tube that was incubated at 95 °C for 1 min, then gradually cooled by −0.1 °C s−1 to 10 °C on a thermocycler. Next, 80 μl of ligation master mixture was added to the gDNA tube at room temperature. The mixture contained 40 μl preheated 50% PEG-8000, 12.5 μl SCR buffer (666 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 132 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water), 10 μl of 100 mM DTT, 10 μl of 10 mM ATP, 1.25 μl of 10,000 U ml−1 T4 PNK and 6.25 μl of 400,000 U ml−1 T4 ligase. The splint ligation mixture was then splinted into five 0.2-ml PCR tubes, 20 μl per tube. The tubes were shaken at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and spun down, then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by 20 min at 65 °C to inactivate the ligase. For splint ligation indexing PCR, 80 μl of the PCR reaction mixture was mixed in each splint ligated tube. The mixture contained 20 μl 5× VeraSeq GC Buffer, 4 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 3 μl VeraSeq Ultra Enzyme, 5 μl 20× EvaGreen dye, 2 μl of 10 μM N501 primer and 2 μl of 10 μM N70X-HT primer (Supplementary Table 1). The mixture was then aliquoted into a clean PCR tube with 50 μl volume and run on a thermocycler with the setting below, 98 °C for 1 min, then cycling at 98 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, for 13–19 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 10 s. The reaction was removed once the quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal began to plateau. The amplified PCR products were pooled and purified with a 0.8× volume ratio of SPRI beads (bead-to-sample ratio) and the completed DNA library was eluted in 15 μl nuclease-free water.

The separated beads containing cDNA were used for cDNA library generation. In brief, 400 μl of 1× B&W buffer with 0.05% Tween 20 was used to wash the beads twice. Then, the beads were washed once with 400 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min at room temperature. Streptavidin beads with bound cDNA molecules were placed on a magnetic rack and washed once with 250 μl nuclease-free water before being resuspended in a template switching oligonucleotide solution (44 μl 5× Maxima reverse transcription buffer, 44 μl of 20% Ficoll PM-400 solution, 22 μl of dNTPs, 5.5 μl of 100 mM template switch oligo, 11 μl Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase, 5.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) and 88 μl nuclease-free water). Resuspended beads were then incubated for 30 min with agitation at room temperature and for 90 min at 42 °C, with gentle agitation. After the reaction, beads were washed with 400 μl of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 0.1% Tween 20 and washed without resuspension in 250 μl nuclease-free water. Water was removed on the magnetic rack and the beads were resuspended in the PCR solution (100 μl of 2× Kappa Master mix, 8.8 μl of 10 μM primers 1 and 2 and 92.4 μl nuclease-free water). Next, the beads were mixed well and 50 μl of the PCR mixture was split into four 0.2-ml PCR tubes. The PCR programme was run as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and cycling at 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 3 min, for a total of five cycles, followed by 4 °C on hold. After five cycles of PCR reaction, four PCR tubes were placed on a magnetic rack and 50 μl of the clear PCR solution was transferred to four optical-grade qPCR tubes, adding 2.5 μl of 20× Evagreen dye to each tube. The sample was run on a qPCR machine with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, cycling at 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 3 min, for 13–17 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The reaction was removed once the qPCR signal began to plateau. The amplified PCR product was purified with a 0.8× volume ratio of SPRI beads and eluted in 20 μl nuclease-free water.

A Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit was used for cDNA library preparation. In brief, 2 μl (2 ng) of purified cDNA (1 ng μl−1), 10 μl Tagment DNA buffer, 5 μl Amplicon Tagment mix and 3 μl nuclease-free water were mixed and incubated at 55 °C for 5 min. Then, 5 μl NT buffer was added to stop the reaction with incubation at room temperature for 5 min. PCR master mix (15 μl 2× N.P.M. Master mix, 1 μl of 10 μM P5 primer (N501) and 1 μl of 10 μM indexed P7 primer (N70X) and 8 μl nuclease-free water) was added. The PCR reaction was run with the following programme: 95 °C for 30 s, cycling at 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min, for a total of 12 cycles. The PCR product was then purified with a 0.7× ratio of SPRI beads and eluted in 15 μl nuclease-free water to obtain the cDNA library.

An Agilent Bioanalyzer D5000 ScreenTape was used to determine the size distribution and concentration of the library before sequencing. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and NovaSeq X Plus system (150 bp paired-end mode).

For RNA-sequencing data, Read 2 was processed to extract barcode A, barcode B and the UMIs. Using the STARsolo pipeline56 (v.2.7.10b), these processed data were mapped to the mouse genome reference (mm10). This step generated a gene matrix that captures both gene-expression and spatial-positioning information, encoded through the combination of barcodes A and B. The gene matrix was then imported into R for downstream spatial transcriptomic analysis using Seurat package (v.5.1.0)57.

For DNA-methylation data, adaptor sequences were trimmed before demultiplexing the FASTQ files using the combination of barcodes A and B. We used the BISulfite-seq CUI Toolkit (BISCUIT) (v.0.3.14)58 to align the DNA sequences to the mouse reference genome (mm10). Methylation levels at individual CG and CH sites were stored as continuous values between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of methylated reads after quality filtering. These processed CG–CH files were then analysed independently using the MethSCAn pipeline18 to identify VMRs59, defined as fused genome intervals with methylation-level variance in the top 2%. We used default parameter settings when running MethSCAn, and the MethSCAn filter min-sites parameter was determined from the read coverage knee plot (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The methylation levels and residuals of VMRs were then imported into R for downstream DNA-methylation analysis.

We mapped the exact location of pixels on the bright-field tissue image using a custom Python script (https://github.com/zhou-lab/Spatial-DMT-2024/tree/main/Data_preprocess/Image), before removing additional empty barcodes on the basis of read-count thresholds determined by the knee plot (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Clustering and data visualization were conducted using R in RStudio.

For RNA data, we used the SCTtransform function in the Seurat package (v.5.1.0), built using a regularized negative binomial model, for normalization and variance stabilization. Dimensionality reduction was performed using RunPCA function with the SCTtransformed assay. We then constructed the nearest-neighbour graph using the first 30 principal components with the FindNeighbors function and identified clusters with the default Leiden method in the FindClusters function. Finally, a UMAP embedding was computed using the same principal components with RunUMAP function.

Owing to the inherent sparsity of DNA-methylation data, it is impractical to analyse methylation status solely at the individual CpG level. Binary information at sparse loci cannot be used directly to construct a feature matrix suitable for downstream analysis. In our study, we adopted the VMR framework, which divides the genome into variable-sized tiles and calculates the average methylation level across CpGs in each tile for each pixel18. This approach results in a continuous-valued matrix, in which rows correspond to pixels and columns represent genomic tiles, with values ranging from 0 to 1. VMR methylation levels and residuals were then imputed using the iterative principal component analysis approach as suggested in the MethSCAn instructions. Initially, missing residual values were replaced with zero and missing methylation levels were replaced with the average values for that VMR interval. The principal component analysis approach was iteratively applied until updated values stabilized to a threshold. The imputed residual matrix for VMRs was then imported into the existing Seurat object as another modality. Similar to the RNA-clustering pipeline, dimensionality was reduced using the RunPCA function. The first ten principal components from the residual matrix were used for clustering and UMAP embedding.

To visualize clusters in their spatial locations, the SpatialDimPlot function was used after clustering on the basis of gene expression or VMR residuals. UMAP embedding was visualized with the DimPlot function. The FindMarkers function was applied to select genes and VMRs that were differentially expressed or methylated for each cluster. For spatial mapping of individual VMR methylation levels or gene expression, we applied the smoothScoresNN function from the FigR package60. The SpatialFeaturePlot function was then used to visualize VMR methylation levels and gene expression across all pixels. To illustrate the relationships between clustering results from different modalities, we generated the confusion matrix and alluvial diagram using the pheatmap and ggalluvial R package61.

To integrate spatial DNA methylation and RNA data, WNN analysis in Seurat was applied using the FindMultiModalNeighbors function19. On the basis of the WNN graph, clustering, UMAP embedding and spatial mapping of identified clusters were performed for integrated visualization.

For the integration of spatial transcriptomics data of E11 and E13 mouse embryos, the top 3,000 integration features were selected, followed by the use of PrepSCTIntegration and IntegrateData functions to generate an integrated dataset. Similarly, to integrate with public single-cell transcriptomic data25,44, we first identified anchors using the FindIntegrationAnchors function in Seurat, followed by data integration using the IntegrateData function. To integrate DNA-methylation data, common VMRs between both developmental stages were obtained and the integrated CCA method from the IntegrateLayers function was used to join the methylation data from the two developmental stages. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare the methylation levels and gene-expression differences between the two time points.

To perform TF motif enrichment, we first used the MethSCAn diff function on distinct groups of cells to identify differentially methylated VMRs on the basis of the clustering assignment. The HOMER62 findMotifsGenome function was then applied to analyse the enrichment of known TF motifs using its default database. We followed the same parameter settings used in MethSCAn, with motif lengths of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

Enrichment analysis of individual CpGs in the differential regions (Fig. 5a,b) was performed using knowYourCG (https://github.com/zhou-lab/knowYourCG), which provides a comprehensive annotation database for each CpG, including chromatin states, TF binding sites, motif occurrences, PMD annotations and more. To avoid inflated odds ratios for high-coverage data, genomic uniformity was quantified using fold enrichment, defined as the ratio of observed overlaps to expected overlaps. The expected number of overlaps was calculated as: (number of CpGs sequenced × number of CpGs in the chromatin state feature)/total number of CpGs in the genome.

Correlation analysis was performed for different clusters. We first used the findOverlaps function in GenomicRanges package (v.4.4)63 to map VMRs to overlapped genes. Then, the Pearson correlation test was applied to obtain the correlation between mapped genes and corresponding VMRs. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust all P values.

GO enrichment analysis was conducted using the enrichGO function from clusterProfiler package64 (v.4.2). For GO enrichment in the comparative analysis of E11 and E13 mouse embryos, the FindMarkers function in Seurat package was used to find differential genes and VMRs in the same cluster from integrated data across two developmental stages. Differentially upregulated genes (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05) with demethylated VMRs were used for the GO analysis.

The diagram illustrates the chemistry workflow for simultaneous DNA methylation and RNA library preparation in Spatial-DMT. Initially, tissue sections are fixed and permeabilized to preserve tissue architecture and molecular integrity while allowing reagent penetration. Following permeabilization, sections undergo HCl treatment to disrupt the protein structure and remove nucleosome histones to improve Tn5 transposome accessibility. Next, Tn5 transposition integrates adapters into genomic DNA, and in situ reverse transcription (RT) converts mRNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) directly within the tissue. Subsequently, Barcode A and Barcode B are sequentially ligated to label and spatially encode DNA and mRNA molecules. Streptavidin bead separation then facilitates the differential enrichment and processing of nucleic acids: cDNA molecules undergo a template switching reaction, followed by Nextera XT library preparation, while genomic DNA (gDNA) is subjected to NEBNext EM-seq conversion for methylation detection, splint ligation, and subsequent library construction.

a, Correlation analysis between replicates based on DNA methylation (left) and RNA transcription (right) data from E11 embryo samples with two-sided Pearson correlation test. b, c, Integrative analysis (b) and spatial distribution (c) of clusters from two independent Spatial-DMT experiments using E11 embryo samples. d-f, Spatial mapping of DNA methylation and RNA expression levels for selected marker genes in facial (d), brain (e), and heart (f) regions from two independent Spatial-DMT experiments using E11 embryo samples.

a, Barcode rank plots showing the distribution of reads per spatial barcode for E11, E13 embryos, and P21 brain samples. Valid barcodes are shown in blue, and filtered barcodes are shown in orange. b, Box plots, where the central line represents the median, the lower and upper hinges indicate the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the hinges, showing the duplication rate for E11, E13 embryos, and P21 brain samples, and other single-cell DNA methylation datasets12,67. The y-axis represents the percentage of duplicated reads (n = 278 cells for Cabernet Embryo, n = 927 cells for SciMETv2 LA Brain, n = 1619 cells for SciMETv2 SL Brain, n = 2,493 for E11 embryo (10 μm), n = 1,954 for E11 embryo 1 (50 μm), n = 1,947 for E11 embryo 2 (50 μm), n = 1,699 for E13 embryo (50 μm), and n = 2,235 for P21 brain (20 μm)). c, Box plots showing the mitochondrial retention rate for E11, E13 embryos, and P21 brain samples. The y-axis represents the percentage of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome. d, Spatial distribution heatmaps of global DNA methylation levels in E11, E13 embryos (mCG), and P21 mouse brain (mCG and mCA). e, The conversion rate of unmethylated cytosine in the linker sequence in E11, E13 embryos, and P21 mouse brain. f, Percentage of reads with poly A (≥ 30 adenine), poly T (≥ 30 thymine), and TSO sequence (AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATGGG) in the DNA libraries of E11, E13 embryos, and P21 mouse brain.

Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL (nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos. This study highlights a striking example of genetic suppression of a monogenic disease revealing a canonical enzyme in the CL biosynthesis pathway.

(a) Precision-recall curves for five biological replicate CRISPR screens in HAP1 TAZ KO cells using the reference core essential gene set (CEG2) defined in Hart et al. 2017. (b) Scatterplots representing TAZ qGIs derived from all possible pairwise combinations of five replicate screens. Pearson's correlation based on comparison of qGI scores calculated on all grey points (|qGI | >0.5, FDR < 0.5) is reported in all cases, with R and p-value (TAZ_051 vs. TAZ_186 P = 3.6667×10−91, TAZ_203 vs. TAZ_208 P = 9.31965×10−210, TAZ_203 vs. TAZ_264 P = 1.68248×10−163, TAZ_208 vs. TAZ_264 P = 3.79×10−83) determined using the stat_cor() method in the ggpubr R package. Significant points in both screens highlighted (red). (c) Fitness effect (LFC) distributions for reference core essential (CEG2) and non-essential gene sets across five TAZ KO query screens, the ABHD18-c1 screen and the TAZ;ABHD18-c2 screen respectively. (d) Enrichment for Gene Ontology (GO), molecular function, GO bioprocesses and Reactome terms among genes that exhibited a significant negative GI with TAZ (significant in at least 2 TAZ replicates, |qGI | >0.5, FDR < 0.5) (top), and positive GI with TAZ (bottom). Number of genes overlapping a particular term and term size are indicated. P-values determined by Fisher's one-tailed test using gProfileR. (e) Mutagenesis-based viability screens in HAP1 WT, and two independent TAZ cell lines. X-axis: log10-transformed mean number of insertions (± strand). Y-axis: ratio, defined as # sense reads/ (# sense + # antisense reads). Significant genes (P adj<1e-3, as compared to four WT controls) are dark grey. Selected genes are marked in red. (f) Overview of unique insertions in the ABHD18 gene in both TAZ KO (s1 and s2 clones) gene-trap screens. Gene transcript (top), sense integrations (middle), and antisense insertions (bottom). (g) Competitive growth assays. Co-cultures of TAZ;ABHD18 double KO cells with either TAZ KO cells or WT HAP1 cells followed over time by flow cytometry and normalised to day 0. (h) Relative proliferation of WT, TAZ KO, ABHD18 KO and ABHD18;TAZ double-KO RPE1 pools, presented as means of n = 2 biological replicates). (i) Relative proliferation of WT, TAZ KO, ABHD18 KO and ABHD18;TAZ double-KO H1-iCas9 pools (left; WT n = 5, TAZ-KO1 n = 4, ABHD18-KO1 n = 3, ABHD18-KO1: TAZ KO-1 n = 4 biological replicate assays) and proportion of pluripotent cells in selected pools (right; WT n = 4, TAZ-KO1 n = 4, ABHD18-KO1 n = 3, ABHD18-KO1: TAZ-KO1 n = 3 biological replicate assays). Data presented as means ± s.d. with significance calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test. (j) Representative flow cytometric analysis of OCT4 & SOX2 expression in WT, TAZ, ABHD18 and ABHD18;TAZ H1 hPSC pools. (k) Bar plot showing relative fitness effects when overexpressing either TAZ (TAZ OE) or ABHD18 (ABHD18 OE) across double mutant backgrounds. OE of either TAZ [clone 2 P = 0, clone 8 P = 0.0007] or ABHD18 [clone 2 P = 0, clone 8 P = 0.0001] reduces fitness in TAZ;ABHD18 double-KO cells. Data presented are means ± s.d.

Apple debuted the iconic and now wildly popular iPad in 2010. A few months later, Instagram landed on the App Store to rapid success. But for 15 years, Instagram hasn't bothered to optimize its app layout for the iPad's larger screen.

That's finally changing today: There's now a dedicated Instagram iPad app available globally on the App Store.

It has been a long time coming. Even before Apple began splitting its mobile operating system from iOS into iOS and iPadOS, countless apps adopted a fresh user interface that embraced the larger screen size of the tablet. This was the iPad's calling card at the time, and those native apps optimized for its precise screen size are what made Apple's device stand out from a sea of Android tablets that largely ran phone apps inelegantly blown up to fit the bigger screen.

Except Instagram never went iPad-native. Open the existing app right now, and you'll see the same phone app stretched to the iPad's screen size, with awkward gaps on the sides. And you'll run into the occasional problems when you post photos from the iPad, like low-resolution images. Weirdly, Instagram did introduce layout improvements for folding phones a few years ago, which means the experience is better optimized on Android tablets today than it is on iPad.

Instagram's chief, Adam Mosseri, has long offered excuses, often citing a lack of resources despite being a part of Meta, a multibillion-dollar company. Instagram wasn't the only offender—Meta promised a WhatsApp iPad app in 2023 and only delivered it earlier this year. (WhatsApp made its debut on phones in 2009.)

The fresh iPad app (which runs on iPadOS 15.1 or later) offers more than just a facelift. Yes, the Instagram app now takes up the entire screen, but the company says users will drop straight into Reels, the short-form video platform it introduced five years ago to compete with TikTok. The Stories module remains at the top, and you'll be able to hop into different tabs via the menu icons on the left. There's a new Following tab (the people icon right below the home icon), and this is a dedicated section to see the latest posts from people you actually follow.

Within the Following tab, there are three columns: All, Friends, and Latest. All shows recommended posts and reels from accounts you follow, Friends is from accounts you follow that follow you back, and Latest is a reverse-chronological feed from those you follow, with the most recent posts showing up first. Instagram originally had a reverse-chronological feed but got rid of it in 2016 in favor of one curated by an algorithm. (Right now on phones, you can tap the Instagram logo at the top of the app and choose “Following” for a reverse chronological feed of posts from accounts you follow.)

Open up Instagram's messages, and you'll see a two-panel split view that shows the conversation on the right and a list of all people you're chatting with on the left. Open up comments on a reel, and they'll populate alongside the reel instead of blocking the video. The app takes advantage of the larger screen, and accessing features requires “fewer taps."" It's about time.

When her son died in utero, a venture capitalist went to extremes to punish her surrogate.

Cindy Bi is not supposed to be telling me this story.

First, there's the confidentiality clause. When Bi, a venture capitalist who claims to have invested in a dozen unicorns, hired a surrogate to carry her only male embryo in 2023, both parties agreed to keep the details private and away from the media. Then there's the restraining order against Bi, followed by a court-ordered agreement saying she would not so much as mention the “surrogate” involved in Baby Leon's stillbirth. Finally, there are social norms to consider when publicly attacking the woman who says she almost died carrying your child.

Still, Bi is talking to me. She sends me a nearly 3,000-item folder filled with legal filings; reports to professional organizations, insurance companies, employers, and the police; emails with her attorneys; and correspondence between her and the “Egg Whisperer” influencer, Dr. Aimee.

Bi considers herself a whistleblower out to protect “unborn children via surrogacy.” Her website invokes scripture: “Establish justice in the courts. Amos 5:15.” Indeed, Bi has racked up nearly a million dollars in legal bills since 2024, in what she views as a fight to honor her son. “I want the surrogate to be known for what she did, to be set as an example,” Bi tells me. “I hope she goes to jail.” Ideally, for murder.

American surrogacy is an enormous industry, taking in approximately $5 billion in 2024, and the practice is expected to explode globally almost tenfold in the next decade. It seems especially popular in Silicon Valley, where a growing cadre of investors and executives, from OpenAI's Sam Altman to Dropbox's Drew Houston, have used it to grow their families. More than a dozen big tech companies provide five-figure subsidies to any employee who needs or wants to outsource gestational labor. A shocking number of techies now believe growing a baby can be a straightforward business transaction.

But intended parents and gestational carriers—IPs and GCs, as they're somewhat dehumanizingly known—are often uninformed about the dearth of regulation and completely unprepared for what can go wrong. Only one state, New York, requires agencies to be licensed. Although America is the world leader in surrogacy, it's also the developed nation with the highest maternal mortality rate and one of the highest stillbirth rates, a situation described by many as “a public health crisis.” Compared to natural conception, carrying a genetically unrelated fetus more than triples the risk of severe, potentially deadly conditions, a statistic surrogates are rarely given. IPs do not always have to disclose complete medical information, including histories of certain conditions that may harm their GCs. They don't have to be honest about how many kids they have, why they are hiring a surrogate, or how many other surrogates they have simultaneously pregnant. Do you really know who is carrying your child—or whose child you are carrying?

Meanwhile, the US is torn over who controls a pregnant woman's body. The increasing acceptance of “fetal personhood” means that, in many states, losing a pregnancy can be charged as a felony and potentially punished with life in prison. This is thorny enough when it's a woman's own baby. It's exponentially more fraught when the carrier isn't the parent.

Many of the issues Bi and her surrogate encountered on their “journey” are likely far more common than you'd ever imagine. But you haven't heard about them. They won't influence policy or case law, because they tend to unfold in private, shrouded by confidentiality clauses and handled in closed arbitration proceedings. A stark power differential means that intended parents often have the means to file lawsuits and wage yearslong campaigns, while surrogates who feel screwed are forced to rely on free legal help and GoFundMe.

The case of Bi and her surrogate shows how, in an environment with little regulation and extreme inequality, the miracle of life can mutate into a death sentence.

Cindy Bi met her future husband on April Fools' Day, 2016. It was a warm Friday night at Molly Magees, an Irish pub-slash-discotheque in Mountain View, California. Jorge Valdeiglesias spotted Bi on the dance floor: heart-shaped face, long black hair, snatched size-zero waist. He brought over shots of Don Julio. Bi, a Chinese immigrant and founder who'd later appear on a list of “30 of the Most Successful Early-Stage Startup Investors,” inspected his Google badge to make sure it was real. “I'm older than you,” Bi told him. She was 36 to his boyish, rumpled 28. “But it's OK, I froze my eggs.” Valdeiglesias was shocked by Bi's forwardness—he was just looking for a fun night—but it worked.

When she and Valdeiglesias were ready to start a family six years later, surrogacy was the obvious choice. At 43, Bi felt she was too old to be pregnant; she also said she was on a medication that could lead to complications. Bi didn't grieve the decision. In a Facebook group for future IPs, she wrote: “I've been prepared for this for almost a decade.”

At first, Bi and Valdeiglesias considered implanting two embryos at once to have twins. Bi's fertility doctor strongly discouraged that because of risks to the babies and surrogate. Instead, Bi and Valdeiglesias settled on “twiblings” gestated by separate women but born a few weeks or months apart. They'd have a protective big brother and a sweet little sister, fortuitously born in the year of the Dragon, the most auspicious sign of the Chinese zodiac.

They signed up with a Southern California–based agency, Surrogate Alternatives Inc. According to their psychological consult, Bi took an SSRI for PTSD spurred by work-related stressors, but hoped to wean off soon. SAI quickly matched the couple with a college-educated bank manager in Virginia. “She was perfect,” Bi told me. “Tall, healthy, young, good job. I showed her off to my friends. The only thing I was concerned with was she's a single mom, but I saw past it.”

Rebecca Smith was a former professional athlete who became interested in surrogacy after watching a close friend struggle to conceive. (Although Smith's real name is public, I'm using a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She declined to be interviewed on the record, citing the confidentiality clause and ongoing litigation.) The 34-year-old wanted to help a family who couldn't carry their own child. As she put it in a Facebook post, she wanted to give them “the same love I found in becoming a mom.”

Cindy Bi with her husband.

In her profile photos, the pale, lanky Smith mugged in denim jackets and athleisure with her 6-year-old biracial son, whom I'll call Ellis. Smith had previously dated but told her psych evaluator that “it doesn't work when you are a single mom.” She spent her free time coaching her son's sports teams; she ran errands on weekends when Ellis was with his dad, who remained a good friend. She was the type of person who preferred cooking at home to eating out, who made sure to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Ellis was an almost 10-pound baby. The pregnancy had been unremarkable but for the fact, perhaps, that her belly hadn't shown until she was seven months along.

Smith signed up with SAI, a well-regarded agency founded by a surrogate more than two decades earlier. She liked that it offered its GCs numerous safeguards: IPs went through thorough vetting, including psychological screening, and all had a medical reason for pursuing surrogacy; a detailed contract between the GC and the IPs would dictate the terms; a third-party escrow would hold the money and pay Smith; she'd get allowances and reimbursements for housekeeping and maternity clothes; if Smith had to be hospitalized or miss work, she'd receive payments for lost wages and childcare. Also, Smith's employer-provided insurance would treat the pregnancy as if it were her own baby—a major boon. Although directly paying a woman to carry your child is technically illegal in Virginia, Smith's contract specified that all payments were “reimbursements.” She planned to use the $45,000 “reimbursement” to pay off her student loans and build an emergency fund.

Smith met Bi and Valdeiglesias in a standard video call facilitated by SAI. In her psychological evaluation, Smith seemed smitten with the couple, calling them “amazing.” The therapist wrote, “She feels they are ‘100% compatible.'” In the summer of 2023, Smith and Ellis flew out to San Francisco for the embryo transfer. Bi put them up in a nice hotel for 12 days, close to her apartment, and planned a detailed sightseeing itinerary. Smith didn't even request reimbursement for her lost wages.

A doctor implanted Bi and Valdeiglesias' only male embryo inside of Smith. Everyone was elated when it stuck. Bi asked Smith for permission to share a photo of the test result on Facebook, and Smith quickly agreed, inviting Bi to tag her. Bi and Smith texted all the time: Smith shared her happy nausea and impressions of Baby Leon; Bi detailed her constant travels and her search for a second GC. Smith tried to recruit her own sister for the job, then a coworker. When scary but benign early bleeding brought Smith to the ER, Bi sent her a DoorDash gift card.

But in the wake of the bleeding, Smith found something out. Bi had been posting about Smith's health in Facebook groups, sharing test results and crowdsourcing suggestions for her treatment. Bi didn't refer to Smith by name but included distinctive details that allowed members of the tight-knit community to identify her, which violated their contract.

Smith alerted SAI but didn't confront Bi, perhaps calculating that it was better not to risk tainting their rapport. After all, the surrogacy relationship was unlike almost any other. Once you were pregnant, there was no going back. A new human had been—had to be—created.

In late 2023, a little more than halfway through the pregnancy, Bi got a Facebook comment that scared her. She had posted about Smith getting a new, better job; the COO of ART Risk Solutions, an insurance agency, replied, suggesting that Bi double-check whether Smith's new policy would cover the pregnancy. Outreach like this wasn't uncommon: The Facebook groups often teemed with industry professionals peddling their wares. The ART Risk COO offered to look into it.

While SAI's standard process had determined that Smith's new insurance would cover the pregnancy, ART Risk disagreed. Bi was spooked by what she saw as SAI's oversight on a major issue: Pregnancy complications could rack up five- or six-figure bills. To Bi, the people she had paid to ensure her only son's healthy birth seemed asleep at the wheel. Since Bi alleged SAI had “made a mistake,” she demanded they pay for Smith's backup insurance policy. When it stood by its assessment and refused, Bi was irate.

She began posting about SAI, sometimes multiple times a day, to warn other IPs. Sometimes she said that Smith had told her about the job change, other times she claimed that Smith hadn't notified her. She didn't want to burden Smith. “It's not your fault,” she assured Smith, trying to protect her from the stress while keeping her in the loop.

It seemed like they were on the same page. “I just hate that it all happened!” Smith texted Bi. “I was so excited thinking the new job was surrogate-friendly.” Bi was sure that if Smith had known otherwise, she wouldn't have taken the job.

It wasn't about the money. Smith's new, subsidized Affordable Care Act plan, at $391 a month, was a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated $200,000 Bi had budgeted for the pregnancy. Bi told Smith that they would lay low until Leon was born and then go after SAI: “I want to show them what justice should look like.”

On December 15, a day on which Bi sent her more than 50 texts about the insurance, Smith felt liquid between her legs. She was 26 weeks pregnant and afraid her water had broken. The emergency room sent her home, telling her it wasn't amniotic fluid. She should've been relieved, but she soon had another text from Bi: One of Bi's lawyers wanted Smith “to sign a few forms.” Smith had already signed a power of attorney giving Bi and Valdeiglesias the ability to make decisions for Leon. Were they now asking for control over her body? (Bi declined multiple requests to show me the forms in question.)

Smith confronted Bi gently. “I guess I'm a little confused,” she said. Bi and Valdeiglesias hadn't been calling into any of the prenatal appointments where they could ask questions. “What's changed?”

“After your ER visit, I have tons of questions,” Bi replied. “For example, was it due to the stress of Friday's insurance discussion? If not, what can we do to prevent such episodes so baby can grow to full term?” By this point, Bi and Valdeiglesias had found a second GC for Leon's younger sister, and that process, Bi told Smith, was going much more smoothly.

That day, Smith was back at the clinic for follow-ups on the leaking. She'd already started taking precautions: sleeping on her left side and drinking a gallon of water a day. Again, they told her it wasn't amniotic fluid and that stress might have been a contributor.

On January 1, 2024, 29 weeks pregnant, Smith texted Bi that she was in the ER again. This time, doctors confirmed that her water had broken. Smith was admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics, monitoring, and steroids to help develop the baby's lungs. She was to stay there until Leon was born.

Bi and Valdeiglesias had just celebrated New Year's Eve in New York City. A few days later, Bi ordered Smith a tower of boxes from Amazon: coconut water, freeze-dried cantaloupe slices. But Bi also pestered Smith with questions: Why was she in the hospital, instead of just on bedrest at home? Was she submitting lost wage requests? Meanwhile, on Facebook, Bi claimed that Smith had broken their contract by not notifying her before changing jobs. A breach claim was serious. It meant that Smith was on the hook for any bills that insurance didn't cover—potentially million-dollar-plus sums that Bi acknowledged could bankrupt Smith. (Technically, Smith had notified them: She had a text from Valdeiglesias congratulating her.)

The situation reveals one of the fundamental imbalances of surrogacy: When a surrogate breaks contract, her IPs can stop paying her and stop paying the medical bills for her pregnancy. But if an IP breaks contract—say, by sharing their GC's private information online or withholding compensation—a GC typically has to hire a lawyer. No matter what, IPs get the baby at the end. Anything else would be considered baby selling and human trafficking.

Bi started to believe something was wrong with Leon because of photos Smith posted. She looked slim, despite being months along. You hardly look pregnant! a commenter wrote, approvingly. To Bi, this wasn't a compliment. Everyone knew pregnant women had big bellies.

A few days into Smith's hospitalization, Bi got news that seemed to push her over the edge. Smith phrased it like it was a good thing: Despite the premature rupture of membranes, her doctors had told her that Leon was healthy, and a growth scan estimated that he was in the 30th percentile. That didn't sound right. The 30th percentile meant most babies measured bigger than Leon. Smith was tall—shouldn't that make a bigger baby, Bi wondered? She had expected her son to be above average in all things.

Smith maintained that the doctor told her everything looked great. But Bi's motherly intuition was going off. Something didn't seem right with her son. She pressed on: Was Smith eating enough? Had she gained enough weight? “Small belly by itself, I brushed off,” Bi wrote. But “30th, water leak, small belly, is Leon being suffocated and become defective already?”

Since Bi did not have Leon in her body, where she could protect him and keep him safe, she had to do everything she could from across the country. She turned to Facebook groups and Google for second, third, and fourth opinions. On January 13, Bi emailed SAI asking for copies of Smith's medical records.

Bi—a direct communicator who prided herself on her candor—asked her husband if she was out of line. Valdeiglesias assured her she wasn't. “You're just caring for your baby,” he said. “Like just what any other mother would do.”

The hardest part of being hospitalized, Smith told Bi, was saying goodbye to her son, who cried whenever she had to leave. Bi had suggested that Ellis could stay in the hospital. Ellis spent the night just twice in those weeks, sleeping on the recliner meant for new parents.

On one of those mornings, January 21, Smith woke up in the same room as her sweet, protective, now 7-year-old son. Nurses came in and did morning monitoring. Leon had no heartbeat.

When Bi got the Facebook message from an unknown woman, she thought it was a prank: “Call the hospital asap,” the woman wrote. It was Smith's sister. “This is an emergency.”

Bi recorded her conversation with the hospital. The doctor gave her condolences: She thought she'd seen a flicker in one of Leon's heart valves and so rushed Smith into an emergency C-section. But Leon was already dead. The placenta had separated from Smith's uterine wall, depriving Leon of oxygen. “Typically that leads to vaginal bleeding,” the doctor explained, “which she had not been having. She did about 10 days ago.” They'd followed the standard of care by trying to keep Leon inside Smith until 34 weeks gestation. But, she said, “these things just happen sometimes. I don't think we'll ever know exactly why, unfortunately.”

Later, Bi got a call from Smith, who had recently woken up from general anesthesia. Snotty-nosed, crying, Smith told her she last felt Leon moving that night. Bi was confused: Smith had told her that Leon was moving more during the day and less at night. The call button was right there, Bi thought. If Smith felt Leon move, why hadn't she alerted the nurses?

Bi and her husband arranged for flights to see their son's body. She emailed SAI: Could the medical records be ready when she arrived at the hospital? “I didn't sleep,” Bi said, “I was contacting attorneys.”

Smith, meanwhile, had spent several hours in surgery. Placental abruptions are a major cause of maternal mortality. According to court filings, she “lost a lot of blood and nearly died.”

Now awake, sliced through her core, she held baby Leon. He weighed 3 pounds, 12 ounces—almost exactly average for his gestational age. The child that she'd carried for seven months lay dead in her arms.

What shocked Bi, when she arrived at the hospital, was the joy she felt with her stillborn child. “He was a white boy, just like his dad.” He had light hair, a cut near his left knee, and hard-looking fingernails. Bi photographed Leon in a white gown and diaper, holding a blue crocheted heart. Bi would never know the color of his eyes.

A nurse told Bi that Smith was being discharged but wanted to speak to them. Bi said no; it was her time with her son before his autopsy. She did ask for a list of Smith's medications.

Eight days after Leon died, Smith emailed Bi and Valdeiglesias. She understood they might not want to talk, but her heart was breaking, thinking of them. “I will forever carry the memory of your baby boy,” she wrote, “how his favorite place to kick/punch was my right rib and how he danced up a storm whenever Ed Sheeran came on.”

Back home in San Francisco, Bi felt empty. She wandered the sidewalks where she should've been pushing a stroller. Things were bad at home. She couldn't sleep, couldn't work. Instead she dedicated all of her time to taking screenshots and organizing folders of evidence to wage a medical malpractice lawsuit.

She also hired psychics to give her answers. As she tells it, they all blamed Smith. One suggested that an ex-boyfriend of Smith's had turned her against Baby Leon. Another claimed to see traumas on Smith's belly and said she was clearly having rough sex. He warned: “She has something to hide.” When Smith refused to release her medical records unless nonpregnancy information was redacted, Bi saw it as confirmation that Smith was hiding crucial details.

Bi contacted SAI, claiming that Smith had breached contract by not informing her about the insurance change on time, not taking her vitamins, and not alerting her before the C-section. “Our contract specified a ‘well-baby' that didn't die,” she reminded them. Bi ordered the escrow to stop paying Smith or reimbursing her medical expenses. A few days later, Bi re-listened to the recording of the worst news of her life. She noticed a detail she'd missed: Smith had bled 10 days prior to Leon's death. No one had told her.

SAI countered that there was “no documented bleed” on the date in question but clarified that there was “some light pink fluid which the doctor was not concerned about.” SAI said Smith asked the doctors to tell Bi directly, and that the contract gave Smith two weeks to tell Bi. “That's emergency information,” Bi said. “She should have told me right away.” If Bi had been told, she believed that Leon would be alive. She would've insisted on a C-section immediately.

Many stillbirth advocates believe that American doctors do not take the risk of stillbirth seriously, that the standards of care are often woefully inadequate, and that calculations about when to deliver a baby ignore risk factors. After losing a baby, women are often told, as Bi was, that these things “just happen.” Stillbirths take about 21,000 American children per year—more than guns, car accidents, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer, and fires combined.

Leon's death “was 100 percent, 1,000 percent preventable,” Bi told me, anguished. Searching for meaning, she started attending Epic Church (known for hosting high-profile VCs). At one discussion, participants talked about “when God gives you a mission.” Bi sobbed. “I don't want this mission, I want my son,” she thought. Upon reflection, though, she became hopeful. She thanked God for giving her trauma, because He believed she could handle it. “I will do my best to make sure it won't happen to other people,” she promised herself. She would become her son's voice. “I'll make sure other unborn children are protected.”

In her grief, Bi pieced together her version of events: During the pregnancy, Smith had engaged in “lots of unsafe sex.” A bout of “forceful sex” led to her leaking in mid-December. More sex eventually necessitated her hospitalization. Smith had let her “adult-sized” son sleep in her bed, where he'd probably kicked her in the stomach. Smith may have even intentionally given birth early, mistakenly believing she'd receive full compensation.

At the advice of her lawyer, Bi hired a private investigator. A reverse address lookup suggested a man shared Smith's address—whose name Bi was sure had to be Smith's (supposedly ex) partner. He was Black, and the PI's report described him as having been charged with two misdemeanors. Bi believed Smith should have never been a surrogate with an “undisclosed live-in boyfriend with #felony JAIL TIME record,” as she put it online. The PI dug up a flyer advertising a New Year's Eve party listing the man as one of the DJs, seemingly confirming Bi's lawyer's suspicion about what Smith had been doing the night before her hospitalization.

Bi was ready to approve an in-person surveillance operation when another detail froze her blood: Smith had gotten a speeding ticket on a day she was inpatient at the hospital. As Bi would claim online, on January 13, Smith had “snuck out” with her son, gone 40 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone, then “snuck back into” the hospital. The very next day, Smith had experienced “profuse vaginal bleeding” for “at least five hours.” In hindsight, Smith's behavior appeared “weird” and “defensive”: The day after the bleed, Smith had asked Bi to stop posting.

Bi understood how far-fetched her allegations sounded. “If it were not for all the hard evidence, it's too shocking to believe [Rebecca Smith] did what she did to kill my son,” Bi wrote on Facebook, using Smith's real name. Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi's tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi's claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi's $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.

Bi's husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn't blame him too.

Smith had planned to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn't stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn't breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.

When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith's HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.

Smith hadn't heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who'd had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.

Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon's corpse to Smith's 7-year-old son's iPad.

In the months after Leon died, Bi:

Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump's “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon's due date. Posted Leon's ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted Smith's full name, photo, employer, mortgage license number, son's first name, and a link to her address on her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.

Baby Leon's empty crib.

Bi has abandonment issues that she traces back to her twenties, when her father divorced her mom for the mistress who'd conceived his long-awaited son. She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I'm not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it's up to them to disclose. One of Bi's fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it's not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.

If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn't just Leon's death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman's body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.

On Facebook, strangers started calling for Smith to rot in jail and lose custody of her son. She and her family feared online vigilantes would search out the woman Bi portrayed as a profit-minded baby killer. Smith's parents bought security cameras for her car, then Smith moved back in with her son's father, then moved again. She changed jobs, hoping to spare her small office the chaos. Bi contacted Smith's next employer too, saying Smith had been fired for fraud and lied on her application. Smith's sister feared violence.

Smith had suicidal thoughts. She wondered if her son would be better off if she were dead, if that meant Bi would never send him another disturbing message.

In June, Bi sued Smith and the other parties she blamed for Leon's death. When a judge ruled that Bi had to follow the original contract and do private arbitration instead of a public lawsuit, she spent $25,000 appealing the decision. One day at work, in front of her new colleagues, a man served Smith papers naming Bi and Valdeiglesias as Leon's parents. Smith's pro bono lawyer advised her to acknowledge the papers without realizing that Bi's lawyer—the husband of Bi's psych consultant—had added a section forcing Smith to release her medical records. After another court battle, the judge threw out that requirement.

Whatever loophole existed, Bi would find it. If Smith relaxed, she would take advantage. “The only goal she had was to destroy my life,” Smith wrote in a court document: to get her fired from her job so she couldn't support her son. To have her behind bars. To bankrupt her. To make it so Smith could never be at peace while Leon was dead.

In the fall of 2024, Bi was served papers. Smith had filed a restraining order. Smith maintained that she'd been single and lived alone with her son; she'd never “snuck out” of the hospital—nurses permitted her to go home to pick up an obscure vitamin Bi had asked her to take; the doctors had advised her not to create extra stress by telling Bi about the minor bleeding; she'd asked SAI to inform Bi about it. Smith's supporters said that after the stillbirth, she'd volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House for the NICU, sponsored a gold leaf on a tree for angel babies, pumped and donated her breastmilk to feed fragile babies in Leon's honor.

Bi found these claims ridiculous. “She kidnapped and killed my son.”

“I am the victim here,” Bi told me repeatedly. Being a “single mom,” she said, “doesn't give you the right to kill another son. You don't have that victim card to play.” She was almost screaming when she said it. Bi explains over and over her belief that surrogates hold all of the power. There are far more intended parents than surrogates—between three and 10 times as many—and IPs are, as Bi put it online, in “such a disadvantaged position.” Once a GC has the embryo inside of them, they can harm the baby. Therefore, IPs are at their whim.

Bi sees a model for surrogacy in the antiabortion laws that “recognize and protect the right of a fetal life.” The baby, she believes, should come first. Bi thinks that when doctors see surrogates go against medical advice, they should report it to the police.

Bi isn't anti-surrogacy—in fact, she frequently advises other investors who are pursuing it and sends me links to startup after startup. Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist friend of Bi's who has commissioned twiblings, said the problem is that information is siloed when “each agency has their own database of wombs.” In this model, surrogates are the gestational equivalents of Uber drivers or Amazon warehouse workers. “There should be a database of carriers allowing us to filter on what we want: age, BMI, willingness to abort the fetus,” Mohnot said.

Six months after Leon's death, Bi's daughter was born. In an Instagram announcement, Bi sits in a hospital recliner wearing a medical gown, clutching a newborn to her chest. Bi often compared her two surrogacy experiences—“I had the world's worst GC, and the best”—and told me for months that everything with Chelsea Sanabria had been easy and smooth.

Not quite. Sanabria told me she had a great relationship with Bi but a pregnancy plagued with placental issues: first, gestational diabetes; then placenta previa, where the placenta blocks the cervix, which led to a hospitalization and a scheduled C-section. When doctors removed the baby, they found that the placenta had grown too deeply into her uterine wall, a condition known as placenta accreta. Once they removed the placenta, Sanabria began losing blood. As a nursing student and patient care technician, she knew what was going on as they called out numbers of blood loss—ultimately an astounding 5.4 liters. “The weirdest part was being awake” while she was dying, she said. An emergency hysterectomy saved her life. She woke up nine hours later, intubated, in the ICU.

A 2024 survey found that naturally conceived pregnancies carry about a 2 percent risk of several adverse maternal events. A surrogate pregnancy increases that to almost 8 percent. Nobody had talked to Sanabria about these risks. Now, she posts online to educate other surrogates.

As Bi pointed out repeatedly in her quest to get Leon's placental slides, the placenta comes from the DNA of the biological parents—hers and Valdeiglesias'. In fact, Bi's mother and sister developed diabetes while pregnant, an issue stemming from the placenta, and remained diabetic. Valdeiglesias told me that his aunt had her water break early, but everything was fine.

But Bi and Valdeiglesias's family medical histories were not disclosed to their surrogates. This is normal. If Bi and Valdeiglesias have a third child, they almost certainly won't disclose their pregnancy complications.

“Imagine a journey being treated like a human incubator and not like a person,” Smith wrote in a Facebook group for GCs. “Imagine a journey where the intended parents leave you to pay all of the medical bills.”

Hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills are in Smith's name, which could wreck her credit. Smith's employer-provided insurance initially agreed to pay but revoked coverage after Bi emailed them alleging fraud. Now, the plan Bi bought isn't paying out either. Bi maintains that Smith is responsible. Just as Bi warned in a Facebook group, the bills could bankrupt Smith.

During a Zoom hearing last December, Bi considered mercy. Perhaps Smith had suffered enough; perhaps Bi had already achieved a form of justice. Inspired with grace, Bi said she made an offer: If Smith dropped the restraining order and allowed Bi to talk freely about her, using her full name, Bi wouldn't pursue criminal charges.

Smith's lawyer refused, so Bi contacted local police. (In Virginia, police have investigated pregnancy losses and put a stillbirth mom behind bars.) If that fails, Bi hopes to nail Smith for perjury based on the “lies” in her restraining order application. In order to avoid a permanent restraining order, Bi signed a court-enforced confidentiality agreement not to talk about Smith. But Bi now views that agreement as toothless. It appears nothing—not even the specter of being found in contempt of court—will stop Bi from sharing her truth. Though it's highly unlikely, Bi could even go to jail: There's an arrest warrant out for Bi in Virginia for doxing Smith.

So far, Bi has worked with nine different attorneys. She racked up almost $750,000 in legal bills in 2024 but paid less than half; the law firm where Elizabeth Sperling works, owed $200,000, said it “intends to initiate a proceeding”; her appeals lawyer, also owed $200,000, keeps threatening to send her to collections. “I cannot pay you because if I do, then I cannot get another lawyer,” Bi explained. She needs the money to pay her next retainer. Lawyers never ask Bi about money: “They see my profile and they assume I can pay.”

But Bi tells me she's cash poor. Although Bi had an eight-figure net worth before Leon's death, most of it was illiquid stakes in companies. She has rent to pay ($10,000 a month) and childcare (her sixth live-in nanny). She had to withdraw her management fees for her investment fund much faster than planned. Bi hasn't worked much since Leon died, but she doesn't know how she can continue as a venture capitalist if she backs down. “If I cannot protect my son,” Bi says, “if I cannot give him honor, sue the hell out of these people, and have some sense of justice … how can the investment founders say, ‘Cindy, you're the best?'”

Just when it seemed like Bi might not be able to stomach, or afford, more lawsuits, she found someone who would represent her without charging hourly. “Pitbull attorney” Doug Rochen has the kind, open face of a Midwestern pastor. He's gotten eight-figure payouts for abused foster children and mistreated prisoners and specializes in sexual abuse cases. Bi says Rochen will sue the doctors and the hospital for malpractice and pursue arbitration against Rebecca Smith, SAI, and other parties in exchange for 40 percent of Bi's winnings.

Meanwhile, Bi and her husband have been hunting for their third surrogate. In the spring, Bi emailed with The Biggest Ask agency about “a great surrogate profile”: another single mother, of two, who lives with her parents. But she hesitated: Should she give her daughter a little sister or use the money to “pursue justice” for her son? “I just can't pull the trigger,” Bi told me. Not yet.

I love a list. I can happily write the same to-do list in six different places in a single day (good thing I test digital notebooks and paper planners). I often find myself rewriting the little brainstorms in my Notes app because the ideas are still banging around in my brain, asking to be let free onto a page, digital or not.

But not every brainstorm or list needs a full-size page. That's where ReMarkable's latest digital notebook comes in. The reMarkable Paper Pro Move ($449) takes the same technology as the company's flagship Paper Pro notebook—color e-ink screen included—and puts it on a much smaller screen. With a 7.3-inch e-paper display and a gentle front light, it's a good size that fits in your hand as you jot down notes or an idea while you're on the go—the classic reporter's notepad turned digital. Turns out, that's exactly what I needed.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is identical to the Paper Pro that launched last year in technology, just in a smaller profile (no small feat). You can write in color, add color highlights, and it has a soft frontlight for writing in dim environments. The front light doesn't get as bright as a Kindle or smartphone, but it does make the screen legible.

The Marker stylus that comes included is the same, and as usual, you can upgrade to the Marker Plus, which lets you use the other end of the stylus as an eraser (a must-have, in my opinion). It magnetically sticks to the right side of the tablet, and that's how it connects and charges. Speaking of, the Paper Pro Move retains the same two-week battery life claim as the Paper Pro. Much will depend on how much you use it, but I expect you'll probably have to charge it two times a month, three if you're rigorously using it every day.

The Move is 4 inches by a little over 7 inches, and weighs only 8 ounces (though it weighs 12 ounces with a case and stylus on), with a 16:9 aspect ratio in portrait mode, and a 4:3 aspect ratio in landscape mode to match ReMarkable's larger models. The Move's longest side is the same length as the Paper Pro's shortest side. It's the smallest of ReMarkable's tablets, but it has the highest pixels per inch, coming in at 264 ppi, while the Paper Pro is 229 ppi. That makes it sharper, but I didn't see a huge screen difference looking at the paper-like screens side by side.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move can sync with your existing ReMarkable notes, but it has its own special page size designed for the smaller form. Notebooks I started on the Move and then pulled up on my Paper Pro had a little gray bar on the right side, showing that the page size was smaller than the Paper Pro had room for. I saw similar gray bars if I pulled up a PDF or document on the Move and zoomed out to see it in its entirety. Usually, you won't see these bars on the Move if you're opening up a standard set of notes. The notebooks you started on ReMarkable's larger e-ink devices will adjust to fit onto the Move's smaller screen in portrait mode, and resume their normal size if you rotate to landscape mode.

The Move responds quickly to whichever orientation you move it to, whether it's in your hand or flat on a desk. Recent software updates actually make all ReMarkable devices more responsive to orientation adjustments—my larger Paper Pro used to ignore rotations until I activated the keyboard on the attached Type Folio case, but now it flips around just as fast as the Move.

Unsurprisingly, it's the size that really makes the ReMarkable Paper Pro Move shine. It was easy to grab and write down notes from an impromptu call with an exterminator after an ant infestation in my pantry (nothing like some late summer desperation from my neighborhood ant colonies).

It was comfortable to stack on top of a Hobonichi Techo and carry around the house without feeling like my hand could drop either item, and layered nicely on top of my planner when it was laid open if I wanted to fill out my planner's weekly spread and then write down my extended to-do list on the Move. It can fit into my favorite small handbag, and just about every handbag I own besides my shorter belt bags. The lighter weight and slim size made it comfortable to grab and write anywhere, especially compared to the Paper Pro and its heavy Type Folio case.

The Move was less convenient for PDFs and typed materials, but not impossible to use. Already typed copy on a different ReMarkable adjusts to fit the Move's screen, which felt very much like reading on a Kindle. It was more effort to zoom in and annotate or edit something on a PDF, like changing a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet. While you can't type directly on the Move, you can convert your handwritten text into type, which works quickly and does a good job recognizing block writing and cursive alike.

The color is also a really fun addition that you won't find on every digital notebook. It paired nicely with the color coding I like to do in my paper planners to help visualize different sections, though you only have nine colors for pen tools (including black and white) and six colors for the highlighter (including gray). It's not as wide a gamut as you'll get with real-life highlighter packs, but still enough color to spice things up.

ReMarkable is always adding more features to its devices via software updates, but you'll need to subscribe to ReMarkable Connect ($3 a month) to enjoy most of them. Earlier this year, the company debuted ReMarkable Methods, which added a new library of templates and workbooks designed by users and even the BulletJournal.com team. These are accessible on ReMarkable's website, and you can choose which ones to add to your devices.

There's another new feature for Connect subscribers: Handwriting Search, which can search through your notes even if they aren't typed. The search primarily focuses on the title of your notebooks rather than the content within them, but it opens up a lot of opportunities to find your content. It takes a little while to scan your notes, but after that, I could easily search words or even parts of words to find results; searching “phan” would pull up my notes from the Dungeons & Dragons campaign The Lost Mines of Phandelver, while searching “Friday” pulled up various to-do lists I'd written.

Once you select the note that best matches, the Move will open the note to the page with that word and highlight it. You can flip through how many times a word appears in the notes, too, with a set of arrows that appear in the right-hand corner of the note after you use Handwriting Search. This feature is only available if you join the Beta program, but it will roll out later this year. You won't need a Move to access it, but you will need to be a Connect subscriber.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is my new favorite digital notebook. It's the perfect size to grab and jot down random ideas and a complicated list, and you can still zoom out to draw larger sketches or switch to landscape mode.

If you're a student looking to type notes, the Paper Pro is still a better pick. But compared to the cheaper, older ReMarkable 2, the Move's writing experience is smoother, plus the colors are a blast and make for great note-taking support. It's more affordable than the Paper Pro, and a good size for anyone mostly looking to jot down everyday notes and tasks rather than long-form distraction-free writing. But keep in mind, this is still a $449 notepad. Sometimes, all you need is a $25 reporter's notebook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How Disinformation About the Minnesota Shooting Spread Like Wildfire on X","https://www.wired.com/story/disinformation-minnesota-shooting-x/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:28:04 GMT","

Minutes after the perpetrator of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis last week was identified, YouTube appeared to delete several videos they had shared that morning.

But not before the videos were downloaded and reshared in full on X.

Within hours, the platform was flooded with wild claims about the shooter and her motivation, with everyone from Elon Musk, the site's owner, to the head of the FBI and left-wing activists posting half-baked allegations blaming anti-Christian hate, transgender genocide, and white supremacy. Many of the posts racked up millions of views per X's public metrics.

While other social media platforms were also used to share unfounded claims about the shooter's motivations, X, under Musk, has become the perfect platform to supercharge the spread of dangerous disinformation during breaking news events. The entire team tasked with tackling disinformation on the platform was first culled years ago, and now X's biggest users claim they are incentivized by the platform to share out-of-context clickbait content over verified facts.

“X's feed algorithm is fully designed to maximize engagement, even negative engagement,” says Laura Edelson, an assistant professor in the computer sciences college at Northeastern University who specializes in tracking disinformation online. “In these conditions, conspiratorial, extreme content tends to perform very well. And when you couple that with the fact that with X's significantly weakened content rules, this is exactly what we would expect to result.”

X did not respond to WIRED‘s request for comment.

An 11-minute video from the shooter, which was shared by dozens of X accounts in the minutes after her identity was revealed, includes a wide array of guns and ammunition. The weapons were adorned with over 120 symbols, words, and phrases that reference dozens of hateful ideologies, mass shooters, memes, and coded language used by the nihilistic online communities the shooter was a member of.

As extremism researchers warned people against jumping to quick conclusions given the huge swath of digital, written, and video content that needed to be analyzed, X users took very little notice.

The same day, screenshots from the video were used by everyone from elected lawmakers and senior government officials to law enforcement personnel, activists, podcasters, and conspiracy theorists on X to push particular narratives about what was to blame for the latest mass shooting.

In one of the primary narratives erroneously pushed immediately after the shooting, conservative influencers and politicians claimed that the perpetrator's gender identity was at fault. Information about the shooter, who identified as transgender and changed her name to Robin Westman when she was 17 years old, spread like wildfire on X, pushed by a huge list of right-wing figures, including Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, and Musk himself. X's own AI-powered chatbot Grok refuted the idea that transgender people disproportionately carry out mass shootings.

Many X users, like right-wing commentator Nick Sortor, claimed the attack was motivated by hatred of God, citing “all the anti-Christian and and anti-God writings” on the shooter's guns. FBI director Kash Patel seemed to boost these claims by posting that the shooting was being investigated as a “hate crime targeting Catholics.” Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer alleged that the shooter was “radicalized by leftism and Islam.” Others cited anti-Israel phrases written on the weapons as proof the shooting was antisemitic.

On the left, most focused on the fact the shooter praised other mass shooters and used racist language. Left-wing podcaster Benjamin Dixon, who describes himself as “Pastor of Antifa,” described the shooter on X as “a right wing incel aggrieved white boy.”

The platform itself even helped boost some of these claims in the summaries it presented to users about the shooting, which highlighted the ""anti-Trump messages"" written on some of the shooter's weapons without mentioning all the other words and phrases.

The reality, according to extremism experts who are still trawling through the shooter's writings and digital footprint, is that there simply appears to have been no overarching ideology motivating the shooter. Instead, some have determined that the shooter was likely part of a growing group of nihilistic violent extremists whose sole motivation is the violence itself.

“They clearly state several times they are not doing this for any ideology or cause, they are simply doing this for the sake of violence, for their desire for notoriety, to know what it feels like to be one of their idols, to cause chaos and see the fear in the eyes of their victims,” Marc-André Argentino, an extremism researcher, wrote on Bluesky in reference to the diaries the shooter posted to YouTube hours before the attack.

Argentino also warned that nihilistic violent extremists can be performative, their messages and writings designed in part to trick people into boosting specific phrases out of context.

“These kind of attackers put on a performance, there is a script they follow and part of that script is trolling journalists or leaving ironic items in the hope someone in the media will bring on the Streisand effect to further spread their attack and be immortalized,” says Argentino.

But on X, where posting first and often is rewarded more than posting accurate and verified information, such warnings repeatedly fall on deaf ears.

“Context collapse is a rhetorical device that we see a lot in breaking news events—twisting real quotes or events to mislead or presenting it without the context in which it was said,” Nina Jankowicz, the former Biden administration disinformation czar who is now CEO of the American Sunlight Project, tells WIRED. “This is particularly prevalent on microblogging platforms like X, where users are disincentivized to read more than 280 characters or past the headline of a news item.”

Since Musk's takeover of Twitter in late 2022, almost every move he's taken with regards to content moderation has made it more difficult to find accurate and timely information on X.

Shortly after he bought the company, Musk removed the team responsible for tackling disinformation and replaced it with the crowdsourced Community Notes system, which made the misinformation situation worse, not better. More recently, users have relied on Grok to fact-check posts, which also hasn't helped. This lack of oversight, combined with a new verification system that rewards posts with the highest engagement over verified sources, has resulted in a toxic stew of disinformation flooding the platform during major global breaking news events. This was clearly seen at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and more recently during the protests in LA.

“There are no guardrails on X anymore, and it's become overrun by disinformation accounts and grifters,” says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists. “There are certain narratives about mass shootings that will instantly find homes on X, and nothing holds them back from spreading.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Dolby Atmos FlexConnect Lets You Place Speakers Anywhere","https://www.wired.com/story/dolby-atmost-flex-connect-tcl/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:03:00 GMT","

For years, there have been just two options for better TV sound: A traditional, AV receiver-based home theater system or a soundbar.

The AV receiver route is undeniably the best way to go for a truly cinematic experience, but only the most diehard audiophiles are willing to deal with hulking metal boxes, yards of speaker wire, and a minimum of five speakers (plus a subwoofer) that must be placed just so. That's before you delve into the often arcane settings needed for peak performance.

Soundbars, with their lure of simplicity—just plug a single speaker into your TV and walk away—have enticed many. But few single-speaker systems live up to the promise of Dolby Atmos, and if you buy a model with additional satellite speakers and subs, the placement of these speakers remains crucial to getting that dome-of-sound experience we associate with movie magic.

Starting this summer, however, there's a third choice: Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. FlexConnect is a new platform developed by Dolby that lets you place wireless speakers anywhere you like. The system automatically detects the speakers' capabilities (power, frequency response, etc.), then maps their position in the room. From there, it calibrates the audio to maximize the system's ability to deliver a Dolby Atmos experience (including height and surround channels).

In its launch guise, Dolby Atmos FlexConnect uses a smart TV as its central hub. This means you'll need a FlexConnect-compatible TV and wireless speakers. However, future FlexConnect products may embed that hub function in soundbars or even smart speakers—opening up more options for those who don't want to replace their TV. I got a chance to give a Dolby Atmos FlexConnect system a listen earlier this month at an invite-only event in Santa Monica, California, and came away impressed with the possibilities.

As Dolby's launch partner, TCL is the first to embed FlexConnect into a TV. All of TCL's 2025 QD-Mini LED TVs are FlexConnect-compatible and can be paired with up to four wireless TCL Z100 FlexConnect speakers, which TCL sells for $400 each. Optionally, you can replace one of these Z100 units with a wireless TCL Z100-SW subwoofer ($500).

While Dolby imposes no hard limit on the number or type of speakers (or subwoofers) you can use in a single FlexConnect system, each manufacturer's choice of processor determines what's feasible.

What you can't do is use any other company's wireless speakers—whether they're FlexConnect-compatible or not. Naturally, this raises the question of compatibility. When other companies eventually make their own FlexConnect TVs, speakers, or soundbars, will they only work within that brand's family of products? Dolby says this kind of brand lock-in isn't built into Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, but neither does it require compatibility between FlexConnect products.

Unfortunately for now, TCL's implementation of FlexConnect is proprietary. During the event, I asked Dolby's reps which other companies have signed up to be a part of the Atmos FlexConnect world, but they refused to comment, choosing instead to let TCL own the limelight during the initial launch. Afterward, however, I received a follow-up email letting me know that Dolby had partnered with Hisense on FlexConnect outside of the North American market. No word on whether Hisense's version will be similar.

As far as the TCL setup, each TCL Z100 is rated at 170 watts RMS, which is delivered via three front-facing drivers (woofer, midrange, and tweeter) plus an up-firing driver for height effects. TCL says it uses a 1.1.1-channel layout, which means it can receive and reproduce one front/surround/rear channel, plus height and low-frequency effects (LFE) channels.

TCL doesn't say how low the Z100's woofer can go, saying only that “low frequencies are optimized and gained, lowering the extension frequency to deliver more thrilling and powerful bass performance.”

You can't configure the Z100 to be part of a multiroom audio setup like you can with a Sonos or Bose soundbar, but you can switch it to Bluetooth mode for direct audio streaming from a phone. Two Z100s can be stereo-paired. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth mode isn't managed by Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, so you may want to think carefully about speaker position if you use it frequently.

Unlike soundbars and AV receivers, which typically override a TV's internal speakers, Dolby Atmos FlexConnect incorporates them, channeling content and frequencies in a way that works with the rest of the speakers in the system. Presumably, most of that content will be center channel (dialog, key sound effects), with the wireless speakers filling in as needed.

Our brief demo paired a TCL QM8K (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with three Z100 speakers and a single Z100-SW subwoofer. Two Z100 units were positioned on either side of the TV, slightly toward the main seating area, with the third placed behind us, on the right side of the room. Each sat on an end table, a little lower than shoulder height when seated. Setup and calibration were performed onscreen via the remote control (Dolby's 2024 demos used a smartphone app) and took less than two minutes.

The TV's onboard microphones detected the presence and position of each speaker. We had to be careful not to stand between the speakers and the TV during this phase, otherwise the system couldn't complete the setup. The only manual part of the process was telling the TV how far away it was from the main listening position.

Dolby's demo playlist included one of its own Atmos trailers called “Nature's Fury,” a movie scene designed to show off the system's reproduction of dialog (The Two Popes) and its immersive surround sound (Top Gun: Maverick), plus two Dolby Atmos music videos (Billie Eilish's “Bury a Friend” and Elton John's “Rocket Man”).

Overall, the system sounded good. There was plenty of dialog clarity, and the Z100 speakers provided a strong sense of surround sound. Height effects were harder for me to detect, but in fairness, I'm not super-familiar with what the Top Gun: Maverick scene should sound like (the one where Maverick's squadron comes under missile fire following its successful destruction of a target).

Low-frequency effects were pronounced—the dedicated sub no doubt helping out a lot—but they weren't especially nuanced or defined. It made me wonder if the Dolby Atmos FlexConnect calibration is focused more on speaker placement than room correction.

In the end, it was the two music tracks that impressed me most. Dolby Atmos Music, thanks to its 3D soundstage, is inherently immersive. You can get some of that flavor via headphones through binaural rendering, but nothing beats listening to discrete speakers in an open space.

The system did a fantastic job with both tracks. If you're on the fence about Atmos Music, you owe it to yourself to hear it from a setup like TCL's implementation of Dolby Atmos FlexConnect.

Unfortunately, we didn't hear the TCL FlexConnect system without a subwoofer. We also didn't get to experiment with a variety of speaker placements and numbers. The one change I was able to ask for moved the rear Z100 from the side of the room to directly behind our seating position. It had the desired effect of balancing out the surround channels—but was this the result of FlexConnect's algorithmic magic or simply moving the speaker?

This wasn't meant to be a full test of the system's capabilities, so I won't try to render a verdict. What I can say is that if you bought our demo system, it would run you $1,700. For that kind of dough, you could pick up one of several excellent soundbar alternatives from Sonos, Bose, LG, JBL, Sennheiser, or Samsung.

On the other hand, TCL is famous for street prices that fall well below its “official” prices. If that pattern continues, you could find this system for a lot less—a potentially compelling deal, especially for aesthetic folks who hate cables and big speaker systems.

I think Dolby has a winning formula with Atmos FlexConnect. Being able to choose the number and placement of your home theater speakers, set them up in under five minutes, control it all through your TV remote, and still get a decent, immersive experience? That's going to appeal to a lot of folks, even if it turns out to be not quite as immersive as the alternative. Everybody likes options.

On July 18, after more than a decade of legal uncertainty, US lawmakers finally brought part of the crypto industry into the regulatory fold. The newly signed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act requires issuers of stablecoins—cryptocurrencies that claim a value tied to a more stable asset—to fully back their tokens with cash or short-term Treasury bonds, submit to audits, and follow anti-money laundering rules, among other conditions. In an effort to cement stablecoins as a form of “digital cash” rather than a place to park money, the law also bars stablecoin issuers from paying interest.

But crucially, the law doesn't ban crypto exchanges from offering customers rewards on their stablecoin holdings, meaning stablecoin holders are still able to receive financial incentives that look a lot like interest. Today, Coinbase customers can earn a 4.1 percent annual reward if they hold a stablecoin called USDC on the platform. The return is similar to what customers might expect from a high-yield savings account.

Banking industry groups say this represents a major regulatory loophole and could push people to take their money out of banks and put it in crypto exchanges, which continue to be far less regulated. Some crypto exchanges offer higher rewards than what's available from a high-yield savings account (while rates vary, many offer an annual yield of 4.25 percent). Kraken, for example, promotes 5.5 percent “rewards on your USDC holdings.”

Even without rewards, stablecoins pose a potential risk for consumers compared to bank deposits and cash. Unlike checking or savings accounts, cryptocurrencies are not FDIC-insured, meaning that if a stablecoin issuer collapses, the US government won't directly step in to make consumer deposits whole.

Some regulators and crypto advocates say the GENIUS Act's stringent reserve requirements and bankruptcy protections obviate the need for FDIC insurance. But stablecoins have collapsed in the past, and research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggests even the “least volatile” stablecoins, like the ones now the standard under GENIUS, “rarely trade exactly at par” to the value they claim to have. This brings into question “stablecoins' ability to serve as a reliable means of payment,” BIS researchers write.

Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City suggests increased demand for stablecoins could have knock-on effects for the economy. “If stablecoins are purchased out of bank deposit accounts, that necessarily means that there are less funds available for banks to loan,” says Stefan Jacewitz, assistant vice president of the Kansas City Fed. He says incentives like rewards “could induce shifts in funding that are faster and larger than they would have been otherwise.”

In April, the Treasury Department released a report suggesting consumers may move as much as $6.6 trillion out of bank deposits and into stablecoins, partially as a result of the GENIUS Act. If that happens, it could reduce the funds banks have available to lend, and consumers and businesses may face higher borrowing costs in the long run, according to research by the American Bankers Association (ABA), a prominent industry group.

Crypto advocates see things differently. They claim stablecoin rewards create healthy market pressure and could drive big banks to provide more competitive interest rates in an effort to keep customer deposits.

“To call this a trillion-dollar fight would be an understatement: This is highly fraught territory that banks have jealously guarded,” says former Republican Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, who served as Chair of the House Financial Services Committee until January 2025.

A study commissioned by Coinbase predicts a maximum decrease in banks' deposits of 6.1 percent. Looking at community banks specifically, the report does not find a statistically significant effect on deposits under what it sees as likelier market-growth projections for stablecoins. Meanwhile, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, the issuer of USDC, has written that “today's generation of successful stablecoins have increased dollar deposits in the U.S. and global banking system,” adding that the prohibition on interest from stablecoin issuers represents “a measure that would protect the deposit base.”

In the four years it took to push stablecoin legislation over the finish line, most lawmakers in Congress agreed that stablecoin issuers should not pay interest. “The drafters understood that [stablecoins are] a different kind of instrument: digital cash, a digital dollar, not a security instrument that provides a return,” says Corey Then, deputy general counsel of global policy at Circle.

In March, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong weighed in. On X, he suggested customers should be allowed to earn interest on stablecoins. He likened the arrangement to “an ordinary savings account, without the onerous disclosure requirements and tax implications imposed by securities laws.”

The rest of the story—as told by Ron Hammond, who recently worked as a senior lobbyist on behalf of the Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto industry group—goes something like this: Eventually, the banking industry agreed to a deal, which included the sought-after prohibition on stablecoin issuers paying interest. But the provision still left some room for crypto exchanges to provide users with a monetary incentive for holding stablecoins. Hammond says some crypto companies had hoped interest would be explicitly allowed, but prominent crypto groups were willing to agree to a compromise.

“The world of crypto, at the very least, was successful in getting language that opens the door for them to provide some type of reward that either is yield or something that resembles yield,” says McHenry, the former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, who now serves as the vice-chair of Ondo, a blockchain-focused financial markets company.

The fact that banking industry groups are now sounding the alarm about stablecoins frustrates some crypto industry experts. “Raising concerns about stablecoin rewards at this stage feels disingenuous and overlooks the extensive debate that shaped the GENIUS Act,” says Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, a crypto-focused advocacy and lobbying group. “Banking industry representatives were fully engaged throughout the process, alongside crypto stakeholders, and the final language, which permits stablecoin-related rewards offered by exchanges and affiliated platforms, was a direct product of those discussions.”

The crypto industry might have been willing to compromise in part because it didn't want to expend too much political capital on a bill it viewed as a test case for broader crypto regulation. “The concern for the crypto industry was, ‘If we start having hiccups with the stablecoin bill—the easy bill—the odds of us getting past it significantly go down, and then the odds of us getting to the market structure bill are near zero for these next two years,'” Hammond says.

The bill he is referring to is what's known as the CLARITY Act, which attempts to create a regulatory framework for products and financial platforms operating on the blockchain, much like the laws already governing traditional financial entities like stock markets, banks, and institutional investors. The act has passed in the House; a Senate version of the bill is expected in September. Days after the GENIUS Act was signed, Senate drafters of the CLARITY Act published a request for information that asks whether legislation should limit or prohibit systems like stablecoin rewards.

The CLARITY Act gives both the crypto and banking industries a second chance to push through provisions that did not make it into the GENIUS Act. Paul Merski, executive vice president of congressional relations for the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), community banks' primary lobbying and advocacy group, says the ICBA will fight any language that threatens “the underlying premise of not paying interest”—which he claims the GENIUS Act provided. “We addressed it in the bill that addressed stablecoin issuers, and we'll make sure it's addressed in the market structure legislation as well, so it doesn't create a loophole,” he says.

“Here's the problem with having two legislative packages move at different speeds: The losers in the last round will come back for another round, and the winners will have to relitigate,” says McHenry. ”So we're back for round two, where everything is relitigated from round one. It makes round two more difficult.”

As the CLARITY Act moves through Congress, banks are also making their own public moves into stablecoins. Citigroup and Bank of America have signaled that they may issue their own stablecoins. Meanwhile, PNC Bank and JPMorganChase have launched partnerships with Coinbase. In JPMorgan's case, this partnership allows customers to directly link their bank accounts to their crypto wallets as soon as next year.

JPMorgan is also piloting a “deposit token” system, which features much of the same technology as stablecoins without the need to shore up the token's reserves at a 1:1 ratio, which is a requirement for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act. Ultimately, if the CLARITY Act results in a ban on stablecoin “rewards,” banks may regain the upper hand in the possibly multi-trillion-dollar fight over deposits and the interest rates accompanying them.

“The banking trades clearly missed it and GENIUS got past them, and they rarely let something like that happen,” McHenry says. “I think they're back: They're back in a hardcore way, and the stakes are high.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Survey Finds 30% of iPhone Owners Mulling Move to Rivals' Foldables","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/survey-finds-30-of-iphone-owners-mulling-move-to-rivals-foldables-179897.html","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:01:48 GMT","

A survey released Monday by a trade-in comparison website found that 30% of iPhone owners are “considering” switching to foldable phones by Apple's competitors if the company waits until 2026 to launch a foldable of its own.

According to the survey by SellCell, 20.1% of iPhone owners would consider switching to a Samsung foldable and 10.2% to a Google one if Apple waits until next year to introduce its take on the form factor.

The survey of more than 2,000 U.S. iPhone owners also found that 3.3% were waiting for an iPhone foldable before upgrading to their next iPhone.

Nevertheless, the survey suggested a strong upgrade cycle ahead for Apple, with 68.3% of iPhone owners saying they will be buying an iPhone 17, which is expected to be announced next week.

“We don't see the lack of a foldable product significantly impacting Apple's iPhone unit sales,” said William Kerwin, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar Research Services in Chicago.

“We continue to see foldable phones as a relative market niche, with high price points and low volumes,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This is part of why Apple has held off on the form factor so far.”

“Additionally,” he continued, “the foldable screens have thus far lacked the quality Apple would require to release its own. We think they will come out with a foldable, but expect it to be a lower-volume product compared to the flagship iPhone lineup.”

“We don't see a future foldable hampering sales for the iPhone 17 lineup this fall,” he added. “In fact, we expect Apple to release a thin version of the iPhone that could get consumers excited about a new form factor for the first time in a few years.”

Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that “considering” switching was a weak measure for measuring loyalty. “There's a big leap between considering and actually switching,” he told TechNewsWorld.

He also doubted that 30% of iPhone owners would switch because “nowhere near 30% of even high-end Android users are choosing foldables.”

“We don't see a massive shift from iOS to Android or from iPhones to foldables,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for EMEA devices at IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass.

“The numbers on foldables are still very low,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The percentage of foldables is less than 2% of the 1.2 billion smartphones sold every year. We expect that to grow faster when Apple launches a foldable device.”

“But at the moment, we don't see the intentions of those responding to the survey materializing in real sales,” he noted.

This is another case of the market waiting for Apple to verify this form factor, he added. “I'm sure there's a lot more users waiting for Apple to launch their foldable device rather than rushing now to a foldable from Samsung or other vendors,” he said. “If someone is on iOS, it's very hard for them to move to Android, as well as when someone is on Android, it's quite hard to adapt to iOS.”

Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., explained that foldable smartphones are a niche market worldwide.

“In 2023, they accounted for approximately 1.4% of the overall smartphone market,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This share is expected to slightly increase to 1.5% in 2024. The market share is projected to exceed 2% only by 2025.”

Current U.S. iPhone model shares show that larger-screen formats like Pro Max and Plus already make up more than a third of sales, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a market research firm in Chicago.

Foldables remain a niche, but they're growing steadily, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas.

“Samsung has done the heavy lifting in normalizing the format, and Google has followed with its Pixel Fold and has made enormous engineering inroads on its hinge designs,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Still, foldables make up a small percentage of overall smartphone shipments, mostly appealing to early adopters and power users.”

While foldables are a niche market, Apple's pace in embracing the form factor, as indicated by the SellCell survey, has frustrated many of its faithful. “The SellCell survey reveals a palpable sense of impatience,” Vena said. “About a third of iPhone users are at least open to switching if Apple delays too long. That signals not mass rebellion, but enough frustration that Apple can't ignore it.”

He acknowledged, however, that the foot-dragging was “characteristic of Apple at its best.” “The company typically waits until a new category is mature before jumping in,” he explained. “Foldables are still ironing out durability, cost, and software optimization issues. Apple wants to deliver a foldable that feels polished from day one, not like a tech experiment.”

Creative Strategies' Bajarin agreed. “Apple is very disciplined and will only bring one out when they believe they can have one that is worthy of their brand,” he said. “There are still issues with foldable screens and other areas that emerge over time. Apple would want the technology to meet their high standards, and that is why they have not released one yet.”

“Apple is unlikely to release a foldable until they have a guarantee that they're not going to see a wave of returns,” added Andrew Cornwall, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.

“Traditionally, iPhone users have been a lot less willing to overlook UX imperfections,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They may not be as accepting of a line down the middle of the screen as their Android counterparts.”

“The SellCell survey appears to demonstrate some discontent, although we'd describe it as curiosity about foldable phones rather than unhappiness with the current iPhone models,” observed Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

“Upgrade intent is difficult to understand,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Consumers want new stuff all the time, so we prefer to look at actual behavior.”

“Apple makes significant form factor changes, like to a foldable phone, only when it is absolutely certain it has mastered the tech,” he added. “Until now, and probably for the time being, foldable phones are more of a novelty than a critical part of their model lineup.”

It's only this year that “no compromise” foldables, such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, the Magic E5, the Pixel, and others, have been introduced in the market, explained IDC's Jeronimo. “We believe the category will grow much faster,” he continued. “And that's why Apple is entering the market at the right time next year. It wouldn't make sense to bring a foldable device to market when the technology was not yet ready, and there probably wasn't enough demand for them to sell in large volumes.”

“Apple may end up redefining the foldable space when it finally enters, much as it did with smartwatches and tablets — much to the ironic chagrin of Samsung,” added Vena. “The question is less whether Apple will make a foldable, and more whether it can make one mainstream. When that happens, foldables could go from niche curiosity to everyday device.”

NewDays, a Seattle startup using a generative AI therapy to treat people with mild dementia, today announced $7 million in funding to expand its service.

The company offers telehealth visits with clinicians once or twice a month combined with frequent, personalized conversations with an AI companion called Sunny. 

“We've had this large group of people that for the longest time has been told there is no cure, there is no drug that can fix your disease, there is no drug that can stop your disease,” said co-founder Babak Parviz. “Basically, you cannot do anything, just live with it … And what we're saying is that there is hope so you can actually take charge and meaningfully, actually do things that can make your life better and make life better for your loved ones.”

Parviz, who serves as CEO, launched the startup last year with Chief Innovation Officer Daniel Kelly. Parviz was a vice president at Amazon where he led the company's Grand Challenge initiative to discover new areas of operation. Prior to that role, he was at Google X and ran the Google Glass team. Kelly previously oversaw engineering teams at Amazon and Google X.

Both have dementia in their families and were eager to apply their tech expertise to providing care to people suffering from these diseases.

The need to support seniors with cognitive decline is massive. An estimated one-third of Americans 65 and older have either dementia or mild cognitive impairment, said the NewDays team. 

In a pilot project including more than 1,000 users, participants gave the startup's service a 4.5 out of 5 approval rating and 100% of respondents said they felt “better” or “a lot better” after using the program. The pilot ran in Washington, California and Florida and the service is now being offered in Texas as well.

NewDays' strategy for care is based on research from the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT), a study that provided virtual chats between healthcare providers and elderly participants that was led by a Harvard Medical School scientist. 

The project showed demonstrable benefits, slowing cognitive decline and reducing loneliness. But a model using human clinicians isn't scalable to serve the millions of Americans alone who need treatment and the costs would be prohibitive.

So NewDays offers AI-generated conversations that aim to mimic the treatment provided in I-CONECT.

As Parviz explains, the startup took clinically proven interventions and assigned 90%-95% of the work to AI while including a human clinician to supervise the care to make sure it's tailored and appropriate. The team has not conducted studies to determine efficacy.

The AI-led conversations are personalized to users and provide specific types of therapies including cognitive stimulation, cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation. The chats with Sunny will cover a users' interests and reminiscences. They'll practice skills needed in day-to-day life, like remembering a series of questions that come up naturally in conversations with friends and family. 

“We don't want to be a substitute for their social connections,” Parviz said. “We want to be an amplifier there and sort of the builder of confidence, so they can actually practice with us and then go to do more human-to-human conversations.”

Kelly said that his father has moderate dementia and enjoys talking with Sunny during stretches of 30 minutes or more. For his dad, the AI chats are a safe, non-judgmental place for interactions.

“He knows that this is a piece of software and he can open up to it and not be worried about making mistakes or repeating himself, and it just kind of allows him a lot of freedom to have conversations in ways that he might refrain from when he's interacting with other people,” Kelly said.

Another important benefit is Sunny is so engaging that Kelly's mom gets a break from caregiving during that time. 

People anywhere can try Sunny for free. The sessions with clinicians cost $150 per visit and unlimited use of Sunny is $99 per month. The service with clinicians is currently limited to Washington, California, Florida and Texas with plans for expansion.

NewDays' leaders said they do not share outside of the company any data collected in the conversations unless it's needed for someone's care.

Another startup using AI to deliver care to seniors called CloudMind is testing its technology in residential memory care homes. Multiple startups are offering AI-supported services for general mental health therapy and mindfulness, including Wysa, Woebot, Headspace and others.

Seattle's Madrona Venture Group and San Francisco's General Catalyst provided the seed round funding.

Fizz, the college social app, is expanding into grocery delivery thanks to a new partnership with Gopuff, the startup told TechCrunch exclusively. The partnership will allow students to order anything from late-night snacks to weekly groceries directly within the Fizz app in as fast as 15 minutes, Fizz says.

Founded in 2021, Fizz is available at more than 620 campuses across the United States, with over 27 million posts shared to date. The social platform allows students to connect anonymously with others at their university. Fizz also features a marketplace where users can buy and sell items locally. 

Fizz co-founder and CEO Teddy Solomon told TechCrunch in an email that the startup's expansion into grocery delivery was a long time coming, as users had been asking for the feature for some time.

He says that students are already using Fizz to buy and sell through the Fizz Marketplace and to coordinate group food and beverage delivery, so it made sense to make grocery delivery possible through the app. 

Solomon also believes it was a natural fit for Fizz to partner with Gopuff, since it's also a service that was founded by and for college students and is popular among a younger customer base. 

“Gopuff was founded by college students and has long had a strong presence on campuses, so the synergy with Fizz was clear,” Solomon said. “We share the same Gen Z DNA, and once conversations began, it was obvious this partnership would be a great fit. By combining Fizz's community and extreme distribution with Gopuff's ability to deliver essentials instantly, we are making student life easier.”

While students could already order groceries through Gopuff directly, Fizz says the new integration allows for more convenience. Additionally, the Fizz Store features pre-selected collections of groceries to make it easier to shop for essentials. Examples of these include the Gym, Study Fuel, and Rush bags. 

Despite adding a marketplace and grocery delivery, Fizz says it's still a social app and will always be one. 

“As platforms like Instagram and TikTok have gone all in on entertainment (only 7% of content consumed on Instagram is from friends), Fizz has continued to be the most powerful community for shared experiences and identities,” Solomon said. “Features like the Fizz Store are a direct extension of the core experience, and help to fulfill Fizz's mission of being the social app for the 99% of life that is not on Instagram and TikTok.”

In terms of the future, Solomon says Fizz will continue to expand to new campuses and markets. Fizz also plans to expand its social features while focusing on authenticity and community. 

Fizz shared that in the past month, it has quadrupled its daily active users, launched on 250+ new campuses, and broken its one-day registration record 12 days in a row.

The startup has raised $41 million in funding to date.

Finnish quantum computing startup IQM is now a unicorn: The company just raised more than $300 million in a Series B funding round that was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. investment firm focused on cybersecurity.

A university spinout, IQM builds quantum computers meant for on-premises installations as well as a cloud platform that taps this hardware. The company has already sold its quantum computers to enterprises in APAC and the U.S., but its strongest market remains Europe. 

That's what this round is intended to change: The startup is planning to use the fresh cash for both a commercial push as well as R&D to align with the market's evolving understanding of what's needed to turn advances in quantum science into practical impact.

To win U.S. clients in the face of competition from big tech companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft, IQM knows it must accelerate its roadmap for both hardware and software. According to its co-CEO and co-founder Jan Goetz, this means investing more in the company's chip fabrication facilities, as well as in software development and error correction research.

Error correction, the ability to detect and fix errors inherent in quantum systems, is a hot topic right now, given that the very notion of what makes a quantum computer competitive is being redefined — being able to compute a large number of qubits is less of a holy grail today than it used to be. “It's always a trade-off between number of qubits and quality and reliability,” Goetz said.

Navigating this trade-off will be critical for developing real-world uses for quantum computing that have long been envisioned but weren't prioritized. But now that quantum advances over traditional supercomputers no longer seem the stuff of sci-fi, companies like IQM are trying to make sure their computers will have practical applications sooner than later.

Reliability aside, IQM's roadmap aligns with the sector's growing focus on the software layer that will be required to put quantum computing in the hands of its first end users: experts with PhDs in fields that are not quantum computing.

An immediate software-related objective for IQM is to build a developer platform that, Goetz says, is akin to “an SDK for quantum computing,” with the goal to “bring in as many developers as possible to start working on our machines.” As an alternative to IBM's approach, this platform will rely on Qrisp, an open source project by Berlin-based research institute FOKUS. 

Second to its headquarters in Finland, Germany is where most of IQM's 300 staffers are located, with a large R&D unit working out of Munich, Goetz said. “But with this round, we want to grow the team and create more commercial traction, especially in the U.S.”

In the future, the company is considering becoming “a bit more operational in the U.S.,” said Goetz, adding that tariffs could play a role in this decision. “One thing that we are considering is that if we sell more systems in the U.S., we could do local assembly.”

But IQM will remain focused on sales in the U.S. for the time being. The company recently sold an on-premise quantum computer to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a science lab run by the U.S. Department of Energy. 

According to Ten Eleven Ventures' co-founder and managing general partner, Alex Doll, there's a strong overlap between the investment firm's thesis and IQM's focus. “Quantum computing will be a pivotal pillar in the next era of cybersecurity and computational innovation,” said Doll, who is also joining IQM's board as part of the fundraise. 

The fact that Ten Eleven Ventures has a strong network in the U.S. made it a strong fit for the startup, Goetz said.

The Series B also saw investment from Finnish investment firm Tesi, as well as Schwarz Group, Winbond Electronics Corporation, EIC, Bayern Kapital, and World Fund. Per IQM, this new round brings its total funding to date to $600 million.

Goetz feels the size of the round was justified by the commercial and technical milestones that the startup hit in the last few months. “We are now the company that has sold the most quantum computers globally, in all major continents,” he said.

In absolute numbers, that's still small — in late 2024, the company hit a production milestone of 30 quantum computers. That only serves to remind that the sector still has a long way to go before it reaches a wider audience.

Still, IQM's 54-qubit chips are already in use at computing centers, research labs, universities, and enterprises, and Goetz said that the company is now on track to deploying the first 150-qubit systems — a fact that seems to matter much more to him than IQM becoming a unicorn.

During a press conference on Monday, Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, showed off a Huawei smartphone that China's President Xi Jinping gifted him, calling it “the best phone in the world,” and making a bold claim.

“The Americans can't hack it, neither their spy planes, nor their satellites,” Maduro said. 

The phone looked like a Mate X6, a foldable phone released by Huawei in 2024. 

Obviously, nothing is impossible to hack, and even less so by U.S. government hackers, who are considered some of the best in the world. 

A U.S.-based vulnerability researcher told TechCrunch that because Huawei makes its own hardware, as well as its own mobile operating system — HarmonyOS — its devices are easier to hack. 

“There's bound to be many more mistakes in their brand-new code than in iOS and Android at this time,” said the researcher, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive issues. 

HarmonyOS — like any software in the world — has had bugs and needs regular security updates. In the case of the Mate X6, Huawei promises monthly security patches but also notes that “the number of device models with monthly security patch updates is subject to change. Certain carriers may only support updates on a quarterly basis.”

Last month alone, Huawei patched 60 bugs in HarmonyOS, 13 of which were classified as “high severity” bugs. 

Huawei acknowledges that malware can get on its devices and has a page dedicated to helping customers who may have gotten their devices hacked. 

Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. 

There is a documented history of U.S. government hackers targeting Huawei. In 2014, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had hacked and hid backdoors inside Huawei servers in China. The hack was so bad that NSA spies got all the way inside Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen, which allowed them to spy on company executives' communications and get information about its products. 

“Many of our targets communicate over Huawei-produced products,” the NSA document said, according to The New York Times. “We want to make sure that we know how to exploit these products,” it added, to “gain access to networks of interest” around the world.

Even though that was in 2014, it is almost certain that the NSA, U.S. Cyber Command, and others have the mission to hack Huawei devices and find vulnerabilities in them for espionage purposes. There are likely U.S. government employees whose only job is to hack Huawei devices and systems. Earlier this year, the Chinese government accused the NSA of targeting Chinese critical infrastructure.

Apple is hosting its “Awe dropping” hardware event on Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT. The company is expected to announce its iPhone 17 lineup, which could include a slimmer version, as well as updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. 

The keynote will take place at Apple Park in Cupertino. Viewers can tune in to the livestream here or watch it on Apple's website. As usual, TechCrunch will be covering the event, so stay tuned for news.

There have been numerous rumors surrounding the upcoming iPhone lineup. Taking center stage is the rumored iPhone 17 Air, which could replace the Plus model and would be notably thinner than any previous iPhone model.

Additionally, the iPhone 17 is expected to feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen and a 120Hz display, a big boost from the existing 60Hz. It's also speculated to include a 24-megapixel front camera.

The Pro model may receive a significant redesign on the back of the device, too. Instead of a square-shaped camera bump on the left, there could be a rectangular camera bar extending across the width of the ‌iPhone‌, with the flash and lidar sensor on the right. 

Apple may also provide more details about the public release of iOS 26, which introduces a Liquid Glass interface that offers a more transparent look.

Amid lawsuits alleging child safety concerns, online gaming service Roblox announced on Wednesday that it's expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to provide age and content ratings for the games and apps on its platform.

The company said that by year's end, the age-estimation system will be rolled out to all Roblox users who access the company's communication tools, like voice and text-based chat. This involves scanning users' selfies and analyzing facial features to estimate age.

This age-estimation tech is combined with other systems, including ID age verification and verified parental consent, to provide a more accurate measure of a user's age, Roblox says — especially when compared with simply having kids type in a birth year when they create an account. The company notes that it's also planning to launch systems that will further limit communications between adults and minors on its platform.

Meanwhile, the company's partnership with IARC will see Roblox replacing its own content and maturity labels with those used by rating agencies worldwide. That means users in the U.S. will see ratings from the ESRB, while other countries will see those used by their own ratings authorities. Players in the Republic of Korea will see ratings from GRAC; players in Germany will see ratings from the USK; and players elsewhere in Europe and the United Kingdom will see ratings from the PEGI, for instance.

This system is meant to help parents better understand what sort of games their kids are playing, based on factors that could raise concerns, like whether game content features blood or gore, violence, substances, gambling, adult language, and more.

These updates follow earlier moves the company announced in July, designed to better protect younger users. 

Roblox introduced a series of safety features, including the age-verification system that analyzes users' ages via video selfies. This information is used to prevent users younger than 13 from accessing certain features within Roblox, like the ability to voice and text chat without filters. Roblox also prevents users ages 13 to 17 from adding users to their “trusted connections” unless they know them in real life — something Roblox verified through contact imports or QR code scans.

The move also follows the rollout of increasingly strict laws and regulations around the world that require social platforms to verify users' ages, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and Mississippi's age-assurance law, which has already seen social network Bluesky stop serving users in the state. Similar laws are in various stages in other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia.

Roblox has invested in safety features over the years as well.

Among its tools is Roblox Sentinel, an open source AI system designed to detect early signals of child endangerment. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when there are servers where a large number of users are breaking its rules, so it can take them down.

Despite the company's efforts, child predators still manage to access the platform and target children, according to complaints filed by Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill and in other lawsuits across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

In addition, The Guardian recently reported on a research study that discovered that kids on Roblox's service can still easily come across inappropriate content and interact with bad actors.

More recently, a popular Roblox farming simulator game, Grow a Garden, made headlines because its players began buying and selling its virtual items on online marketplaces for real money, in violation of the platform's rules. Parents and others raised concerns that the game was luring in children, then pushing them to spend cash to keep up with other players.

The changes to the ratings system may not put an end to all these bad experiences, but it could at least provide parents with more insight about the games their kids are playing. 

“Roblox is committed to creating a safe platform for our users and empowering parents to make the best decision for their children,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, in a prepared statement. “We're excited to partner with IARC and hope it will provide parents globally with more clarity and confidence regarding age-appropriate content.”

Invites to Perplexity's new AI-powered web browser, Comet, are one of the web's hottest commodities these days. The new product was made available first to the AI firm's $200-per-month Max subscribers and a small group of invitees. But now there's a new way to jump ahead on the waitlist. On Wednesday, PayPal announced it's giving its customers, including PayPal and Venmo users, early access to Comet as well as a free year's subscription to Perplexity's premium service, Perplexity Pro, normally $200 per year.

The browser, launched in July, offers an integrated AI assistant, AI-generated summaries of search results, product comparisons, and other features. 

While typically a co-marketing relationship isn't news, it's worth paying attention to this deal because of PayPal's ability to position Comet in front of millions of U.S. customers, and later, even more globally. 

The arrangement is part of an expanded partnership between PayPal and the AI provider, which benefits both companies in different ways. Earlier this summer, the two companies partnered on agentic commerce on Perplexity's platform, allowing PayPal or Venmo to check out instantly when they asked the AI to find products, book travel, or buy tickets.

For PayPal, the deal also has the potential to draw users to its apps with the promise of the Comet invite and free subscription, while also calling attention to a new subscriptions hub feature, which provides a single destination where users can view and manage their recurring subscriptions. (Alongside this, PayPal is running a promotion that pays out $50 to customers who link and pay for at least three subscriptions through its service.)

Meanwhile, Perplexity gains increased exposure at a time when AI agents are battling for attention, and AI-powered browsers are aiming to disrupt a market currently dominated by Chrome. It could also help Perplexity gain more paid subscribers, as users may either forget to cancel or actively decide to stay subscribed when the free year of Perplexity Pro is up.

To receive the free 12-month subscription and Comet invite, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to access the offer directly in their respective apps. Users only get one invite per PayPal account, and they can't already be Perplexity Pro customers. 

“Our partnership with Perplexity gives PayPal and Venmo customers early access to one of the most anticipated AI browsers and dynamic subscriptions,” said Diego Scotti, general manager of the Consumer Group at PayPal, in a prepared statement. “It's exciting to deliver offers and tools that our customers request most, meeting their needs and helping them navigate their financial lives with greater simplicity, added convenience, and even more rewards.”

The offer is valid through the end of 2025 and is only available to U.S. customers at launch, PayPal notes. It will roll out to international markets later in the month. After customers sign up for Perplexity Pro, they'll receive information on how to immediately download and install the Comet browser. 

The subscriptions hub is available this week to all U.S. customers after a prior ramp-up period.

I'd hazard this goes both ways, too.  That is, it is not just in terms of how much the computer is capable of doing, but what the real world systems being modeled can do.  For a fun example, you can make a sorting network that can sort integers on a computer rapidly, but that doesn't necessarily help you sort a physical quantity of anything.  Is akin to making a computer that can win a game of chess, but only if the human moves the pieces for it.All too often, people present programs as if they are truths independent of either model or computer.  Which is doubly wrong as they are constrained by the model of the language they are implemented in, as well as being dependent on the model of whatever problem they are describing.

I feel like some authors would really benefit from writing a first draft and then condensing it down to 1/n. In this case, like 1/10.The author has an interesting and explicit model as a table for how to classify some languages. Everything else is either fluff or should be a separate article. For example, you either assume we're talking about moder languages, or your model needs to be way broader and more theoretical. Tangents about days when langauges were tied (at least way more than today) to hardware were unnecessary.  That also goes for the biased way the author talks about their favorite languages.It's also rife with things that, quite frankly speaking - I don't know what the hell they're talking about. It's almost like satire about how Haskellers are so clueless that they never think about run-time considerations. Or meandering thoughts on language theory (gotta drop in references to random wiki articles somehow I guess) about how it shapes our thoughts which don't amount to much because they say nothing interesting because they keep it too vague where the real answer is it depends. Or the loaded statements the author makes about Rust (in an honestly confusing way by framing it through the paretto front). Rust does not have the same guarantees as something with GC like Java. Even if you disagree with me on that, we should at least agree that this isn't as settled as the author makes it out to be.

As someone who was interested in this article primarily to figure out what Rust got particularly right... the article seems uninterested in actually fulfilling that promised content.

When I saw the title for the fifth episode of Alien: Earth, it seemed too good to be true. Could the episode actually live up to the implications of its title? Were we about to get a brand-new, full-fledged Alien movie in the comfort of our home? Thankfully, the answer to both those questions is “Yes.” The fifth episode of Alien: Earth saw creator Noah Hawley deliver his own version of an Alien movie in the confines of his show, and it was familiar, fascinating, and fraught with tension. Let's discuss.



That aforementioned episode title is “In Space, No One…” a wink at the tagline of the original 1979 Ridley Scott Alien. The full phrase goes, “In space, no one can hear you scream,” and the episode had plenty of screaming as we jumped back in time to explain exactly what happened on the USCSS Maginot that made it crash into Earth.

One of the many things that made this so great is that Hawley, who both wrote and directed this episode, already set up so much in previous episodes. For example, we know everyone except Morrow is dead. We know that he had a chance to save Zaveri (Richa Moorjani), but he let her get killed by a xenomorph. Oh, right, we also know that there was a xenomorph on board that burst out of the chest of a person in cryosleep and that several of the ship's other creatures also survived the crash. So all of that was just kind of hanging over the episode. Beats we knew we had to hit; it was just a matter of when or how. That delivered almost a new Alien experience, one inspired by the films but more dependent on dramatic irony than pure discovery.

And the episode jumps right into it. Mostly, we follow Morrow, which makes sense as he's still alive and crucial to the rest of the show. He's woken up from cryosleep to be told two creatures are out, the captain is dead, and a fire was set that basically made it impossible for the ship to land properly. As the head of security, he immediately tries to figure out what the hell is going on. Was someone behind this, or was it random? He begins recovering deleted files and going through footage. We also get a flashback of him with his young daughter back on Earth and learn that she died in a fire at the age of 19, only a few years into his trip. He'll have to wait over 50 years to recover her belongings.

With the ship's captain dead, Zaveri is put in charge. When she reports this home, all Weyland-Yutani cares about is one thing: what's the status of the cargo? In fact, Zaveri gets almost cyberbullied by the MUTHUR computer as it repeatedly makes sure that she acknowledges “survival of cargo is top priority.” Nothing else. Basically, the humans are secondary to the aliens.

Plus, those aliens are having a field day all over the ship. Even though the person with the facehugger is put into cryosleep, the facehugger doesn't take, and a xenomorph bursts out and escapes. The creepy slug things escape their containment and drop a bunch of babies into Chibuzo's (Karen Aldridge) water. Fascinatingly, the eyeball octopus notices this and tries to warn Chibuzo about it, but she doesn't react. Eventually, that too escapes and takes a ride in the eyeball of one of the ship's mechanics, Shmuel (played by the great Michael Smiley).

Morrow continues his investigation and discovers two things. One, the ship is being directly sabotaged by someone who is pretending to be asleep. And, most importantly, he learns that this person was hired by Prodigy CEO Boy Kavalier. Morrow finds a video that shows the saboteur Petrovich (Enzo Cilenti) begging Boy to be transferred into a new body. Boy sort of agrees (we know he can't do this with adults, but Petrovich doesn't) as long as Petrovich delivers the Maginot on a collision course to one of his cities.

It's the revelation of all revelations. Boy played dumb as it all went down, but now we know not only was he aware of what was on the Weyland-Yutani ship, but he also orchestrated its crash so that he could steal it all. It's a piece of information that changes everything. And now we also know Morrow is aware of it.

There are a ton of other details throughout the episode, too, but in the grand scheme of things, they are largely inconsequential. Each little thing—like when those babies finally kill the young mechanic or we get to see the eyeball creature fight and bite a xenomorph—adds to the enjoyment and terror of the episode, but it's all tangential. Most of the people die, and we already know the creatures live and escape. All that really matters is that we see Maginot was sabotaged and that it was orchestrated by Boy Kavalier.

Eventually, we work our way back to the moment from the pilot episode when Morrow lets Zaveri die, he reports that everyone else on the ship is dead, and he prepares for the crash. Then, finally, back on Earth, and back in the timeline of the show, we see Morrow meet with Yutani (Sandra Yi Sencindiver) and reveal that he wants to not only recover the creatures but also to kill Boy Kavalier. Yutani tells her team to give him whatever he wants.

In terms of moving the story of Alien: Earth forward, “In Space, No One…” didn't move the needle a lot. It was mostly a big, bold, elaborate story centered on that one massive revelation. But, in terms of giving us a hugely satisfying, seriously terrifying, and massively impressive episode of TV, it delivered and then some. Noah Hawley may be pushing the Alien franchise in a bunch of new ways with this show, but with this specific episode, he tipped his cap back to the masters.

Did you like this episode as much as we did? What do you think are the implications of Boy being behind the crash? Let us know below

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","reMarkable Paper Pro Move Hands-On: A Notebook Lover's Dream Device?","https://gizmodo.com/remarkable-paper-pro-move-hands-on-a-notebook-lovers-dream-device-2000652668","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:57:30 GMT","

Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. People just adore their reMarkable devices. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display.

Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately.

It's a handsome device that works exactly like a smaller version of the Paper Pro. About the only thing that I find a turnoff is the thick, inch-ish tall bezel on the bottom of the 1,696 x 954 color E Ink display. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. On the plus side, the density of the pixels is higher compared to the Paper Pro—264 PPI versus 229 PPI—which means content does appear just a smidge sharper. reMarkable says the Paper Pro Move can render the same 20,000 colors as the Paper Pro.

I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital.

The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. The handwriting-to-text recognition is also hit or miss—even AI can't perfectly convert the worst chicken scratch. Sorry, doctors, your unreadable handwriting is probably still unreadable to artificial intelligence.

 

The Paper Pro Move comes with 64GB of storage, which is good for up to 810 digital notebooks, and is the same amount you get in the Paper Pro. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.”

Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. It's not going to be for everyone—get an iPad if you want a multipurpose tablet that does messaging, videos, games, music, and more—but it's definitely for somebody who wants a focused device for jotting stuff down and will pay for it. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. The Paper Pro Move with Marker costs $449, but there's also a bundle that includes the Marker Plus, which comes with an eraser on the end, for $499. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

In the end, graphic-obsessed gamers only really care about maximizing frame rates. But that's not all gaming laptops are good for. If you ignore the blinking RGB lights most gamer devices stuff into every crevice, they pack high-end CPUs and GPUs built for intensive graphics processing—handy for artists or AI developers. Whereas there are plenty of workstation laptops with high-end specs built for working stiffs, Acer said screw it and gave us a business-centric laptop that looks like a gamer's dream device, even if it packs features players couldn't give a fig for.

The Acer Predator Helios 18P is the latest in the company's tank-like high-end mobile gaming rigs. The new 18-inch laptop—itself a refresh of the Predator Helios 18 announced at CES—packs extra features that would leave most gamers scratching their heads. It's rocking Intel vPro, the chipmaker's business security and management suite. Along with up to a whopping 192GB of ECC memory—a type of RAM that can correct small memory errors (which is important for those working on servers or other critical data infrastructure)—the Predator Helios 18P contains up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 mobile GPU. That CPU and GPU combo offered stellar performance in super-heavy laptops like the MSI Titan 18 HX. The extra business-specific bits and bobs plus the optional up to 6TB of storage would simply be extraneous to anybody who intends to supplant their gaming desktop with a device that's slightly more portable.

See Acer Predator Helios 18P at Amazon

Announced at IFA 2025, there's no price or availability yet, but I can't imagine combining a gaming laptop with a business laptop (normally two of the priciest PC options available today) will make the Predator Helios 18P cheap. At least it will make your games look nice with a 4K mini LED display, though it only runs up to a 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop weighs in at 7.7 pounds, so all you suits with gaming ambitions should start your forearm exercises early. Business types may need to disable all those fancy lights while plugging away in the office, but for work-from-home setups, the Predator Helios 18P could be your one and only PC.

If you were looking for something on the opposite end, Acer's new 16-inch Swift 16 Air seems too light to be real. Despite the Apple-like name, the Swift 16 Air weighs in at less than 1 kg, or 2.18 pounds. That's easily one of the lightest laptops of this size available. It's more frisbee-like than the 2.7-pound 13-inch MacBook Air and is somehow even lighter than the ultrathin Asus Zenbook A14 that first debuted at CES 2025 earlier this year. That laptop was one of the lightest in its class, but Acer's Swift 16 Air, with its magnesium-aluminum shell, has a larger wingspan and still will barely feel like anything in your backpack.

See Acer Swift 16 at Amazon

You can toss the Swift 16 Air around to your heart's content, but eventually you'll need to open it up and use it. The notebook either comes with a 60Hz IPS LCD screen or a 120Hz AMOLED display. The IPS is the lighter of the two options, while the AMOLED version clocks in at 2.43 pounds. Inevitably, you'll want the OLED not just for the deeper blacks and better contrast, but for the higher 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. The Swift 16 Air features up to an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU and 32GB of RAM. All that sounds pretty standard for today's light laptops. Even though the laptop is thin at 16.5mm, there's still a fair number of ports, including two USB-C, one USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.

It's still a very thin and light design, and that will demand some trade-offs. The Acer Swift 16 Air's 50Wh battery seems paltry compared to the Zenbook A14's 70Wh battery. Acer said the Swift 16 Air gets 13 hours of battery life in video playback tests. Real-life experience long ago taught us that real use—even completing regular browsing tasks—will deplete the battery sooner.

That battery life will be one of the biggest concerns for anybody thinking of dropping their money on a new laptop. Unfortunately, Acer isn't ready to share any details about when people in the U.S. can buy the Swift 16 Air or how much it will cost.

If the first trailer for 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple was just the words “Aren't you excited you only had to wait three months to see this footage?” it would be enough. The fact is, in modern Hollywood, it's incredibly rare for a movie to come out in June and for its sequel to be heading to theaters six months later, in January. But that's what happened with 28 Years Later and its sequel, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, which will be out January 16, 2026. And, lucky for us, the trailer is much, much more than a single sentence.

The Bone Temple is directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman, The Marvels) and picks up where Danny Boyle's previous film left off. After Spike (Alfie Williams) decided to leave his family and its safe village to explore the world, he ran into the insane Jimmy (Jack O'Connell) and his jumpsuit-wearing gang. The film will see Spike pulled between Jimmy's world as well as Dr. Kelson's (Ralph Fiennes) world. Here's your first taste.

After Danny Boyle surprised us with this summer's decidedly human follow-up to 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, The Bone Temple definitely seems like a less radical departure. But, we're fine with it, simply because it looks like the next chapter in this story. We follow and learn more about Spike; Dr. Kelson; the terrifying, well-endowed zombie named Samson (Chi Lewis-Parry); and, of course, Jimmy. Jimmy was the first character we encountered in the previous film, and after his surprising return at the end, it'll be very interesting to see where things with him go next.

Oh, and don't forget The Bone Temple is where we'll finally see the return of Jim, the first zombie survivor, played by Oscar winner Cillian Murphy. He shows up at some point in this story and, if this film is a success, will play a larger role in the trilogy capper. Do you think this film is going to do well enough to get there? Let us know below.

Globally popular social media star MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson) is already estimated to be a billionaire, but he doesn't seem to be satisfied with having made an obscene amount of money from YouTube videos. A new report claims that Beast plans to follow in the footsteps of Ryan Reynolds and get into the telecom business.

Business Insider writes that Donaldson has been mulling launching his own phone company. Citing a leaked investor deck, the outlet reports that the company would be a “MrBeast-branded mobile service” that runs atop an existing telecom network, such as Verizon or T-Mobile.  Such a business is called a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, and functions by essentially branding a segment of an existing network—much like Reynolds' Mint Mobile (which runs on the T-Mobile network).

If the product does launch, it may be in 2026, according to the viewed deck, although much about the company remains unclear. Gizmodo reached out to Donaldson for comment. An anonymous source familiar with the plans told BI that “the MrBeast team has been moving forward with a wide range of new initiatives and partnerships and has no specific timeline for its mobile-phone project, which isn't an immediate priority.”

Lately, Donaldson seems to be attempting to expand his empire, and launching a phone business would probably be a good way to do that. The social media mogul's expanded ambitions were revealed earlier this year when CNN reported that he was hoping to buy TikTok. Such a purchase would have made sense, given Donaldson's penchant for viral videos. However, as of this summer, there was no clear winner in the bid to buy the popular app, although Donaldson still appears interested in it.

Donaldson has also faced some legal troubles over the past few years, including a lawsuit from former contestants on his Beast Games that alleged “chronic mistreatment” while participating in the show.

Crucial continues to be a pioneer in the high-end SSD space with the introduction of the T710, the presumed successor to the once 'fastest SSD on the planet,' the T705. How could that drive possibly be one-upped by Crucial, and is the new drive able to retake the crown from the recent and celebrated Sandisk WD_Black SN8100? The T710 certainly has a surprise or two up its sleeve, but as we'll find out, it's not exactly a dragon slayer.

Crucial has taken its high-end T705 design and improved on it with better hardware; in this case, a newer, more efficient controller and a newer generation of TLC flash. As the previous-gen T710 was already pushing the limits of the PCIe 5.0 interface, we can't expect much. Performance is, in fact, relatively similar between the two, although the T710 is, on paper, the fastest 1TB drive available. Improvements come, instead, in the way of much improved power efficiency, which also means significantly less heat output. This is a blessing for laptop and HTPC users in particular.

It's well-known that high-end PCIe 5.0 drives pull a lot of power, to the point that active cooling was recommended for the earliest solutions. With firmware maturity and an air-cooled environment, a passive heatsink was, in most cases, more than sufficient. However, the use of the drive without a heatsink was essentially prohibited. This has changed with the advent of newer, more efficient controller technology, and the T710 is the pinnacle of this development. This is good news for enthusiasts with workstations, content creators, and others who want the fastest storage possible without the normal downsides.

That doesn't mean the T710 is perfect or for everyone who wants a high-end PCIe 5.0 solution. There are faster and less expensive options that achieve the same goal. Those on tighter budgets will likely want to look elsewhere as well. But it's a compelling drive that aptly carves out its own niche.

The Crucial T710 is available at 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB with MSRPs at $179.99, $279.99, and $549.99. For $20 more, you get a heatsink, which is recommended for a PCIe 5.0 performance SSD. Crucial has opted out of offering a lower capacity option, which would not be able to realize the full performance of the SSD controller, and a higher capacity, which would be quite expensive and has proven difficult to achieve at this performance level. These prices are reasonable when compared to competing drives, but they are quite high when compared to PCIe 4.0 drives that offer a similar experience for most users.

The T710 is rated for up to 14,900/13,800 MB/s for sequential reads and writes, and up to 2,200K/2,300 K IOPS for random reads and writes. The 1TB SKU has a higher sequential read rating than the 2TB and 4TB, which is different from the Sandisk WD_Black SN8100 using the same controller. Additionally, the T710 has a significantly higher sequential write speed than the WD_Black SN8100 at 1TB. This is due to a difference in flash – Micron's TLC flash uses six planes for the T710, with greater internal parallelization, while the BiCS8 TLC on the WD_Black SN8100 is four-plane with generally better latency. This means that if you are specifically looking at a 1TB solution that you should opt for the T710 to maximize potential throughput.

Crucial backs the T710 with a standard five-year, 600TB of writes per TB capacity warranty. The drive supports encryption under the TCG Opal 2.01 specification.

Crucial offers two primary pieces of software for the T710: Acronis and the Crucial Storage Executive. The first is a well-known cloning and backup application that is offered by multiple SSD manufacturers. If you would rather use a non-OEM, universal program, we recommend MultiDrive or Clonezilla. The second piece of software is Crucial's SSD toolbox, an all-in-one solution that helps you track drive health and control drive features. For general drive information, we recommend CrystalDiskInfo.

 




The Crucial T710 is a single-sided drive, which means it should be compatible with more systems and can be easier to cool. Due to its increased power efficiency, it should be suitable for use in laptops. Running this drive in a Gen 4 / PCIe 4.0 slot will reduce its bandwidth potential, but the drive will otherwise be fast and even more power efficient. This makes it an option for future-proofing regardless of the system you're using it in, although we would recommend something less expensive for the PlayStation 5. If using the drive in a desktop, we recommend going for the heatsink version of the drive.

 




The T710 is using Silicon Motion's SM2508 controller, also used in the excellent Sandisk WD_Black SN8100, which has proven to be powerful and very efficient. In particular, this is a worthwhile change from early adopter Phison E26-based drives, such as the Crucial T705, which suffered from poor power efficiency, especially at idle. The T710 also utilizes LPDDR4 for its DRAM cache, which may provide a slight power efficiency boost to the drive compared to the WD_Black SN8100's DDR4. We also tested this controller with LPDDR4 but older 232-Layer Micron TLC flash in our Acer Predator GM9000 review.

The choice in flash is an important consideration with a drive of this caliber and should factor into your decision of what drive to get. The GM9000, with its older flash, is likely to be less expensive while providing the bulk of the Gen 5 benefits. The T710, with newer Micron TLC flash, has potentially higher bandwidth potential – especially at 1TB – and better power efficiency. The WD_Black SN8100, using BiCS8 TLC, offers the best latencies. If you want to save money and don't need to worry about power efficiency, then the T705 remains a good choice.

Initially for R&D use, until later this decade where it will transition to production

SK hynix and ASML early on Wednesday announced that they had assembled the industry's first Twinscan NXE:5200B High-NA EUV lithography system at the company's fab M16 in Icheon, South Korea. The device will initially serve as a development vehicle for next-generation process technologies, but eventually it will be used for mass production of DRAM using leading-edge process technologies a few years down the line.

For SK hynix, the assembly of one of the industry's first Twinscan NXE:5200B EUV system with 0.55 numerical aperture optics means that it leaps ahead of its arch-rivals Micron and Samsung as well as the vast majority of companies across the broad semiconductor industry, many of which still must adopt existing EUV systems with a 0.33 numerical aperture.

""We expect the addition of the critical infrastructure to bring our technological vision we have been pursuing into reality,"" Cha Seon Yong, head of R&D at SK hynix. ""We aim to enhance our leadership in the AI memory space with the cutting-edge technology required by the fast-growing AI and next-generation computing markets.""

ASML's Twinscan EXE:5200N with a 0.55 NA lens achieves 8nm resolution — compared to 13nm on current Low-NA EUV tools — enabling 1.7 times smaller transistors and 2.9 times higher transistor density in a single exposure. While Low-NA tools can match this with costly multi-patterning, High-NA EUV simplifies lithography steps, albeit at the cost of new technical challenges.

Given the capabilities of High-NA EUV machines that allow chipmakers to avoid double or triple EUV patterning, the NXE:5200B will initially be used to fast-track prototyping of next-gen DRAMs to be made using process technologies that rely on existing Low-NA EUV and DUV tools. Only then the tool will be used for development of fabrication processes that will actually mandate usage of High-NA EUV equipment for proper yields and cycle time. ASML estimated in one of the presentations for its investors that DRAM makers will transit to High-NA EUV tools in the 2030s.

Rapid prototyping greatly speeds up development of next-generation process technologies. The High-NA EUV machine enables detailed prototyping of DRAM structures (e.g., capacitor trenches, bitlines, wordlines) at a higher pace than is possible on existing Low-NA EUV tools, which gives a critical boost to SK hynix's R&D.

In the long-term future (towards 2030s), SK hynix can use this tool to test patterning limits, develop new layouts, and evaluate new materials it will need for fabrication nodes that obligate usage of High-NA EUV tools, well in advance of needing to commit to full High-NA EUV-based production.

The assembly of ASML's first Twinscan NXE:5200B machine at a client site (in this case SK hynix's M16, which is indeed a mass production facility) marks a milestone for the company as previously it built Twinscan NXE:5000 machines at Intel's D1X development fab near Hillsboro, Oregon, where they have produced tens of thousands of wafers already. The NXE:5000 systems are considered pre-production, but they can be upgraded to gain performance required for high-volume manufacturing.

""High-NA EUV is a critical technology that opens the next chapter of the semiconductor industry,"" said Kim Byeong-Chan, ASML's head of customer team. ""ASML will closely collaborate with SK hynix to bring forward the innovation of the next-generation memory.""

27% increase in GPU shipments, 21.6% increase for CPUs


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The total number of GPUs sold for the second quarter of 2025 hit 11.6 million units, while desktop PC CPUs went up to 21.7 million units according to a Jon Peddie Research report. This is a 27% increase in graphics card shipments and a 21.6% jump in CPU shipments from the last quarter, which is a change from the usual drop in deliveries we've seen in recent years.

“AIB prices dropped for midrange and entry-level, while high-end AIB prices increased, and most retail suppliers ran out of stock. This is very unusual for the second quarter,” said Jon Peddie Research president Dr. Jon Peddie. “We think it is a continuation of higher prices expected due to the tariffs and buyers trying to get ahead of that.”

As for the three major GPU manufacturers, Nvidia still has the lead, taking in 94% of the market — an increase of 2.1% over the previous quarter — while AMD is at a distant second place with 6%. This is still a much better position than Intel, though, whose market share is so small it did not even register on the chart.

Intel was the first to launch its latest-generation GPUs, putting them on sale in December 2024. On the other hand, both Nvidia and AMD released their latest generation GPUs during the first quarter of the year, with the former continuing to release its value models well into the second and third quarters of 2025. However, all these releases were marred by shortages, with buyers unable to find units at SRP. This was true even as late as the start of the third quarter of this year, with prices for mid-range cards not normalizing until last month.

Still, it seems that gamers were willing to spend cash on upgrading their systems, as the data shows. The report even said that the overall attach rate for desktop PCs increased to 154%, meaning 1.54 GPUs were sold for every CPU bought by customers. So, aside from people building totally new PCs (or buying pre-built), it seems that there was also a good number purchasing new graphics cards to upgrade their systems.

Jon Peddie Research suggests that this increase was driven by tariff concerns, especially as the U.S. government has been announcing and delaying massive import taxes on many semiconductor products, including GPUs. Despite this, the research firm anticipates that the GPU market will decrease by 5.4% between 2024 and 2028.

If the projected shrinkage of the market holds, this increase is likely a temporary blip driven by tariffs and the artificial GPU shortage. This slump could be driven by several factors, including gamers leaving (or even not getting introduced to) PC gaming or the arrival of processors with powerful on-board graphics, like AMD's Strix Halo chips.

Nvidia CEO was in Taiwan for 13 hours.

Two weeks ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a surprise visit to Taiwan where he met TSMC for a few hours. It was a short stay but it sparked customary rumors pertaining to why he was there. Originally, it was thought to be just a routine check-up on the upcoming Vera Rubin chips that TSMC is manufacturing for Nvidia. However, amidst the thought pool, a report had claimed that Huang was actually there to deliver a message from President Trump over revenue sharing — a claim that has now been shut down by TSMC.

Earlier in August, the Trump administration struck an informal deal with semiconductor companies such as AMD and Nvidia to share profits. In exchange for permission to sell their chips in China, these companies would give 15% of the profit to the government. TSMC, so far, does not fall under this arrangement and that's where the original rumors stem from. Jensen's visit was claimed to be moonlighting as an envoy for the U.S. government, conveying some sort of message through a mutually important liaison.

 




According to FocusTaiwan, TSMC has since rejected these rumors and clarified that Huang was there to attend a belated birthday event for founder Morris Chang. Huang also gave an internal speech to the workers at TSMC. Later that day, CEOs from both sides, along with other suites at the company, also had dinner where Taiwanese media caught Huang and TSMC CEO C.C. Wei engaging in lighthearted banter over who'd pay for dinner. Wei said he'd pick up the check if Huang agrees to his wafer pricing, to which Huang cheekily replied with ""I agree with your wafer pricing.""

At the time of the visit, TSMC was asked about the Trump administration's unprecedented move to acquire stakes in American companies, sometimes by converting grants into equity, and CEO Wei replied with ""They have already announced that they will not take shares."" Apparently, there is no need for secretive talks or any back-alley deals because, ultimately, TSMC falls outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Owing to this, TSMC reiterated yesterday that it has smooth and positive communication with the White House.

Modder makes you wonder what expandable RAM would look like on modern-day GPUs


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Expandable memory has arguably been one of the most desired features users have wanted in GPUs over the past 20 years. GDDR memory stubbornly remains soldered, but some people apparently want the thrill of plugging a DIMM into a GPU regardless. Bitsandpcs.Tech on Facebook recently showed off the work of a modder who went the extra mile to 3D-print a fan shroud that incorporates a single DDR5 slot on the side.

Before you start second-guessing yourself, no, this mod doesn't result in extra memory capacity. Modern-day GPUs don't support adding extra memory like you would do on a motherboard, especially DDR5 memory, which is significantly slower than GDDR7.

 




The modder stripped down an existing GeForce RTX GPU of some kind and replaced the card's exterior shroud with a completely custom 3D-printed design featuring Asus and ROG branding. Some of the card's shroud looks like it is inspired by the Asus Dual-series, particularly the sides of the shroud, which have the same shape and design as Asus' dual-fan graphics cards.

The selling point of the modded graphics card is located in the front, where (what would have been) the right intake fan has been removed to make room for a single DDR5 slot. The slot sits at an angle with the left side resting just above the left ROG-fan, and the right resting underneath it.

Not only is there a RAM slot, but whoever modded the graphics card went the extra mile to also wire the RAM slot with power so that RGB-equipped DDR5 memory would at least light up. The end result is a white ROG-branded graphics card with a RAM stick on the side that accompanies the GPU's internal RGB lighting, assuming the RAM stick installed boasts RGB to begin with.

The modder's 3D printed creation might have been made just for fun, but graphics cards with upgradable RAM have already been done before, for real. In the 90s, several graphics card designs offered upgradable memory slots that could double the GPU's available memory pool if used. One such video card was the ATI 3D Rage II, which incorporated a single SGRAM slot on the card, allowing users to double the card's memory capacity if needed.

Sadly, upgradable GPU memory went away by the 2000s. There is no single reason why it went away, but cost, complexity, performance requirements and cooling issues are all likely reasons why the board makers at the time dropped the feature. Adding expandable memory slots to a graphics card would add a significant amount of complexity to a manufacturer's board design. On top of this, board makers would have to figure out a cooler design that could work with extra memory slots as well.

The closest thing we have to expandable memory today is memory modding. Skilled GPU repair technicians and modders have actively been upgrading modern Nvidia and AMD GPUs with larger capacity memory ICs. We've seen this with a plethora of GPU models to date, including the RX 5600 XT, RTX 2070, and RTX 3070.

Children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA; Still disease) and those with rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive polyarthritis exhibiting high disease activity had higher serum ferritin levels than those with other JIA subtypes, underscoring serum ferritin's potential as a marker of disease activity across all JIA subtypes.

""Serum ferritin might serve as a clinically and prognostically useful biomarker across the full spectrum of JIA subtypes, with particular relevance in sJIA and RF-positive polyarthritis,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Maria Francesca Gicchino, Department of Woman, Child, and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli,"" Naples, Italy. It was published online on August 27, 2025, in the European Journal of Pediatrics.

This study was limited by its retrospective and single-centre nature, the lack of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody measurements, and the lack of longitudinal data. Moreover, the lack of early follow-up data in all patients restricted the assessment of ferritin dynamics and treatment response over time.

This study did not disclose any specific funding. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Two new studies examining kidney disease at both the cellular and protein levels provided novel insights into disease biology, suggesting paths toward more precise and individualized therapies for patients with kidney disease.

A study published in Nature Genetics suggested that applying single-cell tools at the patient level could usher in a new era of diagnostics and therapeutics.

Researchers used artificial intelligence to identify and catalog 70 distinct kidney cell types across human and animal samples, creating an integrated single-cell kidney atlas from more than 1 million cells collected across 140 samples. In turn, this work led to the development of CellSpectra, an open-source tool that quantifies changes in gene expression coordination across cellular functions.

“CellSpectra can be applied to individual patients to yield biological insights about their specific disease,” said study co-investigator Nancy Zhang, PHD, the Ge Li and Ning Zhao professor of statistics and data science at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Zhang emphasized, however, that while this work represents “an important step toward clinical applications,” larger studies and clinical trials are required before it can be practically applied.

If validated, these types of biological insights could lead to improved methods for early detection of kidney diseases and more personalized management of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Utilizing the massive dataset, known as SISKA 1.0 Atlas, the researchers were able to detect disease-related problems at the cellular level. Through cross-species and patient-to-patient comparisons, they moved beyond differential gene expression analysis to assess pathway-level changes in coordination.

“This allows you to identify cell type-level signatures, which can, for example, serve as a ‘report card' for a patient's disease,” Zhang told Medscape Medical News. 

A separate study, published in Nature Medicine, found that protein levels in kidney cells often do not match gene activity. This discordance suggests that genetic data alone cannot fully explain disease mechanisms.

The findings point to a broader understanding of kidney disease biology, extending beyond RNA to the functional protein level. By integrating protein profiles with clinical traits such as blood pressure, lipid levels, and kidney function, researchers hope to enable more targeted therapy selection.

“These findings have not yet been validated for clinical use,” said study investigator Katalin Susztak, MD, PhD, director of the Penn/CHOP Kidney Innovation Center, Philadelphia. Susztak stressed that validation in clinical trials and proof of actionability are required before the results can be adopted in clinical practice.

Susztak and colleagues analyzed 337 human kidney samples using whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics. They demonstrated that tissue proteomics reveal critical insights into cardio-kidney metabolic (CKM) disease not captured by tissue gene expression or blood proteomics.

Focusing on proteins linked to CKM traits, the team identified multiple targetable mechanisms, including the role of kidney angiopoietin-like 3 in lipid levels and kidney function, and charged multivesicular body protein 1A in kidney function and hypertension. They also identified several proteins not previously prioritized for CKM diseases. These proteins may help explain why some patients with kidney diseases respond to therapy and others do not.

Asked to comment, Matthew B. Lanktree, MD, PhD, director of the McMaster Kidney Genetics Clinic & Nephrology Genetics Fellowship Program, St. Joseph's Healthcare, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, said these two papers “raise the bar for genomic studies into kidney disease.”

By using high-throughput single-cell and multiomic techniques, the researchers analyzed both the rate at which genes signal protein production and the actual amount of protein within each kidney cell type. This allowed them to “read the tea leaves to identify patterns among the mass of information,” said Lanktree, who was not involved in the studies. “Undoubtedly, this research has provided new tools and data, furthering our understanding of kidney health.”

Lanktree emphasized that CKD often results from multiple factors rather than a single cause that can be precisely targeted.

“Even in genetic forms of kidney disease, caused by one genetic change, lifestyle choices can have enormous impact on disease severity. Treatment needs to focus on all facets of cardio-metabolic-kidney health and risk factors, not just that one genetic change,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“These two papers give clues toward new therapies to add to our growing treatment armamentarium for kidney disease, some of which may be more applicable to specific groups of patients,” he added.

However, Lanktree cautioned that larger studies across more diverse populations will be required before these technologies can be applied clinically.

“I wouldn't expect to see changes in the clinic tomorrow,” he said. “But this work does represent huge progress in higher-resolution genetic and protein studies of the kidney.”

The studies were supported by the National Institutes of Health (2R01DK076077-15, 5R01DK087635-15, 5P50DK114786-07, 5R01DK105821-08, 5R01DK132630-02, R01 DK105821, R01 DK087635, R01 DK076077, R01 DK12345, and 1R56AG081351), the National Science Foundation DMS/NIGMS (2245575), and the Translation Genetics in Renal Medicine grant from the University of Pennsylvania. Zhang, Susztak, and Lanktree reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A risk-based screening strategy shows high efficacy and significant reductions in cost in the detection of upper gastrointestinal cancers compared with conventional universal screening, results from a real-world study at two screening sites in China showed.

The screening protocol could provide important improvements upon conventional universal screening, which consumes considerable medical resources, with relatively low malignant upper gastrointestinal detection rates.

“This real-world, multi-center study demonstrates that the adoption of sequential screening by identifying high-risk individuals based on real-time risk assessment prior to endoscopic examinations is feasible and cost-effective in detecting upper gastrointestinal cancers,” the authors concluded.

This study was conducted by senior authors Zhonghu He and Yang Ke, of the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research,

With the start of a new medical school year upon us and the total number of students currently in US medical schools reaching a new high of 100,000, according to Association of American Medical Colleges data, Medscape Medical News wanted to know what motivates future doctors to join the field.

For Ellen Fuller, 25, who is entering her second year at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, Connecticut, a family of health professionals set the stage for her interest in the field. It included her father, an emergency physician; her mother, a virologist; her oldest sister, a third-year emergency medicine resident; and her middle sister, an emergency room nurse.

“Growing up, my sisters and I were inspired by the work our dad was doing and the fact that it was more than a job to him,” Fuller told Medscape Medical News. “It was a lifestyle that included taking global health trips and learning about medicine from the time we could walk.”

For others, witnessing a family member dealing with a difficult prognosis set the scene for a future in medicine.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape Medical Students Rate Clinical Instruction Report 2025 found

Such was the case for Alyssa Klee, 24, currently in her second year of Yale School of Medicine's MD/PhD program, New Haven, Connecticut, who was 13 years old when her aunt died of ovarian cancer at the age of 38.

“When my aunt was pregnant with my cousin, Max, an ultrasound missed a mass on her ovary, and she died 6 months after he was born,” said Klee, who plans to become an immuno-oncologist when she graduates in 2031. “If it had been found on the ultrasound, there's a chance they might have been able to remove it instead of the cancer spreading everywhere.”

This family tragedy then led Klee to apply for a summer research program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, when she was just 15 years old. Forging a career in both medicine and cancer research remains central to Klee's career plans.

“The reason I'm going to medical school and also getting a PhD is that I know I can make an impact this way,” she said. “Even though my aunt's doctors didn't have a cure for her, I saw how much her medical team was able to help her and make a big impact in her care. I want to be part of a team that can be there to help, especially during the tough times.”

Klee also looks forward to the day when her research translates into actionable treatment protocols for her patients.

“I want to be the one to see the research through,” she said. “It's one thing to do the research and be a part of creating therapies. It's another thing to prescribe that therapy to your own patients.”

Adam Crabtree, 39, has spent years in the medical field during a career that began 14 years ago when he became a US Army Special Forces Medic. Today, he's in his second year of medical school at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, Reno, Nevada, and said there were many experiences on the front lines that influenced his desire to become a physician once he finished his service.

One experience, which occurred during the evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021, was particularly harrowing because it involved treating a 12-year-old girl who was severely burned during gunfire and flames. Despite the lack of resources, Crabtree and two Afghan physicians were able to work together to stabilize her, providing sedation and the critical care she needed in the midst of a war zone.

“It's hard to put that entire experience into words,” said Crabtree, who is considering specializing in anesthesiology. “But if you could squeeze anything down into one experience, I feel like that was the moment I had this pivotal realization: I remember watching her being evacuated to safety and realized that I had helped this little girl in need who was running for her life. At that moment, I knew this was my purpose and that I wanted to go home and continue this work.”

Finding a way to use her language abilities (she speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and French) was just one of the things that propelled Clara Goebel, 31, to apply to medical school. 

Now in her third year at the Robert Larner, MD, College of Medicine at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, Goebel, who initially thought she'd follow in the footsteps of her mom, who taught English as a second language to immigrant families from Mexico and Central America, remains committed to helping patients facing language barriers within the healthcare system.

“In the hospital, I find myself drawn to patients who are nonnative English speakers or have other communication barriers,” said Goebel, who is considering specializing in urologic oncology. “I'd like to train and work somewhere with populations that have that kind of communication barrier.”

Watching other doctors connecting with patients in their native language remains inspiring to Goebel.

“I've watched some of the doctors speaking in a language that their patients understand, and that's so important,” she said. “I truly believe every field needs someone who is culturally competent, and that starts with speaking their language.”

Having a personal health challenge is yet another inspiring reason many students pursue a career in medicine.

For Jacob Fliegelman, 27, now in his fourth year at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York, being the first 1-year-old to receive a cochlear implant, after being diagnosed at 6 months with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, certainly imprinted on him the important role physicians play.

“The medical professionals who treated — and operated — on me enabled me to be where I am today,” said Fliegelman, who had his second surgery when he was 7 years old. 

For Fliegelman, the work of a physician is fundamentally all about giving back, something he experienced firsthand.

“Doctors connect to people at the most intimate and vulnerable times,” he said, adding that he is considering specializing in general surgery. “When people are in times of crisis, they look to doctors for hope and guidance, and that spoke to me.”

Despite his unique challenges and the fact that his impairment is “invisible,” Fliegelman is optimistic about his future.

“Occasionally, people don't realize I have a cochlear implant, so it's on me to clarify and let them know that if I don't hear them, especially in the chaotic OR [operating room], I'm not ignoring them,” he said.

Ultimately, Fliegelman's story is one of resilience and a love for the field. “I want others to know that even if you have similar limitations, anything is possible,” he said. “If you put your mind to it!”

Given the seriousness and increased frequency of strokes, many studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and the risk of stroke with varying results. A new study suggests women having a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy have higher risks of stroke compared with those who did not have surgery. Results of the study are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The Menopause Society.

Stroke is the third dominant cause of death and the fourth dominant cause of disability around the world, representing a significant public health challenge. Therefore, ongoing prevention efforts that address modifiable risk factors are essential to reduce the burden of this disease.

Estrogen levels play a major role. Women of reproductive age have a lower stroke risk, whereas postmenopausal women are roughly two times more likely to have a stroke within a decade of menopause. Both hysterectomy and oophorectomy significantly affect estrogen levels. Hysterectomy may result in lower ovarian sex steroid levels, resulting in earlier menopause. An oophorectomy can reduce premenopausal serum estradiol by up to 80% and androgen levels by about 50% in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Although multiple studies have previously been conducted around the relationship between surgery and stroke risk, results have been mixed. This latest study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included more than 21,000 women, with an average of 8.3 follow-up years, documenting 193 stroke-related deaths. The analysis of these results found an increased risk for hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy but not for hysterectomy alone or hysterectomy with unliteral oophorectomy. A pooling analysis of this study's results with other cohorts, however, revealed an 18% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, and a 5% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy alone.

Although the new study lacked surgical indication data, meta-analysis studies show that there is no connection between a benign or malignant diagnosis when determining the associated risk of surgery. Similarly, current evidence does not differentiate the amount of risk based on specific indications (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, or other rare conditions).

Additional studies with a large sample size and longer follow-up period are needed to address the disparities of type of stroke, age at surgery, surgical techniques, and menopause status on the association between stroke risk and hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

Survey results are published in the article ""Stroke risk in women with or without hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy: evidence from the NHANES 1999-2018 and meta-analysis.""

The results of this study demonstrate increased stroke risk related to hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, highlighting that these common procedures carry longer-term risks. They also call attention to an opportunity for more careful assessment of cardiovascular risk and implementation of risk reduction strategies in women who undergo these surgeries.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Monitoring cell detachment in microcarrier-based cultures","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250903/Monitoring-cell-detachment-in-microcarrier-based-cultures.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:32:00 GMT","

Microcarrier-based platforms have become essential for scalable cell culture across a range of applications—from vaccine production to cell therapy and cultured meat. These systems typically follow a progression through attachment, growth, and detachment phases. 

While viable cell density (VCD) monitoring using capacitance sensors is already well-established and aligned with Process Analytical Technology (PAT) guidelines for process optimization and control, real-time monitoring of the detachment phase continues to be a challenge.

Currently, assessing cell detachment often depends on off-line sampling and microscopy—methods that interrupt workflow, reduce precision, and increase the risk of contamination, especially as production scales up. To address this, ACIB Co. explored the use of in-line capacitance-based monitoring to track MA 104 cell detachment from Cytodex 1 microcarriers, leveraging Hamilton's Incyte sensor.

This real-time, in-line approach provided immediate visibility into detachment dynamics, enabling faster, data-driven decisions and improving overall process consistency. By supporting automated, continuous monitoring, capacitance sensing enhances PAT's effectiveness in scaling microcarrier-based cultures—not only for vaccines, but also for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) and cultured meat production.

The real-time permittivity signal produced by the Incyte sensors was assessed during the detachment of MA 104 cells from Cytodex 1 microcarriers, carried out in a 1-liter DASGIP bioreactor system (Eppendorf, DASGIP® Bioblock parallel system, 700 mL working volume) (Figure 1).



Data acquisition was carried out during the cell detachment process (at a maximum of one hour), using two different generations of Incyte Arc sensors (Incyte Unit DN12) and Incyte Arc Expert (Figure 2) with different final concentrations of Trypsin-EDTA solution as the dissociation reagent.

The Incyte Arc Expert incorporates an integrated preamplifier, which represents a major improvement in design. The capacitance measurements were carried out at a frequency of 1 MHz for all tests, a parameter enhanced for use in mammalian cells.

During the detachment process, off-line samples were systematically gathered to examine cell density and viability utilizing the Trypan Blue assay and predicting the detachment efficiency. Full dissociation of cells from microcarriers was checked via microscopic examination.

The results shown in Figure 3 illustrate both the detachment efficiency (Figure 3a) and the corresponding changes in the permittivity signal captured by the Incyte sensor (Figure 3b) during the cell detachment process across varying final Trypsin concentrations.

Following enzyme addition, the permittivity signal dropped sharply within the first five minutes. As supported by the off-line data in Figure 3a, Figure 3b shows that complete cell detachment from the microcarriers (MCs) consistently led to a decline in permittivity below 10 pF/cm. Higher enzyme concentrations (>0.82 mg/mL) produced a more rapid and significant drop in the permittivity signal compared to lower concentrations (0.64 mg/mL).

In contrast, at very low concentrations (0.43 mg/mL), the signal initially declined—primarily due to dilution—but failed to reach the same low values, instead leveling off at a higher plateau.

These real-time permittivity measurements during in-situ detachment highlight the Incyte sensor's potential for monitoring enzyme activity and predicting detachment outcomes.

A predictive model was developed using permittivity data recorded between minutes 4 and 7 of the detachment phase. This model forecasts the signal at 20 minutes, offering a reliable early indicator of final detachment success. Figure 4 presents the model's predictive accuracy, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.6.

To assess signal reproducibility and consistency, additional experiments were carried out using the Incyte Arc sensor at enzyme concentrations of 0.86 g/L and 0.43 g/L.

As shown in Figure 5, the results closely aligned with previous measurements. The main distinction was a steeper signal decline observed with the Arc sensor, suggesting improved responsiveness likely due to enhanced sensitivity in the updated technology.

Implementing real-time monitoring of cell detachment using a capacitance sensor proved effective in evaluating detachment efficiency and predicting detachment status. This capability enables faster, more informed decision-making for subsequent process steps and enhances overall process control—while also minimizing the need for offline sampling.

The proposed real-time approach is particularly promising for applications involving stem cell detachment from microcarriers, where microcarrier-based expansion has become a well-established and widely adopted method.

Given the sensitivity of stem cells, accurately identifying the optimal timing for enzyme inactivation is critical. Timely intervention can help preserve key surface markers essential for maintaining their differentiation potential.

A new study shows that beetroot juice can reduce blood pressure in older adults by enhancing nitric oxide pathways through shifts in oral bacteria, pointing to a simple nutritional strategy for healthier aging.



Study: Ageing modifies the oral microbiome, nitric oxide bioavailability and vascular responses to dietary nitrate supplementation. Image Credit: Liudmyla Chuhunova / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine, researchers investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) deficiencies, a common aspect of human aging, could be mitigated by consuming nitrate-rich beetroot juice. The study leveraged data from a randomized crossover trial comparing the impacts of beetroot juice consumption on young and older adults.

Study findings revealed that beetroot juice consumption substantially lowered blood pressure (BP) scores in older adults, while having no statistically significant impact on their younger counterparts. Furthermore, the study found that this BP improvement was associated with higher plasma nitrite levels and correlated with decreases in a Prevotella-dominated bacterial module, rather than directly with increases in nitrate-reducing genera. The Prevotella-dominated group included taxa capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), which may divert nitrite away from NO production. These findings support the notion that dietary nitrate may enhance blood pressure regulation in older adults, with microbiome shifts potentially mediating this effect. However, endothelial function and arterial stiffness were unchanged.

Decades of research have elucidated some of the routine processes associated with aging, with the body's deteriorating ability to produce nitric oxide (NO), a key molecule for cardiovascular health, well-documented. Conventional interventions often involve the use of pharmacological supplements; however, a significant number of patients respond poorly to these interventions, prompting the search for newer, naturally derived, and physiologically safe alternatives.

Recent research has also established robust links between oral health and systemic disease. However, the biological mechanisms governing these benefits remain largely unknown. One of the few well-documented pathways involves the conversion of dietary nitrate, abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot, into nitric oxide (NO). Studies have shown that this process entirely depends on specific oral bacteria (living on human tongues) that process the machinery to convert (enzymatically reduce) nitrate to nitrite. This nitrite is then converted to NO, a vital signaling molecule that relaxes blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.

Unfortunately, aging substantially hinders this process, as the body's primary mechanism for producing NO, via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), becomes less efficient. This age-related decline has been observed to contribute to hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. However, the oral microbiome and vascular system responses to the aging process remain unknown. Elucidating these interactions may allow for a new ""backup"" means to mitigate NO deficiency, thereby contributing to healthier aging. In this study cohort, however, baseline NO biomarkers were similar across age groups, suggesting that NO availability may be maintained during healthy aging, and thus, age-related NO decline should be framed cautiously.

The present study aimed to address the knowledge gaps by conducting a placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover trial involving 39 young adults (aged 18–30) and 36 older adults (aged 67–79), to investigate the impacts of different oral solutions (beetroot juice and mouthwash) on participants' oral microbiome and vascular responses.

Individuals with known medical histories of pulmonary, metabolic, or cardiovascular diseases were excluded from the sample cohort. Exclusion criteria also included oral diseases, smoking, high BP (> 140/90 mmHg) at baseline, and recent (<3 months) antibiotic use.

The study intervention lasted two weeks (each treatment), separated by additional two-week 'washout' periods. The interventions included:

Data collection involved the collection of tongue swabs (before and after each period) for oral microbiome analysis via high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, participants' key cardiovascular health markers (brachial and central BP) and endothelial function (using flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) were recorded at the same frequency. Finally, Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were measured as proxy biomarkers of NO bioavailability.

The study demonstrated a surprising contrast in how young and older participants responded to the dietary nitrate. The latter cohort had higher baseline BP (mean arterial pressure of 95 vs. 87 mmHg, P < 0.001), but when provided the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, demonstrated a significant reduction in brachial mean arterial pressure (4 ± 4 mmHg [P = 0.003]). Young, healthy adults, however, did not see any such change. Post-nitrate BP was lower than after mouthwash, but not lower than after placebo beetroot juice, which itself increased plasma nitrate and nitrite and had a modest effect on BP in older adults.

Further analyses revealed that the nitrate intervention directly correlated with the decrease in a co-occurring module of bacteria dominated by the genus Prevotella. Prevotella concentrations, in turn, were strongly associated with both the increase in plasma nitrite (r = -0.72, P = 0.001) and decreased BP.

The use of antiseptic mouthwash was also associated with reduced oral microbial diversity (Shannon index, P = 0.004) and impaired vascular function in the young group. Conversely, nitrate supplementation altered the oral microbiome in older adults, leading to increases in specific nitrate-reducing genera, including Neisseria and Rothia. Notably, Neisseria exhibited a proportionally greater increase in older adults compared to the young group.

The present study reveals that dietary nitrate may serve as a potent tool for enhancing cardiovascular health, particularly in older adults. The findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a shift in the oral microbiome associated with higher plasma nitrite levels may contribute to the blood-pressure-lowering effect of nitrate, rather than proving direct causation. This research opens a new frontier for targeted nutritional and probiotic strategies to support cardiovascular health, especially in our aging global population.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Global mental health crisis demands urgent investment and action","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250902/Global-mental-health-crisis-demands-urgent-investment-and-action.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

More than 1 billion people are living with mental health disorders, according to new data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), with conditions such as anxiety and depression inflicting immense human and economic tolls. While many countries have bolstered their mental health policies and programmes, greater investment and action are needed globally to scale up services to protect and promote people's mental health.

Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in all countries and communities, affecting people of all ages and income levels. They represent the second biggest reason for long-term disability, contributing to loss of healthy life. They drive up health-care costs for affected people and families while inflicting substantial economic losses on a global scale.

The new findings published in two reports – World mental health today and Mental Health Atlas 2024 – highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide. The reports serve as critical tools to inform national strategies and shape global dialogue ahead of the 2025 United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases and promotion of mental health and well-being, taking place in New York on 25 September 2025.

Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges. Investing in mental health means investing in people, communities, and economies – an investment no country can afford to neglect. Every government and every leader has a responsibility to act with urgency and to ensure that mental health care is treated not as a privilege, but as a basic right for all.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

The report shows that while prevalence of mental health disorders can vary by sex, women are disproportionately impacted overall. Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most common types of mental health disorders among both men and women.

Suicide remains a devastating outcome, claiming an estimated 727 000 lives in 2021 alone. It is a leading cause of death among young people across all countries and socioeconomic contexts. Despite global efforts, progress in reducing suicide mortality is too low to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of a one-third reduction in suicide rates by 2030. On the current trajectory, only a 12% reduction will be achieved by that deadline.

The economic impact of mental health disorders is staggering. While health-care costs are substantial, the indirect costs – particularly in lost productivity – are far greater. Depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated US$ 1 trillion each year.

These findings underscore the urgent need for sustained investment, stronger prioritization, and multi-sectoral collaboration to expand access to mental health care, reduce stigma, and tackle the root causes of mental health conditions.

Since 2020, countries have been making significant strides in strengthening their mental health policies and planning. Many have updated their policies, adopted rights-based approaches, and enhanced preparedness for mental health and psychosocial support during health emergencies.

However, this momentum has not translated into legal reform. Fewer countries have adopted or enforced rights-based mental health legislation, and only 45% of countries evaluated laws in full compliance with international human rights standards.

The report reveals a concerning stagnation in mental health investment. Median government spending on mental health remains at just 2% of total health budgets – unchanged since 2017. Disparities between countries are stark; while high-income countries spend up to US$ 65 per person on mental health, low-income countries spend as little as US$ 0.04. The global median number of mental health workers stands at 13 per 100 000 people, with extreme shortages in low- and middle-income countries.

Reform and development of mental health services is progressing slowly. Fewer than 10% of countries have fully transitioned to community-based care models, with most countries still in the early stages of transition. Inpatient care continues to rely heavily on psychiatric hospitals, with nearly half of admissions occurring involuntarily and over 20% lasting longer than a year.

Integration of mental health into primary care is advancing, with 71% of countries meeting at least three of five WHO criteria. However, data gaps remain; only 22 countries provided sufficient data to estimate service coverage for psychosis. In low-income countries fewer than 10% of affected individuals receive care, compared to over 50% in higher-income nations – highlighting an urgent need to expand access and strengthen service delivery.

Encouragingly, most countries report having functional mental health promotion initiatives such as early childhood development, school-based mental health and suicide prevention programmes. Over 80% of countries now offer mental health and psychosocial support as part of emergency responses, up from 39% in 2020. Outpatient mental health services and telehealth are becoming more available, though access remains uneven.

While there have been some encouraging developments, the latest data shows that countries remain far off track to achieve the targets set in WHO's Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan.

WHO calls on governments and global partners to urgently intensify efforts toward systemic transformation of mental health systems worldwide. This includes:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Do pediatricians recommend vaccines to make a profit? There's not much money in it","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250903/Do-pediatricians-recommend-vaccines-to-make-a-profit-Theree28099s-not-much-money-in-it.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:14:00 GMT","

It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, deepfakes, and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don't know seeking to profit from your behavior.

But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.

“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 video posted on the social platform X. “They're pressured to follow the money, not the science.”

Doctors and public health officials have been fielding questions on this topic for years.

A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drive pediatricians' childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.

Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off vaccines is counterintuitive.

“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you'd see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.

It costs money to stock, store, and administer a vaccine.

Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars' worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines' temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.

“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Pediatric Workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”

When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and its administration, Hackell said.

Many pediatricians also participate in a federal program that provides vaccines free of charge to eligible children whose parents can't afford them. Participating in that program isn't profitable because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don't cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it's valuable for patients, Hackell said.

When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don't make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.

Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children's Health Care System in Texas, said a practice's ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its situation.

Terk's practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn't lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.

Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice's patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies' payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.

“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.

Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics' or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended vaccine schedule.

Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.

“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn't wish that on anyone.”

Still, your pediatrician will consider your child's health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.

For example, a few children — less than 1% — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.

“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child's doctor,” Diasio said. “Don't get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”

TRIMTECH Therapeutics, a biotech company creating novel, small molecule therapeutics that selectively degrade protein aggregates, to combat neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the formation of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Globally recognized leaders within the protein degradation and technology development fields, Professor Alessio Ciulli FRS FRSE FRSC and Dr Adam Gilbert, have been appointed as Chair and member of the SAB, respectively. The newly formed SAB will support development of TRIMTECH's targeted protein degradation (TPD) TRIMTAC™ and TRIMGLUE™ platform, and progression of its small molecule therapeutic pipeline for neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders.

Prof. Alessio Ciulli is Chair of Chemical and Structural Biology and Founder and Director of the world-leading Centre for Targeted Protein Degradation (CeTPD) at the University of Dundee. His scientific achievements and pioneering contributions to the field of targeting protein-protein interactions and TPD have been recognized through numerous prestigious awards, including national and international science prizes, Innovation and Knowledge Exchange awards, major research grants, and fellowships, including his recent election as a Fellow of the Royal Society, the UK's national scientific academy. Prof. Ciulli has authored numerous high-impact publications, co-founded biotech ventures, including Amphista Therapeutics, and established high-profile partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry. As Chair of TRIMTECH's SAB, Prof. Ciulli's extensive experience in developing established and novel TPD mechanisms will support the advancement of the Company's degrader platform, discovery screening technologies, and progression of its target portfolio in neurology and inflammation.

Dr Adam Gilbert has over 30 years of experience in pharma, including his previous position as Executive Director and External Accelerator Lead, and Executive Director of Design and Synthesis Sciences, at Pfizer. He is currently a scientific advisor to Axiom Therapeutics, PhoreMost and Gero.AI. At Pfizer he created opportunities for strategic partnerships and business development deals, as well as gaining deep medicinal chemistry experience, with a focus on the development of protein degraders. Dr Gilbert is also a co-inventor of LITFULO™ (Ritlecitinib), recently approved to treat Alopecia Areata, and his group helped deliver ABRYSVO™ (RSVPreF), a preventative Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccine, and COMIRNATY® (BNT162b2), an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Dr Gilbert's focus as a member of TRIMTECH's SAB will be to advise on the development and applications of the Company's TRIMTAC and TRIMGLUE platform and the development of its degrader portfolio.

Establishing a Scientific Advisory Board is a pivotal step for us as a young company, and we're absolutely delighted to have Alessio and Adam, both globally recognised experts in the development of targeted protein degraders, join the company as advisors. Both will be instrumental in driving the development of our degrader platform and small molecule portfolio. Over 55 million people globally are affected by diseases such as Alzheimer's, and millions more battling other neurodegenerative disorders. There is a clear and urgent need for novel, cost-effective disease-modifying treatments that can reach these broad patient populations, and we are proud to be working toward addressing this.""

Dr Nicola Thompson, CEO, TRIMTECH Therapeutics

Professor Alessio Ciulli FRS FRSE FRSC, Chair of the SAB, TRIMTECH Therapeutics, commented: ""Targeted protein degradation has proven its therapeutic benefits against conventional drug targets, but the development of degraders that are truly selective for protein aggregates has remained challenging. TRIMTECH's platform offers a new and incredibly promising approach, uniquely positioned to develop small molecule drugs for hard-to-treat targets that underpin many neurological diseases. I look forward to being part of the Company's journey.""

Dr Adam Gilbert, Scientific Advisor for TRIMTECH Therapeutics, added: ""TRIMTECH's approach to TPD is backed by almost two decades of academic research, and has the potential to address a real gap in the field by specifically targeting aggregated proteins. The Company's recent seed funding round and impressive investor cohort are further testament to the quality of the team and strength of the science. I am delighted to join the SAB and look forward to helping guide the development of therapeutics that will provide new treatment options that are so needed.""

Faced with a worsening drug crisis, policymakers in recent years have made it much easier for doctors to prescribe the highly effective opioid addiction treatment buprenorphine. However, many patients may still struggle to find pharmacies carrying the treatment, finds new research led by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.

Buprenorphine was available at just 39% of U.S. retail pharmacies in 2023, a modest increase from 33% in 2017, according to the study published Sept. 2 in Health Affairs. But disparities in who can access the treatment have persisted. Pharmacies in predominantly Black neighborhoods (18%) and Latino neighborhoods (17%) remain significantly less likely to carry buprenorphine as those in white neighborhoods (46%).

Buprenorphine is one of several medications that can ease opioid cravings and withdrawal, and it is the only one that can be prescribed in primary care settings and dispensed at retail pharmacies. Because these treatments are milder opioids and considered controlled substances, they historically have been subject to tight prescribing and dispensing rules.

Recent efforts to ease prescribing rules include the 2023 elimination of the so-called ""X-waiver"" that required doctors to receive specialized training and registration to prescribe the treatment. However, dispensing rates have changed little, suggesting that pharmacy regulations aimed at preventing opioid (and buprenorphine) diversion, abuse and misuse continue to discourage pharmacies from carrying the treatment, particularly in minority neighborhoods and some areas hit hardest by the opioid epidemic.

Relaxing buprenorphine prescribing rules was an important step in making this critical treatment more accessible, but too many patients lack a nearby pharmacy that carries it. Federal and state policymakers must reduce barriers that make it difficult for pharmacies to stock buprenorphine, especially in some of the more vulnerable communities.""

Dima Mazen Qato, senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center and the Hygeia Centennial Chair at the USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences

Researchers analyzed buprenorphine claims from 2017 to 2023 from an IQVIA pharmacy database from covering 93% of U.S. retail prescription claims. Among their key findings:

Researchers said states should consider easing tight controls on buprenorphine dispensing, which can restrict access to the treatment in several ways.

When buprenorphine demand rises, suppliers may delay or pause shipments to pharmacies to avoid scrutiny from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and pharmacies often refuse to stock buprenorphine out of concern the orders will be flagged to the DEA. Some pharmacies carry the medication but refuse to dispense it for fear of running afoul of the federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state pharmacy regulations and laws, which require pharmacists to ensure that prescriptions for controlled substances are valid.

The researchers found buprenorphine availability was greatest in states with the least restrictive prescription drug monitoring programs, including those that limited how law enforcement could access the electronic databases to investigate suspicious prescribing.

The researchers said state and local governments should consider requiring pharmacies to maintain buprenorphine stock, noting that some have issued similar orders for the overdose reversal treatment naloxone and emergency contraception in an effort to improve access.

""If policymakers fail to introduce policies that increase equitable access to buprenorphine at local pharmacies, existing racial and ethnic disparities in opioid use disorder treatment and recovery will likely worsen,"" said first author Jenny S. Guadamuz, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.

New real-world data confirm the RSV vaccine offers strong protection for older adults across two winters, but highlight weaker responses in those with compromised immunity and cardiovascular disease.

Study: RSV Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalization Among US Adults Aged 60 Years or Older During 2 Seasons. Image credit: Ground Picture/Shutterstock.com

A large-scale multicenter study published in JAMA revealed that a single dose of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine is 58% effective in preventing RSV-related hospitalization among older adults during two viral seasons.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonally prevalent virus in the United States, causing epidemics every year in the fall and winter. The virus induces severe respiratory illness and chronic cardiorespiratory conditions in older adults. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 RSV-related hospitalizations and 4000 to 8000 deaths occur annually among adults aged 60 years or above in the United States.

Three RSV vaccines, including two protein and one mRNA, have been approved and recommended for older adults to prevent severe respiratory illness. In June 2023, a single dose of the RSV vaccine was initially recommended for adults aged 60 years and above. The recommendation was updated in June 2024 for all adults aged 75 years or older and at-risk adults aged 60 to 74 years, and in April 2025 for adults aged 50 to 59 at higher risk of severe RSV infection.

Monitoring RSV vaccines' clinical effectiveness and durability against severe infections and related hospitalization, particularly in high-risk subpopulations, is crucial for public health. Continuous monitoring is also vital to determine whether vaccine effectiveness is declining due to mutation-related changes in viral fitness. 

The Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network has previously assessed the effectiveness of RSV vaccines in a diverse population during the first season of use. The IVY Network is a multicenter surveillance network that recruits older adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness in the United States.

The current study was designed to assess the effectiveness of RSV vaccines against hospitalization during two viral seasons among older adults at higher risk of developing severe RSV infections.

The study population included 6958 adults aged 60 years or above who were hospitalized with acute respiratory illness during two RSV seasons: between October 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, or October 1, 2024, and April 30, 2025.

Among enrolled participants, 821 (11.8%) were cases (infected only with RSV) and 6137 (88.2%) were controls (tested negative for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza; human metapneumovirus was allowed, with a sensitivity analysis excluding it). About 7.7% of cases and 15.7% of controls received a single dose of RSV vaccine at least 14 days before illness onset.

The effectiveness of RSV vaccination in preventing RSV-related hospitalization was assessed in the entire study population and was stratified by the interval between vaccine receipt and illness onset.

According to the study estimates, a single dose of the RSV vaccine is 58% effective in preventing RSV-related hospitalization among adults aged 60 years or above during two viral seasons compared to no vaccination. The protection against severe outcomes among hospitalized patients was sustained for two years, with a 72% vaccine effectiveness against invasive mechanical ventilation or death.

The estimated vaccine effectiveness was 69% when the vaccine was administered in the same season before illness onset and 48% when vaccination occurred in the prior season. Although point estimates suggested waning, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.06).

The estimated vaccine effectiveness during two seasons was 30% among immunocompromised adults, significantly lower than that among immunocompetent adults (67%). A similar reduction in vaccine effectiveness was observed among immunocompetent adults with cardiovascular disease (56%) compared to those without cardiovascular disease (80%).

The effectiveness of the vaccines Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) was similar. They were effective against both RSV A and RSV B subtypes.

The study highlights the protective efficacy of a single-dose RSV vaccination against RSV-related hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes among older adults during two viral seasons.

The observed reduction in vaccine effectiveness in at-risk subpopulations indicates that older adults with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions may have lower initial and less durable immune responses to RSV vaccination, highlighting the need for a shorter revaccination interval.

Among older adults with cardiovascular disease, the observed reduction in vaccine effectiveness may be associated with the pro-inflammatory state that diminishes immune responses, contributing to increased susceptibility to RSV infection and potentially inhibiting immune responses after vaccination. Reduced vaccine effectiveness in this subpopulation also highlights the need for a shorter revaccination interval than that for the general older adult population.

Existing evidence on RSV vaccine-specific immune responses suggests that revaccination at intervals ranging from 12 to 36 months after the primary vaccination can boost antibody titers, but not to the same level as after the primary dose. These findings agree with the results of a clinical efficacy trial, which demonstrates that older adults reimmunized with the RSV vaccine 12 months after the primary vaccination do not gain additional protection against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease compared to no revaccination.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recently expanded RSV vaccination to adults aged 50 to 59 who are at higher risk of severe RSV infection. Such reformation of vaccine policy for adults highlights the need for continuous monitoring of vaccine efficacy to accurately characterize waning protection and inform revaccination intervals.

A father's exposure to passive smoking as a child may impair the lifelong lung function of his children, putting them at risk of COPD-a risk that is heightened further if they are childhood passive smokers themselves-finds research published online in the respiratory journal Thorax.

The findings highlight the intergenerational harms of smoking, say the researchers, who urge fathers to intercept this harmful legacy by avoiding smoking around their children.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more usually known by its acronym of COPD, includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Now the third leading cause of death around the world, COPD kills around 3 million people every year, say the researchers.

Several factors throughout the lifespan may increase the risk of poor lung function and subsequent COPD, and attention is now beginning to focus on the potential role of intergenerational factors, they explain.

While previously published research showed that passive smoking during a father's childhood may be linked to a heightened risk of asthma in his children by the time they are 7, it's not clear if compromised lung function may extend into middle age and beyond, they add. 

To explore this further, the researchers drew on 8022 child participants in the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS), all of whom had tests to assess their lung function (spirometry).

Their parents completed an initial comprehensive survey on their and their children's respiratory health. Further check-ups ensued when those children were 13, 18, 43, 50 and 53. These included spirometry to assess 2 measures of lung function (FEV1 and FVC) as well as questionnaires on demographics and respiratory symptoms/disease. 

Of the 7243 parents who were alive and could be traced in 2010, 5111 were re-surveyed about whether either of their own parents had smoked when they were under the age of 5 and/or up to when they were 15.

Among the 5097 respondents with complete data, 2096 were fathers. The final analysis included 890 father-child pairs with data on the father's passive smoke exposure before puberty and lung function data for their children up to the age of 53.

More than two thirds of the fathers (nearly 69%) and more than half of their children (56.5%) had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhoods.

Around half of the children (49%) had a history of active smoking by middle age, and just over 5% of them had developed COPD by this time point, as assessed by spirometry.

After adjusting for potentially influential factors, including the father's lifetime history of asthma/wheeze and his age, his passive smoke exposure as a child was associated with 56% higher odds of below average FEV1, but not FVC, across the lifespan of his children. 

Similarly, fathers' childhood passive smoke exposure was also associated with a doubling in the odds of an early low-rapid decline in FEV1/FVC in their children. This was statistically significant even after adjusting for potentially influential factors.

And paternal exposure to passive smoking as a child was also associated with a doubling in the risk of COPD by the age of 53 in his children, although this was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for potentially influential factors. 

But children whose fathers had been exposed to passive smoking as a child were twice as likely to have below average FEV1 if they, too, had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhood.

The observed associations were only partly mediated through smoking and respiratory illnesses in fathers and their children (each contributing less than 15%).

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that TAHS lacks data on paternal lung function and genetics, preventing assessment of familial aggregation as a potential mechanism. 

And their children's childhood passive smoke exposure was defined as at least one parent smoking 6 days a week, which might have misclassified moderate/light smokers as non-smokers, they add.

But the period before puberty is especially critical for boys, when exposure to harmful substances may change gene expression and modify repair mechanisms, which may then become heritable, say the researchers by way of an explanation for their findings. 

""Our findings are novel as this is the first study to investigate and provide evidence for an adverse association of paternal prepubertal passive smoke exposure, rather than just active smoking, on impaired lung function of offspring by middle age,"" they write. 

""This is of importance from a public health perspective, as passive smoke exposure affects about 63% of adolescents, which is significantly higher than the approximately 7% affected by active smoking."" 

They conclude: ""These findings suggest that smoking may adversely affect lung function not only in smokers but also in their children and grandchildren…Fathers exposed to tobacco smoke during prepuberty may still reduce risk for future generations by avoiding smoking around their children.""

CN Bio, a leading provider of Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) Systems and solutions that accelerate drug discovery and development workflows, today announced the expansion of its Contract Research Services (CRS) with new PhysioMimix® computational modeling tools. These capabilities have been developed to enhance Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) profiling, for accelerated drug discovery and development workflows.



This launch represents the Company's new in silico tools available to customers and is designed to enhance data generation from its range of predictive in vitro tools - unlocking deeper insights into key ADME parameters, including human bioavailability, and enabling more confident in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE).

CN Bio's computational tools combine the insights gained from microphysiological system (MPS) assays with powerful mathematical models. These tools complement the Company's existing bioavailability assay based on its proprietary dual-organ Gut/Liver model, available via the CRS or as an off-the-shelf kit. The derived data is fully compatible with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) frameworks and can be used to extract additional data from preclinical studies, providing functional predictions of how compounds interact with human biology.

By working with CN Bio's CRS team, customers gain access to broad support and expertise from both MPS and computational modeling specialists. The team collaborates closely with customers throughout the process, from ensuring robust study design to translating experimental data into meaningful ADME predictions. Raw data generated from projects is also translated into an easy-to-interpret format, suitable for supporting go/no go and drug dosing decisions.

This year, the FDA made significant changes to phase out animal testing requirements, signaling a clear shift towards the use of more relevant human approaches for preclinical safety and toxicity testing. We are providing the tools to ensure our customers stay ahead of these regulatory changes."" He added: ""The launch of our Bioavailability assay last year was a major step towards improving understanding of the appropriate dose regimens for safe and effective new therapies. Now, by integrating advanced in silico modeling into our offering, we are enhancing this service to bridge the in vitro to in vivo translation gap for drug developers. By working with our expert CRS team, customers have access to dedicated support throughout the entire process.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Faster progression to severe diabetes observed in people with learning disabilities","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250902/Faster-progression-to-severe-diabetes-observed-in-people-with-learning-disabilities.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:49:00 GMT","

People with learning disabilities progress faster to severe type 2 diabetes and are at greater risk of dying from their condition than people without these disabilities, suggests research published in the open access journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Control.

This is despite having better overall blood glucose control and similar risks of vascular complications, the findings indicate.

Around 1.5 million people (950,000 adults) in the UK have a learning disability, which includes conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, note the researchers. 

Type 2 diabetes in those with learning disabilities can be challenging as it requires a substantial amount of monitoring and management, which they may not always be able to do, potentially compromising their blood glucose control, explain the researchers.

But there's been no large study on the potential impact of learning disabilities on the outcomes of type 2 diabetes, including blood glucose control, progression to microvascular and macrovascular complications, initiation of insulin therapy (proxy for severe disease), and risk of death, they add.

Macrovascular complications refer to stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or amputation more than 6 months after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Microvascular complications refer to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy.

In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers extracted anonymized medical records for 352,215 adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in primary care between January 2004 and January 2021 from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD.

Of these, 280,300 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study, 2074 of whom had a learning disability when they were diagnosed.

They tended to be younger (average age 51 vs 64) and have a shorter monitoring period. And they included higher proportions of men, people of White ethnicity, people living with severe obesity and in areas of greatest deprivation than those without learning disabilities.

They were also more likely to be taking medication for diabetes and high blood pressure and to have more complications related to diabetes at the time of their diagnosis. 

Even after adjusting for these potentially influential risk factors they were 19% less likely to have poor blood glucose control than those without learning disabilities 5 years after diagnosis.

But they were 20% more likely to progress faster to severe disease and the need for insulin therapy than those who didn't have learning disabilities. 

And they were around twice as likely to die from any cause and specifically from diabetes despite having similar risks of vascular complications as those who didn't have learning disabilities.

This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause and effect, and the researchers acknowledge that large numbers of values for the outcome variables for blood glucose control were missing among those with learning disabilities. Complication rates may therefore have either been underdiagnosed or under-recorded, they suggest. 

""Our finding of higher rates of insulin initiation in those with learning disabilities warrants further investigation into whether this is due to poorer glycemic control at presentation (and therefore faster advancing type 2 diabetes) or due to having a greater degree of clinical surveillance,"" say the researchers.

""Future research into the mechanisms behind this could help reduce health disparities for people with [type 2 diabetes] and learning disabilities,"" they add.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medicaid expansion boosts access to opioid use disorder treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250902/Medicaid-expansion-boosts-access-to-opioid-use-disorder-treatment.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:08:00 GMT","

Medicaid plays a key role for giving people with opioid-use disorder access to treatment, according to a Rutgers Health study.

Progress in life-saving treatment for opioid-use disorder with the medication has stalled in the past several years, according to a Rutgers Health study. However, researchers added that while some states were able to achieve substantial improvement, others lost ground. 

Specifically, states that have expanded access to Medicaid insurance coverage since 2018 saw increases in prescriptions for opioid-use disorder treatment, according to the study, while states that haven't expanded Medicaid experienced declining treatment rates after 2022. 

Researchers found that state Medicaid policies were key drivers of population-level treatment rates.

The study, published in Health Affairs, examined trends in national retail pharmacy claims by Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance across states between 2018 and 2024, a period of rising fatal overdose rates and national policy changes aimed at increasing treatment. Researchers compared the claims with state populations and overdose rates to assess the impact of Medicaid eligibility on treatment uptake.

We were impressed by the success stories in some states, such as those with recent eligibility expansions. Several of these states, like Virginia, Utah and Missouri, doubled or tripled Medicaid-paid prescribing, driving strong population-level improvement. These successes point to opportunities for improvement even when the overall national rate of progress is disappointing. Nevertheless, wide disparities between states remained, as shown in maps and state comparison tables in the paper and its appendix."" 

Stephen Crystal, Director of the Rutgers Center for Health Services Research at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research

Despite the availability of effective treatments for opioid-use disorder, more than 80,000 died in 2024from opioid-use overdoses. In addition to the disease of addiction, there are a number of policy and financial barriers preventing people from accessing medication, the researchers said. The federal government declared an opioid public health emergency in 2017 and again in 2025. 

Because people with opioid-use disorder tend to be low-income single adults, Medicaid is the most important payer for buprenorphine, a highly effective medication used to treat opioid-use disorder. However, Medicaid policies covering opioid-use disorder treatment vary state to state, resulting in vastly different uptake of treatments that can dramatically lower the risk of overdose and support recovery. New Jersey is among the states that have implemented important initiatives that have aided access to Medicaid-paid treatment, including Medicaid expansion, elimination of buprenorphine prior authorization, and increased reimbursement for treatment, with improvements in Medicaid and all-payer buprenorphine prescribing during the study period.

The national analysis led by Crystal, who is a Distinguished Research Professor at the Rutgers School of Social Work, showed diverse state-level trends that often pointed to the importance of Medicaid. 

States that recently expanded the eligibility criteria to qualify for Medicaid insurance experienced a 27.3% increase in buprenorphine prescribing rates. But in states that didn't expand Medicaid, overall prescribing lagged, with declines after 2022. 

Researchers said expanding Medicaid eligibility and minimizing disenrollment from Medicaid during eligibility redeterminations are critical steps in increasing access to opioid-use disorder treatment across the country.

""Translating evidence into consistent practice has been uneven across the country for multiple reasons, including the stigma surrounding people with addiction,"" said Crystal. ""But progress is possible when states take action to help residents access and afford effective medication. Maintaining the progress that has been made in opioid-use disorder treatment through state Medicaid policies will be challenging under the financial pressures created by recent federal legislation, but it is vital in maintaining progress on preventing overdoses and supporting recovery.""

Coauthors of the study include Fangzhou Xie, Hillary Samples, Elizabeth Stone and Jennifer Miles of Rutgers; Allen Campbell of the IQVIA Institute, Peter Treitler of Boston University; and Sumedha Gupta and Kosali I. Simon of Indiana University.

Crystal will discuss the research during the Health Affairs Health Policy Briefing focused on the opioid crisis on Sept. 3 and in an upcoming Health Affairs Health Podyssey podcast episode.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Changes at NIH give political appointees greater power to fund or block research","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250903/Changes-at-NIH-give-political-appointees-greater-power-to-fund-or-block-research.aspx","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:12:00 GMT","

The Trump administration has given notice that political appointees, rather than scientists, will ultimately decide who gets grant money from the world's largest biomedical research funder — the federal government's National Institutes of Health.

In an Aug. 7 executive order, President Donald Trump announced that political officers would have the power to summarily cancel any federal grant, including for scientific work, that is not ""consistent with agency priorities."" Senior officials should not ""routinely defer"" to recommendations from peer reviewers, who have provided the backbone of federal science funding for eight decades.

NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya reinforced the message in an Aug. 15 internal memorandum stating that political priorities may override the scoring system provided by outside experts appointed to hundreds of review panels.

""While the score and critiques an application receives in peer review are important factors in determining the scientific merit of a proposal,"" his memo stated, NIH institutes and centers should not rely on the scientific merit rankings ""in developing their final pay plans.""

Like ongoing conflicts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Reserve, NIH scientists told KFF Health News, the disruption of the peer review process represents an attack on agency expertise that the country has relied on for decades.

Although the priorities of top agency staffers have always influenced some NIH funding, those people were nearly always career scientists in the past. By downgrading its peer review process, the NIH could allow political appointees who now occupy key positions to stop grants that typically would be funded, and to fund grants they prefer that don't necessarily meet rigorous scientific standards, a dozen current and former NIH officials told KFF Health News.

Bhattacharya's guidelines ""open the door to the politicization of NIH research,"" said Jenna Norton, a program officer in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

""Peer review is fundamental and makes sure we're doing the best science,"" she said. ""If you're going to ignore that, the political appointee gets to make the final call.""

NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine said that peer review would continue to be the cornerstone of the NIH's funding decisions but that funding would become less dependent on reviewers' rankings of grant proposals.

This will ""ensure consistent, transparent, and strategic funding decisions that align with the agency's mission, maximize public health impact, and responsibly steward taxpayer dollars,"" she said. Trump's executive order said peer reviews would be ""advisory"" only.

Grants to scientists at universities and other research centers make up about 80% of the NIH's $48 billion budget, with the rest funding internal NIH research. Since 1946, the NIH has doled out funds based mainly on merits established by a scientific review process that ranks each proposal based on innovation, importance, and feasibility.

The peer review process, in which grant proposals scoring above a certain percentile generally receive funding, has always had its critics. Many a Nobel Prize speech has described failures by reviewers to recognize work that would end up leading to pathfinding discoveries, said Carrie Wolinetz, a former NIH chief of staff.

About half of the NIH's 27 centers and institutes provide leeway to raise or drop grants on the priority list because of factors like institute-wide research goals, Fine said. But these exceptions apply to fewer than 5% of grants, according to Richard Nakamura, who led the NIH's Center for Scientific Review from 2011 to 2018.

Nakamura's successor, Noni Byrnes, retired last week after overseeing changes aimed at reducing one frequent target of peer review critics: the awarding of multiple grants to well-placed scientists from top-tier universities.

The Bhattacharya document ""itself is not so disturbing in the light of usual practice,"" said Harold Varmus, who led the NIH under President Bill Clinton and was the chief of the National Cancer Institute under Barack Obama. ""What is disturbing is what it might mean in the context of the current administration.""

The expansion of the Trump administration's political power at the NIH comes as it has strangled the release of thousands of grants with sometimes ambiguous policy statements and new layers of bureaucracy, including requirements that both the White House and the NIH director clear all new funding opportunities.

Career scientists, who have long run the NIH, have in some instances been replaced by political appointees playing critical roles in scientific decisions, staff scientists say.

New political appointees under Bhattacharya include chief of staff Seana Cranston, a former aide to conservative Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and former Department of Government Efficiency manager James McElroy, Cranston's deputy. The position of chief operations officer was created and filled by Eric Schnabel, a political appointee — since fired — who previously had been in charge of business development for a company that sold fitness programs.

Bhattacharya's deputy, meanwhile, is Matthew Memoli, an infectious disease scientist who emerged as a sharp critic of covid-19 vaccine mandates. The Department of Health and Human Services stunned vaccine experts in May when it awarded Memoli and colleagues a $500 million grant to develop an influenza vaccine using older technology, with no explanation other than a superlative-filled news release.

The mood at the agency is morbid, said Sylvia Chou, a program officer at the National Cancer Institute. While a minority of workers speak out in protest through documents like the “Bethesda Declaration,” others keep their heads down and their mouths shut.

Most grants must undergo new levels of review by senior NIH employees and the White House, program officers say. Staff members painstakingly police all grant applications for language — such as ""diversity"" or ""climate change"" — that might trigger scrutiny by higher-ups, according to four program officers, two of whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they feared retaliation.

""Bhattacharya has been saying that program officers are making up banned-words lists,"" Norton said. ""It's true, we haven't gotten a list from him saying, 'Don't use these words.' But we do notice that when a grant says 'health equity,' it gets terminated.""

""We review them and screen them for all these words as we're supposedly not doing — but we are doing,"" said a program officer who has been at the NIH for six years. ""After we approve them, they go to the grant management office and sit there. Then they send them back and say, 'What about this word?'"" This leads to self-censorship, the officer said.

The officer cited a recent proposal involving the effects of hotter weather on kidney disease. It contained the phrase ""climate change"" as background information, but ""I had them remove it,"" the officer said. ""It's a level of absurdity, but I wanted to avoid more delays.""

The peer review process itself is ""starting to break down"" because highly scored grants haven't been funded for sometimes obscure reasons, Chou said.

The NIH picks hundreds of deeply experienced external scientists to serve on its review panels. While screened to avoid conflicts of interest, many reviewers are themselves NIH grant recipients. They accept pay of about $200 for 100 hours of work as a kind of social contract with the NIH, said Mollie Manier, a scientist at the Center for Scientific Review.

""We're finding that people are more likely to decline to serve on review panels because their own grants are frozen, or out of protest at what's happening at NIH,"" Manier said.

Another review officer described approaching a Brown University scientist with a request to serve on a panel recently: ""They said normally they would do it, but they've lost three grants and need to figure out how to keep their lab running.""

As grants crawl through the system, ""reviewers are starting to feel they aren't being convened for anything real,"" Manier said. ""If the government cancels your grant for no good reason, you can't expect a good-faith effort anymore.""

""It's death by a thousand paper cuts, anything they can do to gum up payments, to gum up the decision-making, to wrest control of grant decisions from the career scientists,"" said Elizabeth Ginexi, an NIH program officer for 22 years who took early retirement in April.

Fine, the NIH spokesperson, said the agency had ""no evidence that recruiting peer reviewers has become more difficult than in the past.""

The administration's skepticism of peer review feeds doubts NIH scientists already had because of what they saw as irrational villainizing of mRNA vaccines and other matters — including Memoli's vaccine award.

Although in-house NIH research isn't subject to the same review process as external grants, Memoli's grant left officials aghast. ""I'm not aware of a process that awards $500 million for a project using antiquated technology to develop vaccines,"" one seasoned reviewer said.

Trump's executive order says the grant review process ""undermines the interests of American taxpayers,"" leaving many good proposals unfunded while supporting ""too much unfocused research of marginal social utility.""

""The opposite is true,"" the seasoned reviewer said. ""We make sure taxpayer money goes to the most high-impact research.""

""Alignment"" is a word the Trump administration frequently uses to explain why an official got fired or research was rejected. Chou finds it appalling.

""The Chinese Communists call it 'harmonization,'"" she said, and now her colleagues speak routinely about grants that are ""clean"" because they've ""gone through alignment.""

""We're saying this in plain English,"" she said. ""Not Russian, not Beijing Chinese.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Five Things to Know: USMNT vs. Korea Republic","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/09/five-things-to-know-usmnt-korea-tim-ream-son-heung-min","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:06:57 GMT","

The U.S. Men's National Team is back in action for September international friendlies.

First, the USMNT takes on Korea Republic in Harrison, New Jersey on Sept. 6. Then the U.S. will face Japan on Sept. 9.

 With the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaching, the USMNT gets a look at two nations that will be back in North America next summer for the tournament.

 It'll mark the first time the USMNT has matched up with Korea since 2014. The U.S. will have the chance to even up the all-time record which currently sits at 2W-3L-2D.

Here's everything you need to know before the USA faces the Asia Power:

1. Continuing Gold Cup Momentum 

After the USMNT's Concacaf Gold Cup Final run, veteran defender Tim Ream said the squad developed a better understanding of the expectations from head coach Mauricio Pochettino. That understanding only continues to build moving forward.

“The guys who were here during the Gold Cup, we know what the standard needs to be, and what it is going forward,” Ream said. “Just making sure everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, making sure we're on the same page — we're on the same team. We're trying to move things forward and make sure we're in a good position moving into the next year and into the World Cup.”

Including September, the USMNT has three international windows this year to grow further under Pochettino, who was hired in September 2024. Ream said that while these matches are friendlies, with the World Cup looming, every opportunity together as a National Team is imperative to building chemistry.

2. Back in Stars and Stripes 

Defender Sergiño Dest and forward Folarin Balogun could earn their first cap of 2025 in the September matches after battling injury.

Dest tore his ACL in April 2024 and hasn't played with the USMNT since the Americans won the 2024 Concacaf Nations League. The right back was on the initial roster for the summer but instead opted for a training program to further work back from injury. Since then, Dest has had a strong start on the club side with PSV, with two goals and an assist through five matches.

Balogun has dealt with a couple of injuries. First, a dislocated shoulder, which kept him out at the end of 2024. Then he sustained an ankle injury that forced him to miss the summer Gold Cup run. If either of them makes an appearance in the two friendlies, it'll be the first cap under Pochettino

3. A USMNT Legend Honored 

Before the USA and Korea kick off, USMNT legend Michael Bradley will be honored in a pre-game ceremony. Bradley is the third-most capped USMNT player with 151 international appearances, including 48 matches captained, from 2006 to 2019.

Ream wore the captain's band eight times in 2025. The 37-year-old defender played with Bradley for several years, from Ream's first days with the USMNT to his first time captaining.

“I don't know that I've ever really given him credit, but I'm sitting here today because of some of the things and some of the conversations that he and I have had over many camps and over many years,” Ream said. “A lot of great memories, lot of great camps. And just watching him, and knowing how professional he was, and the leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together is something that I always left camp in awe of, really. I tried to use that when I would leave and still trying to use those examples.""

4. A World Cup-Qualified Test 

The USMNT faces two top AFC opponents, both of which have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. The first, Korea, punched its ticket in June to the tournament co-hosted by the United States.

It will be the 12th appearance for the Asian nation led by forward Son Heung-min, one of the most popular Asian players in football history who this summer signed with LAFC in Major League Soccer. Saturday's match between the USMNT and Korea Republic will be a reunion of sorts. USMNT head coach Pochettino coached Son from 2015-19 back in their days at Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League.

5. Familiar Faces in Familiar Places 

The match at Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls, marks a homecoming for several USMNT players on the roster.

Midfielder Tyler Adams grew up in Wappingers Falls, New York and came up through the Red Bulls Academy. Forward Tim Weah, also a New York native, spent a year with the academy before departing for France and PSG's youth program.

Ream was drafted by the Red Bulls in 2010 in the second round of the MLS SuperDraft. He played two seasons with New York before leaving for the UK. The center back returned to MLS in 2024 after more than a decade overseas. He now suits up for Eastern Conference club Charlotte FC where he's played the last two seasons.

👕 Alex Morgan partners with London City Lionesses

🔄 Alyssa Thompson's transfer saga

🇺🇸 Saving youth soccer with “the U.S. Way”

Welcome! Let's start by getting ready for a new season in England.

Morgan joins London City … kind of

She's here, she's there, she's everywhere.

Alex Morgan has been around the world and back this past month as she gets ready for her jersey retirement with the San Diego Wave on Sunday.

As we reported just minutes ago: Morgan's company, Togethxr, which she co-founded with Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim, has partnered with Michele Kang's England-based club to display the brand's iconic “Everyone Watches Women's Sports” slogan. Check out the full collection here.

London City is one of three teams under Kang's multi-club organization, Kynisca Sports International. The announcement highlighted London City's status as the only club in the 12-team league to be fully independent from a men's team, aligning with Togethxr's women- and athlete-led founding team.

The move isn't just about visibility for Togethxr. The company's classic shirt hit $6 million in revenue last year. 

These London City jerseys are fun, but the team is already fighting an uphill battle as the black sheep of the league. It's hard to see these outdoing the rest of the Togethxr catalog, but it is a nice change of pace from the airline, betting and tech logos that typically adorn the fronts of jerseys.

What's new with WSL?

Speaking of the WSL, the new season kicks off Friday with reigning champion Chelsea hosting Manchester City at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The league's offseason saw a record broadcast deal (roughly £65million, though it's still unclear how to watch in the U.S.), young forward Olivia Smith becoming the first £1 million player in the women's game and debutants London City flexing their financial muscle.

While Chelsea looks to repeat its success, the WSL itself is undergoing its most seismic structural changes since expanding to 12 teams in 2019. Here's what you need to know:

But those are just the highlights. Check out what else is new for the upcoming season.

The postseason is still two months away, but the Kansas City Current have already secured their spot in the playoffs.

They beat the North Carolina Courage 2-0 at CPKC Stadium last Saturday, exactly what they needed to mathematically claim their postseason spot with eight regular-season games remaining and tie the 2024 Orlando Pride as the fastest team to secure a playoff spot in NWSL history.

Kansas City has spent 14 straight weeks at the top of the table, scoring 36 goals and earning 46 points with a 15-1-2 record. Their closest competitor, the Washington Spirit, is 14 points behind. They're also tight on the other end, allowing just 10 goals this season — five fewer than Orlando, the NWSL's next-best defense.

The club may have missed the chance for a home championship game last year, but the Current are clearly out for revenge this season.

One man's search to revolutionize U.S. youth soccer

The American youth soccer system is vast and complex. It's also a bit messy and driven largely by money and conflicting motives.

In August 2023, new U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker arrived in the United States from England to change that.

In his first two years, Crocker hired Mauricio Pochettino as the U.S. men's national team head coach and Emma Hayes as the boss of the U.S. women. With those two leaders in place, it was time for Crocker to look at the coaching across all 27 national teams he oversees and the youth coaches that feed into that system.

In his preliminary research, Crocker found that from 2014 to now, there was a “slight, slow decline” in the number of USWNT players in the world top-50 and top-250 lists. On the men's side, there were no players in the top 50.

So began the evangelism of “the U.S. Way” across the country, as Henry Bushnell writes. The project includes a digital platform for data, training programs and film to aid coaches across the disjointed landscape.

Advertisement

Simply put: Everyone in the U.S. landscape has their motives, and Crocker wants to unite them for the future of the sport in the country as a whole.

Is Alyssa Thompson going to Chelsea?

The answer right now is unclear.

Thompson also posted a cryptic message to her social media about not letting others rob you of your happiness. Keeping our eyes on this one.

The WSL transfer window doesn't close until tomorrow. And a lot can happen in a few days — or even hours.

One other headliner from the weekend: The Saudi Women's Premier League window closed Sunday night with Bay FC striker Asisat Oshoala joining Al Hilal.

The NWSL secondary transfer window closed last week, but teams are still allowed to trade among themselves until the roster freeze on Oct. 9. International players can also be signed through that date, but they need to meet certain conditions and can't play in the NWSL until the next window, which is January.

Numbers show everyone does watch women's soccer

For years, women's soccer was treated like the “nice to have”: great stories, inspiring athletes, but no real selling point. The big advertising money went to the NFL, NBA, MLB and men's soccer, where the spreadsheets behaved nicely.

Now, data is giving us a serious plot twist: Parity, a sports marketing and sponsorship platform focused on professional women athletes across 85 sports, surveyed about 2,400 U.S. sports fans and found that:

Translation: These fans aren't just loyal, they're commercially dangerous — in a good way.

Sponsorship dollars are already catching up. The NWSL banked $75 million in sponsorship revenue last year. Angel City, Kansas City and San Diego are leading the charge, and defender Ali Riley has more endorsements than any U.S. star. Add in a $240 million media rights deal and suddenly women's soccer isn't the side dish — it's the main course.

You can read the full report here.

— Asli Pelit

Turbulence: Manchester United Women moved one step closer to securing a return to the Champions League on Saturday with a 2-0 win over Hammarby. Despite flying on a private charter to Sweden, some players had to pay for their own flight home after the club offered only a commercial flight with a connection through Copenhagen on the return trip.

Who to watch: By now, the WSL stars are clear, be it by trophies or transfer fees. However, The Athletic helps you stay on the lookout for the ones you may not know — yet.

Know the name: On Friday, 16-year-old KK Ream became the youngest player to score in the NWSL regular season (by 52 days). Her Utah Royals teammates shared their pride for Ream and told The Athletic about what it was like to be part of league history.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","How Much Alex Morgan Made in Her First NWSL Season","https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/how-much-alex-morgan-made-in-her-first-nwsl-season/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:27:30 GMT","

Alex Morgan made less than $300 per match during her first 22-game season in the NWSL.

The two-time FIFA World Cup winner revealed that her first season in the nascent soccer league saw her earn a grand total of $6,000 to play for the Portland Thorns.

“Not a month. For the season,” she said on a Wednesday, September 3, appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. “$6,000 to play in the NWSL for the season.”

Morgan's revelation came in a conversation with podcast host Alex Cooper about her role in advancing the NWSL and the rights for women's soccer players throughout her 16-year pro career.



“I look at these young players coming into the NWSL, and I'm like, ‘Yeah you have that confidence. You walk in there proudly and you ask for what you deserve,' because in a lot of ways, that's what we fought for,” said Morgan, 36. “Players are getting over $500,000 now to play, and maybe in three years, a million. And maybe in three more years, $5 million. Who knows?”

Morgan has long been an advocate for pay equity in soccer, even joining with her U.S. Women's National Team teammates in 2022 in a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation. The resulting settlement gave women's soccer players $24 million and ensured men's and women's Team USA members would receive equal pay moving forward.

While both Cooper, 31, and Morgan acknowledged that progress is often much slower, it is tangible in the NWSL. As of the league's 2024 collective bargaining agreement, the new minimum salary is $48,500, which will grow to $82,500 by 2030. The CBA also began to relax the rules on teams taking charter flights and eliminated the draft and free agency restrictions.

“Holding yourself accountable and knowing we all have a part to play and also we likely won't reap the benefits of what we're fighting for, but the hope is that our kids will,” Morgan added. “My hope is my daughter knows nothing other than equal; she knows nothing other than having as much access to a soccer field, to the best coaches, to the best opportunities because I played some small part in it.”

Morgan announced her retirement from professional soccer in September 2024 at the same time she announced her second pregnancy.

“I'm retiring and I have so much clarity about this decision and I'm so happy to be able to finally tell you,” she said at the time in an Instagram video. “It has been a long time coming and this decision wasn't easy but at the beginning of 2024, I felt in my heart and soul that this was the last season that I would play soccer.”

Morgan and husband Servando Carrasco welcomed son Enzo in March 2025. They also share daughter Charlie, 5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","USWNT star Wilson announces birth of daughter","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/uswnt/2025/09/02/uswnt-star-wilson-cardinals-wr-wilson-announce-birth-baby-girl/85948389007/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 01:19:55 GMT","

U.S. women's national team star Sophia Wilson (née Smith) has welcomed a baby girl along with her husband, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson.

Wilson made the announcement on her Instagram story on Tuesday, posting a picture of a baby's feet along with the caption: ""Hi world.""

The Portland Thorns forward didn't immediately announce the baby's name or birth date. She had previously revealed that she and her husband were expecting a girl.

The Wilsons announced in March that they were expecting their first child. That announcement came just two months after they were married.

The couple originally met at Stanford University, where they both excelled at sports. The player then known as Smith was a soccer standout while Wilson was a star on the football team.

Michael Wilson is getting set to begin his third season in the NFL, all of which have been with the Cardinals after he was drafted in the third round in 2023.

Sophia Wilson, 25, has won a number of team and individual honors already in her career. She was named NWSL MVP in 2022, a year in which she also led the Thorns to the league title. In 2021, she helped the Thorns win the NWSL Shield.

She was also named the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year in 2022, and was a key member of the USWNT's gold medal-winning side at the Olympics in 2024.

Overall, Wilson has 24 goals in 58 caps for the USWNT.

Wilson has not played for the Thorns or the USWNT in 2025 after announcing her pregnancy in March.

The Thorns have eight matches remaining in the regular season, concluding with a game against the Houston Dash on Nov. 2. Portland is currently in sixth place in the NWSL table.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Five Things to Know: USMNT vs. Korea Republic","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/09/five-things-to-know-usmnt-korea-tim-ream-son-heung-min","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:06:57 GMT","

The U.S. Men's National Team is back in action for September international friendlies.

First, the USMNT takes on Korea Republic in Harrison, New Jersey on Sept. 6. Then the U.S. will face Japan on Sept. 9.

 With the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaching, the USMNT gets a look at two nations that will be back in North America next summer for the tournament.

 It'll mark the first time the USMNT has matched up with Korea since 2014. The U.S. will have the chance to even up the all-time record which currently sits at 2W-3L-2D.

Here's everything you need to know before the USA faces the Asia Power:

1. Continuing Gold Cup Momentum 

After the USMNT's Concacaf Gold Cup Final run, veteran defender Tim Ream said the squad developed a better understanding of the expectations from head coach Mauricio Pochettino. That understanding only continues to build moving forward.

“The guys who were here during the Gold Cup, we know what the standard needs to be, and what it is going forward,” Ream said. “Just making sure everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, making sure we're on the same page — we're on the same team. We're trying to move things forward and make sure we're in a good position moving into the next year and into the World Cup.”

Including September, the USMNT has three international windows this year to grow further under Pochettino, who was hired in September 2024. Ream said that while these matches are friendlies, with the World Cup looming, every opportunity together as a National Team is imperative to building chemistry.

2. Back in Stars and Stripes 

Defender Sergiño Dest and forward Folarin Balogun could earn their first cap of 2025 in the September matches after battling injury.

Dest tore his ACL in April 2024 and hasn't played with the USMNT since the Americans won the 2024 Concacaf Nations League. The right back was on the initial roster for the summer but instead opted for a training program to further work back from injury. Since then, Dest has had a strong start on the club side with PSV, with two goals and an assist through five matches.

Balogun has dealt with a couple of injuries. First, a dislocated shoulder, which kept him out at the end of 2024. Then he sustained an ankle injury that forced him to miss the summer Gold Cup run. If either of them makes an appearance in the two friendlies, it'll be the first cap under Pochettino

3. A USMNT Legend Honored 

Before the USA and Korea kick off, USMNT legend Michael Bradley will be honored in a pre-game ceremony. Bradley is the third-most capped USMNT player with 151 international appearances, including 48 matches captained, from 2006 to 2019.

Ream wore the captain's band eight times in 2025. The 37-year-old defender played with Bradley for several years, from Ream's first days with the USMNT to his first time captaining.

“I don't know that I've ever really given him credit, but I'm sitting here today because of some of the things and some of the conversations that he and I have had over many camps and over many years,” Ream said. “A lot of great memories, lot of great camps. And just watching him, and knowing how professional he was, and the leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together is something that I always left camp in awe of, really. I tried to use that when I would leave and still trying to use those examples.""

4. A World Cup-Qualified Test 

The USMNT faces two top AFC opponents, both of which have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. The first, Korea, punched its ticket in June to the tournament co-hosted by the United States.

It will be the 12th appearance for the Asian nation led by forward Son Heung-min, one of the most popular Asian players in football history who this summer signed with LAFC in Major League Soccer. Saturday's match between the USMNT and Korea Republic will be a reunion of sorts. USMNT head coach Pochettino coached Son from 2015-19 back in their days at Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League.

5. Familiar Faces in Familiar Places 

The match at Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls, marks a homecoming for several USMNT players on the roster.

Midfielder Tyler Adams grew up in Wappingers Falls, New York and came up through the Red Bulls Academy. Forward Tim Weah, also a New York native, spent a year with the academy before departing for France and PSG's youth program.

Ream was drafted by the Red Bulls in 2010 in the second round of the MLS SuperDraft. He played two seasons with New York before leaving for the UK. The center back returned to MLS in 2024 after more than a decade overseas. He now suits up for Eastern Conference club Charlotte FC where he's played the last two seasons.

Today's News

International Football

U.S. striker Folarin Balogun, back with the national team for the first time in nearly a year, said Wednesday that the injuries that kept him away from the USMNT are “behind me.”

“I'm in a good shape, and in a good way,” Balogun said via Zoom from U.S. camp in Morristown, N.J., ahead of Saturday's game against South Korea.

Those injuries cost him four consecutive U.S. camps, the team's first four under head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Balogun, after starting or appearing in all nine A-team games for the USMNT in 2024 under former head coach Gregg Berhalter and interim Mikey Varas, missed camps in October, November and this past March due to injury. He was initially named in Pochettino's pre-Gold Cup squad, but also withdrew from that camp due to an ankle ailment.

“It was a tough period, but I think every athlete goes through that at some stage,” Balogun said.

Another ankle issue in August cost him a preseason game and Monaco's Ligue 1 opener. It was presumably part of the reason why the 24-year-old was not on the first version of the USMNT's September roster, which was revealed last week.

But when Brian White withdrew due to injury, U.S. Soccer contacted Balogun, who'd made his 2025-26 debut that past weekend, playing 90 minutes in a 1-0 loss to Lille.

“I got the call — I can't remember the date, exactly, but it was a bit late,” Balogun acknowledged Wednesday.

“I was really happy,” he added. “It was important for me to be back with the team.”

Several days later, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3-2 win over Strasbourg. Then he jetted across the Atlantic, to New Jersey, where he was one of the last to arrive at U.S. camp.

Now, he will get his chance to make a delayed first impression. He is one of a few players who, at roughly the midway point of Pochettino's tenure, are meeting and training under the new boss for the first time.

“Everyone wants to make an impression,” Balogun said. “And I think that's just natural, with such a big competition coming in 10 months, it's important to leave your mark.”

That “big competition,” of course, is the World Cup. The 2026 edition, slated for June and July in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, would be Balogun's first.

For roughly 11 months, the countdown to that milestone coincided with Balogun's absence from the USMNT. Now, a first opportunity to impress the coach who'll select the U.S. World Cup roster might lead some players to press, to over-exert, to try to be something other than themselves.

“That's part of the psychology, to not overdo it, because things will just become more complicated,” Balogun said. “The harder you try sometimes, the more difficult it is.”

But Balogun is comfortable searching for and finding a middle ground, and pushing for a potential place in the U.S. starting lineup come next June. He'll compete with EFL Championship leading scorer Josh Sargent and new Southampton signing Damion Downs for the prime minutes at striker in this camp, which also includes a friendly against Japan.

“It's something I've been doing all my career, fighting for my position and fighting to get in teams,” the former Arsenal academy product said. “I believe that's a balance that comes naturally to me.”

Dynamic pricing has drawn complaints in other areas

Start of sales process for tournament will begin next week

Fifa has confirmed that it will employ dynamic pricing for tickets to the 2026 World Cup from the beginning of the sales process, which starts next week. The system was also used for this year's Club World Cup and, in the UK, drew widespread complaints from fans buying tickets for Oasis's comeback tour.

The use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed around ticketing for the World Cup one week before sales open, including the first collection of prices. The cheapest tickets will start at $60 (£44), with the most expensive, for a prime spot at the final, starting at $6,730 (£5,760). Fifa did not provide any price points in between those two.

Dynamic pricing means that those starting prices can, and probably will, rise significantly. This will be the first men's World Cup to use the scheme, in which the ticket prices are adjusted by the seller to reflect demand – ­similar to the way surge pricing works for .

Ticket companies have benefited significantly from dynamic pricing as its usage has risen over the last ­decade . Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation broke its record for revenue in 2024, with dynamic pricing thought to be a significant factor. The practice has also attracted complaints from fans priced out of events – including in high-profile cases surrounding Oasis's tour and last season's FA Cup final.

Fifa officials justified the use of dynamic pricing by saying it was the organization's way of adapting to the domestic market in the United States and Canada, where the practice is common, and where it says the public already accepts that event tickets will be priced according to demand. One official added that Fifa couldn't pass up the additional revenue that would be generated by dynamic pricing, citing the 211 Fifa member nations that could benefit from a more profitable World Cup. According to the officials, Fifa never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing – suggesting the topic was never really up for debate.

The pricing structure is expected to be put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales, which begins on 10 September. Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on, meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others before the World Cup draw has even begun.

Fifa used dynamic pricing at the 2025 Club World Cup, with mixed results. Prices for those games initially rose sharply, only to drop – in some cases as low as $13.40 (£10) – just before kickoff as stadiums remains only partially full. However, demand at the World Cup is almost certain to be significantly higher than at the Club World Cup, and a Fifa official said that this time around prices would not go lower than $60.

Another significant change described by Fifa officials comes in the way tickets are categorized for the World Cup. In past tournaments, Fifa has broken down seats into a category system, with Category 1 generally considered to be the best seats, Category 2 the next best, and so on until Category 4. It had been standard practice for a seat's placement in relation to the pitch to affect its categorization: a seat along the sideline, for example, was far more likely to be considered Category 1, while a seat at the same level but located behind the goal might be Category 2 or lower.

That approach is no longer in use. In 2026, seat categories will in most cases correspond to the level of the stadium the seat is located. At the World Cup final, for example, the entire lower level of MetLife Stadium is expected to count as Category 1, with the suite level in the middle counting as Category 2, and then the upper bowl making up Categories 3 and 4.

Once again, Fifa officials said that the change was made to bring the organization in line with perceived cultural norms in the host countries. The officials said that according to their research, North American fans place a higher emphasis on proximity to the field than they do having a certain type of view of the match.

Fifa and longtime financial partner Visa announced in late July the details of the first phase of ticket sales, and those remain largely the same. From 10-19 September, Visa cardholders worldwide may submit an application on Fifa's website, and by 29 September the randomly accepted applicants will be notified and given a date and time window in October, during which they can buy tickets. A Fifa official said that application data would be screened to prevent the influence of bots, and that the randomized draw would be made in the presence of a public notary in Zurich.

As in past World Cups, fans may buy single-game tickets, or packages that give access to every game at a certain venue, or every game played by a specific team. Tickets will only be sold by category, with seats assigned at random within those categories until the final phase of sales, in which fans can buy specific seats on a first-come, first-served basis, many months after dynamic pricing has gone into effect.

Fans can buy a maximum of four tickets per match, for a maximum of 10 matches during the tournament. Fifa said it would operate a resale marketplace in an effort to avoid scalping.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Real Madrid's Gonzalo Garcia has admitted that his rapid rise into the spotlight, capped by a starring role at the FIFA Club World Cup, still feels surreal.

The young forward, who has been a key figure in Xabi Alonso's project, especially at the Club World Cup, sat down with AS to reflect on his journey so far and the challenges ahead.

The 21-year-old is clear about his ambitions with the national team as well. “I always aim for the top. Being able to represent my country in a World Cup… It's a dream. As it would be for any other player.”

He also revealed how limited his contact has been with Spain boss Luis de la Fuente, explaining,

“I haven't had much time to talk to him. Just one training session, and we said hello on the field. Pretty good, four of us made it up there, and it was amazing.”

Furthermore, when reminded of comparisons with former Madrid striker Joselu, he was quick to downplay them.

“I appreciate it, but let's be clear, there's a big gap between me and Raul or Joselu. I'm just starting out, and hopefully I can get close to the numbers they've achieved with Madrid or the national team.”

Speaking about the similarities between Xabi Alonso and Alvaro Arbeloa, Garcia noted,

“Every coach has their own style of play, their own way of seeing football. They are similar in many ways, such as in high pressure. 

“It's not that they are very, very similar and tell us different things, although there are similarities.”

As a forward, he accepts the responsibility of pressing from the front.

“The forward is the first to press when the goalkeeper takes a goal kick, and when the forward presses, it always makes things easier for the team. 

“When you press, if you win the ball back closer to the opponent's goal, you're closer to scoring (smiles).”

The 21-year-old was later asked about the comparisons between Alonso and Carlo Ancelotti, to which he noted,

“With Ancelotti, last year, I came on at very specific moments. It's not like I was there long enough to have an opinion. 

“What I can talk about is Xabi and what he's been telling us. That we need to polish those details to get closer to what he's trying to convey to us.”

Perhaps the most defining moment of his young career came when he was told he would start against Al Hilal in the Club World Cup.

“I'm not going to lie, I knew there was a possibility because Kylian was ill. Obviously, I was surprised, but I approached it with confidence. 

“I was sure of myself because I had worked hard to take advantage of any opportunity. (Thinks and laughs) And I was very happy with how it went.”

On the advice he received that day, he added, “The coach always made me feel calm and confident. 

“He told me to be confident, to press well, to bother the centre backs so they couldn't get the ball out, and when we had it, to try to pin down the centre backs. 

“And inside the box, to take advantage of any opportunity that came up to score a goal.”

That tournament ended with Garcia winning the Golden Boot, something he is still processing. “There, as the World Cup goes on, you don't realize it. 

“You're focused and there are games every day, you don't have time to digest it, but once I'm back in Spain and I'm with my family and friends, you talk about how it was and how it all happened. 

“You look back and think, ‘If someone had told me a year ago… finishing the season playing with the first team and winning the Golden Boot… I can't believe it myself.”

Far from feeling overwhelmed by Madrid's galaxy of stars like Kylian Mbappe, Garcia remains grounded.

“In the end, it's true that you go from playing for Castilla and watching your idols on TV to training with them, and that, of course, impresses you.

Gonzalo garcia knows the value of being grounded. (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images)

“I am just very grateful to be able to share a locker room with them, with the best players in the world.”

His pride was equally evident when speaking about his contract renewal. “I was extremely happy when it was finalised.

“It's the dream of any youth player, and for me it was very special after so many years at the club. I'm very happy to be able to say after so many years that I've fulfilled a dream.”

As for shirt numbers, Garcia was relaxed: “In the summer, my agent was negotiating with Madrid and told me about the options available, but in the end, my priority was to be part of the first team. 

“The number is secondary. Being able to play for the best club in the world… With any number!”

Finally, reflecting on his Santiago Bernabeu appearance against Mallorca, he added,

“Special. I was lucky enough to play there for a year, as I had to move there for family reasons. 

“I was lucky to make good friends and have good teammates, and I'm very happy to have been able to play a few minutes against them,” he concluded.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella has revealed how U.S President Donald Trump crashed their Club World Cup celebration in New Jersey.

Marc Cucurella has enjoyed significant success since moving from Brighton to Premier League rivals Chelsea in the summer of 2022, both at club and international level. Yet an encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump has been one of his more memorable recent moments. 

The former Barcelona youth product played a key role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and followed that trophy by lifting the UEFA Conference League with Chelsea. The London club then capped off the season by winning the first edition of the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, held in the United States this summer.

That last title has certainly left a lasting impression on Cucurella, as he revealed in an interview with AS' Joaquín Maroto ahead of Spain's upcoming 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Turkey. Thanks to Chelsea's Club World Cup win, the 27-year-old became the holder of a rather unusual record: he is the only Spanish athlete who has ever been photographed with Trump.

So how did that moment play out, with the then–U.S. president taking center stage on the podium at a stadium in New Jersey?

“It was definitely an experience,” he recalled. “He stayed up there on the podium to celebrate the title with us. But at the same time, we had been told we couldn't start celebrating until he left. And the thing was, Trump wouldn't leave. He wanted to be right there with us.”

“He even walked away with a winner medal,” he added. “I've seen that same medal displayed in his office at the White House.”

Cucurella's Club World Cup triumph will be remembered not only for the trophy itself but also for the unusual podium moment with Donald Trump, a one-of-a-kind experience in the left-back's career.

Here's when you'll be able to buy FIFA World Cup tickets. 

The countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is on, and FIFA has released the full timeline for when tickets will be available.

The majority of tickets will be sold through random lottery drawings — three phases in total — before the remaining tickets go on sale to the public on a first-come, first-served basis, similar to past tournaments.

The World Cup will take place next summer in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, including in Philadelphia, where six matches will be played at Lincoln Financial Field. 

Prices will vary widely: Early group stage matches will start at $60, while the most expensive seats, for the World Cup final, will start at $6,730. And prices may climb even higher — FIFA confirmed it will use “dynamic pricing,” meaning costs could change depending on demand.

Interest is already sky-high. FIFA officials say 8.5 million people have created a FIFA ID account to apply for tickets.

Here's what you need to know about the phases, dates, and how to apply.

The first phase, called the “Visa presale draw,” is fast approaching.



When: Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. through Sept. 19 at 11 a.m. 

How to apply: Create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets, log in during the window, and complete the Visa presale draw form (a Visa card is required to be eligible).

Need more detail? The Inquirer has a full guide on how to enter the presale draw with step-by-step instructions.

What's included: Single-match tickets to all 104 games, plus venue-specific and team-specific options. That means fans in the Philadelphia area could buy tickets for matches at Lincoln Financial Field — if selected.

Next steps: Winners will be notified starting Sept. 29 and assigned a date and time in October to buy tickets.

When: Oct. 27–31

How to apply: Use your FIFA ID to fill out the early ticket draw form at FIFA.com/tickets.

Next steps: Winners will get purchase time slots in mid-November through early December.

The random selection draw is the final phase of random ticket lotteries before the remaining World Cup tickets can be purchased without applying through a random lottery.

When: Early December–Spring 2026 (after the final draw on Dec. 5, when teams and groups are set)

How it works: Same process as earlier lotteries, but this time you'll apply for tickets to specific matches.

Once the lotteries end in the spring, any remaining tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. FIFA will also launch an official ticket resale platform at FIFA.com/tickets.

Supporter tickets — for fans who want to sit in their team's fan sections — will be made available closer to the tournament.

⚽ Bottom line: The first chance to apply for tickets opens Sept. 10, and you'll need a FIFA ID and a Visa card to enter. Additional lottery phases and open sales will follow, so even if you don't land tickets right away, more opportunities are coming.","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Has the USA ever won the FIFA World Cup?","https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/has-usa-ever-won-fifa-world-cup/bltf05868463777788b","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 07:16:49 GMT","

A look at the history of the U.S. men's national team in the FIFA World Cup.

Ever since their inaugural bout in 1930, where they reached the semifinals, the United States men's national soccer team (USMNT) have recorded FIFA World Cup appearances. 

In fact, the semi-final finish in 1930 put them on the podium as it was recognized as a third-placed finish. This tournament also saw American striker Bert Patenaude score the first hat-trick in World Cup history, officially recognized by FIFA in 2006.

Following their notable 1–0 upset against England in the 1950 World Cup group play, the U.S. team did not qualify for the tournament again until 1990. They then participated consistently from 1990, with the only exception being the 2018 World Cup.

No, the USA has never won the FIFA Men's World Cup. Comparatively, the U.S. women's national team (USWNT) have enjoyed far more success, winning the Women's World Cup four times: 1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019.

Getty Images

The USA's best finish at the FIFA Men's World Cup was third place in 1930 — the inaugural World Cup held in Uruguay. Although the tournament in 1930 did not have an official third-place match, FIFA later awarded third place to the USA based on goal difference and overall performance compared to the other losing semifinalist (Yugoslavia). The USA reached the semifinals before losing 6-1 to Argentina.

Before the World Cup expanded to 16 teams in 1934, until subsequently to the new 48-team format in 2026, the 1930 event only featured 13 teams with a four-team knockout bracket sans a round of 16 or the quarterfinals.

Since then, their most notable recent performance was reaching the quarterfinals in 2002. Narrowly losing to Germany 1-0, it may be considered the USA's best modern-era performance.

Yes, the USA will be at the 2026 Men's FIFA World Cup — it has already secured its place as one of the host nations alongside Canada and Mexico. FIFA's Council confirmed on February 14, 2023, that all three host nations will receive automatic berths into the finals. These spots are taken from CONCACAF's total allocation, without having to go through the regional qualifiers.

Marc Cucurella has revealed a behind-the-scenes incident that occurred during the Club World Cup, which was held in the United States of America.

The Chelsea defender spoke about the moment when US President Donald Trump presented the medals to the winning team, in this case the ""Blues"", who defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the final, writes ""Gazeta Express"".

The Spanish defender even reveals that Trump had taken a medal with him during the awards ceremony, in addition to the trophy, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino had previously given him.

""It was an experience, that's clear. He stayed there on the podium to celebrate the title with us. But, on the other hand, we said we wouldn't celebrate until he left. And, the fact is, Trump didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay there. He even got a champions' medal, which I saw in his office in the White House,"" the left-back told Spanish media outlet AS.

Furthermore, he also spoke about the experience at the Club World Cup, which was held for the first time in the new format, although there were difficulties, especially with the high temperatures.

""I hope things improve at the World Cup, because it was difficult to play in those conditions, with such great heat. I hope things improve next summer,"" the Spanish footballer further underlined.

""We among the favorites? Spain will be a candidate because we are the reigning European champions, we have the level and the enthusiasm. Let's see if we can close the qualifiers in the best possible way and arrive at the World Cup in good shape,"" concluded Cucurella. /Express newspaper

World Cup

FIFA said Wednesday that ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup will start at $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats and range to $6,730 for the most expensive tickets to the final – but all of that is subject to change once sales begin in October.

A FIFA official, speaking to reporters on a Zoom call Tuesday, confirmed that organizers will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets.

This means that prices may – and probably will – change before and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when group-stage matchups, dates and locations will be set.

“We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” the FIFA official said.

An initial ticket phase, featuring a lottery, will open Sept. 10. Fans will apply for the chance to purchase tickets (using a Visa card); and if randomly selected, they'll get the opportunity to buy up to 40 — up to four per match, for up to 10 matches — in a specific time slot in October.

A similar second phase, which will not include the Visa card requirement, will run from late October through early December. There will then be another lottery phase, followed by a first-come-first-served phase, after the World Cup draw.

FIFA officials said they had not yet determined all of the initial prices. They will divide tickets into four categories — with Category 1 being the most expensive and Category 4 the least expensive — but when asked about the prices for Category 1, 2 and 3 tickets to group-stage matches, one official said that those numbers weren't set.

He also would not say how many of the $60 tickets will be available, nor what percentage of a given stadium will be considered “Category 4” seats, though he did say that percentage will “not be insignificant.”

In general, the lower bowl of stadiums will be Category 1; the second deck will be Category 2; and the upper deck will be Category 3 and 4. In most of the sales phases, fans will purchase tickets in these categories without knowing what section or row they'll be assigned; they will not be able to choose specific seats.

The initial $6,730 maximum price for the final is not a hospitality ticket — those are already on sale, and range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person across the tournament.

The regular-ticket maximum is more than four times the price of Category 1 tickets to the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, which cost $1,605. (Category 2 was $1,002, and Category 3 was $604.)

The FIFA official said Tuesday that organizers had “committed to the $60” as a starting point, but that “we will apply variable pricing from Day 1 of the process.” That means prices could rise or fall during the presale phase, which will run through Oct. 21. (Sept. 19 is the deadline to apply.)

Although dynamic pricing is typically associated with price increases, the opposite happened ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. Months after FIFA overestimated demand with its initial prices, the cost of tickets plummeted as FIFA scrambled to fill otherwise-empty seats.

The expectation, though, is that demand for the 2026 World Cup, which will feature 104 matches in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be much higher, and prices could rise.

“We do not intend at all to change prices every five minutes,” the official clarified, but he acknowledged that part of the process would involve automation.

To justify the “variable pricing” approach, he and another World Cup official said that it would allow FIFA to maximize revenues and attendance. Soccer's global governing body, which runs the World Cup, expects to make over $3 billion from hospitality and ticket sales. It also expects to smash the previous World Cup attendance record, which is still held by the 1994 edition, a 24-team tournament in the U.S.

The FIFA official also cited local customs. “What FIFA is doing is adapting to the domestic market,” he said. “And it's a reality in the U.S. and Canada that events are being priced as per the demand that is coming in for that event.”

FIFA will also adapt its resale strategy to North America. When ticket sales begin, it will launch its own resale platform. In the past, it has capped prices on these secondary sales, to prevent fans and scalpers from reselling for profit. But in 2026, for ticket buyers in the U.S. and Canada, there will be no cap, according to World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schrigi.

The reason, Schrigi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

The exception is for Mexico, where resale laws are stricter. After extensive discussions with the Mexican government, FIFA agreed to create a separate, dedicated resale platform for Mexicans fans, who will only be allowed to post their tickets for resale at face value. It will function more like a ticket exchange than a resale market.

When asked what fees or cut of resales FIFA would take on its official platform, a spokesman said that would be finalized at a later date.

FIFA officials said that around 1 million tickets would likely be available in the first Visa presale phase — out of roughly 6 million in total for the tournament.

One official mentioned that 8.5 million people had officially “registered their interest” in tickets since FIFA began asking fans to do so.

The World Cup is slated to begin June 11 in Mexico City and conclude with the final July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

For event organizers like FIFA, dynamic pricing comes with dual benefits.

It allows them to raise prices if and when they sense they can make more money on tickets.

It also allows them to set high initial prices, knowing they can eventually lower those prices if sales are slow. (This is precisely what happened with the Club World Cup.)

The argument against dynamic pricing, of course, is that a lower fixed price would allow fans with less money to experience the World Cup.

The argument for dynamic pricing, essentially, is that a lower fixed price also incentivizes scalping. The scalpers then resell for profits, and the outcome for most consumers is the same — prices on the secondary market end up just as high as, if not higher than, the dynamic prices FIFA could charge. The only difference is that the money ends up in the hands of the scalpers — some of them Average Joes, some of them slimy profiteers — rather than FIFA.

Some would argue that's a good thing. FIFA would argue that the money should go into its coffers and then out into the world to fund football development.

And because FIFA controls the World Cup, FIFA's argument wins.

Looking to buy tickets to FIFA World Cup 2026? Here's everything you need to know about the first wave of ticket sales.

The presale draw is the first of four phases for ticket buying for the World Cup – set for June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The ""Visa Presale Draw"" begins Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. ET and will end on Sept. 19 at 11 a.m. ET, allowing fans worldwide (who are Visa cardholders) to register to buy World Cup tickets.

FIFA says the draw will be randomized, and eligibility will be established with a no-value transaction. Fans can go to FIFA.com/tickets to sign up.

On Sept. 29, applicants will be notified if their application was successful.

From Oct. 1 to Oct. 21, ticket buyers will be issued a dedicated date and time slot to purchase their World Cup tickets.

Ticket buyers will be issued a ticket in a category seating range, based on the 16 different World Cup venues across the three countries. Specific seats will be assigned later.

After the presale, FIFA says multiple additional ticket phases will launch in the coming months.

“Get your tickets early, especially if you know where you'll be because you live in that city or you're a fan of the three hosting nations. You know already when and where they'll play. Get your tickets early, because anything can happen,” FIFA World Cup 26 chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi said during a Sept. 2 media briefing.

While the World Cup match schedule is already set, the matchups not featuring host nations will be determined following the FIFA World Cup draw on Dec. 5.

The United States (Group D) will play group stage matches in Los Angeles on June 12, 2026, in Seattle on June 19, 2026, and Los Angeles again on June 25, 2026.

Mexico (Group A) will play in the World Cup opening match at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, 2026. They will also play on June 18 in Guadalajara and June 24 in Mexico City.

Canada (Group B) will play group stage matches in Toronto on June 12, 2026, and Vancouver on June 18, 2026 and June 24, 2026.

The World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.

Here's everything you need to know about the FIFA World Cup presale draw

Prospective World Cup ticket buyers need to sign up for a FIFA account, and have a Visa payment card. After Oct. 21, fans will be able to buy World Cup tickets with other payment methods.

FIFA will have approximately 1 million tickets for sale during the Visa Presale Draw phase.

FIFA says the lowest price ticket for group stage matches will be $60 USD, while the most expensive ticket price for the World Cup final will be set at $6,730 through each ticket purchasing phase. However, dyanmic pricing could affect how much those prices could fluctuate based on demand.

Fans will be able to purchase three different types of tickets:

There are four categories of World Cup tickets available to purchase, reflective of the level seating areas in World Cup venues. FIFA will provide maps of each stadium venue, explaining the ticket categories.

FIFA says a ticket buyer can purchase up to four tickets per match, for up to 10 matches, 40 tickets in total.

FIFA will also launch its own resale platform for ticket holders to safeguard fans against invalid or unauthorized resale tickets. Note: Ticket resellers outside of Mexico will be able to set their own resale prices.

“We are not capping the FIFA resale platform in terms of ticket prices. Obviously, people would go to other resale platforms and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want,” Schirgi said.

“We want to keep a safe and secure, and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets, also ensuring that from a technical point of view, that the resale ticket actually works when you come to the gate.”

The next ticket sales draw following the Visa Presale draw will be in November. FIFA is in discussion with the three host nations to see “if and how” they can give domestic customers priority to buy tickets in their home countries.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

World Cup

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are not yet on general sale, but soon, the yearslong wait will end.

After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Advertisement

The opening of a presale application window on Sept. 10 will mark the start of a multi-phase process that is now more defined, but still requires lots of explanation.

So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

The “Visa Presale Draw” opens at 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 10, but you do not need to rush to your computer or smartphone that day. You can enter anytime between then and Sept. 19. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The first official purchases of tickets, by the successful applicants, will then happen in October.

For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December.

Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup.

Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing).

To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.”

You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform.

And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible.

Yes. (Visa is a FIFA sponsor, hence the scheme.)

A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access.

But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods.

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person.

If you'd like to go to a game with a larger group, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs.

You'll have three options, per FIFA:

You won't have to choose between these options until October. When you apply, you're merely applying for a place in line — for a time slot. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says.

The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. Most tickets, though, will be more expensive, and probably much more expensive. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices.

And all of those prices could change. FIFA will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer.

The highest price for the 2026 World Cup final will start at $6,730, FIFA said Wednesday. That's more than four times the price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2022 World Cup final, which cost $1,605.

In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69.

The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section.

For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

A Category 1 ticket, for example, might be in the 20th row of the lower bowl in a sideline section level with the penalty box; or it might be on the second deck closer to midfield.

Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. “Fans value the front-row seat much higher,” an official said, “than the seats that have a technical view of the pitch.” So, rather than sideline vs. endline, the delineation will generally be lower level (Category 1), second deck (Category 2) and upper deck (Category 3 and 4).

FIFA will release maps of each stadium showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022.

In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app.

Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. The main difference there is that the transfer of tickets into your account and app depends on the seller, and isn't always immediate. (More on that below.)

For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market.

“You will get your ticket in the app at a later stage, not at the moment of the purchase,” Jean-Marie Tardy, a FIFA ticketing manager, said of the system generally on a TicketCo podcast in 2023. “And once the ticket is loaded into your app … you've got all the information about all your tickets — the seat category, the stadium, the match, even the seat details — but you don't get anything that can get scanned at that moment.”

FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. And many sites are already doing that. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches.

FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schrigi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA can.

FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.”

Those sites don't require a seller to upload the digital ticket to list it.

They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have.

So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. And there are four main theories about what, exactly, those “tickets” are:

That remains up in the air. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

The Visa presale draw opens Sept. 10. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

Arlington hopes residents will apply","https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-09-03/fifa-world-cup-is-looking-for-volunteers-in-north-texas-arlington-hopes-residents-will-apply","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:47:00 GMT","

Arlington is encouraging residents to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as the world's largest sporting event grows nearer.

The city will host the most matches of any city with nine, and Deputy City Manager Jennifer Wichmann said the tournament will need a lot of volunteers.

Anyone who is selected as a volunteer would work eight to 10 shifts of about eight hours, she said. In return, they will get World Cup gear like hats, backpacks and T-shirts, along with possible access to the games while volunteering.

Multilingual volunteers will be in especially high demand since around 54% of visitors, including non-ticket holders, are expected to be international.

The city is looking for ways to get those international visitors to stick around Arlington when they're not attending games or FIFA events, some of which are expected to be held in the entertainment district on non-game days.

According to data from the city, international visitors are expected to stay between nine and 10 days on average, and less than half are anticipated to speak English.

The World Cup is expected to have “Fan Activation” events in the Arlington Entertainment District and at Fort Worth's Sundance Square, according to Wichmann.

She encouraged anybody interested in learning more about the tournament to visit the World Cup 2026 page on the city's website.

The city includes information for residents, visitors and businesses.

It offers guidance on volunteering, the match schedule, short-term rentals like Airbnb and the match schedule for residents. For visitors, the city has compiled information on lodging options, travel information and things to do around the city between matches.

Business owners can also use the website to learn more about commercial regulations and permitting guidelines.

Wichmann said more information will quickly start becoming after Dec. 5, when FIFA will announce which matches will be played and where.

That will open the door for teams to pick basecamps – with six possible locations identified around North Texas including in Mansfield, Dallas and Fort Worth.

The city will hold a town hall for businesses in and around the entertainment district at 1 p.m. Sept. 25 in the Convention and Visitors Bureau auditorium. Another town hall with a yet-to-be-determined focus will be held Oct. 23 at the same time and place.

Preparations are underway in Arlington for next year's FIFA World Cup.

ARLINGTON, Texas - The Arlington City Council released more details about the preparations for the World Cup.

What we know:

The city expects most international visitors to spend about 10 days in North Texas for the tournament.

Law enforcement will limit activity and close off most streets surrounding AT&T Stadium before and after matches to focus on security and other needs.

Arlington Deputy City Manager Jennifer Wichmann said the city is also encouraging local business owners to get excited about the event, saying the opportunity to market to visitors will be key.

""That kind of creativity is what we're trying to help our business see and understand. It most likely won't be a direct contract with FIFA, but it might be a way to attract visitors to your restaurant or enhance a hotel. So we're really working with our community to help with that,"" she said.

Applications to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held in North Texas, are set to open on Monday.

Council members also dug into the next steps for thousands of volunteers. The applications opened in August and FIFA will reach out to every person who applied this month and next.

FIFA said once approved, volunteers will work several eight-hour shifts. They will get merch in exchange for their time.

People who speak multiple languages are in the highest demand.

The Associated Press reported that the 2026 World Cup will follow the same format as in recent years, just with a bigger collection of teams. 

There will be 12 groups of four teams. The teams in each group play each other and the top two will advance to a knockout stage. The eight best third-place teams will also advance. The knockouts will be played from the round of 32 to the final.

NEW YORK - The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament in international soccer, but its list of champions is a very exclusive club. Since the first tournament in 1930, only eight countries have managed to lift the coveted trophy.

The backstory:

Brazil holds the record for the most World Cup wins with five titles and is the only team to have competed in every tournament. The most recent winner is Argentina, which won its third title in 2022. 

Lionel Messi won the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar with his Argentinian teammates after defeating France in one of the most intensely dramatic finals in memory. The match ended 3-3 after extra time and was decided in a nail-biting penalty shootout. Argentina won the shootout 4-2, and Messi lifted his first World Cup at 35 years old.

Will a new country surprise us in 2026 and make it to the list of champions? Or will we see the return of another giant lifting the prestigious World Cup trophy?

Premier League sides spent big strengthening their respective squads, but neither PSG nor Barca made many moves in the market

The 2025 summer transfer window closed on Monday, bringing an end to a summer of almost endless drama and controversy. Premier League sides spent more money than the other 'Big Five' leagues combined, meaning there's a very real risk of title-challenging teams from La Liga, Serie A, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 becoming feeder clubs for England's elite.

That said, Real Madrid splashed a fair bit of cash remodelling their backline, taking Trent Alexander-Arnold away from Liverpool in the process, but it's not as if the right-back is being missed at Anfield, which bore witness to one of the most remarkable spending sprees in football history.

The Dutchman was hamstrung by a raft of big departures, but his lack of passion and stubbornness rubbed his new employers up the wrong way

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was first up on the bonfire of former Manchester United coaches that took place in the space of four days around the weekend, sacked by Besiktas just minutes after they failed to qualify for this season's Conference League. Less than 24 hours later, his United predecessor, Jose Mourinho, was fired by Fenerbahce as they came to terms with missing out on reaching the Champions League league phase. 

Neither decision came as a huge surprises given the coaches had both presided over disastrous eliminations from European football, while Mourinho had caused chaos and controversy throughout his 12 months in Istanbul. But when Erik ten Hag became the third former Red Devils coach to lose his job in a matter of days, dismissed by Bayer Leverkusen on Monday after just three matches in charge, there was widespread surprise. Well, everywhere except from within Germany.

The writing had been on the wall for some time for Ten Hag, who accepted the most poisonous of chalices by succeeding Xabi Alonso, Leverkusen's greatest-ever coach, in the same summer that the club also parted with a number of the players who had helped the charismatic Basque coach make history two seasons ago by winning the club's first Bundesliga title as part of an unbeaten domestic double.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

From Champions League winners to exciting young talents, there have been plenty of eye-catching players on the move in this summer's transfer window

This summer's Women's Super League transfer window has had pretty much everything. It's had a record-breaking transaction, taking Olivia Smith to Arsenal for the first million pound fee in the women's game; it's had heroes of the Lionesses' European Championship triumph on the move, with Michelle Agyemang loaned back to Brighton and Chloe Kelly making her Arsenal switch permanent; and it's seen established superstars move to the English top-flight for the first time, including two Champions League winners in Fridolina Rolfo and Ellie Carpenter.

It means there are a lot of new faces for fans of the WSL to get to know this summer, be they players who have already made a real name for themselves overseas, or young, upcoming talents with the potential to be world-beaters. That intrigue permeates across the league, too, with it not just the big guns who have been making a splash in the market.

So, who are the new signings that fans should be keeping an eye on for the 2025-26 WSL season? GOAL picks out 10 names worth tracking as the new campaign begins...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Novak Djokovic was tested by Taylor Fritz on Tuesday at the US Open, but managed to navigate the key moments and capitalise on the American's missed opportunities to continue his quest for a record-extending 25th major crown.



The 38-year-old, who has lifted the trophy in New York four times, dispatched last year's finalist 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 to extend his perfect Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Fritz to 11-0. Fritz will rue his two-for-13 break-point conversion rate, letting slip his first nine break opportunities.

""Incredibly close match,"" Djokovic said in his on-court interview. ""It was really anybody's match. I thought I was lucky to save some crucial break points in the second set. I think for most of the second and third set, he was a better player. In these kind of matches, a few points decide the winner.""


After below-par performances in the early rounds and several visits from the physio during those matches, Djokovic has played into form throughout this fortnight and will next face rival Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster semi-final clash. Djokovic leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including victories in their past two matches. Friday will mark their first encounter at Flushing Meadows.

There has been a lot of talk of a Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz final at the US Open this fortnight. The World No. 1 and World No. 2 have met in the past two major championship matches, with their previous five clashes on Tour coming in title deciders.

However, one man keen to block out the Sinner-Alcaraz noise and spoil the party is Novak Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major. The 38-year-old Serbian defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets on Tuesday night to set a semi-final meeting against Alcaraz.

“We know that they are the two best players in the world. Everybody is probably expecting and anticipating the finals between the two of them. I'm going to try to mess up the plans of most of the people,” Djokovic said. “Let's see. Sinner still has to win a couple of matches to get to the final. But they are playing the best tennis of any players here. They have been the dominant force since the beginning of the tournament.

“But I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court. I don't think anybody does really when they play them, but particularly not me. I put myself in another semi-final of a Grand Slam this year. I have been very consistent, most consistent on Slams this season and that's what I said at the beginning of the year, where I would like to perform my best tennis and make the best results. Here we are. I have another chance, another shot.”

Djokovic has advanced to the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025, losing to Sinner at Roland Garros and Wimbledon and retiring against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open.

The four-time US Open champion is chasing his first major since he won in Flushing Meadows in 2023 and might have to go through both Alcaraz and Sinner if he is to end his two-year wait. Sinner – who meets Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals – and Alcaraz have won the past seven majors between them.

Having defeated Fritz in three hours and 27 minutes, Djokovic is hoping to be ready to go by the time he walks back onto Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday. He leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“It's not going to get easier. I tell you that,” Djokovic said cracking a smile. “I'm going to try to take one day at a time. Really take care of my body. Try to relax and recover. The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed. I just would really love that.

“I would love to be fit enough to play and to play potentially five sets with Carlos. I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion. Normally I like to play the big matches on a big stage. It's just that I'm not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days. But I'm going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that.”

Djokovic also reflected on his quarter-final win against Fritz in his post-match press conference. The seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, up three spots to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, improved to 11-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the American.
“Taylor is the kind of player that if you allow him to play, he's going to try to dictate, he's going to be aggressive, stay close to the line. He's going to take his forehands and punish you. I was just trying to survive, just trying to stay in the rally, make him play,” said Djokovic, who is 31-9 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
“I think it was good for me that he wasn't making a lot of first serves in the first couple of sets. Then he raised the level of the first serve, and the first-serve percentage went up. Then, all of a sudden, it was so much more difficult for me to stay in his service games. But then, you know, I think in important moments in the fourth I served well, mixed it up, came to the net as well…. It's one of those days where you just have to grind, you know. You just have to play with your heart and fight.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","All set, no sweat: Alcaraz stymies Lehecka for US Open SF spot","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-lehecka-us-open-2025-qf","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:28:18 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz extended his spotless US Open campaign with an ultra-clean quarter-final showing on Tuesday, dismissing Jiri Lehecka in style to stay in contention for his first hard-court major title since 2022.

The 22-year-old Spaniard hustled for a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 victory to reach the semi-finals in New York without dropping a set. Into the last four at a hard-court major for the first time since the US Open in 2023, Alcaraz will face four-time champion Novak Djokovic in a blockbuster matchup.

The dominant scoreline, however, doesn't fully reflect the high-octane nature of their duel. Lehecka, one of just six men to defeat Alcaraz this season after winning their Doha clash in February, pressed the Spaniard to the brink in plenty of high-quality exchanges.

But that did nothing but fire up Alcaraz, who rose to the challenge with trademark flair, producing a dazzling array of drop volleys and audacious shotmaking that left the Czech struggling to keep pace. Alcaraz's highlight reel included a remarkable back-to-the-net drop volley on the stretch to cap a physical 21-shot rally in the second set.

CARLITOS 👉 SEMI-FINALS ❤️‍🔥@usopen | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/KN2YOLfM8f

“I'm not, but sometimes when I go to the living room, my little brothers are watching my highlights, so I just sit down and watch them,” Alcaraz said with a smile when asked if he watches back his hot shots. “Everytime I watch my shots again, it reminds me [during] matches.”

Beyond the artistry, Alcaraz was imperious on serve, surrendering just seven of 45 points behind his first delivery and facing no break points during their one-hour, 56-minute quarter-final clash.

With a Tour-leading 59 wins and six titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz looks in good stead to better his career-best tally of 65 wins and six trophies from 2023.

With the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings also up for grabs this week, Alcaraz ramped up the pressure on fierce rival Jannik Sinner. If he can match or better the defending champion's result in New York, he will climb to World No. 1 for the first time since September 2023.

“If I think about the No. 1 spot too much, I'm going to put pressure on myself, and I just don't want to do that,” Alcaraz said. “I just want to step on court, try to do my things, follow my goals and try to enjoy as much as I can. The No. 1 [spot] is there, but I try to not think about it too much.”



Alcaraz, who leads Sinner 9-5 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, is seeded to meet the Italian in the final for a fifth consecutive tournament in which they have both featured in. Sinner takes on countryman Lorenzo Musetti in Wednesday evening's quarter-final.

Despite defeat, Lehecka can reflect on a milestone campaign in New York, where he reached his second major quarter-final and rose six spots to No. 15 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, ensuring his Top 20 debut on Monday.

Lehecka owns a 34-18 tour-level record this season, highlighted by winning his second ATP Tour title in Brisbane in January and reaching the final at Queen's Club, where he was defeated by Alcaraz in three sets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","'You need to show up': Venus implores Serena to join her, Fernandez in Queens","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4355533/venus-williams-serena-williams-us-open-doubles","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:11:15 GMT","

Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach. The American-Canadian pairing is into the quarterfinals in New York.

Update: Venus and Leylah Fernandez's doubles run ended on Tuesday with a 6-1, 6-2 loss to the top-seeded team of Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. Sadly, Serena never showed up at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, but we know she was locked in at home.

NEW YORK -- Serena, you're on the clock.

Venus Williams called her sister out and requested her presence in New York after reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open doubles draw, alongside partner Leylah Fernandez, on Monday.

""She's given us advice, and we just need her in the box,"" the 45-year-old icon said in her on-court interview after the pair's impressive 6-3, 6-4 win over 12th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai. ""So my message is, 'Serena you need to show up.'""

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

Asked later what kind of advice the 23-time Grand Slam singles champ had for her sister -- whom she won 14 major doubles titles with, don't forget -- Venus said Serena is a motivator, and she can hardly contain her nervousness watching them on TV.

""She gave me a pep talk and made sure to call me today,"" Venus said. ""She's definitely coaching from afar. She's so excited. She gets so nervous watching, and she's got the kids watching. They're all at home, just really on our side.""

But if Serena is going to coach them, Venus prefers that she do so in Queens, not from a distance.

""If she came, it would be a dream for both of us, and we'd have her on the court coaching,"" Venus said. ""We'd force her to hit, even though she doesn't hit often. It's probably best she doesn't come because we'd probably bully her.""

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

It's been quite an interesting tournament for Williams, who lost in the revamped mixed doubles event before dropping her first-round match to now-quarterfinalist Karolina Muchova.

But Williams decided to stick around in New York a bit longer, accepting a wild card into the doubles draw with Fernandez. They've torn the house down in Louis Armstrong Stadium since playing their first match last Thursday, winning three straight without dropping a set and becoming one of the more delightful stories of the tournament.

But they're much more than just a nice story; they're a legitimate threat to win it all. We all know about Venus' doubles pedigree, and Fernandez -- a former US Open singles finalist in Flushing Meadows -- is also a former French Open doubles finalist.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

They'll face their stiffest test on Tuesday, again in Louis Armstrong Stadium (their happy place), against the top-ranked doubles players in the world, Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. 

Hopefully Serena will be in the house to give them an extra boost. Though the way they're playing, they might not need one.

The 2022 champion is into his third semifinal in Flushing Meadows in four years.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 02, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 02, 2025

NEW YORK—Few have played Carlos Alcaraz tougher in 2025 than Jiri Lehecka, who split a pair of three-set matches with the former world No. 1 earlier this season.But the US Open proved a different stage entirely as the second-seeded Alcaraz blitzed No. 20 Lehecka, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to race into his third semifinal in four years at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Tuesday.""I think that today I kind of met the Grand Slam version of Carlos,"" Lehecka said after the match. ""I felt that against Carlos, if you want to beat him, you need to win at least few of the big points, and he won all of them, you know. Even when I played really good rally, even when I tried to put him under pressure, go to the net, change the rhythm, do something, he was there, and he had an answer for everything I tried.""Alcaraz won his first major title in Flushing Meadows back in 2022, but has not won a hard-court major since, picking up two titles each at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. The former No. 1 has not dropped a set this year and now stands two wins from his second US Open victory after a one-hour, 56-minute victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium.Lehecka was partly responsible for some of Alcaraz's hard-court struggles earlier in the year, stunning the Spaniard in three sets at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in February. Though he avenged the Doha defeat two months ago on grass in Queen's Club, Alcaraz conceded the big hitter from the Czech Republic has become a formidable rival.

“I struggle every time that I played against him,” Alcaraz said after reaching the last eight on Sunday. “There is no doubt about it.

You know, that he knows how to react when someone is playing well, when someone is playing this or that.”That focus wasn't there in the early goings for Lehecka, who dropped serve in the opening games of the first and second sets and failed to make in-roads on return as Alcaraz eased to a two-set lead.

I think that today I kind of met the Grand Slam version of Carlos. Jiri Lehecka

Lehecka opened the third set more promisingly, keeping on serve through the first six games. He saved a break point in the seventh, outvolleying Alcaraz at net to take a 4-3 lead.Alcaraz found another opening two games later, flipping a 30-0 deficit to earn another break point, this time converting after turning defense to offense and drawing a wild forehand error from Lehecka.""If I want to beat a guy like him, then I really need to show my best at the big points, because every time I had a chance—for example, in the second set when there was a close game when I had a chance to go at least for a break point, you know, there was a good rally. We played very good rally, but unfortunately, he was everywhere. He always managed to do something special,"" Lehecka said in his post-match press conference. ""So even although I didn't play bad, I played very good shot or something like that, he had the answer. Yeah, that was kind of demotivating sometimes.""

NEW YORK—On Sunday, Taylor Fritz was asked why he thought he had an 0-10 record against Novak Djokovic. His answer was simple:“I think the first, almost like seven or eight times I played him, I probably just wasn't a good-enough player to really have that much of a chance.”Fritz is a better player now, and he showed that by pushing Djokovic through four competitive sets in the US Open quarterfinals on Tuesday night. But in the end, the reason for his 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 loss was the same: He wasn't as good as Djokovic.Djokovic and Fritz looked and played much the same. They were both dressed in black. Both have similarly lanky but strong builds; Fritz is 6'5”, Djokovic 6'2”. Both hit semi-Western forehands and two-handed backhands. Both spend most of their time pummeling the ball from the baseline.

But with the exception of the serve—and even there it's close—Djokovic does all of those things a little better than Fritz. He can rally for longer. He can spread the court more and put his shots closer to the lines and the corners. He's a better returner, a looser and more flexible mover, a better defender, and he has a better transition game. And while Fritz had more aces and won a higher percentage of his first-serve points, Djokovic was the more clutch server: He saved 11 of 13 break points, while Fritz saved five of nine.All of this meant that Fritz faced a difficult tactical question: Should he use his pace to try to end the points quickly, knowing that Djokovic is a rock from the backcourt? Or should he extend the rallies, knowing that he has 11 years on Djokovic? Fritz, according to his coach, Michael Russell, followed his usual instincts and opted for the former. It got him closer than he's been in the past, but still short of victory.

It didn't help that he got off to a predictably nervous start, missing first serves, overhitting forehands, and going down an early break. While the American settled down soon after, he never got that break back. The match's first inflection point came with Djokovic serving at 5-4. Five times he faced a break point, and five times he saved it, each with an aggressive play.“In many of my service games I was just trying to stay alive, fight for every ball,” Djokovic said. “He was aggressive, staying close to the line, not easy to play him.”That pattern held through the first nine games of the second set. Fritz reached break point with Djokovic serving at 1-2, 2-3, and 5-4.

But then, with the prospect of a dreaded fifth set looming, Djokovic knuckled down. At 4-4, he played a crisp attacking game and held at love. With Fritz serving at 4-5, a nearly exhausted Djokovic hung on for dear life through a series of long rallies with the crowd urging Fritz on, and closed it out on his third match point.“It was incredibly close match, it was really anybody's match,” Djokovic said. “In these kind of matches, a few points decide the winner. It was fortunately coming on my side, end of the fourth. That last game was nerve-wracking.”As for Fritz, it was a case of déjà vu all over again: He couldn't take the points he needed most from Djokovic.“That's one of the things that makes, like, the great players great. They win the big points, and that's something that I kind of touched on before the match is, like, I'm going to need to go out and take those points from him,” Fritz said. “He's not just going to hand them over to me.”“That's exactly what happened. A lot of my weapons, aggressive shots were just not there, letting me down. So I felt like it was tough for me to go out and take those points.”

Djokovic was uncharacteristically subdued in victory. In part, he was a bit chastened by his fights with the crowd.“I wear my heart on my sleeve,” he said. “I'm really proud of the fight I put in.”The other reason he may have been more low-keel in victory. He's already thinking about his next assignment: A semifinal war with Carlos Alcaraz, in two day's time.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

IndyCar racer Colton Herta will spend the 2026 season as Cadillac's test driver, following the signing of Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as the team's main driver pairing.

Hot on the heels of the announcement of their driver line-up of Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez for 2026, Cadillac have revealed that IndyCar racer Colton Herta will fulfil the role of test driver at the team.

American driver Herta, whose name had been spoken of in relation to a seat at Cadillac before the Bottas/Perez line-up announcement came on August 26, was the youngest ever IndyCar winner back in 2019, and has nine victories and 16 pole positions to his name from his 116 career starts in the series.

Reflecting on the announcement, 25-year-old Herta – son of former IndyCar and ChampCar racer Bryan Herta – said: “This is a dream opportunity, and one I've been working towards for a long time. To be part of Cadillac F1's entry at such a pivotal time is something I couldn't pass up.

“My dream has always been to race in Formula 1, and I see this move as a huge step towards that goal. For now, my focus is on giving everything I can to Cadillac F1, helping build a competitive team.”

Cadillac's Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, meanwhile, added: “Colton is an exceptionally talented racer with proven speed, race craft, and maturity well beyond his years. His experience in top-level American motorsport as part of the TWG Motorsport family makes him an ideal fit for this role, and he will bring valuable and fresh insight, perspective, and energy to our team as we continue to build for the future.

“Having an American driver join an American Formula 1 team is a hugely significant moment, not only for our team, but for American motorsport as a whole.

“Colton represents the passion, ambition, and competitive spirit that define the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, and we are proud to have him carry the American flag with us on the world stage.”

Herta has previous F1 experience, having tested a 2021-spec McLaren MCL35M at Portimao back in 2022 – with McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown saying at the time: “We're very serious about anyone we put in our Formula 1 car… The first gate to get through is: do we think this driver is World Champion, Grand Prix-winning capable? And if the answer to that is yes, then we continue to proceed.”

Meanwhile, the move will mark a return to European racing for Herta, who competed on the continent from 2015-16, including time as Lando Norris' team mate in the 2015 MSA Formula Championship, before returning Stateside.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Having remained calm under pressure for another win this season, Oscar Piastri is already gaining comparisons with some of Formula 1's greatest.

Oscar Piastri has reacted to claims that he shares similar traits to those of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, following his impressive victory at the Dutch Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver claimed his first Formula 1 Grand Slam last weekend in Zandvoort, having taken pole, set fastest lap and led every lap en route to his seventh win of the 2025 campaign.

Piastri's win extended his lead over title rival and team mate Lando Norris to a substantial 34 points after the Briton was forced to retire in the closing stages with a mechanical problem.

In the post-race press conference, the Australian was asked whether he was aware he had been compared to Schumacher given his cool and calm approach when placed under pressure.

""Anytime you get mentioned in the same sentence as Michael Schumacher, that's a good thing,"" said Piastri.

""I've got a hell of a long way to go to be talked about in the same air as someone like him but I'll take it.""

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella previously worked with Schumacher during his time at Ferrari, becoming his performance engineer as the German amassed five Drivers' titles with the Scuderia.

The McLaren boss praised Piastri's performance in Zandvoort, stating: ""I think with Oscar, he makes it look simple. He was very calm like always and fast at the same time. Precise in execution so a deserved victory.""

Although Piastri sits with a comfortable margin in the Drivers' Championship, the 24-year-old believes that with nine races remaining the title battle is far from over.

""No, I don't think so,"" said Piastri when asked if he could play a percentage game over the remaining races.

""I need to keep pushing and try to win. I wouldn't say it's a very comfortable margin, as we saw today, it can change with one DNF [retirement] very, very quickly so this far out from the end of the year, it's not a comfortable gap.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

From Oscar Piastri's champagne spray to Lewis Hamilton's Instagram praise, here's how the paddock and beyond welcomed Hadjar into the spotlight.

Not every rookie podium feels like a watershed moment. Isack Hadjar's did. At Zandvoort, the 20-year-old Frenchman didn't just take home a trophy, he stole the spotlight.

From the hugs in the pit lane to the champagne spray on the podium, the celebrations told the story: everyone wanted to be part of his breakthrough.

And when the cheers faded trackside, the party rolled on online, with drivers and fans filling his feed with praise.

Hadjar's first congratulations came straight from those closest to him. Team mate Liam Lawson wrapped him in a hug, while fellow French drivers Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly added their own warm embraces. George Russell also stopped by to share the moment.

On the podium itself, Oscar Piastri made sure Hadjar got the full treatment with a cheeky champagne spray. And sharing the rostrum with him, Max Verstappen offered a handshake and a few words of encouragement, a surreal moment for Hadjar, who has long looked up to the Dutch superstar.

Well-known team bosses like Red Bull's Helmut Marko and McLaren's Zak Brown made a point of congratulating the young Frenchman. For someone only a few months into his Formula 1 career, recognition like that showed just how big this moment was.

The celebrations didn't stop when the engines turned off. Online, Hadjar's podium quickly became one of the weekend's most talked-about moments, with tributes pouring in across Instagram.

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton led the way, posting in support of the rookie. Coming from one of the sport's most decorated champions, the gesture was more than just a nod, it was a powerful endorsement that amplified Hadjar's arrival on the big stage.

Not far behind, Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon and Max Verstappen each shared their own tributes. For Gasly and Ocon, it was a proud moment to see another French driver join the spotlight. And Verstappen, fresh from celebrating his own home podium, still made time to congratulate the rookie standing beside him.

The wave of support didn't stop there. Alex Albon and Yuki Tsunoda added their congratulations, George Russell gave Hadjar a nod of recognition online, and rising star Kimi Antonelli made sure to celebrate the milestone too. Together, it felt like the entire grid wanted to welcome Hadjar into the spotlight.

Hadjar's own post quickly became a wall of applause. Motorsport figures such as Sergio Pérez, Arthur Leclerc and fellow Frenchman and former F1 star Romain Grosjean were all in the comments. Even Lando Norris, whose awful luck opened Hadjar's window of opportunity, chipped in with his congratulations.

Hadjar's first podium wasn't just a personal victory. It was a reminder of the camaraderie that still runs through F1. Fierce rivals on Sunday, but quick to unite when one of their own hits a milestone, the grid showed its brotherhood in full force.

Hadjar may be a rookie, but on this weekend, he was welcomed into the F1 family for life.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was half a second away from scoring a point at the Dutch Grand Prix, following criticism earlier in the weekend by the team's Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore.

Franco Colapinto has earned praise from Flavio Briatore after narrowly missing out on a points finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Alpine chief calling it “probably his strongest” performance of the season so far.

Going into the weekend, Briatore made headlines by declaring that he was “not happy” with Colapinto's results since the Argentinian took over from Jack Doohan at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix – having so far failed to score.

However, Zandvoort brought more encouraging signs from the F2 race winner, who made his F1 debut as a Williams substitute driver last season before being released to join Alpine over the winter, initially as a test and reserve driver.

Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out.

In an encounter full of incidents and Safety Cars, and amid battling displays from both drivers, Alpine split their approach for the final restart by giving Colapinto fresh tyres and leaving Gasly out on old rubber.

Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position.

“Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”.

Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. It was a race where we had to be alert and ready to capture any opportunity. I felt I drove well and, at the flag, [scored] my best finish of the season.

“As a team there are some parts of the race we will assess to see what we could have done better. We made a call at the end to pit for softs during the final Safety Car to try and attack cars ahead towards the points. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end.

“There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

With nine races remaining, Max Verstappen believes Lando Norris still has a chance at this year's title.

Max Verstappen has stated that Lando Norris needs ""to keep working hard"" and put the disappointment of retiring from the Dutch Grand Prix behind him if he is to stand a chance at this year's title.

Norris and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri have been locked in a battle for the Drivers' Championship all season, with just nine points separating the pair heading to Zandvoort last weekend.

Norris was shadowing his team mate throughout Sunday's race until the closing stages when he suffered a mechanical problem that forced him to retire.

With Piastri claiming his seventh win of the season, Norris now trails his title rival by 34 points with just nine races of the season remaining.

After finishing second at his home event, Verstappen was asked how easy it was to pick himself up from setbacks in his own title battles, particularly in 2021 when the Dutchman fought Lewis Hamilton for the title.

During that season, Verstappen suffered a high-speed puncture in Baku when leading, and also recorded non-scores at Silverstone and Monza after collisions with Hamilton.

""I mean, it's out of your control. So, you just need to keep working hard, keep trying to win,"" said Verstappen.

""As simple as that. Especially when you are team mates, you have the same car, same opportunities. It's probably a little bit more complicated than when it's two different teams, but still a lot of races and you can see things can swing.

""You don't know if you [will] get a mechanical failure or not, it's out of your control. So yes, it's not ideal, but there are enough races to either turn it around or not, and time will tell.""

While Piastri has yet to retire from a race this season, finishing all 15 Grands Prix in the points, the Australian suffered a setback at the opening race in his home country after spinning off in the rain and believes nothing is guaranteed yet.

""I need to keep pushing and try to win,"" he said.

""I wouldn't say it's a very comfortable margin, as we saw today, it can change with one DNF very, very quickly so this far out from the end of the year, it's not a comfortable gap.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola join forces once again to look back on two landmark cars from the legendary Niki Lauda's career – the Ferrari 312T and the McLaren MP4/2B.

As F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary this coming Monza weekend, and off the back of the Dutch Grand Prix, it's a good time to look at two landmark F1 car designs, both associated with the legendary Niki Lauda.

The Ferrari 312T of 1975 was the car which took then-26-year-old Lauda to the first of his three world titles. The 1985 McLaren MP4/2B was the car in which 36-year-old Lauda won his final Grand Prix – at Zandvoort – before retiring for good at the end of the season. These two cars, respectively 25 and 35 years into the F1 World Championship's history, show just how fast F1 technology evolved in the intervening decade.

Designed by the genius Mauro Forghieri, the Ferrari was at the cutting edge of 1975 F1. Conforming to the 3-litre F1 in force at the time, it was a beautifully integrated design. Neither turbocharging nor ground effects had yet hit F1, the introduction of both technologies to the category not coming until two years later. The Ferrari 312T was the ultimate iteration of the pre-ground effect, normally-aspirated F1 car.

At its heart lay the flat-12 engine designed by Forghieri and used by the team since 1970.  Laying the cylinders down flat (in two banks of six) rather than in the conventional vee positions of rival engines lowered the car's centre of gravity and allowed a greater volume of air to flow to the underside of the rear wing, boosting downforce.

It had taken some time for Ferrari to fully exploit these two inherent advantages, however. Although the 312B and 312B2 models had won races regularly between 1970-72, the dominant teams of the time were Lotus and Tyrrell, both of which used the Ford Cosworth DFV engine, a brilliant design available to customers off the shelf. Its V8 format made it more compact (and slightly lighter) than the flat-12, and it used less fuel.

Forghieri came to realise that the Ferraris – in having to incorporate the 12-cylinder engine and bigger fuel tanks – were a little longer than ideal, denying them the agility of the best Cosworth cars. Forghieri began to think about how to centralise the car's mass to give it that same agility despite the long engine.

Taking a break from running the F1 team in 1973, he designed an experimental prototype with a very short wheelbase – enabled by moving the radiators from the front and rear to the sides and re-siting the fuel and oil tanks. The distinctive nose of this design earned it the nickname of ‘The Snowplough'. Although it was never raced, the late-season version of the 1973 312B3 race chassis incorporated its side radiator layout.

This became the basis of the 1974 car. It was still labelled the 312B3 but was very different in appearance to the previous year's machine. It incorporated the side radiator layout but Forghieri had further optimised the layout of the side bodywork to make a bigger gap beneath the rear wing.

The area freed up at the front from moving the radiators was used to fashion a big delta front wing, taking its inspiration from the ‘snowplough' prototype. It also featured much wider bodywork, as Forghieri had realised from running his 312P design in the enclosed wheel sports car World Championship that the bodywork width could be used to help create more downforce.

The skinny ‘toothpaste tube' F1 cars of the previous era in the late 1960s/early '70s had prioritised lowering drag. There was a growing realisation that there was more lap time in using the bodywork to enhance downforce than would be lost to the greater drag. The 1974 312B3 pitched that trade off where Forghieri reckoned would give the best compromise.

It was a big success – comfortably the outright fastest car of the season, with Lauda scorching to nine pole positions in his first season with the team. But although team mate Clay Regazzoni took the title fight to the final round, ultimately Ferrari lost out to McLaren's Emerson Fittipaldi.

But Forghieri knew there was more performance to be unlocked, if he could centralise the car's mass even further. The more centralised the mass, the greater agility a car will have. His solution was to turn the gearbox sideways. This transverse layout was acknowledged in the 312T designation.

It made its debut in the fourth round of the '75 championship and went on to power Lauda to five victories and a comfortable win in the Drivers' World Championship. Ferrari won the Constructors' for the first time in 11 years – and would go on to win the following two as well.

Ferrari's mid-1970s pre-eminence was brought to an end by the advent of ground effect aerodynamics – introduced in 1977 by the Lotus 78. The airflow through the sidepod venturi tunnels which generated the negative pressure from the underfloor was effectively blocked by the Ferrari's flat-12 layout.

Rather than adapt the flat-12 into a V12 – as Alfa-Romeo did during that time – Ferrari instead concentrated on creating a new turbocharged 1.5-litre V6 engine, which would race for the first time in 1981.

Turbocharging had been introduced to F1 by Renault in 1977. The 3-litre formula regulations in place since 1966 had always allowed for a forced induction engine, but at half the permitted capacity of a naturally-aspirated motor. This penalty was felt to be too restrictive to make a supercharged or turbocharged engine competitive. But Renault thought otherwise – and eventually were proved dramatically correct.

By 1985 the various turbos from Renault, BMW, Ferrari etc were delivering up to 1,500bhp in Qualifying trim, with around 750bhp available in the races. This compared to around 515bhp of the final version of the Ferrari 3-litre flat-12 in 1980. Ground effect aerodynamics had brought similar giant gains in downforce until the governing body stepped in to regulate flat-bottom cars from 1983.

All these developments had intrigued Lauda in his two-year hiatus from F1 in 1980-81. That technical fascination was part of what attracted him to the idea of returning to F1 – for McLaren in 1982.

McLaren had pioneered the use of carbon fibre as the material with which to construct the chassis. It allowed a vastly stiffer chassis for a lower weight than a conventional aluminium chassis – and by a happy coincidence, much better impact protection.

The search for performance had actually contributed to greater safety. This too appealed to Lauda as he prepared to make his F1 return, something which would culminate in his winning a third world title in 1984, in the McLaren-TAG MP4/2. It was designed by John Barnard, who specified the dimensions and layout of the V6 turbo engine to Porsche, the contracted supplier. The motor was labelled a ‘TAG' in recognition of the funding of it by McLaren's partner, Mansour Ojjeh's Techniques Avante Garde company.

For 1985, the MP4/2 was lightly modified to make the MP4/2B. Lauda qualified it at Zandvoort only 10th-fastest but that was not so unusual. The strength of the car was in the race, where the great fuel efficiency of its engine (there was a regulation maximum fuel capacity of 220 litres) allowed Lauda and team mate Alain Prost to use more boost than the thirstier Renault, Ferrari and BMW engines. A decade's worth of technical progress meant that Lauda's qualifying time was over 7s faster than his pole time of 1975 in the 312T.

That car had steel brakes and aluminium chassis. This one had carbon fibre brakes and chassis – not to mention around 50% more power and more efficient aerodynamics.

The race boiled down to a no-holds-barred dice between Lauda and Prost. The latter was on his way to his first World Championship but Lauda used all his guile to keep the younger driver behind him to the flag. It was his 25th and final Grand Prix victory.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Multiple incidents and a penalty played their part in Kimi Antonelli's Dutch Grand Prix weekend.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has thrown his support behind Kimi Antonelli following the rookie racer's turbulent weekend at the Dutch Grand Prix, stressing that he is “going to make mistakes” while getting used to life in F1.

Antonelli has experienced an up-and-down first season in F1, with highs including a maiden pole position for the Miami Sprint race and a breakthrough podium in Canada, and lows including incidents such as a first-lap collision with Max Verstappen in Austria.

When F1 returned from its summer break at Zandvoort, the teenager spoke of viewing the final 10 rounds as “a new start”, but his efforts were hampered almost immediately when he ran off the track during first practice.

Following a Q2 exit in Qualifying, Antonelli worked his way into the points-paying positions on race day, only for an attempted pass on Charles Leclerc for P5 in the closing stages to backfire – the Ferrari driver being sent into a spin and then the wall (see the video below).

Antonelli was subsequently given a 10-second time penalty by the stewards and tumbled down the order to 16th position, prompting plenty of questions during Wolff's post-race media session in the paddock.

“When we made it clear last year in Monza that we would give him the opportunity, we were also saying that we would give him a year of learning, and there would be moments where we'd tear our hair out, and there would be other moments of brilliance,” Wolff began.

“I think this weekend pretty much sums that up. The mistake in FP1, clearly something that puts him on the back foot for the rest of the weekend, and then in the race, these moments of great driving.

“Once he was in free air, he was behind the McLaren, the quickest car, caught up, and then again was involved in that accident that unfortunately meant the end for Charles' race and also for Kimi's race. But we want him to go for the moves, obviously.

“So, up and downs, and that was absolutely expected from this season. And every one of those days is going to be a learning for next year.”

Asked about Antonelli taking out a Ferrari a week before the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Wolff argued that fans would rather see drivers “push to the limit and sometimes over” than be “hesitant” with their actions.

“Well, I was thinking in the race, what would it have been if Kimi would have overtaken a Ferrari?” Wolff said. “I think the people in Italy would have been happy. Italian fans want an Italian driver that is fighting, that pushes the car to the limit and sometimes over the limit. That's what happened today.

“The Italian fans don't want to have a hesitating driver, but someone that goes [for it]. Obviously, from the team's perspective, we don't want to take a Ferrari out. Certainly not. I'm sure that Kimi doesn't want to take a Ferrari out particularly. But it is what it is. It's hard racing.

“I'm sorry for Charles and Ferrari, but we want him to go for the moves, and he should.”

With Mercedes not fighting for this year's Teams' Championship, Wolff added that Antonelli's dramas have “less relevance than next year, when it's important to score the points”.

“We want to have a driver that has speed, that is fast, that learns, that scores the points, but all the big ones [drivers] make mistakes,” he commented, before pointing to Verstappen's rollercoaster arrival in the sport at a similar age.

“It's difficult to compare now because Max was given a different environment in Toro Rosso at the beginning, but there were also some moments where you said, ‘That was a big mistake'.

“Kimi, 18 years old, thrown in this mammoth of a team, representing Mercedes, he's going to make mistakes. Hopefully less mistakes next year and scoring bigger points. But my 100% belief is in him in the long term, and that is just part of the learning.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Both Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll finished in the points for Aston Martin in the Dutch Grand Prix, and they give their views on how the race panned out.

Aston Martin had an up and down weekend in Zandvoort, at times looking set to be McLaren's closest challengers but also enduring two separate car rebuilds. As a result, getting both cars home in the points can count as a success – even if one driver seemed happier than the other.

Fernando Alonso finished eighth but was left frustrated after rueing some of the strategy calls across the race. Having started P10, he dropped down the order after a poor getaway and soon found himself stuck in a queue of cars.

He started to question the calls over the radio, and the team chose to pit him a second time – even though at that point, it looked like everyone was going to try and go to the end on one set of tyres. As such, he missed out on a cheap stop under the Safety Car, but still picked up a handful of places as others came in for more tyres.

“At the end to be in the points in P8 is great, a nice result but the afternoon was not easy,” Alonso explained.

“The Safety Cars didn't help, they were all at the wrong time and the wrong place. And yeah, some of the cars that finished in front of us, I think they were significantly slower than us… [like] the Haas [cars], so we lost maybe an opportunity.”

Aston Martin had started the weekend strongly – both cars in the top four in the first practice session, with Alonso then finishing second in FP2. But their pace faded on Saturday as others began to turn up their engines, and so the Spaniard only managed P10 on the grid.

That, coupled with his poor start, is where his race ultimately came undone – but recovering to eighth at the flag is still a decent result.

“It was tough. I think when we were all in the same conditions in Quali, we were just on the edge of Q3 so yeah, we still need to improve,” he concluded.

As for Lance Stroll, he managed to come home seventh despite starting from P19 on the grid and making contact with Gabriel Bortoleto in the early stages. That moment ended up being a blessing in disguise, as the team brought him in for a very early pit stop.

As such, he undercut his way past the majority of the field – and then benefitted when the Safety Car came out. It was a good recovery from his lowly grid slot, and just reward for his team, who had had to rebuild his car not once but twice thanks to crashes in FP2 and Qualifying.

“Shoutout to the team for rebuilding the car Friday night and then again Saturday after the off in Qualifying,” the Canadian said.

“It was a frustrating weekend until that point but we had good speed though from FP1, we were up there and I felt good in FP3, it was just Saturday afternoon that was a shame so it was nice to bounce back today.”

The result keeps Aston Martin in the fight for fifth in the Championship with Williams, whom they trail by 18 points. But they need to be wary of the recovering Racing Bulls, who are just two points behind now thanks to Isack Hadjar's maiden podium.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Having looked like finishing in the points would be a challenge at Zandvoort, Alex Albon matched his best result of the season.

Alex Albon was left thrilled to come away with fifth place in the Dutch Grand Prix, having benefitted from incidents ahead and a stunning first lap.

The Williams driver could only start P15 for last Sunday's race at the Zandvoort Circuit, and around a track where overtaking has proved difficult, he expected a hard task to score points.

But a stunning opening lap meant Albon moved up five places, before he was able to benefit from a number of incidents ahead to match his best finish of the season.

""We had a really good launch, made a position off the line and then made two more positions into Turn 1, two more into Turn 3 and then we were immediately in the race,"" said Albon.

""I think looking at strategy, it was always going to look like a one-stop and a pretty boring race but we had the start to put us into good contention for a points finish.

""It just seemed like, summer break happened and everyone got a little bit excited on the first race back. On my side, I had good pace and I was happy to stay where I was, I was happy in terms of the feeling with the car but then everyone just seemed to crash so we ended up P5!

""There's a little bit of luck in there but there's also good pace and we put ourselves in a position to score P5. We weren't one of the ones that benefitted from the Safety Car, we actually benefitted purely on race pace as well. I'm very happy.""

The result proved vital for Williams' hopes of securing fifth in the Teams' Championship, with Aston Martin and Racing Bulls only 18 and 20 points behind respectively.

Albon is now optimistic that Monza this weekend will prove a happy hunting ground for himself and Williams team mate Carlos Sainz.

""It could have easily happened where we lost big points this weekend if we didn't get the P5 today; with Isack [Hadjar] scoring P3, it would have been looking a lot more doom and gloom,"" added Albon.

""Very important for us in the Constructors' side. We're going into Monza now which is historically a good track for us. Let's keep this train going.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be used across the Italian Grand Prix weekend.

Formula 1 moves swiftly on from Zandvoort to Monza for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix – and Pirelli have confirmed the tyres that the teams and drivers will have available to them.

At the historic, high-speed Monza track, the compounds in play will be the C3 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

“There is no change in compounds compared to last year, when the track had just been resurfaced for the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“Twelve months on, inevitably the surface will have aged, but it is unlikely to have any significant effect on the range of possible strategies at this circuit, where cars run in the lowest aerodynamic downforce configuration of the season.

“It is likely that the most popular choices for the race itself will be the hard and medium. One can assume that the level of graining will be lower than last year as the track will now be bedded in.

“Time lost in the pit lane for a tyre change is among the longest of the season, so teams will try and run as long a stint as possible, keeping degradation under control, with the aim of only changing tyres once.

“It is difficult to overtake at Monza, primarily because of the reduced effectiveness of the DRS, with the cars running minimum aero downforce levels. This too tends to swing the balance in favour of a one-stop strategy.

“On the other hand, temperature can have the opposite effect given that September in Lombardy can sometimes still feel like the height of summer. This can speed up tyre degradation, which would make a two-stop more competitive.”

Chad Hodge is joining creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as co-showrunner. 


							By

Television Business Editor


Prime Video is ready to send Lara Croft on her next adventure.


	The Amazon-owned streamer has confirmed that Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner will play Lara Croft in its Tomb Raider series from creator, writer and co-showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As THR previously reported, Turner emerged as the frontrunner for the coveted role late last year from a short list of actresses that also included Mackenzie Davis, Emma Mackey and Lucy Boynton. 




	The series has also brought on Chad Hodge (Good Behavior, Single All the Way) as co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge and set a Jan. 19 date for production to begin. Jonathan Van Tulleken (Dope Thief, Shōgun) has also signed on as director and executive producer.

	Turner, whose recent credits include HBO Max's The Staircase and the ITV/CW miniseries Joan, will be the third actress to play the iconic video game character in a live-action adaptation of Tomb Raider. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander took on the role in previous feature films.


	“I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said in a statement. “It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out — Croft is coming.”


	Said Turner, “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft. She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many — and I am giving everything I've got. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.” 

	











	Waller-Bridge, an avowed fan of the video game franchise, began developing Tomb Raider in early 2023, and Prime Video placed a series order for the show in May 2024. Cyrstal Dynamics (which developed the Tomb Raider game franchise), Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM Studios are producing the series.


	Waller-Bridge executive produces via her Wells Street Productions. Hodge, Van Tulleken, Wells Street's Jenny Robins, Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson, Michael Scheel, and Legendary Television also exec produce. 


	Turner is repped by Independent Talent Group and Public Eye Communications; Waller-Bridge, by UTA, Independent Talent, McEwan & Penford and Johnson Shapiro; Hodge, by WME, Anonymous Content and Ziffren Brittenham; Van Tulleken, by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Independent Talent; and Story Kitchen, by WME and Pryor Cashman.

William Santor charmed the movie world and turned the Cayman Islands into his own filmmaking paradise — one built on an allegedly massive fraud. As his scam unraveled, investors lost millions, but it was the conman who paid the ultimate price.


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	In 2024, Ron Perlman was at work on a long-gestating Ernest Hemingway movie alongside his backer, Canadian film financier William Santor, with whom he'd made several projects during the preceding years in the Caribbean. “It culminated in a location scouting trip together in Cuba,” the actor says. “It was mind-blowingly positive. I thought we'd be in preproduction shortly thereafter.”


	Santor, who'd recently thrown his 50th birthday party at the penthouse of The Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman along world-renowned Seven Mile Beach, had become a Caymans kingpin, socializing with everyone from high-ranking public and private sector island insiders to expat Armie Hammer. He was especially known for his generosity in hosting cast-and-crew dinners during productions. “He liked to be the cool guy with the cool wines,” recalls a frequent attendee.

	Figures such as Santor are prized in indie filmdom, where money is scarce and, even when found, usually available with frustrating strings attached. Santor offered the holy trinity: He was affable, disinterested in creative meddling and, most importantly, came with an open checkbook. Everyone in the scene dreams of securing such an easygoing, deep-pocketed benefactor.


	Which is why his dramatic and tragic unraveling — first professional, then personal — has been so unsettling to those who knew and came to rely on him. The consequences have been far-reaching for a moneyman who, it appears, was running a spectacular fraud.


	“He just seemed like a guy enabling filmmakers to live their dreams,” says Perlman, explaining that it's “been a shock to the system.” The actor adds of Santor, “He could greenlight your film. When you meet someone like that, you go with the flow.”

	











	Indie film's perennial money mania has long made it susceptible for trouble. In the 1970s, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was famously funded by mobsters, leading to years of legal drama. In the 1980s, a would-be producer of The Cotton Club who made her fortune in the cocaine underworld ended up hiring hitmen to kill a rival on the project. Since then, there have been headline-garnering cases of accounting fraud (surrounding Battlefield Earth) and money laundering (the sovereign wealth fund that financed The Wolf of Wall Street).


	The Santor scam, which plays into the global arms race around tax incentives, shines a klieg light on the often opaque realm of film finance. And it's stung Canadian pensioners, Caymanian locals and Hollywood creatives alike.


	Not long after that scouting trip with Perlman, Santor's company Productivity Media Inc. was in Ontario bankruptcy court, with CEO Santor himself accused of misappropriating at least $31.7 million. By December, a court-appointed receiver filed an injunction prohibiting him from disposing of assets in the Caymans, including a vast real estate portfolio, cash in a slew of Caribbean bank accounts, luxury goods like jewelry, wine and watches and a fleet of vehicles, including a Bentley Bentayga.


	Weeks later, Santor, a married father of two young girls who'd turned Grand Cayman into an unlikely production hub, had died by suicide at an island property he'd allegedly purchased and been renovating with laundered funds whose market value is more than $7 million. Records indicate that the swindled are primarily working-class Canadian retirees: plumbers, pipe fitters, electricians, roofers and iron workers.

	











	There's perhaps grim irony in Santor's noir-inflected end. His lurid saga — set in the tropics, the plot revolving around deceit and a dead body — would be just the sort of onscreen story PMI specialized in financing.


	***


	Santor, the son of schoolteachers, grew up on a farm outside Ontario. He was a swimmer who competed nationally in the backstroke. “It's a personality type where you're just always yearning: that extra millimeter, that extra millisecond,” he told an entrepreneurship podcast in 2023. He studied kinesiology in college, then got involved in the professional Latin ballroom dance world. But Santor shifted to a more lucrative career path after he witnessed the financial havoc his father's death had on his mother. He soon found employment in Canada's private wealth management sector, working for family offices.


	Looking for a specialty where he wouldn't be competing on deal flow, Santor eventually segued into independent film finance when he learned about Canada's rebates system. These refundable tax credits allow companies to receive cash even if their tax liability is zero. He became a bridge financier, establishing PMI to fund the gaps across different phases of film production. His firm leveraged these credits as well as presales and distribution rights in pursuit of profit.


	PMI's model, reliant on a long-established program run by the Canadian equivalent of the IRS, allowed it — at least in theory — to lower the risk of lending money to indie filmmakers, a notoriously risky business. “The ups and downs of what's happening at the box office and in streaming is less of a driver for us,” he shared on a business podcast in 2024.

	











	By his account, Santor wasn't concerned about his lack of experience in the film finance sector. “The old quote is that it's your attitude, not your aptitude, that determines your altitude,” he said in the 2023 interview. “So many people set their own limitations before anyone else sets anything for them.”


	PMI soon made a name for itself in Canada. For several years, it threw parties during the Toronto International Film Festival, where the likes of Barenaked Ladies and DJ Jazzy Jeff performed. Among its financed productions were Aubrey Plaza‘s buzzy indies The Little Hours in 2017 and Black Bear in 2020.


	***


	Then came the pandemic. At its onset, Santor and his family were vacationing in the Cayman Islands. The tropical archipelago was sealed off before any COVID cases materialized. Soon, as the costs associated with pandemic health safety protocols for film shoots had begun adding at least 20 percent to revised budgets, Santor sensed an opportunity in turning the coronavirus-bubbled Caymans, whose economy was hitherto known for offshore banking and cruise ship tourism, into a production hub.


	Despite virtually nonexistent production infrastructure, PMI over the next two years backed half a dozen Cayman-shot movies, typically budgeted between $5 million and $10 million and starring the likes of Harvey Keitel, Iggy Pop and Don Johnson. More than 100 crewmembers were employed, the majority of whom were Canadians flown in on a private jet rented from the Toronto Maple Leafs.

	











	Cayman government officials were happy to help. “We'd pick up the phone, and they'd move mountains to make things happen,” Santor recalled on the 2023 podcast. “As you can imagine, for them, the thing that the Caymans was most known for, from a film and television perspective, is The Firm” — Tom Cruise‘s 1993 legal thriller about shadowy financial dealings in the Caymans — “which didn't paint the island in a great light. So, they're like, ‘This will help change the narrative of what the island is about.' “


	The Caymans has spent the decades since The Firm‘s release seeking to shed its lawless reputation as a haven for tax evaders, money launderers and organized crime figures to bank via shell companies and anonymous accounts.


	Santor's 2020 production pivot proved fateful for the islands, whose national airline has since inaugurated a nonstop route from LAX. The country of nearly 90,000 people has also recently launched its own film incentives program, offering up to a 35 percent rebate, and since PMI began backing features, the Caymans has hosted unscripted productions like HBO Max's dating show FBoy Island and Freeform's reality series Grand Cayman: Secrets in Paradise, whose cast includes Hammer's ex-wife, Elizabeth Chambers.


	“Hindsight is always 20/20,” says a source involved in PMI's Caymans productions. “But we never saw anything shady [about Santor] on the ground. Which is why we're so taken aback by what's come out. I mean, clearly he had more on his mind than ripping people off, or he wouldn't have spent all this time on the island creating this very real thing.”

	











	Santor was granularly involved in the Caymans production scene he'd ignited. Perlman, who starred in PMI's 2023 action thriller The Baker, recalls that Santor was “a great collaborator: there every day, generous, life-affirming. You don't see a lot of that in the business.”


	As his profile began to grow on Grand Cayman, Santor became known for securing the best tables at restaurants and riding a scooter through island traffic, blithely ignoring suggestions to put on a helmet. “In L.A., he'd be just another AFM character, making these lower-budgeted movies with bigger names,” explains one Caymans associate, referring to the American Film Market. “But here he was a big fish.”


	***


	In December 2023, Colleen Camp, producer of four PMI films, began to raise an early alarm with her business partners over what appeared to be financial irregularities across projects. In retrospect, she says, the promise of Santor was probably too good to be true, citing his bankrolling of her critically acclaimed boxing drama Day of the Fight: “Who else would give Jack Huston $10 million to direct a black-and-white movie made with Michael Pitt?” Camp adds, mordantly, that she had a bad premonition when she first learned of the prospect of shooting films in the Caymans. “I'm thinking about The Firm, of course,” she says, “and that I'm going to be on a boat that explodes.”

	











	PMI began an initial probe of Santor in April 2024 after learning from the leader of one of its international sales partners that he'd asked the executive to sign an audit confirmation letter for loans that didn't exist. A whistleblower email to PMI four months later alleged a range of misconduct: that its portfolio included more than $70 million in fraudulent films; that its legitimate library was significantly overvalued; and that Santor had diverted funds from some productions by instructing distributors to send money to an account he personally controlled.


	The Ontario bankruptcy filings detail a Ponzi-like scheme in which “imposter corporations” were created to divert invested funds for personal gain. False email addresses and websites associated with partnered sales agents and distribution companies were created to carry out the plot.


	Then, to avoid detection, partial repayments were made with money obtained from other fraudulent loans. The elaborate deception also was concealed by blaming the chaos of the pandemic as well as the Hollywood labor strikes, which roiled real production cycles during this period.


	In hindsight, there were warning signs. The firm had gap-financed 2018's Stockholm, starring Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace. Its distributor, Dark Star, found it notable that its checks weren't being cashed. “I knew something was strange when Will went to the Caymans,” emphasizes Dark Star president Mike Repsch. “That was always a little suspect to me.” A producer on a PMI project that later shot there, and who elected at its outset not to be party to the film's LLC out of concern about its legitimacy, notes that the “Cayman Islands is always a red flag. My spidey sense went right off.”

	











	***


	A Canadian financial risk analyst tells THR that Santor's premeditated misconduct is rare: “In this case, it seems like it was malicious from the beginning, whereas most fraudsters don't intend to defraud. Somehow their business plan goes wrong, and one lie leads to another lie. They make a bad investment and try to recoup the loss by making another bad decision.” This person believes that Santor was either actively or passively aided, explaining, “It's hard to believe that his business partners didn't know what was going on, that they were so dumb to not see anything happening.”


	The bankruptcy filings allege that PMI's CFO Andrew Chang-Sang, a certified public accountant who held 25 percent of the company's voting shares, was aware of Santor's scheme and financially benefited from it, including through “misappropriated” funds that resulted in the purchase of a villa in the affluent Spanish coastal town of Málaga. The August 2024 whistleblower claimed he also used impersonating email addresses and forged signatures on audit confirmations.


	For his part, Chang-Sang tells THR in a statement that he was “shocked” when he learned of Santor's fraud, as “there had been no indication of any concerns from PMI's professional advisers, including its auditor.” He observes that he and other PMI senior executives authorized an independent forensic review and provided the evidence necessary to obtain the receivership order. “I have acted responsibly, diligently and in good faith at all times and have sought to comply with my legal obligations,” he explains.

	











	Dark Star's Repsch only learned that Santor had impersonated him and his company when THR contacted him. “This is confusing, as you can imagine,” he says. “Will had this big personality, a bravado, that filled the room.” He pauses, then adds: “I don't know. I think of his kids.”


	A well-regarded independent film producer marvels at what's happened with PMI — but isn't surprised, given the baseline of the sector. “In this part of the business,” the seasoned dealmaker explains, “if the money's green, nobody's asking questions.”


	***


	To work in the Wild West of independent film is to live with a tolerance for risk unknown and uncountenanced in the major studio business. It's both badge of honor and monkey on the back. Santor knew this. “I've been teetering between ‘What a prick!' and ‘What a nice guy!' ” says a colleague who collaborated closely with him in the Caymans.


	If William Santor was, as it appears, a con artist, he achieved his aims like all such swindlers: by exploiting not just his marks' trust but the unique vulnerabilities inherent in their dreams. Which is to say, he understood that modern Hollywood's green light, which year by year recedes from filmmakers with their arms outstretched, was the ideal bait for his larger scheme.

The Warrens wrap up their role in 'The Conjuring' universe with this latest entry in the hit horror franchise. 


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	It's not just the floorboards that are creaky in the ninth entry in the venerable Conjuring horror franchise. It all began with the 2013 original, depicting the exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. That indomitable duo is back for one last go-around in The Conjuring: Last Rites, and it must be said that they look tired.


	And why wouldn't they be, considering the travails they've been through in their previous films? Not to mention that Ed suffered a heart attack in the last one, from which he is still recovering. As this installment set in 1986 begins, the couple are semi-retired, reduced to giving talks in virtually empty lecture halls to young people who are much more excited about Ghostbusters.

The Bottom Line

	
	A franchise suffering from fatigue.
	



Release date: Friday, September 5Cast: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Mia Tomlinson, Ben Hardy, Steve Coulter, Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Beau Gadson, Kila Lord Cassidy, John Brotherton, Shannon KookDirector: Michael ChavesScreenwriters: Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick

								2 hours 15 minutes			






	Of course, just when the Warrens thought they were out, they're pulled back in for one last case. Specifically, the real-life case of the Smurls, an extended family living in a Pennsylvania coal town who experience things going bump in the night after they make the mistake of purchasing a hideous, hand-carved wooden mirror featuring cherubs at its top.

	Unfortunately for them as well as the film's viewers, it takes a long time for the Warrens to arrive. As a matter of fact, everything takes a long time in this attenuated entry clocking in at a bloated 135 minutes. It begins with an unnecessary prologue set in 1964 depicting the birth of the couple's daughter Judy, who nearly doesn't survive.

	











	When the action shifts forward 22 years, it resembles an old-fashioned television show, with the now-grown Judy (Mia Tomlinson) and her boyfriend Tony (Ben Hardy) arriving for a family get-together that includes much comic banter, a lively game of ping-pong, and Tony nervously asking Ed and Lorraine for their blessing before he proposes to their daughter. Lorraine beams with pleasure, while Ed registers grumpy disapproval like every dad in every family sitcom ever.


	It soon becomes clear that Judy has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, leading her to become aware of the Smurl family's plight. Also aware is her parent's old friend Father Gordon (franchise veteran Steve Coulter), who goes to see a bishop to request help for the beleaguered family. Not surprisingly, the visit doesn't go well.


	So it's left to the Warrens, with Judy and Tony in tow, to head to Pennsylvania where the Smurls have become a media sensation. Cue the predictable spooky mayhem as everyone battles a series of evil manifestations, including dolls, that by now feel all too familiar in their jump scares. This is the kind of haunted house movie in which everything seems to happen in dark rooms, the characters armed only with flashlights, as horrific storms rage outside. It's the kind of movie in which a character enters a dark attic alone, because she's apparently never seen a scary movie before.


The Conjuring: Last Rites trades heavily in nostalgia, with numerous callbacks to past adventures and frequent visitations to the Warren's “Artifact Room,” where Annabelle still resides in her locked cabinet. And since we've been watching the Warrens battle demonic entities for 12 years, they now feel like old friends. Farmiga and Wilson haven't lost their appeal, and with their relaxed chemistry they make for engaging company.

	











	But it all feels old hat by now, with returning director Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun II) failing to bring much freshness or vitality to the proceedings. The stateliness of it all feels even more old-fashioned in light of such recent audacious and original horror films as Sinners, Weapons, and everything directed by Jordan Peele.


	Despite its title and final moments informing us of what happened to the real-life Warrens in their last years (complete with archival clips and photographs), the family tradition may live on, cinematically at least. Tomlinson delivers a terrifically intense performance as the psychically gifted Judy, leading one to think she could easily headline yet another Conjuring offshoot.

Director Romain Garvas talks about his latest movie that also stars Anya Taylor-Joy: “I'm surrounded in a world that I don't really get. To make a film is the attempt to not give answers, but at least to question it.”


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	“Just to be clear,” says director Romain Gavras when discussing his new movie Sacrifice.  “We didn't actually throw anyone in a volcano.”


	A disclosure like this may seem unnecessary, but for a film that was partially shot on location on the rim of a semi-active volcano, it is not entirely needless.




	For Sacrifice, which is set to debut at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 6, Gavras and producers traversed treacherous terrain —  from mines in Northern Greece to the Cannes film market — to make an independent feature that really doesn't look like one.

	In Sacrifice, Gavras dissects myth-making in its many forms. The movie follows actor Mike Tyler (Chris Evans), who is attempting a comeback after a personal crisis and subsequent soul-searching. For his first public appearance, he attends a black-tie environmental charity gala thrown by a billionaire entrepreneur (Vincent Cassel) and his wife (Salma Hayek-Pinault). But it gets interrupted by a violent radical group led by Joan (Anya Taylor-Joy) that is searching for individuals to fulfill a volcano-inclusive prophecy.




			Related Video		







	Gavras made the jump to feature filmmaking after a successful career directing music videos for the likes of M.I.A. and Jay-Z.  In 2022, he released the French-language action-drama Athena with Netflix, after which he wanted to tackle his English-language debut. For this, he enlisted Will Arbery, a writer from one percent-skewering HBO sensation Succession.

	











Sacrifice captures the tenor of these high-end charity events that are attended by the famous and ultra-wealthy, and have a tendency to land somewhere between tone-deaf to hopelessly self-congratulatory.


	“Having been in those kinds of ceremonies, the cheeky side of my brain wonders what would happen if people arrived with guns and started to create mayhem,” says Gavras, who says he normally avoids these kinds of social commitments. “I try not to go because they make you feel uncomfortable. Because we were researching the film, I went to some, and there is stuff you can't even put in the movie because it was too much.” 


	What does end up in the film is a popstar (played by Charli xcx) calling herself “mother nature” singing about the ills of the planet, as strobe lights flash, electro-pop plays and back-up dancers twerk onstage.


	Gavras and Arbery delivered the script at the top of 2024 to producers Robert Walak and Jacob Perlin of Iconoclast. The director flew out to Los Angeles in April to meet with potential cast, landing his stars Evans and Taylor-Joy in less than a week.


	“What I love about him is that he's the perfect American movie star,” says the director of his leading man. With Mike Tyler, Evans gets to play a bizarro-world version of himself. In real life, Evans has successfully landed the dismount after years playing Marvel's Captain America, not getting swallowed up by his own celebrity or the role that made him famous, instead now opting for projects with filmmakers like Celine Song (The Materialists). (Though he occasionally returns to Marvel, as well.)

	











	Onscreen, Evans's Mike Tyler instead takes a more self-destructive route — at times, equal parts hilarious and harrowing — preoccupied by his public image and being perceived as a righteous do-gooder.


	Says Gavras of Evans taking on the role, “This is very, very risky, and that's the beauty of it.”


	For her part, after meeting with Gavras, Taylor-Joy “the next day, texted him a picture of an emoji of a volcano and someone falling into it,” remembers Walak. “We thought, ‘I think that means that she's in.'”


	Weeks after the cast locked, the movie, which was boarded by Mid March Media and Film4, was presented to buyers at the 2024 Cannes film market. While on the Croisette, the producers got an alert about volcanoes erupting in Iceland. In between meetings with potential partners, the team sent a drone to capture the activity for what would become nature-documentary worthy insert shots used in the movie.


	But Iceland, which is known for its high volcanic activity and has hosted productions like Ridley Scott's Prometheus, would not work for their shoot. Gavras wanted to film in order, which meant that by the time the 50-day production wound its way to the volcano sequences, it would be wintertime in the country. Instead, filmmakers found their volcano near Santorini. For the filmmaker, who is half Greek, Greece felt like the right place for his mythology-centric story.


	Even outside of the volcano, from a massive mine and caves to military helicopters, Sacrifice is filled with the kind of set pieces and locations you wouldn't expect in an independently financed feature. Says Gavras, “I'm terrible with VFX and stuff like that, so I always shoot practically.”

	











	Says Perlin, “Anyone else would be, ‘Can we do this? Can you execute it?' And I think that's where Romain shines.” Walak notes that should they have taken the studio route with the film, but that would have changed the outcomes, saying, “We always felt that this would most likely be an indie feature to give Romain that freedom.”


	For his part, Gavras adds, “I have a lot more gray hair now.”


	To build the film's charity event, the team shot in a marble quarry in the city of Volakas in Northern Greece. 400 extras were brought in to fill out the space, with Charli xcx, in the middle of prep for a globe-spanning Brat arena tour, flying in for two days for her pitch-perfect scene.


	When it did finally come time to film on the rim of the volcano, a question emerged about how to physically get there. The answer: donkeys.


	“Robert and I would look through the budget and be like, ‘That's a lot for donkeys!'” says Perlin. Walak adds, “There were some definitely irate emails about donkeys.”


	No vehicles are allowed on the volcanic island, which meant Evans, Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast and crew had an hour-plus hike up the shooting location, while donkeys carried equipment uphill. The group would arrive already tired, with smoke and wind whipping through the setup. But Gavras notes that the film's performances would not be the same if they were captured in the comfort of a soundstage. He says, “It puts the whole team and the whole cast in an energy where we know that we are making a film that is going to be difficult but will be super satisfying.”

	











Sacrifice is looking for distribution at TIFF, with CAA Media Finance and Rocket Science handling sales. Outside of the satire, high concept, and higher production value, the director notes that the film, at its core, is about people who are trying to figure out their place in the world and, just maybe, along the way, make it a better one.


	“We live in a world that's fucking crazy. You turn on the news, you turn on the internet, and everything is mad,” says Gavras. “I'm surrounded in a world that I don't really get, I don't completely understand. To make a film is the attempt to not give answers, but at least to question it.”


	As for what's next, after his experience on Sacrifice, the director says, “I'm thinking of maybe making a nice story in a small apartment.”

Noah Hawley talks episode five, ""In Space, No One..."", which stages an 'Alien' mini-movie and explains that (perhaps controversial?) twist: ""It escalates in a way that ends up feeling a little crazy."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


[This story contains spoilers from Alien: Earth‘s fifth episode, “In Space, No One…”]


Alien: Earth gave franchise fans an unexpected treat with its fifth episode: A mini-Alien movie that feels like the FX drama took Ridley Scott‘s 1979 original film and re-imagined its core elements as a unique one-hour story. 




	Aptly titled “In Space, No One…” (playing off the original film's famous marketing tagline, “In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream”), the flashback episode showed what happened aboard the ill-fated USCSS Maginot that caused its dangerous creatures to escape and the ship to crash into Earth.

	With the ship's interior sets as a near replica of those from the first film's ship, Nostromo, the action played like an alternate universe version of the decades-old film that we'd never seen before. The sequence also contained a twist that upended many of the audience's assumptions about the previous episodes and was inspired by the antics of a certain tech billionaire.


	“This allowed me — in the middle of trying to innovate what [the Alien franchise could be as a series] — to also pick up the gauntlet for classic Alien to say, ‘We could do classic Alien and do it as well as anyone,'” Hawley said. “But what's interesting to me at the same time is adding all these new elements, and putting the creatures in this thematic context. It's the number of elements at play that make it fun to me. It's like by the time the xenomorph enters the story, you're six tragedies deep with these other creatures. Then the xenomorph arrives and it just escalates.”

	











	Hawley continued, “When you think about the last 10 minutes of James Cameron‘s movie [Aliens], there's no other word for it than ‘thrilling.' And my hope was that by putting these elements together and with all these creatures — the sabotage and getting to the bridge and then the chief engineer with The Eye — and now the xenomorph is there, that it just escalates in a way that I think ends up feeling a little crazy. You leave the predictable Alien world and are like, ‘I do not know what is going to happen next.'”


	One key moment is the revelation that Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) was behind the sabotage of the Maginot in an effort to get the ship to crash into his territory so he could steal the creatures. It's a perhaps controversial twist and I suggest to Hawley that — for a famed smartest-geek-alive genius — this seems like a really dumb plan that should never have worked. But it turns out that the plan's reckless idiocy was kind of the point.


	“I don't look at our tech billionaires and think these guys are orchestrating some master plan,” Hawley replies. “I think you have a lot of ADHD billionaires with impulse control issues. And we always look to impose a certain logic on our fiction that doesn't apply to real life. For me, it's a way to tie everything together and as the show plays out in the rest of the season, we find that the boy genius is not a terribly thoughtful and calculating guy. He has all these ideas. He chases all of them at the same time. And he has never failed. So he thinks failure is impossible. He's trying to launch this immortality product, so why would he do this other stuff? He thinks, ‘Oh, I could do everything.'”

	











	Hawley then suggested the characterization is a comment on Elon Musk (he doesn't say the billionaire's name, but his description seems to clearly point to the Tesla/SpaceX/The Boring Company/X mogul as an inspiration. “It's a statement, on some level, about the hubris we're seeing around us by people who think they can go to space, re-invent travel, drill in the earth and enter politics,” he said. “They're doing all of these at the same time when none of them are necessarily being done well. They're just all being done a lot.”


	Throughout the episode, the viewer is also wondering the deal with one character in particular: Andy Yu's crew member Teng, who spied on a fellow crew member in her sleep and seemed rather unpleasant, and then was taken out by the xenomorph. So was he just a creepy human then?


	“It's always open to interpretation, and that's the fun of that franchise — who is an android and who isn't?” Hawley said. “At a certain point, you start to question everybody. But yeah, for me, he's a creepy dude.”


	Hawley added that the show's casting drew from his showrunning experiences on Fargo.   


	“When I realized that I wanted to do that flashback episode, selfishly I was like, ‘Well, I have to [direct] that one; I don't want to hand that one off,'” Hawley said. “Part of that was the casting. [The security officer cyborg Morrow, played by Babou Ceesay] obviously carries the show, but you need that cast to be memorable instantly. A lot of it for me was being over in Thailand like, ‘Well, who can I call that will come?' So I called Richa Moorjani. I called Karen Aldridge from season four of Fargo. I called Andy Yu from season three of Fargo. And the great Michael Smiley and so many great UK actors. They all pop and resonate. So much of what I do in these big ensemble shows is constantly building new worlds and you can't really assign that to another director. The specificity of it, I felt like I needed to do.”

The feature with Lex Luthor and Superman will arrive in 2027.



		By Aaron Couch, Borys Kit 

	September 3, 2025 9:49am	




James Gunn has unveiled the next project in his Superman Saga. Man of Tomorrow will be in theaters July 9, 2027, the filmmaker revealed on Instagram Wednesday.


	The announcement was accompanied by a drawing by DC head Jim Lee featuring Lex Luthor in a green and purple mech suit, with Superman leaning against him, a slight smile on his face as he holds a screwdriver. Luthor's armored suit, designed to battle Superman, has been seen for decades in the comics and in animation, but never in live-action.




	Gunn has been teasing this new feature for weeks, saying that his next project won't be a direct sequel to Superman, but will feature characters audiences already know from his summer hit.

	“I've already finished the treatment for the next story in what I'll call the ‘Superman Saga,'” Gunn told The Hollywood Reporter last month at the premiere for his TV show Peacemaker. “I'm working on that and hopefully going into production on that not too far away from today.”


	It's unclear what the story will be, but there was a Superman: Man of Tomorrow animated movie in 2020 that also featured Lobo (Jason Momoa plays the anti-hero in next summer's Supergirl.) The animated movie was based on a 2003 mini-series titled Superman: Birthright that was a modernization of the Superman origin story.


	Coming up, DC Studios has filmmaker Craig Gillespie's Supergirl due out June 26, 2026, with James Watkins' horror title Clayface slated for Sept. 11, 2026.

	











	Gunn is coming off of Superman, which earned strong reviews and introduced a slew of new characters to populate the DC Universe, not just Superman (David Corenswet), Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) and Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) but heroes such as Guy Gardner (Nathon Fillion), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced).


	With $611.6 million globally, Superman stands as the top grossing comic book movie of the year, but the sum also reflects the more challenging theatrical landscape when it comes to superheroes, particularly internationally. (In 2013, Zack Snyder Superman feature Man of Steel topped $670 million globally.)


Superman ended with a crying Luthor being taken away into custody. Wednesday's post on Instagram seems to say he will return, more determined than ever … but with Superman's friendly stance, perhaps some sort of alliance could end up being forged. Let fandom speculate away.

Seven years after her explosive debut, the superstar is back with a new album and ready to prove she doesn't just talk a good game — she's still at its top.


													By
												

	Carl Lamarre



	It's well past midnight at New York's Daylight Studio, and Cardi B is fighting to stay awake. Five hours into her Billboard photo shoot, a slight wardrobe malfunction with her black dress is prompting a quick timeout. “S–t, I got a wedgie,” she groans, dropping into her seat with a smirk. But like a true New Yorker, she toughs it out — chewing ice and cracking jokes like she's headlining her own late-night set.

	











	Clutching a Chick-fil-A cup, she rattles off a story about the fast-food chain botching her order. Then she seamlessly swerves into her recent social media spat with WWE's Naomi. A couple of days earlier, Cardi had hosted SummerSlam at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium — and in the run-up to the event, she'd threatened on X to shave Naomi's head and use her hair as a wig. “I just be talking s–t because I know these b–ches can really fight,” she gags, eyes gleaming.


	Cardi's jokes and swagger never clock out. But behind the antics, she's focused — and eager to reassert her hip-hop dominance. Seven years after her Grammy Award-winning, multiplatinum-selling, culture-shifting debut, Invasion of Privacy, she's finally ready to launch her next act with her long-awaited second album, Am I the Drama?


	“I'm really one of those artists that people ask for their albums the most every year,” Cardi says matter-of-factly. “I wouldn't be confident if nobody asked me for my s–t. Imagine nobody asking for an album of yours? Imagine nobody asking for your music? That's why I'm so confident.”

	











	She has only released one album, but Cardi B already boasts a Hip-Hop Hall of Fame-caliber résumé. She became the first female rapper to win best rap album at the 2019 Grammys. She has five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s and 13 top 10 hits. She's also the first female artist to have every track on an album certified platinum or higher by the RIAA.


	Along the way, Cardi evolved into one of music's most sought-after collaborators, partnering with pop giants Bruno Mars and Maroon 5 for Hot 100 chart-toppers, as well as hip-hop upstarts such as Latto and GloRilla.


	“What's special about Cardi is that she knows her audience, her fan base and how to stay relevant,” says Shawn Holiday, her manager at Full Stop Management. “She hasn't put out an album in seven years, but she knows how to stay current because she knows how to do features that keep her in the marketplace.


	“GloRilla was a new artist at the time [they collaborated],” he continues. “Cardi didn't care. She was really trying to empower other females in hip-hop. It wasn't about the money for Cardi; she did it because she loved the song and knew she could add value to it.”


	While her music wins are undeniable, it's Cardi's triumphs outside of the studio that have solidified her legacy. Since releasing Invasion of Privacy, she has become a global brand force, securing partnerships with Fashion Nova, Reebok and Whipshots; her deal with NYX Professional Makeup culminated in a Super Bowl commercial in 2024.


	It's hard to believe, given all this enormous cultural influence, that she still has yet to embark on her own headlining tour. “A lot of people say I got comfortable because I make money, but the most money I make is when I go and do shows,” says Cardi, who tweeted in 2022 that she'd netted $1 million for a 35-minute show at a private event during Miami's Art Basel. “I could rush and put out music like it's nothing and then pick up millions of dollars per show, but it's not about that. I want the music to be great. I want it to be amazing.”

	













	With 23 tracks set to appear on Am I the Drama?, including two Hot 100 No. 1s — 2020's “WAP” and 2021's “Up” — Cardi's aiming to prove it was worth the wait. Slated for release on Sept. 19, Cardi's second act features a tougher storyline: Expectations are sky-high, her divorce from rapper Offset is pending, she's raising their three kids on her own and she's navigating the new Atlantic Music Group (AMG) regime under CEO Elliot Grainge.


	“Cardi B is synonymous with the excellence that has made Atlantic Records a historically significant record label,” Grainge tells Billboard. “She is a real vanguard and a groundbreaking career artist who continues to push hip-hop and popular music culture forward in surprising and inspiring ways. There is no one like her. We are fortunate to be in her orbit.”


	In June, Cardi released the album's first single, “Outside,” a trunk-rattling track where she defiantly shakes off the shackles of her marriage and steps into singlehood. The song debuted in the top 10 of the Hot 100, a reminder that even amid chaos, Cardi can still storm the charts.

	











	But if “Outside” was Cardi coming out swinging, it's the René & Angela-sampling “Imaginary Playerz,” released in mid-August, where her pen first draws blood. Jay-Z famously flipped the R&B duo's 1982 single “Imaginary Playmate” for his own “Imaginary Players” in 1997, and on her version, Cardi makes the beat her own as she fires shots with sniper-like precision. “My flop and your flop is not the same/If you did my numbers, y'all would pop champagne,” she snaps.


	“Cardi remains at the top of her game,” AMG COO Zach Friedman says. “She released a great record with ‘Outside,' marking another exciting milestone for her. The entire AMG family is here to support her vision for the new album. She continues to be one of one.”


	It's 2 a.m. when Cardi finally steps off-set, the 11-hour shoot behind her. She exhales, eager to trade couture for pajamas and finally fix that pesky wedgie. These marathon days, the kind that test your patience and prove your stamina, are the grind she has been craving — the same grind that helped her become an overnight icon. Now, seven years after Invasion of Privacy forever changed the rap game, Cardi is ready to be the headline, the plot twist and the finisher all over again. This time, she's walking straight into the drama, daring anyone to even match her smoke.


It has been seven years since Invasion of Privacy. How have you grown since then?


	Since then, I've experienced a lot. The good and bad of fame, the hate, jealousy, drama, balancing my career with my personal life and growing up and maturing. I've learned to control my emotions and understand how life works and how to play chess better.


With all you've accomplished, what still motivates you to chase greatness?


	I'm passionate about winning and everything that I do. If I'm learning something, I want to be the best I can be. I love the game, I love evolving. I don't love listening to my own music.


Really?












	No, it's not that I don't like it, but I've heard it a million times. Now I hear so many things and I'm like, “Ooh. Why do I sound like that?” So I like evolving, the way I pronounce things and the way I come up with things. I really love it.


Did you ever have a moment where you questioned whether this second album would actually come together?


	Never. I always knew that I was going to drop a second album, I just didn't have a project well put together.


	My fans be like, “Oh, you should have put a project together when ‘WAP' and ‘Up' was out,” but I only had four records that I liked. I didn't have an album done around that time. I'm not the kind of person that's going to lock in in two months and complete an album. I'm very picky with my music.


But in this era, you can drop one-off singles like you did with “WAP” and “Up” and be OK.


	Yeah, but I want to put out this whole project because I have a lot of songs. I recorded 60 songs. Every other day, I'm a different person, I change my mind [about everything]. My team is always like, “I hope you don't change your mind about your songs.” I'm like, “Nope. I'm settled.”


Since you broke out, the world of talented female rappers has become more competitive than ever. How do you stay confident and clear in your lane amid all that?


	So many girls come and go. They're great, but yet [the fans are] asking for my product. Every year there's a debate on social media about when is my album dropping. They're not saying that about other people, so y'all need to ask them. That's why I'm so confident.


Why do you think people are fascinated with women MCs feuding? Is there a world where everyone can coexist peacefully, or does the game thrive off competition?












	No lie, these b–ches be catty. You can't prevent a b–ch from being shady. Sometimes b–ches want to see what you're about. They want to test you and they want to test your gangsta. A lot of the b–ches will come in this game and feel like they can challenge you. Some b–ches like to die young. In this game, you need to really know who you're challenging.


People often refer to you, Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion as the “Big Three” women in rap. Even without an album in seven years, why do you still feel like you belong in that tier?


	Because I do my job well and I take my time with my music — clearly you can see that. But it's something you'd have to ask the fans. So many [rappers] come and go, and I'm still here. You can downplay my accent, but I put a lot of thought into my work. I don't half-ass anything I do.


What does success look like for Am I the Drama? A No. 1? A Grammy? Or is the win just in finally delivering it?


	Winning a Grammy, the most prestigious award, you can never take that from me. Everybody wants to downplay it, but everybody wants one. [But] times have changed. Success for me will be people saying, “She put out a great album.“ If [at] 3 a.m. people are talking about the album, that's going to be success for me because people can't wait to downplay it. I even want the people who don't like me to be like, “Yo. That s–t is fire.” Yeah, eat your f–king fruits, n—a.


SZA said she owed you a verse for the album. Did she ever send it in?


	She did not! I feel like she's been really tired because she's been on tour and then on top of that, I don't know. Maybe she did do the verse. I've been hearing other conversations. We'll see about that.


Can you share any features we can expect on Am I the Drama?


	Nah, I don't want to share it. (Laughs.) You just got to hear it.


What went into the decision to include “WAP” and “Up” — both several years old — on the album?












	Because my fans asked for it. My fans always be like, “B–ch, you better not [leave them off the album].” My fans do not stop reminding me of the fact that I didn't submit “WAP” for the Grammys. I'm not always going to submit [my music to the Grammys], but on top of that, people are crying about that like, “Oh, it's about numbers.” Those two records are not going to count for the first-week numbers, which everybody cares about. So what's the issue? [Editor's note: Any activity generated by “WAP” and “Up” before Sept. 19, when the album is to be released, will not count toward the album's weekly chart performance.] At the end of the day, so what, you're going to get 21 new songs. [“WAP” and “Up”] are going to be at the end. So what you're crying for? You really don't care.


	Other artists do the same thing. You only care because of me. If I'm really doing it for the numbers, I could put “Money” [released six months after Invasion of Privacy] because “Money” is [multiplatinum]. I could put “Press” [from 2019]. That's platinum. Hold on, I got a lot of successful f–king records. (Laughs.)


How would you compare your relationship with Atlantic now versus when you first started in your career?


	It's a little different because there's a lot of new people. I started off with different bosses and now I have new ones. S–t, I feel like I had a disagreement on a song with them because I didn't really want to put it out, but it still worked out in my favor. It's like, “Alright. Maybe I can trust y'all a little bit with that.” It's never like, “Oh, I hate my label. I'm [bumping heads] with my label,” and stuff like that. As long as y'all give me my budget, I'm happy. It is a little sad not being with the same people that you started off with, but the new bosses, they're cool. They're young. They get it. You just have to have conversations with people and go directly to them. Be direct, say what you want, be direct to me and that's just that. We're good.


Your connection to fans, especially through Spaces on X or Instagram Live, has always been strong. How much did those bonds keep your spirit up through the album process?












	We have a relationship where I love them. Just like how you love your family and friends, you are going to get into arguments with them. They could be a little bit annoying, like, “Aight. Now y'all doing too much,” but I really love them. They can be therapeutic. It's so weird because I have somebody new in my life and explaining that type of relationship to my fans [can be weird], but they know me. And I know them. I don't go by people's approvals, but I do take my fans' approval for certain things into consideration. It's kind of weird. If they don't like something or somebody, I want them to like them, but it's like, “Why do I care? Why do I want my fans' approval?” But that's because they care about me a lot.


You've built one of the strongest feature runs in rap. In your eyes, what makes a Cardi B verse so special?


	First, I got to really like the song. Second, even if I like the song and I don't hear myself on it, I'll literally tell an artist, “I don't want to ruin your song.” If I do it, it's because I feel very confident. I'm going to put my 100% on it. If you're putting me on your stuff, I'm going to show love to it. I'm not just going to be like, “Oh, here's the record,” promote it for one day and goodbye. I really put my all in it and if I can't do it, I'm going to tell you straight up, I can't.


You've never officially hit the road for a full tour. What would a Cardi B tour look and feel like?


	I know I'm a good performer. Well, am I? No, I'm great. I'm actually really great because I was a stripper. (Laughs.) But no, I think my personal tour is not going to be like any other performances that I've ever had. From the aesthetics to the look to even the way I perform, I'm going to be doing things that I don't normally do, like work out, because I want to be the best. I've been going to so many different tours. I went to the Madonna show and the Beyoncé show. I can't perform like Beyoncé, but you can't half-ass nothing.


You know Beyoncé doesn't drink water onstage, right? If she does, it's only a sip.












	Yeah, but I got asthma. My fans know I got asthma. They know I'm going to have to take a water break, but I'm going to give it my all. I always say this: I have two left feet, but I'm going to have to get a fake leg. A right one because I'm going to give it my all. This is going to be one of the greatest tours. I'm going to make it the best.


What about the Super Bowl? Is performing at halftime something you see in your future?


	Of course. I got asked to do the Super Bowl and I denied it. I feel like soon, if I get to do it, I'm going to have more hits. I'm going to be more experienced and I'm going to eat that up.


Since Invasion of Privacy, you've become a ­mother of three. How has motherhood shaped you?


	It turned me into a real woman. I was like, “What makes a woman? Her body? Her cooking?” It's her maturity and her thinking. If I didn't have kids, I wouldn't sacrifice so much. This summer, I haven't even put my feet in a pool. I do everything for my kids. I'm the only provider and you know what? Ain't no complaining about it. I love them so much and they ground me. Sometimes I be so exhausted and it's not even about work, it's just life. If you think when you get rich you're going to stop working, you're never going to stop working. My mom used to be a freakin' cashier and she used to work every single day. To this day, I still talk about how hard my mom worked. I had a very rough childhood, but my mom always made sure we ain't go to no shelter. I want my kids to be like, “My mom made sure I had everything that I wanted.”


Friendship has always been at the core of your relationship with Offset. Despite the ups and downs, do you envision a lasting friendship with him?


	I tried. Next question.


You're dating NFL star Stefon Diggs. Was it tough at first to not only date again, but go public, especially with someone who's also in the spotlight?












	It was very tough, but it is what it is. It's tough hiding. It's tough dating in your 30s, too, but I like him. I love him, today. (Laughs.) I was always scared of dating people [because] I've always been in a long relationship since I was like 21.


How has he inspired you to be a better version of yourself creatively or personally?


	Personally, I'll never complain about my job or about lack of sleep. I'm not superdisciplined. I don't really have a sleep schedule. I don't ever like to map out my day. I don't even like to schedule my month. It just overwhelms me. The one thing I've been learning is to be more organized and not complain.


	He has to do two different things: learn his playbook and get physical. He has to be in bed at a certain time and wake up at a certain time. I'm like, “Oh, my gosh. You're literally in the military. You really work hard.” I work hard, but I can take a little break. I can lay back and I don't have to be running, but it's very inspirational to see how hard somebody works. It's just like, “Wow. You should be proud of yourself.”


You've inspired a generation of new female rappers. Do you see yourself as a mentor now, and is that a role you embrace?












	Have your ever read [Sister Souljah's novel] The Coldest Winter Ever? (Laughs.) At the end of the book, the main character, Winter, was in jail. She cut a b–ch — or some s–t like that — then they let her out to go to her mom's funeral. She saw her sister going in her same footsteps and wanted to give her advice. Before she gave her advice she was like, “You know what? F–k it. Let her go through what I went through. Let her learn on her own.” Sometimes you got to let b–ches learn on their own. I have to because there were so many b–ches that I've sat down and given advice from the heart. Like, if I see people bullying you because of whatever the f–k, I'm going to go in your DMs and give you advice. But sometimes I got to really hold myself [back] and say, “No, b–ch. Don't do it,” because these b–ches turned their backs on me, f–ked my man, talked about me and somebody told me about it.


After your first album, you became a force in fashion, beauty and branding. How intentional was that?


	Fashion is something I really love. I love clothes. I love style. I like putting things together well. I have an amazing team and we always get a thrill about putting amazing outfits [together]. It's really a sport to us. Even when it gets intense, like this Fashion Week that just passed. We were always arguing. There were tears shed, but we loved those end results so much. This is why we do it all the time. The lack of sleep, the disagreements [happen], but at the end, I look like a doll and people say I look amazing.


	When it comes to branding, if you're going to put something out, it has to be the best. Imagine somebody f–king you on the first date. They f–ked you but it's not the best p—y they ever had? You want people to say that's the best p—y they ever had. You don't want to give people drunk p—y. Drunk p—y is good, but what happens when you're not drunk? It's not good. I want it to be good all the time.


You've always immersed yourself in politics. Is that something that you hope to pass down to your kids when they get older?












	Yes, please! I hope they take that trait from me. You always have to be aware of what's happening to the world and what's happened before, because things really do repeat themselves. Maybe not something drastic like a world war, slavery or the Holocaust, but there's always shady s–t going on. I just want them to always be aware of what's going on and what could happen. But there's something about politics that gets me in a rabbit hole. I remember wanting to say something so bad this week, but I was like, “I can't.”


You bit your tongue?


	I have to bite my tongue. I really, really had to bite my tongue, but you know the reason why I've been so silent about politics? It's because when I used to complain the past four years, I know for a fact that people watch my stuff. I know it. I know the White House watches my stuff. I have a big platform. I know they listen to what I say. I might not say it the prettiest way, but I know they listen to what I'm saying. There's a president that knows I've never supported him and it's like if I say something, he's not going to care. I tried to give people warnings and it is what it is. What I can do? What I can say?


	There was a time when I said I wasn't voting for nobody. Everybody's doing shady s–t. I was like, you know what? I had to pick the lesser evil. People thought it was funny. People made fun of my accent. People made fun of my speech [at a Kamala Harris rally days before the 2024 presidential election]. I was, “Aight. Y'all gonna see what's funny.” S–t ain't funny right now, isn't it? It's really tough out here. S–t is really rough out here for everybody. I tried to warn ya.

	











	All I'm going to say is America is in a very bad place. No matter who's in charge, it's going to stay like that because we're paying for bad karma. Why [are we] paying for bad karma? Because we have been involved in something morally illegal, morally that God hates, morally that is disgusting. I'm not going to speak about it. Y'all should know why. All I'm going to say is we're going to be paying for a very long time because there's no bigger leader than God. We've been doing immoral stuff. We've been supporting and endorsing immoral, evil things. Not one person is going to pay for it; the whole country is going to pay for it.


If you could pick one word to title this chapter in your life, what word would that be and why?


	At first, I was going to say “confusing.”


How so?


	It felt like a reset. Maybe that's the word. I'm resetting again in my career. I took a break and I'm about to go back again. I'm about to be heavy on tour and I haven't been heavy on the road in a long time. That's a reset there. Then, it's a reset on my personal life. The last time I was on the road, I had one kid. Now I have three kids. I was married, now I'm getting a divorce. I'm dating. It's a reset on everything. Sometimes I feel like I'm 20 again. I shouldn't feel like I'm 20. I should be feeling like I'm in my 30s and I'm settled, but I don't feel as settled. I feel like I'm redoing things and relearning again in every aspect of life. Career and personal. So I guess we should say a reset.

Before this year's MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday (Sept. 7), take a look back at the 41 videos that have secured the award show's top prize — and see which one we deem the all-time best.


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	MTV's biggest night — and now officially Music's Most Iconic Night — is just around the corner (Sept. 7), as the Video Music Awards come to CBS for the first time. Produced for the first time in a decade by longtime MTV exec Van Toffler, hosted by five-time Grammys steward LL Cool J, and featuring performances from a wide array of breakout stars and returning greats, the evening should be a memorable one — but for no one moreso than whichever artist gets to become the latest to take home the top prize for video of the year. 


	The video of the year category has a storied but imperfect track record of honoring the all-time greats of the format, acknowledging Madonna but not Michael Jackson, Pearl Jam but not Nirvana, Kendrick Lamar but not Drake. Despite the many celebrated artists and classic videos ultimately denied the distinction, the all-time winners list remains a formidable canon of prime MTV fixtures, YouTube sensations and now even theatrically premiered short films — a list of names that this year's nominees would all be more than happy to add theirs to. 


	Will that list come to include a repeat winner, like Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga or The Weeknd? Perhaps a long-overdue first-timer, like Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars or Billie Eilish? Maybe a newer crossover star like ROSÉ, Sabrina Carpenter or Playboi Carti? We'll see on Sunday, but before then, take a look back at Billboard‘s ranked list of the 41 videos that have already received MTV's greatest honor — there's not a total dud in the bunch, and at least a couple dozen that remain essential pieces of pop culture history years, if not decades later. 


	“Mirrors” made Justin Timberlake just the second artist to ever win both the video of the year and the Video Vanguard awards in the same night in 2013, an achievement likely more about his overall career momentum at the time than “Mirrors” being a particularly great video. Which isn't to say it's bad: Floria Sigismondi gives its split romantic narrative an elegance befitting the stately midtempo ballad, but the pacing of the video never feels right and its multiple timelines never totally cohere into something you want to follow for a full eight and a half minutes. 


	At the peak of Katy Perry's pop ostentatiousness, “Firework” could rank as only the second-most-memorable video from the Teenage Dream era with explosive material shooting out of her chest. It's a solid video with strong intent, but it lacks the gaudy panache that really made the visuals on this album cycle so iconic for Perry, and its straight-faced messaginess can get a little tiresome on repeat viewings.


	Green Day spends a lot of time walking that lonely road in “Boulevard of Broken Dreams”… and walking… and walking. Not a lot truly happens in “Boulevard,” as the band traverses desolate landscapes while director Samuel Bayer scratches up the film stock like his name was DJ Premier. It's effective enough as the hangover back half of a two-parter with the more rambunctious “Holiday” but a bit unremarkable on its own; maybe they should've been nominated in tandem.


	The arguable centerpiece of the entire 1989 era, “Bad Blood” captures a moment in Taylor Swift's megapop crossover where everything was about size. And so we not only get an entire fake Joseph Kahn-directed action flick, we get multiple Squads worth of cameos — everyone from Zendaya to Hayley Williams to Ellen Pompeo — as well as a drop-in from the hottest rapper of the time. The spectacle is dazzling, but the actual content is unwieldy; Swift's blockbuster fantasies were obviously much better served by her own Eras Tour a decade later.


	Can't fault “Lady Marmalade” for lacking star power; no other video of the year winner has even three lead artists to its credit, let alone four topline hitmakers (and a fifth cheering them on from the wings in co-producer Missy Elliott). There's not a ton to remember about the video beyond the five of them, though; otherwise it's basically just a more commercial for Moulin Rouge! than any trailer could ever hope to be.


	Undoubtedly effective as promo, as the images of Miley's close-up, tear-stained stare, her sledgehammer-licking and her nude riding of the titular item of destruction all became about as iconic as any pop visuals of the 2010s. Unfortunately, the first one doesn't really go with the last two, as the video's jarring vulnerability is undercut, not enhanced, by the provocations of its more salacious imagery — and the presence of the deeply problematic Terry Richardson behind the camera certainly helps little with that part of it.


	Swift's second video of the year winner is a mostly successful spin on the colorful camp aesthetic of Teenage Dream-era Katy Perry — down to Perry herself making a cameo, officially putting to bed any rumors of a lingering feud between the two 2010s superstars. But as “Bad Blood” previously demonstrated, Swift just isn't at her best going so big and broad; some of the attempts at comedy fall flat and the video's eye-popping color schemes feel a little visually exhausting by the end.


	The surprise top-prize recipient at the 2006 awards, Panic!'s big win for its breakout hit arguably marked the high point of mid-'00s emo's entire pop culture moment. It wasn't totally unworthy as a winner, but you really have to be invested in the broad-strokes theatricality of frontman Brendon Urie and his Tim Burton-goes-Moulin Rouge! aesthetic to get much out of it; he's a captivating carnival barker but there's not a ton of thrills offered elsewhere in the “Tragedies” circus. 


	One cannot often fault Abel Tesfaye for not going big enough, but you can't help but wonder what “Blinding Lights” might have looked like with a late-'90s video budget behind it. As is, The Weeknd is an undoubtedly commanding presence at the bloody-and-bruised center of the video — with a quickly iconic look that soon took him all the way to the Super Bowl — but without a co-star or any particularly memorable set pieces for him to play off of, the action of the song outpaces the action of the visual a little too easily.


	Madonna had already built a 15-year resumé as the arguable MTV GOAT by the time she finally won video of the year for “Ray of Light“ in 1998. Her win wasn't just a belated make-good — the song and the video were a real moment for Madge in their own right, proving she could still thrive at the dawn of the TRL era — but if you were to guess the lone win of her career in the category, “Light” probably wouldn't be one of your first five guesses. It's one of her few videos where she feels like she's playing a supporting role to the (admittedly captivating) photography effects and slice-of-life tableaus. 


	At the absolute post-grunge peak of '90s alt-rock, there was perhaps no bigger band on MTV than Aerosmith, whose trio of Alicia Silverstone-starring Get a Grip videos brought Steven Tyler and company to a new peak of popularity a full 20 years into their career. “Cryin'” perhaps holds up the best of the three, as its leading lady's performance — an intoxicating mix of lip-biting vulnerability and bungee-jumping badassery — gave notice that she was well on her way to becoming an era-defining superstar in her own right.


	The first black-and-white video to take home the VMAs' top prize since 2009 is a sci-fi fantasia with elements of Frankenstein and Poor Things and cameos from Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles. But the most memorable parts of “Fortnight” are the scenes with just Taylor Swift and Post Malone staring at one another, their chemistry easy and obvious, even in the eye of a tornado of unread letters.


	It might not be her best-remembered video, but coming at the height of the media scrutiny and often outright cruelty that plagued her life and career in the mid-'00s, the paparazzi-besieged “Piece of Me” played an important part in cementing Spears' pop star lore and setting her career up for its second decade. Whether the video's excessively '00s fashion, styling and tanning adds to or detracts from its iconicity is likely in the eye (or age) of the beholder. 


	Clearly the “This Note's for You” video was needed in 1989, when MTV's first decade culminated in an era of visual excess and explicit commercialization that classic rocker Neil Young was all too happy to take the piss out of. Doesn't make it OK for Young to have beat Michael Jackson and Madonna for the VMAs' top prize — a trophy it took the latter another decade to take home, and which the former somehow never won in his lifetime — but the clip remains a fun time capsule and a fascinating anomaly in the awards' history. 


	The telenovela-inspired clip for “Havana” took Camila Cabello's true breakout solo smash to the next level, giving it both greater gravity and more campy fun, while making her look like an unquestionable star. Historically, though, it's hurt somewhat by emerging from one of the great VMA classes in recent memory, which also included top-level clips from the Carters (Beyoncé and Jay-Z), Childish Gambino, Drake, Ariana Grande and Bruno Mars & Cardi B — all of which were at least as deserving of the big win, and a few arguably moreso. 


	The video that proved that Lil Nas X would have pop culture resonance well beyond his historic “Old Town Road” moment, “Montero” often teeters on the edge of garish in its bluntly rendered heaven-and-hell landscapes, but remains compelling enough to enrapture fans and enrage haters in equal measure —and ensure a tsunami of content surrounding the song, driving it to immediate-smash status. “Y'all are not gonna win bro,” he tweeted about the latter group when it first mounted the backlash to the song and its video; he may as well also have been talking about the other nominees for video of the year in 2021.


	“My Name Is” and its TRL-conquering video made Eminem a star in 1999, but the next year's”The Real Slim Shady” was the one that guaranteed he was already on his way to icon status. Not all parts of the video have aged brilliantly — good luck explaining to anyone under the age of 35 why a Tom Green mini-parody was really necessary at the time — but the unforgettable shots of Slim directing an army of nodding lookalikes still feel equally thrilling and terrifying a quarter-century later.


	One of Swift's most successful videos at capturing the tenor of the song it accompanies, “Anti–Hero” cleverly reflects the pop superstar's late-night mania by personifying the different voices in her head with their own Swiftian incarnations. The clip could certainly do without (or at least with a shorter version of) its post-bridge vignette imagining Swift's descendants fighting over her will, but the closing shot of the multiple Taylors enjoying a drink together on her rooftop is among the most satisfying in her videography. 


	Sneaking in to steal video of the year in 1999 from the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin and KoRn at the very height of the teen-pop, Latin-pop and nu-metal explosions was Ms. Lauryn Hill and her evocative splitscreen clip for Hot 100-topping solo breakout “Doo Wop (That Thing).” The video is less spectacular than those other TRL-era-defining clips, but arguably more effective, with the '60s and '90s versions of L Boogie's performance clip meshing seamlessly to reinforce the idea of “Doo Wop” (and its universally acclaimed parent album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill) as immediately timeless. 


	A gimmicky video that the band would end up immediately resenting — but what a gimmick. “Right Now” brought Van Halen into the '90s with the kind of socially conscious statement video that would loom large in the decade's culture, via “Right now…” text captions accompanying rapid-fire scenes portraying societal ills, scientific advancements and general facts of life. The Mark Fenske-directed clip mixes in just enough silly with the serious (“Right now, Mike is thinking about a SOLO project”) to not become overbearing, and… well, the '90s was kind of a serious time anyway.


	Eminem at his absolute pop peak, playing the superhero he'd essentially become to suburban America with the appropriate mix of irreverence, incredulousness and vendetta-settling irascibility. Decades later, the adventures of Em and Dre in “Without Me” were still fondly remembered enough to inspire a sequel in 2024's “Houdini”; the concept proved ageless enough that it helped the latter match the former's No. 2 peak on the Hot 100.


	Rihanna was already a confirmed hitmaker, but she wasn't a superstar until she laced up for the many unforgettable looks — the French maid's outfit, the top hat and one-piece, the silver body paint — of the “Umbrella” video. The clip came at just the right time not only for Rihanna, but for MTV and the VMAs, proving at the cultural low point of the music video format (and possibly for 21st century pop stardom in general) that the right visual could still become instantly iconic. 


	The final piece of OutKast's complete cultural takeover of late 2003, the joyous “Hey Ya!” video presented Andre 3000 as a one-man Fab Four, perfectly capable of creating globe-sweeping Andremania with one expertly deployed pop song. It all worked — perhaps a little too well for the artist's liking — and today stands as an essential Polaroid of OutKast's ultimately short-lived run at the apex of popular music.


	With clever sleight-of-hand, inspired camerawork and some stellar dance moves, Jonathan Glazer's clip for U.K. acid jazzers Jamiroquai's future-fearing Stevie Wonder pastiche “Virtual Insanity” briefly made frontman Jay Kay an MTV star. The video's unexpected win at the VMAs certainly shows an MTV in a sort of transition moment between superstar eras, but its simplicity and lack of special effects means it's aged much better than most big-budget affairs of the late '90s. 


	Before his current 2024-'25 run, it looked like “HUMBLE.” and its video would represent the pop star peak for Kendrick Lamar, standing out from the SoundCloud rap pack like he does in its video as the one visible face among hordes of the faceless nodding masses. It felt like the evolutionary “Real Slim Shady” — and if this year, “Not Like Us” makes Kendrick the first rapper since Eminem to win multiple video of the year trophies, it would be extremely well-deserved. 


	The VMAs legacy of The Cars' biggest MTV hit will forever be it winning video of the year over Michael Jackson's “Thriller.” Undoubtedly a miss, but not as big of one as it could've been, considering that “You Might Think” is a perfectly imperfect encapsulation of the freewheeling creativity and visual borderline-anarchy of the channel's earliest days, with its elastic reality turning frontman Ric Ocasek into a comic book superhero — or supervillain, it's sorta hard to tell behind those sunglasses.    


	Arguably the moment when Taylor Swift officially separated herself from the pack to become a one-of-one icon for the 2020s, “All Too Well” demonstrated that not only could Swift turn a 10-minute re-recording of a decade-old deep cut into a Hot 100-topping smash, but she could make an award-winning short film out of it too. With help from Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien, the wistfulness and emotional brutality of the clip matches the song stride for stride, with its mid-song kitchen argument in particular capturing the kind of fight whose actual meaning loses weight almost instantly, but whose impact stays with you decades later.


	Nothing says “1980s” quite like those blocky computer-generated everymen, or Straits frontman Mark Knopfler's neon headbands, for that matter. But it's the obvious datedness that has made “Money for Nothing” so enduring — down to the still-chuckle-worthy fake MTV video that plays on its in-store TVs — and it remains as essential a slice of mid-‘80s pop culture as you could hope to reheat in your installed microwave oven 30 years later.


	The first clip from a Black artist to take home video of the year, “Waterfalls” is perhaps even more heavy-handed with its ‘90s messaging than “Right Now” — and with far more dated special effects — but it's balanced by the timeless cool of T-Boz, Left Eye and Chili, three all-seeing deities casually shimmying on the water. And the more dramatic parts do still work: No matter how many times you see it, the ghost of the now-slain drug dealer of the first verse (played by ‘90s rapper Shyheim) trying and failing to hug his mother stays a gut-punch.


	The mix of live action and animation that defines the first part of “Need You Tonight”/”Mediate” looks a little clumsy today compared to some of its similarly VMA-conquering peers — but what hasn't aged at all is the all-consuming magnetism of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, looking well on his way to becoming the Mick Jagger of the MTV era. And the second half's recreation of Bob Dylan's “Subterranean Homesick Blues” lyric card-tossing bit is a smart and still-captivating throwback to what many consider to be the first classic music video.


	The first woman artist to win video of the year wasn't Madonna, Janet, Whitney or Mariah, but Sinéad O'Connor, framed in uncomfortable close-up as she sang (and viscerally felt) one of the most wrenching torch songs of the late 20th century. The famous tear scene — as indelible an image as MTV's second decade produced — wasn't inspired by the departed lover from the Prince-penned lyrics to “Nothing Compares 2 U,” but O'Connor's own recently deceased mother, a loss she made the whole world feel during her all-too-brief period of pop stardom.


	“The impossible is possible tonight,” frontman Billy Corgan promised on Smashing Pumpkins' symphonic rock smash, and the Jonathan Dayton- and Valerie Faris-directed music video certainly made you believe it. A spellbinding redo of the classic silent short A Trip to the Moon, “Tonight, Tonight” showcased a scope, an ambition and a sense of romance that most of the Alternative Nation was supposed to be far too cool for, helping to launch the era's preeminent group of overachievers far past the rest of their '96 peers. 


	As confrontational as Beyoncé has gotten as a pop star, with a video that took on Katrina and police shootings and got her Super Bowl performance — which included the song, just a day after the video's surprise release — boycotted by some unions. The video's purposefulness was powerful, and so were the shots of a glammed-out Bey ghost-riding the whip, or her commanding a phalanx of male backing dancers in a dark church hat and darker lipstick. She never looked bigger or badder.


	For the many cultural failings of the ‘00s as a decade, it did make Missy Elliott MTV's biggest star for at least one night, as the reality-warping rap icon's took home video of the year for her greatest pop moment. “Work It” might not have one image as iconic as the garbage bag outfit from “The Rain,” but it wins in sheer volume: Missy the DJ swarmed by bees, Missy the B-girl dancing with the next generation, Missy the icon cool enough to even ignore Prince's advances.


	Just before grunge was about to explode worldwide at the end of 1991, R.E.M. took their bow as American alt-rock's most-celebrated elder statesmen with the breathtaking and VMAs-dominating “Losing My Religion.” The video turned the band's most exquisite composition into living, breathing art, and made its once-camera-shy frontman Michael Stipe an absolute MTV superstar, helping set the band that defined underground ethics and aesthetics for the '80s on the path to signing what was at that point the highest-paying label deal in industry history in the '90s.


	Don Henley's timeless anthem of lost innocence somehow got a video even more evocative than its lyrics, thanks to fashion photographer-turned-video director Jean-Baptiste Mondino. A barrage of unforgettable black-and-white images from its opening observed-from-afar lovers on the beach to its haunting closing shot of Henley driving down the empty street, “The Boys of Summer” plays like a nostalgic itch you can't scratch, deep and indelible and forever just out of reach.


	“Bad Romance” was the kind of video it should take an artist 5-10 years to build up to; Lady Gaga got there in about 18 months. With its combination of sci-fi imagery, innovative art direction and choreography and sheer superstar presence, “Romance” not only cemented Gaga as a superstar but raised the bar for her entire generation, and reconfirmed that great music videos were still an essential item in the pop star job description. 


	Nirvana were the leading lights of the '90s grunge explosion, but Pearl Jam were actually its biggest stars — thanks in no small part to the ineffable power of the “Jeremy” video, a devastating look at the teenage suburban alienation that would quickly become a decade-defining concern. It's essential three decades later for what it started, but also for what it ended: Pearl Jam didn't appear in another music video that decade, and “Jeremy” title performer Trevor Wilson quit acting shortly after, before tragically dying in 2017.


	Even before Lady Gaga announced that music videos were officially back at the turn of the 2010s, Beyoncé confirmed that they could still be as vital as anything in pop culture. The black-and-white dance clip for “Single Ladies” was a classic video the way they used to make 'em — low-budget and high-energy, with a simple concept executed to perfection and a star performer you couldn't turn away from if you tried — and proved that going viral in the early days of YouTube could be just as impactful as entering heavy rotation at the dawn of MTV. 


	In its own way, as much of a standard-setter for ambition and ingenuity in '80s music video as “Thriller” was — and with a performer who wasn't even quite a superstar yet to help sell it. “Sledgehammer” certainly got Peter Gabriel the rest of the way there, as Stephen R. Johnson's clip lent him an otherworldliness by treating his body like silly putty in its array of mind-stretching animations — matching Gabriel's most limber vocal and (appropriately) hardest-hitting song yet with a video that refused to accept any perceived limitations within its artform.


	The dizzying height of both Rihanna's superstardom and of the EDM era, and still the greatest music video of the entire 21st century a quarter of the way through. Melina Matsoukas' clip for “We Found Love” doesn't just match the obvious euphoria of RiRi's floor-filling Hot 100-topper, it finds a Pantone swatch book's worth of shades within it — romantic, exhilarating, life-affirming, death-defying, perception-altering, terrifying, paralyzing and cathartic as love comes from a hopeless place and ultimately goes right back, forever changing all involved, including us.

	Cardi B sits down with Billboard's Carl Lamarre in anticipation of her second album ‘AM I THE DRAMA.' The star gets candid on everything from why the album took years to release, ‘WAP' and ‘UP' being a part of the track list, female rap beefs and her relationship with Stefon Diggs.


Carl Lamarre:


What's going on, y'all? I am senior director of R&B/Hip-Hop, Mr. Carl Lamarre, and we are here with one of music's most transcendent superstars. She is a Grammy Award winner, five chart-toppers on the Hot 100, Miss Cardi B.

	Hi. How are you? 


I'm good. How are you? 


	It's been a long day shooting, but we here.


You've been trooping like a real soldier. We're here because of album number two. 


	Yes.


It's finally here. You know, it's been seven years since ‘Invasion of Privacy.' How would you say you have grown since then?


	Well, since the seven years, I have experienced a lot. I have experienced fame, the good and the bad of fame, the hate, the jealousy, the drama, the personal life, the balancing my career with my personal life and just growing up and maturing and like opening my eyes more, learning how to like, control my emotions more, or like, understand my emotions, or like, understand just the way life works and like, it's just how to play chess better.


Right. 


	Yeah. 


I mean, listen, I think you've been playing the chess pretty d*mn well. 


	Well you know… 


At any moment in the past seven years, did you question or have any doubts, like, “Sh–, I don't know if this second album is going to drop.”


	No, never. I always knew that I was going to drop a second album. It's not even about dropping a second album.

ROAM represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent booking agency worldwide.

	Dave Brooks



Two of independent music's most respected booking agencies, North America-based Arrival Artists and U.K.-based ATC Live, have merged to form ROAM, a new global booking agency with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris and Glasgow, Scotland. The combined agency represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent and fifth-largest music booking agency worldwide (behind WME, CAA, Wasserman Music and UTA). 


	According to ATC Live co-founder Alex Bruford, ROAM will “provide a genuine alternative in the global booking agency landscape.” 


	Bruford founded ATC Live 15 years ago with a small roster of six artists and grew it to more than 400 artists and 40 staff. When Arrival Artists first launched during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the company already had a relationship with ATC Live and saw the potential for a “strategic partnership” with a “similar mindset,” explains Arrival co-founder Ethan Berlin. “This initial collaboration was rooted in a commitment to developing artists, and the shared vision for growth solidified during the pandemic,” he adds.

	Arrival co-founder Ali Hedrick adds that early on, the two companies had twice-weekly talks and realized they had a “shared identity, a shared culture.”


	The business structure of ROAM is a 50/50 ownership between the two former agencies. Hedrick says this was a deliberate choice: “Neither one of us wanted to own each other. We wanted to be a true partnership.” This structure allows the agency to remain partner-owned, which Berlin says offers “a sense of pride in being able to run our own company that bleeds into the work that we do every day.”


	The name ROAM was chosen to reflect the agency's mission, explains Bruford, noting that it “gravitated towards the meaning of traveling with curiosity and purpose,” while foreshadowing “how we wanted to work with our artists and build road maps with them exploring opportunities and making journeys together.”


	ROAM's strategy is to offer a high-touch, artist-centric approach to global representation, where agents maintain their primary territories and “collaborate on the rest of the world” to find the best opportunities for their clients. Bruford adds that the goal is to offer “global representation to the artists who want it” with “agents on the ground representing artists in a global manner.” 


	“We have a proven track record of developing artists from small venues to major stages,” says Bruford, who pointed to ATC Live's taking Fontaines D.C. from the 150-capacity shows in 2018 to a 45,000-capacity sellout concert in London's Finsbury Park earlier this summer. ATC Live also booked The Lumineers in 2012 to play a small venue in the U.K.; this year, the band booked the O2 Arena for the third time. 


	Bruford also notes the work ATC Live has done with established artists like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, who joined ATC Live in 2018 as an arena headliner and saw a “50% increase in ticket sales” on the band's most recent tour. He emphasizes that “growing artists from day one is such an important part of our business, but also adding value to established artists is key as well.” 


Sarah Joy, who started as a coordinator at ATC Live and worked her way up to partner, says the company is “keen to champion homegrown agent talent” and is putting “a lot of energy into nurturing diversity across the workforce”. She proudly notes that ROAM has a gender split of “59% female and 41% male across its workforce,” bucking the male-dominated agency business.


	Beyond concert and appearance booking, ROAM provides a range of services including digital marketing, brand partnerships and philanthropic activations. Both companies also jointly invested in a third-party company called Company X to serve as a branding and sponsorship division. Hedrick described having more branding opportunities at Arrival than at any other agency she's worked for, citing a two-and-a-half-year sponsorship deal between Mt. Joy and Coors that was involved in the band's sold-out Madison Square Garden show.


	“Their approach is incredibly artist-focused and tailored to each artist,” says Joy.


	The goal of combining resources into a unified company means “creating an agency where artists can grow careers without compromise, uniting scale with agility and execution with creativity,” Bruford tells Billboard.   “Any artist that's looking for some strong global representation but with that high-touch artist-centric approach should come and talk to us,” he adds.

UPDATED, with Fox News statement: Newsmax filed an antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, claiming that the news outlet has maintained its dominance among right-leaning cable, satellite and streaming networks via an “exclusionary scheme” to suppress competition.


	The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Florida on Wednesday, also names Fox Corporation as a defendant.


	Newsmax claimed that Fox “employs at least three anticompetitive means to exclude competing providers of right-leaning video content from the market.” They include “explicit or tacit” “no carry” provisions on distributors that condition access on concessions not to carry other right-leaning news channels like Newsmax.

	The lawsuit also claimed that Fox imposes penalties on distributors if they carry other right-leaning news channels on their basic tiers, by requiring them to carry and pay high fees for lesser watched channels like Fox Business and Fox Sports 2.

	Newsmax also claimed that Fox “inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing,” characterizing Fox as having an “unlawful monopolization” of the right-leaning pay-TV news market. 


	The lawsuit claimed that Fox's “anticompetitive behavior” has resulted in “significant damages to Newsmax, including in the form of lost business, missed advertising and marketing revenues, and lower cable license fees, all while increasing overall company costs. Newsmax is far from the only victim.”


Read Newsmax's lawsuit against Fox News.


	A Fox News spokesperson said, “Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.”


	A key argument in any antitrust case is on the relevant market. Fox News has often promoted its dominance across all news channels, and even across cable TV, a much wider competitive landscape than the one defined by Newsmax.


	In its lawsuit, Newsmax argued that the narrower market for right-leaning pay-TV news channels was distinct from that for general news. Newsmax noted that “consumers who desire right-leaning commentary are much more likely to switch to a channel that shares their ideological perspective than one with a different viewpoint. Right-leaning viewers demonstrate minimal switching to non-right-leaning news outlets like CNN or MSNBC.”

	











	The lawsuit took particular aim at what Newsmax described as Fox's “drag-down” provisions in carriage agreements. Under such tactics, according to the lawsuit, if a distributor wanted to place Newsmax into its basic tier “at little or even at no cost,” the distributor “would be subject to potentially tens of millions in additional license fees paid to Fox for the low-demand channels that are subject to the drag-down provisions.”


	Newsmax claimed that such restrictions have prevented it from being carried on Fubo's sports and entertainment package, as well as on Sling TV's two base plans, while delaying placement on other platforms.


	Newsmax also claimed that it has “faced threats and smear intimidation tactics to hurt or undermine the company and its executives.” Those included Fox hiring, “by itself or through cutout corporations or law firms, private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives,” according to the lawsuit. Newsmax also suggested that social media firm Disruptor has been linked to Fox and engaged in a campaign to spread negative tweets about Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy.


	Newsmax is seeking three times the amount of damages it has suffered, although those were not specified in the lawsuit, as well as an injunction and other relief.

FOX News boasted about being “fair and balanced” for years. But, in fact, it was always the exact opposite. Now these two right-wing media giants are at each other's throats. Aside from Trump and the Proud Boys, mutual destruction would be a fervently hoped-for result by most of the rest of us.

Let's get ready too rumble!!!

The Onion has more legitimate news than these two fake mainstream garbage.

	It took awhile but Prime Video's Tomb Raider series is finally going to production. Some elements have stayed the same — Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who had been attached from the get-go, is creator, writer, executive producer.


	And Sophie Turner, who entered negotiations last November after testing for Lara Croft, is confirmed for the high-profile role previously played on the big screen by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander.


	New additions include Chad Hodge as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge and Jonathan Van Tulleken (Shōgun, Dope Thief) as director and executive producer.

	The series, from Amazon MGM Studios, has set January 19 as the start of production date.




			Watch on Deadline		







	That is exactly three years after word first emerged that Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Waller-Bridge had been tapped to write a Tomb Raider TV series under her overall deal with Amazon MGM Studios. The series was officially greenlighted in May 2024, with Turner identified for the lead six months later. 


	That was followed by months of no new updates amid speculation about creative issues on the series which reportedly went through two writers rooms that didn't result in approved scripts. Hodge, creator of such series as Runaway, The Playboy Club, Wayward Pines and Good Behavior, was brought in as a consultant in the second room, sources said. That led to his appointment as executive-producer and showrunner. Meanwhile, Turner's schedule started filling up, putting a 2025 production start in doubt.

	











	“I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said. “It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…”


Tomb Raider is based on the popular video game franchise, which follows the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft (Turner).


	The series, from Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, is executive produced by Crystal Dynamics, Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions, Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen, Michael Scheel, and Legendary Television.


	“Lara Croft is one of the most recognizable and iconic video game characters of all time. We are thrilled to have the wonderfully talented Sophie Turner bring this character to life who is defined by her courage, strength, and unshakable resolve,” said Vernon Sanders, Head of Global Television, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios. “Led by the brilliant Phoebe Waller-Bridge, this series will honor the beloved Tomb Raider legacy while delivering fresh adventures to fans worldwide.”


	Turner, an Emmy nominee for her first major role as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones, recently headlined the British crime drama limited series Joan and the thriller movie Trust and next stars in another British show, The Dreadful.


	“I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said. “She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I've got. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”Waller-Bridge is represented by UTA, Independent Talent, McEwan & Penford, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Turner is repped by CAA and Independent Talent Group. Hodge is repped by WME, Cullen Conly at Anonymous Content, and Dean Bahat at Ziffren, Brittenham. Van Tulleken is repped by WME, Untitled, and Independent Talent. Story Kitchen is repped by WME & Pryor Cashman.

Associate Editor, TV


Ed Harris (Top Gun: Maverick) has been cast in a leading role in Paramount+‘s Yellowstone, Beth and Rip spinoff series, The Dutton Ranch (w/t). He will star alongside the previously announced Kelly Reilly, Cole Hauser, and Finn Little, who will reprise their original roles. Annette Bening was also recently cast as a lead in the upcoming drama, which will be showrun by Chad Feehan.


The Dutton Ranch, home to Beth Dutton (Reilly) and Rip Wheeler (Hauser), is a testament to the peace they sought, fought for, and nearly died for, as they've come to cherish their 7,000-acre land. With tough times and stiff competition, Beth and Rip do what they must to survive, all while ensuring Carter (Little) becomes the man he's supposed to be.

	Harris will play Everett McKinney, a weathered veteran and veterinarian who treats animals with compassion and understanding, and possesses a good sense of humor.




			Watch on Deadline		







As Deadline revealed in December, the show is expected to remain on the same present-day timeline as the original series, with the new offshoot sharing the most DNA with the mothership of any show in the universe to date.


Yellowstone follows the Dutton family, which controls the largest contiguous cattle ranch in the United States. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son.


Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros, and Keith Cox. Paramount Global Content Distribution distributes the series.


	The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals, for CBS, starring Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton. Additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 were previously announced as being in development.

	











	From Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios, The Dutton Ranch is executive produced by Sheridan, Glasser, the Linsons, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Yari, Friedman, Feehan, Voros, Reilly, Hauser and Cox.


	Harris has been nominated for Academy Awards (Apollo 13, The Truman Show, Pollock, The Hours), Emmys (Westworld, Game Change, Empire Falls), and a Tony Award (Precious Sons). He was last seen on TV in HBO's Westworld playing The Man in Black across the show's four-season run. His small screen credits also include HBO's Empire Falls and TNT's Riders of the Purple Sage.


	Last year, he narrated the Netflix documentary Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy War. Up next, he will play Hollywood agent Neal Saroyan in Marvel's Wonder Man for Disney+. On the big screen, he starred opposite Jessica Lange in Long Day's Journey into Night, which is currently on the festival circuit. He will next be seen in the black comedy-thriller Huntington, working opposite Glen Powell and Margaret Qualley, as well as in the pickleball comedy The Dink. 


	A further sampling of his film credits includes Top Gun: Maverick, Netflix's The Lost Daughter, the A24 film Love Lies Bleeding, the comedy-drama film My Dead Friend Zoe, and the crime thriller feature film Riff Raff. Harris is repped by CAA.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	Warner Bros. continues its ownership of the post-Labor Day frame with this weekend's New Line/Safran Company/Atomic Monster supposed finale, The Conjuring: Last Rites, which is eyeing $40M+ domestic and $80M+ worldwide.


	The opening here is bound to rep a return to form for the Conjuring franchise at the box office; the previous sequel, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, was a theatrical day-and-date release in post-pandemic 2021 on HBO Max and in theaters, and posted a siphoned opening of $24.1M domestic, finishing with $65.6M stateside and $206M worldwide take.


	After a summer that came in even at $3.67 billion in North America, the industry is bracing for a slowdown this month vs. last year, which saw Warner Bros' Beetlejuice Beetlejuice post the second-best start for September at $111M domestic — this after the studio's all-time opening record was set by Stephen King's It back in 2017, which bowed to $123.4M.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Conjuring: Last Rites is expected to be the biggest tentpole in early fall until Disney's Tron: Ares arrives on October 10. That is, unless Warner's Leonardo DiCaprio-starring, Paul Thomas Anderson-directed One Battle After Another (September 26) or Sony's Margot Robbie-Colin Farrell pic A Big Bold Beautiful Journey (September 19) suddenly surprises.


Conjuring: Last Rites is booked at 3,700 theaters in U.S./Canada and 15,500 screens abroad in 66 territories including Korea, Germany, Italy, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Spain and the UK. Conjuring will have all the prayers from Imax, Dolby, PLFs and Motion Seat ticket upcharges. Previews start stateside on at 3 p.m. Thursday

	











	The pic is directed by New Line horror fave Michael Chaves, who helmed The Curse of La Llorona, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It and spinoff The Nun 2. Last Rites follows Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's Ed and Lorraine Warren, who tackle one final case in the 1980s that takes a personal toll on the duo and their daughter (Mia Tomlinson).


RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office


	On U.S. tracking, Conjuring: Last Rites looks heaven-sent with overall unaided awareness ahead of Final Destination: Bloodlines ($51.6M in May) and The Nun 2 ($32.6M during the 2023 strike). First choice is on par with Bloodlines and close to double that of Nun 2, with women under 25 being the strongest demographic. In The Conjuring universe, 2018's The Nun holds the franchise-record opening at $53.8M. It's also the top-grossing pic in the series at $366 million. The Conjuring universe is the largest-grossing horror franchise in motion picture history with $2.3B+ worldwide. New Line is the only company with two billion-dollar horror franchises, with The Conjuring universe and IT/IT Chapter Two at $1.2B.


	Disney has the second wide studio entry this weekend with the filmed version of Broadway sensation Hamilton, which already played on Disney+ back in July 2020 to great viewership and won two Emmys. The theatrical release is expected to ring up around $7M at 1,800 theaters with previews starting Thursday at 2PM. Disney bought the musical created by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda in February 2020 for $75M. Before Covid, the movie was originally intended to have a theatrical release.

	No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet on Last Rites. The first two Conjuring movies have the best grades in the series with an A- apiece, an anomaly for a horror film, which usually scores in the Bs or Cs with general audiences.

	A site billed as the largest live sports piracy operation in the world has been shut down in Egypt, an antipiracy coalition announced on Wednesday.


Streameast had logged more an 1.6 billion visits in the past year, with 80 associated domains, offering unauthorized access to top European soccer leagues. It also gave users access to UEFA club competitions and international qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro and UEFA Nations League, and CONMEBOL Copa America, according to the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, the global antipiracy group.


ACE, which is led by the Motion Picture Association, said that Streameast also provided access to piracy sites for the NFL, the NBA, the NHL and Major League Baseball, as well as sites for pay-per-view boxing, Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, and motorsports, including Formula One and Moto GP.

	The shutdown followed an investigation from July, 2024 to June, 2025, and operators were arrested on suspicion of copyright infringement in an action by Egyptian authorities late last month, according to ACE. Egyptian authorities also seized three laptops and four smartphones used to operate the sites, as well as 10 Visa cards that contained about 6 million Egyptian pounds, or $123,000 in U.S. dollars, as well as about $200,000 USD in crypto wallets, ACE said. Authorities also found that the operators created a UAE shell company to funnel advertising revenue from the sites.

	All sites will be redirected to a “watch legally” page. Most of the visits to Streameast originated from the U.S. and Canada, per ACE.

	











	Charles Rivkin, the chairman of ACE and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement, “With this landmark action, we have put more points on the board for sports leagues, entertainment companies, and fans worldwide—and our global alliance will stay on the field as long as it takes to identify and target the biggest piracy rings across the globe.”

The Conjuring: Last Rites solidifies The Conjuring franchise as the Fast & Furious of horror movies: A conservative, Christian, family-oriented, spin-off and sequel-laden series of adventures that lose the plot and reinvest in the audience's affection for its familiar beats and cornball leads. Last Rites even spends a decent portion of its runtime at a cookout. It's one step away from Ed and Lorraine Warren blessing a six-pack of Corona. As filmmaker Michael Chaves brings the escapades of these two real-life paranormal investigators to a close, returning from previous Conjuring low point The Devil Made Me Do It, he does so with a combination of revisited greatest hits and sappy schmaltz. The resulting victory lap is a slog, a longer and duller hagiography than those of actual saints.

After 12 years of Conjuring, Ed and Lorraine (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) surely deserve some time away from exorcisms, but The Conjuring: Last Rites devotes most of its 135 minutes to set-up. Its trio of screenwriters flit across the country and across timelines to establish the loose connections between the haunted house of the Smurl family and the haunted life of Judy (Mia Tomlinson), the Warrens' now-grown daughter. 

Both storylines are more chaotic than coherent. The packed Smurl household is so dense with bodies and horror tropes that it's an overstuffed Brady Bunch of crosstalk, without real characters to speak of. Judy's life—from demon-pursued miracle baby, to little girl who's inherited her mother's clairvoyance, to ghost-plagued woman engaged to the earnest ex-cop Tony (Ben Hardy)—is predicated on spiritual advice that's baffling coming from a family whose home has a menagerie of haunted doodads: The things she's seeing aren't real. Judy is therefore reduced to horror-movie shorthand, both in her tired arc (of her parents' overprotective denial giving way to acceptance) and in her chanted nursery rhyme mantra, evoked like a non-denominational prayer to keep the ghosts and ghoulies away.

The Conjuring: Last Rites relies on this recitation like it relies on gags and props from the previous films. These can be more aesthetic repetitions—like another couple of creepy toys, plenty of mirrors, a predictably panning camera, and all the jump-scare monsters seeming to share Bonnie Aarons' face—or more literal, like the return of the evil doll Annabelle. While skillful horror can exploit audience expectations, a final franchise entry mostly filled with callbacks isn't especially scary. The more unique elements faced by Ed and Lorraine in Last Rites are the sometimes unintentionally funny demons of age: Terrors like your daughter getting married, your older friends dying, your heart health deteriorating, your ability to move heavy furniture fading, and your likelihood of taking a tumble down the stairs increasing.

The Warrens facing their mortality isn't exactly the point of Last Rites, but it at least allows for Wilson to charm with a few dad jokes and “I'm too old for this shit”-style asides. But where the rapport between Wilson and Farmiga saw the previous entries through their quieter moments, Last Rites spreads itself too thin for these veterans to explore their earned pathos, the script scattered between Judy and Tony's infatuation, the rivalry between a pair of Smurl daughters, a sidebar with Steve Coulter's Father Gordon, and one extended match of ping-pong. When the Warrens finally get to the Smurls' house, the film rushes to its sepia conclusion for one last round of applause, all but raising Ed and Lorraine's demonologist jerseys into the rafters.

James Wan's original Conjuring didn't reinvent anything for the genre, but deployed perfectly practiced and sweaty-palmed fundamentals in a tense setting, with charmingly dorky leads, punctuated by pops of cleverness in design and dialogue. As those who ran with that film's legacy watered down their Wan impressions and focused more on beefing up the mythos of the Warrens, the returns diminished and the series evolved into a defiantly uncritical series of God-powered superhero films. Even in Last Rites, where the Warrens' 1980s lecture audience is mostly there to heckle them about Ghostbusters, this larger cultural eye-roll at the supernatural is just a one-off gag; the rest of the film banks on those “based on the true story” title cards to carry its emotional weight. The damning detail is that this time the silly claim of veracity isn't trying to add an extra chill, but provide a cheap happily ever after.

Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams' daughter, Matilda Ledger, made a rare public appearance in New York City last Thursday, her first in nearly seven months. The 19-year-old, who bears a striking resemblance to her late father, was photographed riding her bike through the city.

As per photos published by Page Six, for the outing, Matilda wore a blue-and-white striped sweater with an A-line denim midi skirt and bright red flats. Later, she changed into a light gray jacket, carrying a green tote bag and pulling a large suitcase while shopping.

A post shared by Heath Ledger 🍁 (@loveheathledger_)

Matilda was last photographed in January while stepping out for coffee with a friend in Brooklyn. For that outing, she wore the same pair of red flats, this time styled with black tights to keep warm. She completed the look with a green puffer jacket and baggy jeans.

The sighting came just one week before the anniversary of Ledger's death. The actor, known for roles in “The Dark Knight” and “Brokeback Mountain”, died on January 22, 2008, at age 28 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs.

Williams welcomed Matilda in October 2005, a year after she met Ledger on the set of Brokeback Mountain. The couple ended their relationship in 2007, a year before his passing.

In March, Williams reflected on raising her daughter during an appearance on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast. “When I make mistakes in front of my daughter and own up to them and apologize, it teaches her to apologize and say, ‘Oops, Mommy, I'm sorry,' and it's not a big deal,” the actress said.

She also spoke about the challenges of being young while navigating love and loss, saying, “I suppose maybe a good thing about being young is that you don't have so much life experience that you can contextualize things.”

Alongside Matilda, Williams is also mom to three younger children with husband Thomas Kail: son Hart, 5, and two more children, including one welcomed via surrogate earlier this year.

In April, the actress was spotted with her family of six in their New York neighborhood. A source told People that Matilda has embraced her role as a big sister. “They couldn't be happier to expand their family, and Matilda has been doting on her younger siblings,” the insider said.

Williams publicly thanked her surrogate during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August, saying, “Thanks to Christine, I have three under 5 at home.”

“General Hospital” fans celebrated with a collective cheer when Drew Cain finally got what he had coming. The Congressman was shot in the back, twice, one at close range, and left to bleed out on his floor. The list of potential suspects will likely include at least a third of all the residents in Port Charles. The soap has launched what will likely be the whodunit of the year, and Cameron Mathison is here for it.

The actor chatted with Soap Opera Digest and shared his thoughts on those spectacular scenes where Drew takes a few bullets.

Cameron Mathison first took over the role of Drew Cain in 2021. At that time, the former Navy SEAL was a great guy. Somewhere along the way, the writers decided to decimate Drew's character, and perhaps one of the most evil GH villains of all time was born. He has spent the last year trying to expose the Qs while blackmailing nearly everyone he once called a close friend. He also seems to enjoy hurting children if it gets him what he wants.

It comes as no shock that everyone wants Drew dead, and Mathison agrees. “Obviously, everybody hates me like crazy, but at the same time, they had to do that for the last four or five months,” he reasons. 

He continues, “They can't just have people not like me. They have to have people want to kill me! And in order to have multiple people want to kill you, you've got to be pretty despicable — and they've done a really good job with that with Drew! I've trusted the process and now, it's become weirdly therapeutic.”

“I try to be a really nice human and a good, solid person in my life, and I've gone through a lot of big life challenges in a very short stretch of time. Then, I go to work and get to be such a jerk — it's almost like my little fantasy escape. I don't know if it's good for my psyche or not, but I've really leaned into it!The more I gave into it and really trusted the process and the writers — I don't change anything, and I don't ask to change anything, I just kind of go in and do it — it's just become easier and easier. That's maybe a little bit scary, but also really fun!”

Cameron is having a blast playing a bad guy and is thrilled to be at the center of a whodunit. “I'm super-excited about it. I watched Dallas back in the day, and in many ways, it's very in line with the ‘Who Shot JR?' story. I don't care if you are the punching bag for all of Port Charles, you're still the center of the story, and that feels really cool.“

He also really enjoyed actually filming those scenes where Drew was shot. “It's not every day that you get to take a gunshot on camera, and I really wanted to get that right and fall hard. And then, from the audience perspective, I knew, ‘The viewers are gonna love this!' They all want to shoot Drew! Everybody wants Drew shot and dead. So I wanted to make sure that I gave them my all.”

Who do you think shot Drew Cain? Do you want to see the Congressman survive?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Actor's Final Wish Was to Reconnect with Kevin Costner Before His Passing","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/graham-greene-final-wish-kevin-costner/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:45:51 GMT","

New details emerge about Graham Greene's final moments leading up to his death.

A representative of the late actor shared with TMZ that one of his dying wishes was to reconnect with his “Dances With Wolves” co-star, Kevin Costner.

According to the outlet, Greene wanted to speak with Costner and show his appreciation for giving indigenous people a chance to be represented in media over the years. The late actor's team tried their best to get in touch with Costner, but were unsuccessful, TMZ added.

A post shared by Kevin Costner (@kevincostner)

However, on Tuesday, the “Yellowstone” star paid his tribute to Greene on social media, and it's clear that the admiration between them is mutual.

Costner honored Greene by posting a scene from their iconic film “Dances With Wolves,” which they starred in together in the 1990s. He praised his late co-star, calling him both a masterful actor and a wonderful person.

“A few things come to mind when I think of Graham Greene and our time together on ‘Dances With Wolves,'” Costner captioned the post.

“I think of how willing he was to learn the Lakota language. I think of my joy when I heard that his work on the film was recognized with an @theacademy Awards nomination.

And I think of this scene in particular, when he was able to establish so much about the relationship between Dunbar and the natives with so few words. He was a master at work and a wonderful human being. I'm grateful to have been a witness to this part of his lasting legacy. Rest in peace, Graham,” Costner added.

Meanwhile, fans took to the comments of Costner's post to share their own tributes for Greene. One fan wrote, “The most iconic movie in my eyes! Rest well, ‘Kicking Bird.'”

Another pointed out, “This film was the first time I ever heard my language in a movie outside of my family circle. Thank you, Kevin. RIP mitȟákȟola.”

Someone also praised Greene for his contribution to the native community. “RIP Graham Greene. A trailblazing talent who gave so much exposure to the Native American artists.”

A fan added, “The most famous and underrated Native American actor in film history. You don't even have to know his name, but you know that face. No matter what role he did, he always caught your attention and added to the quality of the film. Rest in peace, my brother. You did us proud.”

Greene passed away on Monday, after a “lengthy illness,” TMZ reported. He was 73.

Could things between Dorit and PK Kemsley be on the mend? The duo was spotted out together for a very public dinner in LA, and apparently, their chemistry is alive and well. The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” couple has been separated since May 2024, with Dorit taking the step to file for divorce in April 2025. 

According to TMZ, which captured exclusive footage, this was the first time that Dorit and PK had shared a public meal in months, and fans were quick to hope that a reconciliation could be in the works.

The clip obtained by TMZ shows the former lovebirds sharing a quiet dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Sherman Oaks. It was the first time that they had been seen in public one-on-one since the divorce filing. Naturally, sharing a meal has led to speculation about their current status. Sources close to Dorit and PK say that their divorce is still on, and that their commitment is now to coparenting as well as possible. 

As for the chemistry and sparks, they will likely always be there to some degree, especially since they have a family together and can't completely cut ties.

While Dorit's personal life is in flux, work is once again keeping her busy. According to Page Six, the cameras are up and filming for Season 14 of the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” In August, she was spotted filming in the Hamptons with Kyle Richards, and new castmate, Rachel Zoe.

The trio was spotted at a Montauk hotspot called Surf Lodge, renowned for its excellent DJ sets and A-list clientele. “They got there earlier, so it wasn't super crowded,” a source told Page Six. The ladies filmed for about 20 minutes, but “stuck around for the rest of the gig to have fun.” They then made their way to a private area for a filmed dinner.

PK has not been spotted filming for Season 14 of RHOBH. Based on his comments, it is unlikely that he will. He and Dorit tied the knot in March 2015. When Dorit filed for divorce earlier this year, she also asked for sole legal and physical custody of their children, Jagger and Phoenix.

What do you think about their recent outing? Is there a chance that Dorit and PK might reconcile?

Every TV fan knows the power of the workplace comedy.

Sure, there's “The Office” and two decades of its single camera successors — but it's also the backdrop of everything from earlier hits like “Murphy Brown” and “The West Wing” and classic examples of the genre like “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” To be a working American is to unwind by watching other working Americans.

It is in that rich tradition that “The Office” creator Greg Daniels teams up with co-creator Michael Koman for “The Paper,” which quickly sheds the pressure of a spinoff while introducing a new office full of people to love. Set in Ohio, the show follows a struggling local newspaper and its many employees. With no budget to hire real journalists, the “Toledo Truth Teller” sets out to become a local paper of repute, all while followed by the same documentary crew that captured “The Office.”

There's new editor-in-chief Ned (Domhnall Gleeson), online editor Esmeralda (Sabrina Impacciatore), writers (or those aspiring to be) Mare (Chelsea Frei), Nicole (Ramona Young), and Detrick (Melvin Gregg). Tracy Letts is a brilliant choice for a recurring executive who supports the “Truth Teller” while running a toilet paper empire (you read that right).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The Paper” has much of what made “The Office” soar, with the benefit of an existing playbook (as well as the aforementioned workplace comedies and many more): bumbling bosses, budding romance, and Oscar Nuñez — reprising his role as Oscar Martinez in a new accounting job. The joke density is lethally calibrated between the writing, direction, performances, reactions, and heightened absurdity of any mundane situation. (The pilot includes Ned being locked in a room by his soon-to-be employees while they assess him as a security risk, and one of them noting, “We don't know you, sir. Why should we know why you say the things you say?”).

The biggest critique that can be leveled at “The Paper” is that it introduces a lot of characters — no more or less than “The Office” in its first season, but with half as many episodes to get to know them, especially those along the periphery — but even those along the edges provide killer punchlines and a strong enough skeletal character to be built out moving forward. Consider Travis (Eric Rahill), Adelola (Gbemisola Ikumelo), Adam (Alex Edelman), and wizened journalism vet Barry (Duane R. Shepard Sr.). Showrunner Koman and the writing staff stick to a few standout dynamics in Season 1, but with lots more space to play in the future.

 










Gleeson is the de facto lead, armed with a solid American accent and Leslie Knope-esque love for journalism, but Impacciatore runs away with every scene from the start. To compare Esmeralda to Michael Scott would be a disservice (especially when more of that spirit can be found in Tim Key's supervisor Ken), but on paper she fills the role of a slightly obtuse authority figure preoccupied with her own agenda. In practice, she's outrageously entertaining, from line readings to body language to glimpses of Esmeralda's genuine street smarts (or lackthereof, which provide some of the season's biggest laughs in Episode 5, “Scam Alert!”).

The first 10 episodes chronicle the day-to-day of keeping the “Truth Teller” afloat, a struggle that feels as futile as Dunder Mifflin's quest to sell paper did in 2005 (and hits extremely close to home if you happen to be working in news media, ahem). With the focus on local news and the paper's staff, “The Paper” indulges in world-building its workplace like its predecessor or “Parks and Recreation” or “Abbott Elementary” and so much other esteemed company. If you've never imagined how a newspaper staff might co-work with toilet paper sales workers, that's about to change.

 










The bingeable first season will leave everyone from “Office” diehards to new viewers wanting more — which is just as well, since Peacock ordered a second season a day before its debut. While we hope for a bigger episode order and quick turnaround, the “Truth Teller” staff will be reporting for duty, available to stream and make us laugh any time.

All 10 episodes of “The Paper” Season 1 will premiere Thursday, September 4 on Peacock.

Following a world premiere at Cannes, Oliver Hermanus brought his “The History of Sound” to the east coast on Monday night for its New York City premiere. His historical wartime romance follows Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor as they journey through a post-World War America, and follows a decades-long quiet connection that reverberates through one man's lifetime.

Early buzz of the film teased hot and steamy sex scenes between the co-stars. However, following its debut in France, the film's approach opted to tell a softer love story without explicit intimacy. “There are many different kinds of sex scenes in the film, one of which is Paul's character just walking around Josh's character's house, his apartment,” Hermanus told IndieWire on the red carpet. “I tried to, you know, suggest that queer people, gay people, can have relationships that are more than just hookups. This is about the deeper things. I'm proud of my choice.”

As for how the duo developed their chemistry, the director said that it was obvious from the very beginning. “We hung out a few times in London a lot and there was one night I was at a friend's house and they were both over, I think I was DJing, I was hanging out, and it was immediately at ease with which they got on, and by the time we were shooting the movie, it was its own thing,” he said.

 










“I've done my fair share of sex scenes, I'm like, ‘been there, done that,'” Mescal previously told us at Cannes. “What feels slightly different about this from [other] romantic relationships onscreen, I would say in the hierarchy of their relationship, physical touch isn't the priority. It's intellectual stimulation, it's friendship. Not that they're not physically attracted to each other; they very much are, but their chemistry is born from this shared love of these folk songs, and it extends from there.”

With this project, O'Connor will have three indie releases in 2025 alone, along with “Rebuilding” and “The Mastermind.” Reflecting on often starring in independent films, he told us, “I don't necessarily see them as independent movies or studio or anything like that. It's really to do with just good stories, characters, that feel like they're challenging me or, oftentimes, characters that I can learn from and develop as a person.”

Earlier this year, O'Connor wrapped filming on Steven Spielberg's next film, set to release in 2026. He told us that working with the director was “the best ever. He's the boss, I learned so much from him. He's still inquisitive. He's still excited, like a child, when he sees something he likes, he wants to do it more. He's a big inspiration to me.” The project also stars Emily Blunt, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson. Kristie Macosko Krieger will produce for Amblin Entertainment. 

 










“The History of Sound” received positive reviews at Cannes, with IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio writing that “The false notes are rare in director Oliver Hermanus' affecting and dustily textured romance ‘The History of Sound,' written by Ben Shattuck from his own short story about men in love, together and apart, circa World War I and its aftermath. But for a queer love story starring two of the hottest, of-this-moment leading actors around — Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor— ‘The History of Sound' almost perversely denies your expectations of what a gay romance could be.”

MUBI will release the film on Friday, September 12.

Paul Mescal has been one busy man. Just days after celebrating the world premiere of Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” at Telluride, he flew across the country to attend the New York City premiere of Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” which debuted at Cannes earlier this year, alongside co-star Josh O'Connor. All this while being in production for Sam Mendes' Beatles biopic and in off-and-on production for Richard Linklater's “Merrily We Roll Along.” Mr. Mescal, let's hope you're sleeping!

“Hamnet” reviews have been revelatory, coining it an instant awards contender. “It's been such a relief for all of us, you know,” Mescal told IndieWire on the red carpet for his MUBI release. “Having a film premiere in any context is like giving a baby out into the world and we're so, so thrilled that people seem to be, not [necessarily] responding positively, but people seem to be understanding the film that we made as filmmakers. It's a big, big relief.”

In the midst of his releases, Mescal is preparing to play Paul McCartney in Mendes' four Beatles films, set to release in theaters April 2028 as the first “bingeable” movie experience. As for if he has connected with the real life counterpart, Mescal revealed, “I have, yeah. He's an extraordinary man, like to spend any time— it's a crazy sentence to say that I've spent time with that man, let alone play him.” As for if Mescal will be doing his own singing in the films, he said, “Yeah, yeah, absolutely yeah.”

 










Additionally, he's filming Linklater's decades-long project “Merrily We Roll Along,” a project that he remained a bit more tightly sealed about. “It's one that he's kind of swearing us to silence on, because if we start talking about it now, there'll be nothing to talk about in 20 years, but I can say that he is one of my favorite directors in the world,” he said. “I make my way to Texas every couple of years and see him and see Beanie [Feldstein] and see Ben [Platt] and get to work with them. It's also such a crazy process that it's, like, so individual for me.”

“The History of Sound” made waves at Cannes for its sensitive portrayal of a love affair between Mescal and O'Connor's characters. The former had nothing but praise for working with Hermanus: “Oliver made one of my favorite films that I've seen in the last give years, ‘Moffie.'”

“I think he's a true auteur,” he continued. “He's just got such a clear means of attack on scenes and who these characters are, and he knows how to frame them and put them at the center of the story. I loved working with him, he's one of my closest friends.”

“I've been very lucky with the actors I've worked with across my career, with Josh [O'Connor], Andrew [Scott], Jessie [Buckley], Saoirse [Ronan], Daisy [Edgar-Jones], where nothing was ever intentional in terms of how you build a relationship [onscreen],” Mescal previously told IndieWire of creating chemistry with his co-star over an interview at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Cannes the day before “The History of Sound” premiered at the Palais.

 










“It either stands on its own two legs, or it doesn't happen,” Mescal said. “With Josh, it very much felt comfortable. We knew each other, and we'd been talking about the film since 2020, so that's when we first initially connected. He's such a good soul. We're quite similar in terms of the work that we like and are relatively similar as people. It just grew from there.”

Long before the video diary became the en vogue format of personal expression on YouTube and social media platforms like TikTok, Ross McElwee was America's preeminent first-person filmmaker. While studying under cinéma vérité pioneers Richard Leacock and Ed Pincus in MIT's graduate film program, McElwee developed his own style of memoir cinema informed by direct cinema, a Southern literary sensibility ingrained from his North Carolina upbringing, and an almost religious belief in elevating the mundane texture of daily life, previously the province of amateur home movies, to a large artistic canvas. His droll voiceover, which warmly blankets and contextualizes his imagery, provides viewers an entrée into an worldview effortlessly engaged with culture, politics, and the smallest details of his private life.

 








Related Stories ‘A House of Dynamite' Teaser: President Idris Elba Prepares for a Nuclear Missile Attack in Kathryn Bigelow's Latest Geopolitical Thriller Paul Mescal Calls the ‘Hamnet' Positive Reception a ‘Big, Big Relief' — and Talks Connecting with Paul McCartney Ahead of the Beatles Biopic 

While many of his films feature traditional documentary premises — the lingering effects of the Civil War on the South in “Sherman's March,” broadcast television's warped view of reality in “Six O'Clock News,” the complicated legacy of the tobacco industry in “Bright Leaves” — McElwee inevitably deploys them as scaffolding to examine himself and his family. For McElwee, the personal is paramount, and it will either intersect with or supersede any supposedly “professional” requisites whenever it can. His father and siblings, his friends and mentors, they all become recurring characters in his work. McElwee's innately generous eye keeps his work from devolving into solipsism; he frequently extends his gaze to outsiders to help expand his perspective. For instance, gregarious poet and teacher Charleen Swansea appears in many of his films, playing both captivating subject and a pointed foil. She frequently expresses gentle skepticism towards his longtime friend's life's work in casually philosophical terms.

 










McElwee constantly interrogates his compulsion to film daily life, a recurring theme that becomes more prominent once he begins a family. Part of the joy of watching McElwee's work over the years not only comes from watching his family grow up, but also seeing how his creative perspective changes in response to his concerns as a late-in-life husband and father. He adapts his working methods and cheerfully embraces his family as co-authors, but his belief in continuous filmmaking eventually clashes with the wishes of his wife and kids, who understandably don't want their private lives to be grist for the artistic mill. “Turn it off! This is important. This is not art; this is life!” Charleen exclaims to McElwee in “Sherman's March,” insisting that his camera has become a mechanism of detachment. But this tension between art and life, and McElwee's insistence in rendering it a Möbius strip, ultimatelydrives his singular artistic practice.

“Remake,” McElwee's latest accomplished feature, strikes a raw nerve because he makes his family his primary subject for an especially tragic reason. McElwee's son Adrian, a recurring figure in his father's work dating back to when his birth wasdocumented in “Time Indefinite” way back in 1993, died in 2016 of an accidental drug overdose following a long struggle with mental health issues. With “Remake,” McElwee pays tribute to his son by tracing their on-camera relationship, incorporating footage he and Adrian filmed separately and together. In his voiceover, McElwee frequently addresses Adrian and eulogizes his memory, but also expresses self-critical ruminations about his part in his son's death, how his filmmaking may have contributed to his shaky self-image and the growing distance between them.

 










Pain and heartbreak understandably radiate from McElwee's voice throughout “Remake,” a deliberately heavy affair that dives headfirst into the director's lingering remorse. He announces Adrian's death minutes into the film, so every subsequent image of him, from when he was a happy, photogenic child through his more troubled adolescence and subdued final years, are framed by his absence. “Remake” adopts a non-linear approach similar to fragmented memory, jumping back and forth between the past and more recent present, which Ross compares to film reels being out of order. His commentary across the film, which potently mixes 16mm film and contemporary digital imagery that encompass the multiple eras of Adrian's life, switches between adoration and regret befitting a father still contending with such a devastating loss.

Save for a few notable exceptions, McElwee has almost always been the main character in his films, but with “Remake,” he appropriately shares focus with his son, whom he paints without judgment as a lovable, flawed human being. “Remake” portrays Adrian as an ambitious, charming young man whose drive was stymied by substance abuse and unmanaged bipolar disorder, but McElwee never lets his son's setbacks define him in the film. He frequently captures his outgoing personality and sly wit, both as a kid and an adult. Their alternatively affable and tense banter in front of the camera depict a fraught father-son relationship in miniature, but also how self-aware and intelligent Adrian could be even in his lowest moments.

 










Adrian's professional goals varied across multiple disciplines — filmmaker of music and skateboard videos, online entrepreneur, brand manager — but they were founded on a love of moving-image work clearly stemming from his father's influence. At one point, Adrian speaks unfavorably of documentary cinema, claiming he wants to make “real movies” and happily agrees to work within a Hollywood ecosystem that his dad rejected. But he eventually begins filming himself and his friends, like McElwee once did, and even addresses the camera in a similarly intimate fashion. McElwee incorporates Adrian's own unvarnished filmmaking efforts into “Remake,” some of which were designed to be part of a project on opioid addiction in youth culture. The results are authentic and occasionally upsetting: sometimes it's fluid first-person snowboarding footage and other times it's dark scenes of drug use.

Like most of McElwee's films, “Remake” meanders from his relationship with his son to various other personal and professional threads, which serve as necessary breaks from the film's central tragedy and meaningful detours on their own. He discusses the painful separation from his wife Marilyn and how it impacted his relationships with Adrian and his daughter Mariah. At one point, McElwee undergoes brain surgery after a doctor discovers a massive tumor that surprisingly caused no physical symptoms. The most prominent digression involves the futile attempts of comedy director Steve Carr, whose credits include “Daddy Day Care” and “Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” to remake McElwee's most enduring film “Sherman's March” into a fictional movie. Though initially skeptical of the idea, McElwee agrees to Carr's proposal and, in typical fashion, plans to document his efforts. This was the initial foundation of “Remake,” hence the title.

 










As to be expected, a fictional “Sherman's March” never gets off the ground, but not before going through multiple phases of prolonged development: the movie eventually morphs into an hour-long dramatic series before reaching its final failed state as a half-hour comedy. (The single funniest moment in “Remake” features McElwee, shocked and dismayed, watching a sizzle reel of scenes from “Sherman's March,” presumably assembled for interested producers, soundtracked to Beck's “Loser.”) Yet, McElwee uses Hollywood's fleeting attraction with “Sherman's March” to reconnect with real-life figures from his 1986 film and restage certain scenes in the present day. A former girlfriend featured in the film remarks to McElwee that it now plays like a version of sense memory for her and a crucial document of a bygone time in her life.

But as much as McElwee wanders away from Adrian in “Remake,” his absence always snaps the film back into place. So much of “Remake” plays like a companion piece to “Time Indefinite,” McElwee's last film explicitly focused on family and loss. Whereas that film was an optimistic portrait of new beginnings (McElwee‘s engagement and marriage to Marilyn; the birth of Adrian) tinged with a series of unexpected deaths, “Remake” is its explicitly mournful counterpart. On paper, the choice for McElwee to detail his son's final year in painstaking detail, across interview footage and recorded phone calls, might seem like an exercise in misery. In practice, however, the sheer accumulation of documented material becomes absorbing because it's the act of a father desperately struggling to hold onto the memory of his son, even in his darkest hour.

 










Adrian's death encompasses so many various endings in McElwee's life, both small and large, including the end of his 24-year-long marriage, the sale of his beloved house, and the slow evaporation of his friend Charleen's memory. Anyone remotely invested in McElwee's career will feel nothing short of devastated to watch McElwee interview an elderly Charleen as she struggles to remember her appearances in his work.

Despite being so dependent on McElwee's personal and professional history, “Remake” plays perfectly well in a vacuum; he constantly incorporates scenes from his previous films as exposition and background information to ensure that everyone will be up to speed. However, “Remake” will certainlyhave greater significance for those familiar with McElwee's oeuvre since so much of it recontextualizes and fills in gaps from his prior work, particularly his last feature “Photographic Memory,” which partly chronicles McElwee and Adrian's fracturing relationship in a different stage. “Remake” questions some of McElwee's filmmaking choices in the previous film, including the unexamined ethical dilemma of a parent filming their child, especially one obviously struggling with mental illness, for the purpose of public exhibition.

McElwee's bouts of self-doubt about his modus operandi in “Remake” comprise some of the best scenes of his career. When he watches footage from his wedding during a screening of “Time Indefinite” in Poland right around the end of his marriage, he fantasizes about turning off the projector and storming the stage to the film a lie. For such a reflexive filmmaker, McElwee has never appeared so nakedly introspective as to when he's implicitly questioning the value of his career and future as a filmmaker, going beyond mere pondering about the relationship between camera and subject. While this contemplative approach was likely inspired by Adrian's death, it also certainly stems from an aging filmmaker looking back on an intertwined, recursive body of work with a new set of eyes.

 










“Remake” occasionally suffers from occasionally clumsy cross-cutting and some needless repetition in sound and image, but those minor blemishes fade away in the face of its remarkably affecting heights, which capture a father's palpable love for his son and a filmmaker's enduring passion for his creative vision in tandem. McElwee has stated that “Remake” was his attempt to hold onto Adrian and also to let him go. He succeeds in that charge, but that tension he describes, of clinging to memory while desiring to relinquish it, defines McElwee's vision to a tee. His films document the present, but they also preserve the past in amber and point towards an uncertain future. “Remake,” like all of McElwee's personal cinema, embody the passage of time itself. In other words, it's the stuff of life.

“Remake” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Kathryn Bigelow hasn't directed a feature film since 2017's “Detroit,” an eight-year hiatus during which our increasingly unstable world began to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to her geopolitical thrillers. Fortunately, fans of her distinct brand of filmmaking will have another white knuckler to stress over when “A House of Dynamite” premieres this fall. 

Bigelow's new film, which has been branded as one of Netflix's strongest Oscar contenders of the season, follows a President of the United States (Idris Elba) as he meets with advisors to determine the “best” course of action in the face of a deadly nuclear missile strike.

“A House of Dynamite” is written by Noah Oppenheim, who enjoyed a lengthy TV career as a producer for and eventual president of NBC News before co-creating “Zero Day” and writing films like “Jackie” and “The Maze Runner.” In addition to Elba, the film stars Rebecca Ferguson, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Jonah Hauer-King, with Greta Lee, and Jason Clarke.

“A House of Dynamite” premiered at the 2025 Venice International Film Festival, where critics praised the film for its unapologetic bleakness and willingness to portray the ultimate geopolitical worst-case-scenario with thorough research and elite technical filmmaking.

“Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie — with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber with a cataclysmic whisper of an ending,” IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his review. “We used to duck under our desks to rehearse surviving a nuclear annihilation; now, we only duck our heads in the sand we keep shoveling over ourselves. You can't stop what's coming, and what's coming is worse than you thought.”

During her Venice press conference, Bigelow explained that her eight years away from filmmaking was partially due to a lack of material that piqued her interest the way “A House of Dynamite” did.

“I have to be passionate about a subject matter,” Bigelow said. “For me, I don't know if I'm really a director or not, but I'm absolutely committed to a subject and a story. And then I feel like I can do anything, but I have to really believe in whatever the material is.” 

 










“A House of Dynamite” opens in select theaters on October 10 before streaming on Netflix on October 24. Watch the teaser below.

“Poke,” to an extent, is about the Facebook feature meant for saying “hello” to friends. “Who started the rumour of my insanity, and is a Facebook poke still hot 10 years on?” Blue Bendy vocalist Arthur Nolan asked in a statement. “This pretty much sums up our last 18 months perfectly. Maybe with a pinch of salt.”

“Poke” is also the first Blue Bendy song to feature the band's new members, bassist Dina Willcock and drummer Tristan Petsola.

Historians will say it was “Espresso” that did it, but Sabrina Carpenter's ascent to pop's A-list truly began with “Nonsense.” At each stop on her tour behind 2022's Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter performed the song with a bespoke bonus verse incorporating a local shoutout and a sexual innuendo. “Water ain't the only thing I swallow,” she sang to a Chicago crowd that October. By January, “Nonsense” graduated from also-ran to the album's only charting single, and Sabrina Carpenter as we now know her had arrived: witty, itty-bitty, a little smutty, dolled up like a powder-blue Peggy Lee. Now Carpenter is beloved by the classic pop constituencies (teen girls and gay men), while classic rock's powers that be hold her in an esteem second only to Olivia Rodrigo. After nearly a decade in the para-Disney machinery, she's understandably eager to keep a good thing going.

BRAT may have dominated the conversation in 2024, but it was Carpenter's Short n' Sweet that truly achieved ubiquity: At one point, its singles “Taste,” “Please Please Please,” and “Espresso” occupied Nos. 2, 3, and 4 on the Hot 100. Man's Best Friend arrives a year later, almost to the day, with comparatively little pomp. Its only single, “Manchild,” is sneakily endearing, like an explicit needlepoint you've passed in the hallway a few dozen times before bothering to stop and read. “Fuck my life,” Carpenter coos oh-so-sweetly, “Won't you let an innocent woman be?” On Short n' Sweet, she raided the costume closet—a Riviera disco diva's sunnies, a sheer Y2K minidress, a dubiously authentic Pennsylvania twang—to find the one that best suited her. Delivering formally classic, facepalm-clever pop songs on a timetable unseen since Rihanna's heyday, Man's Best Friend takes the Sabrina persona to its apex, and maybe as far as it can go.

When Carpenter sings about sex with men, misandry begets horniness, which begets misandry. “Stranger danger” refers to when he's not that into you anymore; fantasies of pregnancy remain blissfully immaterial. As she goes slackjawed over a man's basic competence—“Assemble a chair from IKEA, I'm like, ‘Uhhh'”—“Tears” boogies to a fidgety strain of nu-disco pulled from the two-year window between Diana Ross' Diana and Evelyn “Champagne” King's Get Loose. Late-album highlight “House Tour” namedrops Chips Ahoy! in the midst of Carpenter's lavishly long-winded and none-too-subtle metaphor: “Yeah, I spent a little fortune on the waxed floors/We can be a little reckless 'cause it's insured.” It's Madonna drag reverse-engineered through Madonna's imitators—the exact sort of kitsch, reference-to-a-reference move that ought to signal just how serious Carpenter isn't.

She made Man's Best Friend primarily with Jack Antonoff, who brought his Bleachers bandmates into the studio. (If only the name Sabrina Carpenter & Her Boyfriends weren't already taken.) Aside from “Don't Worry I'll Make You Worry,” which slips into the messy midtempo of his recent work with Taylor Swift, Antonoff's earnestness becomes the foil to Carpenter's snark. On “Sugar Talking,” he stitches three-chord country to a Babyface-style slow jam and, somehow, none of the seams show. “My Man on Willpower,” one of the album's glitter-dusted ABBA homages, gives Carpenter a taste of her own medicine. “He used to be literally obsessed with me/I'm suddenly the least sought-after girl in the land,” she sings over an ascending progression that doubles as a tranquilizer for critical impulses. When “Goodbye” breaks out the saxophone, honky-tonk piano, and literal bells and whistles, you get the sense Carpenter and Antonoff are just showing off.

Man's Best Friend is so committed to the part that it begins to approach self-parody—“I bet your light rod's, like, bigger than Zeus'” is not Carpenter's best work—but mostly it's sublime. Count up the tricks she and Antonoff pull in “Go Go Juice”: “10 a.m. o'clock on a Tuesday,” the drunken singalong breakdown, the sideswipes at her famous exes. Their love of artifice is how you end up with the lyric “abstinence is just a state of mind,” delivered like Glinda floating away in a Technicolor pink bubble.

No matter how much controversy her pup-play album cover riles up, Carpenter is a pop star in the traditional mold—a showgirl, if you will. The “dress like a princess, curse like a sailor” gambit has nearly run its course, but what a coup in our vulgarly puritanical cultural moment. I picture a room of label execs clapping each other on the back while Carpenter turns toward the camera and winks. They let her sing the word “fuck” 10 times.

Margo Price has always been a 21st-century artist with 20th-century style. Her 2016 debut, Midwest Farmer's Daughter, was a Bobby Gentry fever dream that played out a hot writing hand: vintage country-soul lit with rap-lyric vividness. The record also sketched her moving, hardscrabble personal narrative (further unspooled in a 2022 memoir)—the basis for an exceedingly compelling persona Price has built alongside her records. She rocks the “outlaw country” label as hard as anyone in the game (praising psilocybin and posing on a Manhattan corner puffing a fatty in 2022 New York Times feature); wears her politics proudly on her sleeve (NB: her two-word introduction to a cover of Woody Guthrie's “Deportee” at Newport Folk Festival); and, to judge from her countless collaborations, ranks high among your favorite artists' favorite artists. All the while, her music's been shapeshifting, blossoming wider on 2017's All American Made and roaming further afield, with mixed success, on her last two LPs and a truckload of one-offs since.

In some ways, her latest, Hard Headed Woman, is a return to classic country form—recorded in Nashville at RCA Studio A, where Waylon Jennings cut the 1973 outlaw-genre touchstone Honky Tonk Heroes. But Price's record is also an integration and exhalation. The opener is a fragment of secular gospel that announces “I'm a hard headed woman and I don't owe ya shit.” That dovetails into a rewrite of Kris Kristofferson's “Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down” that recasts the late outlaw-scholar's scathing anti-war ballad as a rowdy, funny, defensively personal honky-tonk screed. The track takes ostensible aim at “tone deaf sons of bitches” in the music industry: “Dudes lookin' down their noses/Thinkin bullshit smells like roses,” she yawps with gusto, “All the cocaine in existence/Can't keep your nose out of my business.” Price was friends with the late Kristofferson, and was raised in the church, so she's entitled to her formal script-flips, which flex folk tradition (rap tradition too) as they repurpose classic forms.

It's an approach she uses across the album, playing to strengths while dodging pigeonholes. In this political moment, for example, a fan might expect—or even long for—sharp commentary from the outspoken writer of “All American Made.” But here, we get a Dylan-esque heel-turn towards other matters. “We played the jukebox while democracy fell,” she sings wistfully on “Close to You,” a dreamy Mexicali love song that sounds like something from Springsteen's recent Lost Albums. That disconnect is echoed on “Don't Wake Me Up,” featuring Jesse Welles, with a video recalling Dylan's “Subterranean Homesick Blues” protest-sign-cum-cue-card shtick. “Don't wake me up, I ain't up for that/The way this world is going, ain't where I'm at/And sooner or later we'll all be dead/I'd rather be living it up, up in my head,” the two activist artists sing, positing a refusal to be perpetually triggered as a significant act of resistance in itself.

Known for collaborating with older heroes, Price works here with peers where she's on more equal footing. With Welles, the talented young Woody Guthrie acolyte known for his potent “singing the news” clips on social media, she's in fact the elder, and the two have good chemistry. “Love Me Like You Used to Do” features Tyler Childers, a successful outlier like Price who's also unafraid to address social issues. But here, the pair Tammy-and-George their way through a flirty slow waltz, mixing pathos with punchlines, Childers rhyming “empty boxes of tissues” with “trust issues” and positing “life ain't always roses/Let's forget all our woe-ses/And go out and pick up some wine.” (That both singers have publicly struggled with alcohol deepens the jokey wistfulness.)

Much of Hard Headed Woman is similarly about love and its trials, and its focus on the verities of songcraft suggests an artist confident enough to lean harder into tropes, formulas, and covers (including a spicy take on Waylon Jennings' “Kissing You Goodbye”). It may feel like fiddling while Rome burns, but artistically it pays off. The aching “Nowhere is Where,” a ballad nodding to Patsy Cline's “Pick Me Up on Your Way Down”, feels near-classic itself. “Red Eye Flight” is a souped-up '80s honky-tonk stomper. “Losing Streak” is a perfect nugget of Rolling Stones country-rock swagger that makes hitting bottom sound almost fun (having Stones wingman Chuck Leavell on board certainly helps). Like a lot of music that speaks to this moment, Price's latest set is mostly about taking pleasure where you find it—not just to avoid the darkness, but to survive it for the long haul.

When people say something is “Lynchian,” they usually mean that it's uncanny or almost imperceptibly off. Or they mean something pure and lovely and innocent, presented in a frame that makes you sense the unseen insects crawling over one another, just below the surface. As you have no doubt noticed, a lot of art and a discomfiting percentage of current events meet this description. It's a useful term, which is why it's overused. Yet it rarely evokes the odd sentimentality at the heart of David Lynch's films. Think of how the sinister drones of “Laura Palmer's Theme,” from Twin Peaks, are suddenly overwhelmed by a brightly sad piano sequence meant to reflect the real pain hidden within surreal events. Should you need a reminder, Chicago post-punk standard-bearers Ganser drop those dire chords directly into “Black Sand,” the first song on Animal Hospital. Their bare-faced homage risks being predictable simply because it's so obvious. But with its remarkably dense noise perfumed by an atmosphere of weird tenderness, Animal Hospital pays off the gamble. If you're too cool to appreciate a Twin Peaks reference in 2025, wait until you hear what they think about you not dancing at shows.

Animal Hospital comes five years after the release of Ganser's last album, Just Look at That Sky. In that time, they've steadily built a reputation as one of Chicago's most intriguing indie-rock bands, touring with Idles and the reunited Mclusky, opening for Bikini Kill and Gilla Band, and working with Liars' Angus Andrew on 2023's Nothing You Do Matters EP. Andrew returns for Animal Hospital, but Nadia Garofalo, who used to front the band alongside singer and bassist Alicia Gaines, doesn't. In her place is Sophie Sputnik, who fills the gap seamlessly—that's her singing in “Black Sand,” sounding like she's been in the band for years. Maybe it's the result of a new member, maybe it's the inevitable progress that comes with five years of steady writing and touring, but Animal Hospital feels like a refreshed and reenergized version of a sound that hadn't yet lost its potency. It's a tangled nest of wiry, traditional post-punk made messier by the band's obsession with noise and tertiary effects, and dynamized by frequent detours into something resembling pitch-black cabaret.

Gaines has always tended to write Ganser's airier music. With more space, you can feel the crushed velvet texture of her voice more directly, and she takes advantage of it throughout Animal Hospital. She croons her way through “Speaking of the future,” a scratched and silky Bond theme. Sophistication and glamor are a crucial aspect of Ganser's appeal, as is the subversion of both; rather than pout over some romantic heartache, Gaines sings about the unbearable velocity of time as it barrels forward, while she and her band carve out a little temporary bunker of a song that slinks forward like Portishead's “Sour Times.” “Everything that we think we know is wrong,” she sings in “stripe”—which, sure, is a nice, if banal, reminder we could all use from time to time—before the pendulum swings and she adds, “Everything that we think we know is right.” There's a dreamy sway to the way the song treats this chorus, as if it's trying to get comfortable reconciling its two seemingly incongruent truths.

This straightforward and stylish mode of handling paradox is underscored by the sense of awe that accompanies so much of the music here. In the case of “stripe,” with its cowbell and Vaselined synths that make it sound like a goth Deee-Lite, there's a dark but sincere sweetness to the music that, in this context, does feel Lynchian. The song's sentimentality is directed at something like the unknowable nature of truth, or maybe the naivete of thinking you might one day solve the riddle, which is an oddly existential sentimentality, but a real one nonetheless; who hasn't found themselves lost in the beauty of not knowing?

Too heady? No problem. Gaines quotes a Michael Jordan meme in “Discount Diamonds”: “Fuck them kids,” she sings, smirking that they “don't dance anymore.” Should the ire of MJ not convince you to shake it, Ganser figure, perhaps the classics will. “Mr. Plato says ‘Come on, let's dance,'” Sputnik spits in the very next song. There is room here to go nuts over the real Mr. Plato's writing about dance as the ultimate art form, should you want to—but don't be a nerd, Ganser seem to say, put your ass into it. Besides, there are plenty of post-punk bands out there who want you to nod approvingly at their cogent class analysis or cower at their fearsomeness. You don't need to know that Ganser are making smart music in order to enjoy moving your body to it, which seems like the point.

As with Andrews' productions on Nothing You Do Matters, the feel of Animal Hospital frequently recalls the industrial dub of Adrian Sherwood. There are a million guitars corkscrewing through “Black Sand,” enough spooky background effects in “Grounding Exercises” to soundtrack a Hanna-Barbera Halloween episode. Even the rattling forward attack of “Half Plastic” is jammed with rapid breaths and photo-negative guitar shredding from Sputnik, Dove Hollis, and former band member Charlie Landsman. Taken as a whole, the density of sound makes Animal Hospital an unusually immersive listen. It's the same way wandering through a well-orchestrated dream, or watching a beguiling TV show, can make you feel like you've stepped into another dimension, one that's full of danger and joy and something else you can't quite name.

Lady Gaga is back with a new song. What's more, her single “The Dead Dance” gets the music video treatment courtesy of Tim Burton, marking the first time the two creatives have ever worked together. The black-and-white visual plays into both artists' aesthetics while keeping ties to Wednesday, the Netflix series starring Jenna Ortega as the Addams Family character of the same name. Watch the video below.

“The Dead Dance” was written by Lady Gaga, Andrew Watt, and Henry Walter, with producer credits going to Gaga, Watt, and Cirkut. The pop star's Wednesday song dovetails with her cameo in the show. Gaga stars as the white-haired character Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary Nevermore teacher, after teasing her role at the Netflix Tudum 2025 event and performing her single “Abracadabra” and “Zombieboy” with portions of the Addams Family theme song.

Mayhem, Gaga's first studio album in five years, came out this past March. Since then, she pulled double duty as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live and headlined Coachella 2025. Her North American tour in support of the album is currently underway, with upcoming dates scheduled in New York, Toronto, and Chicago. From there, she will perform in Europe and Australia on through to the end of the year.

	On The Paper, Peacock's new quasi-spinoff of The Office, Domhnall Gleeson plays Ned Sampson, new editor-in-chief of The Toledo Truth Teller, a once-mighty Ohio newspaper that has, like an awful lot of print journalism, become a shell of its former self. The Truth Teller now employs only a handful of people, while the bulk of its historical building is occupied by people who work in more lucrative divisions of the parent company Enervate, selling things like toilet paper and office supplies. The newspaper itself largely just runs articles from wire services, while its companion website focuses on stories with headlines like “You Won't Believe How Much Ben Affleck Tipped This Limo Driver.”  


	Ned, a journalism nerd who gets control of the Truth Teller as a reward for his great work as a salesman for the company, believes he can, if not restore the paper to its glory days, at least make it a respectable and useful source of news to the community. But aside from Mare (Chelsea Frei), who wrote for The Stars and Stripes newspaper when she was in the Army, he's surrounded by people who range from merely unqualified to outright idiots. So he spends a lot of time as this show's equivalent of Jim, struggling to conceal his exasperation with these people, then telling the documentary crew how he really feels about this depressing situation. But he also turns out to be The Paper equivalent of Michael Scott, constantly holding unnecessary meetings in the conference room and displaying an increasingly overinflated sense of self. 

	











	On top of that awkward combination of character traits, Ned also in a way feels like an author surrogate for Greg Daniels, who co-created The Paper with Michael Koman. Daniels is a sneakily important figure in the history of TV comedy. He wrote some of the best episodes of The Simpsons at its peak, like “Bart Sells His Soul” and “Lisa's Wedding.” He co-created King of the Hill. He adapted the British The Office for American television, and he co-created Parks and Recreation. That's an inner-circle Hall of Fame résumé right there. But those shows were all from the final years of the monoculture and a much healthier time for TV comedy overall. Outside of Hulu's recent hit King of the Hill revival, Daniels' work in the streaming era, with shows like Upload and Space Force, has been creatively uneven, while also failing to penetrate the zeitgeist in the way his earlier series did.

	Daniels trying to revive the brand of The Office in a much more fraught sitcom environment isn't that different from Ned believing that he can resurrect the Truth Teller at a moment when local papers everywhere are bleeding to death, and when the only way he can beef up the staff is to get employees from other Enervate divisions to volunteer their time and learn how to be reporters as they go. Ned and Daniels each find some success on the margins of what they're attempting, but the overall results for both are a reminder of how hard it is to turn back the clock to the good old days.    


The Paper begins with the documentary crew that filmed Michael and company returning to the same office park in Scranton to see how things are going for their old subjects. Instead, the only familiar face is good ol' Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration, as we find out that Dunder Mifflin was bought by Enervate. The lone employee who agreed to move to Toledo is accountant Oscar (Oscar Nuñez), who's none too pleased to have the same filmmakers once again following him around. 


	That's as far as direct Office links go, though Oscar will occasionally talk about how someone's behavior reminds him of Michael, even if he never mentions his old boss by name. But it's not hard to map various new characters onto ones from the original show — or, in the case of unctuous, useless England-born Enervate exec Ken (Tim Key), onto the original Office.

	Mare is a slightly more assertive Pam, and it will no doubt shock you to learn that she and Ned develop chemistry that sits precariously on the line between friendship and romance. The paper's one veteran reporter, Barry (Duane R. Shepard Sr.), is basically Creed if Creed's behavior were motivated by light dementia rather than a Sixties drug hangover. The Paper is willing to mix and match other Office character traits and subplots, so that accountant Adam (Alex Edelman) and toilet paper salesman Travis (Eric Rahill) are both dumb enough to be Kevin. But Adam also winds up with this show's equivalent of Creed's fake Creedthoughts blog, where Ned prints all of Adam's worst ideas on a fake internal newsletter that he dubs “The Also News,” just to avoid hurting the guy's feelings. 


	Ned's worst moments are probably a bit closer to Andy Bernard in the post-Michael Office seasons, when Andy himself became a watered-down Michael. The most aggressive, ridiculous energy comes from the woman who was running the Truth Teller before Ned arrived: Esmeralda, played by Sabrina Impacciatore from the Sicily season of The White Lotus. Esmeralda is a complete cartoon character: wildly narcissistic, transparently incompetent, hostile, mean, and prone to malapropisms. (She tells the humble Ned to stop being “so self-defecating.”) Impacciatore is a gifted comic actor, but even within the slightly exaggerated reality of this fictional universe, Esmeralda would be fired for her behavior in virtually every scene — or, at least, be the subject of constant HR complaints that would get her reassigned to a do-nothing basement job where she would never have to interact with another employee. 

	











	Michael was an obvious moron, too, but Daniels managed to keep his behavior just within the realm of plausibility, and to periodically give him moments that explained how and why he got and kept his job as branch manager. There's a promising window midway through this show's first season where it feels like Daniels and Koman are doing a “she's an idiot, but she's our idiot” character turn with Esmeralda and the staff, much like The Office did with Michael starting in Season Two. But it unfortunately lasts for only a couple of episodes before she goes back to trying to undermine everyone, in a way that constantly grinds the show to a halt. (By far the character's funniest moment comes in a subplot that has nothing to do with the newspaper, where she tries to get her son cast in an Enervate TV commercial, then somehow attempts to make it an audition for herself. It's still ludicrous, but because Esmeralda isn't actively working to sabotage the main characters, it lets Impacciatore's talents shine in a way they don't the rest of the season.) 


	Most of the other characters — including Melvin Gregg and Ramona Young as another slow-burning potential couple — prove likable enough over time, and the writers have some fun for a while with showing how Ned's volunteers from other departments are in way over their heads trying to do the jobs of trained reporters. But Daniels, Koman, and their collaborators — including latter-era Office showrunner Paul Lieberstein writing the finale —  are also trying to squeeze two to three seasons' worth of Office plots into 10 episodes, so that both the romances and the state of the paper evolve far too quickly in so short a span of time. 


	What's odd about that is that earlier this morning, Peacock ordered a second season — the kind of deal that was surely worked out long in advance, and announced the day before the premiere to goose the hype cycle. So Daniels and the others theoretically knew they had a long runway. That said, Peacock has struggled mightily to launch successful comedies, even ones from producers of beloved Office-era sitcoms. Think Girls5Eva from the 30 Rock team and Rutherford Falls, co-created by Daniels' Parks and Rec partner Michael Schur. Old episodes of The Office have proven to be one of the biggest hits of the streaming era — Peacock arguably might not exist if NBCUniversal execs hadn't seen how well their show was doing on Netflix — but it's unclear if that loyalty will transfer to a show as tangentially related as this. (Oscar Nuñez is as dryly amusing as always, but he was never the primary, or even secondary, reason people watched the original show.) 

	











	The streamer originally planned to release all 10 episodes over a four-week window in September. Recently, that plan was changed to a binge-release this week. Is this an attempt to appeal to younger Office viewers who never watched it on linear TV and only know it as a binge? An attempt to do something different after most of Peacock's failed comedies have been weekly?

	The show's opening credits sequence features clips from various eras of people using newspapers for purposes other than actually reading them. They cover up windows during renovation projects. They wrap fish and provide padding for moving boxes. The papers even turn into a jaunty hat for a trip to the beach. It's a wry, melancholy joke about how, even in far better times for print media, newspapers could simply be viewed as a ubiquitous thing that landed on your driveway and might as well be used for something, even if not its intended purpose. Similarly, The Paper doesn't really work as a direct Office replacement, since even at its strongest, it never remotely approaches the comedic levels of its parent show. But it may at least function as a methadone-like substitute for fans who love the original but feel like they need to stop rewatching “Casino Night” and “The Lover” over and over again. 


All 10 episodes of The Paper begin streaming Sept. 4 on Peacock. I've seen the whole season.

	Sen. Susan Collins did not vote for President Donald Trump's signature piece of legislation, his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a massive package of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans financed by slashing an estimated $1 trillion from Medicaid. 


	“I did the right thing for the people of Maine, and I am proud of my no vote,” Collins told a local outlet after the bill passed in July. 


	But before she voted against it, Collins cast a critical vote to advance the legislation, which is projected to kick at least 10 million people off their health insurance — and she cast that vote just one day after private equity billionaire Steve Schwarzman, the chair of the Blackstone Group and a man who will personally reap huge rewards from the bill, kicked in $2 million toward her reelection effort.


	On June 27, Schwarzman gave $2 million to Pine Tree Results PAC, a Super PAC backing Collins; on June 28, Collins cast a decisive vote allowing Trump's bill to advance to the floor. The vote was 51-49. Vice President J.D. Vance was present at the Capitol, on hand to break a tie, but was not needed after Collins voted in favor of the bill. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The bill went on to pass the Senate just a few days later, to Schwarzman's presumed delight, since the legislation both extended the pass-through business deduction — treasured by the owners of private equity firms — and made it permanent, allowing partnerships to deduct 20 percent of their pretax income. Blackstone did not respond to a request for comment. 

	











	Ahead of the vote, the watchdog Americans for Financial Reform sent a letter urging senators to let the loophole, which was set to sunset in 2025, expire. “Pass-through income is heavily concentrated at the top, with nearly two-thirds of the deduction going to households earning over $410,000 and more than half captured by those making above $1 million,” the group wrote.


	A separate provision in the legislation made the use of private jets for business a tax write-off, another boon for both Schwarzman, a private-jet owner himself, and his firm, which has large investments in the private-jet companies, including Signature Aviation Plc, which the firm purchased for $4.7 billion in 2021.

	Collins' office strenuously objected to the idea that Schwarzman's contribution influenced her decision to advance the bill. “The notion that Sen. Collins' vote to proceed somehow helped Blackstone get this bill across the finish line is absurd. The procedural vote passed with 51 Republican Senators voting yes … As a matter of basic arithmetic, the motion to proceed would have passed without her vote,” press secretary Blake Kernen wrote in an emailed statement. “Neither of her votes had anything to do with any financial support her Super PAC received. The Super PAC is separate from the campaign operation (like all Super PACs) so the senator was not aware of this contribution until after the FEC report was filed.”


	The June vote was not the first time that Collins cast an important vote that happened to benefit Schwarzman. Back in November 2017, when Trump was pushing through his first round of tax cuts for the wealthy, Collins proposed an amendment to make child care more affordable, by making changes to the private equity industry's beloved carried interest loophole. (The tax break is particularly precious to Schwarzman, who once compared an effort to increase tax on carried interest to the Nazi invasion of Poland.)

	Reporting from ProPublica revealed that Collins dropped the amendment a day after first floating it, and she went on to support the bill, which passed the chamber, by another razor-thin margin: 51-49. At the time, Collins' spokesperson told ProPublica she dropped the amendment because of opposition from other Republicans and Democrats, and her belief that she wouldn't have been able to persuade enough of her colleagues to pass it.


	After Collins voted in favor of that bill, Schwarzman — and the private equity industry — backed her reelection in a big way. Schwarzman donated $2 million to a Super PAC that supported Collins' 2020 reelection, and he and his wife both gave maximum individual contributions to her campaign. That year, private equity executives gave more to Collins than almost any other senator.

Paris Jackson rebuffed Colman Domingo for calling her “helpful” during the production of Antoine Fuqua's Michael Jackson biopic, saying instead that her notes were ignored and that the film about her father is filled with inaccuracies and “just full-blown lies.” 


	Across several posts on Instagram Stories, Paris distanced herself from the biopic, the first part of which is set to arrive in April 2026 (no release date has been announced yet for the second part). Paris said she “read one of the first drafts of the scripts and gave my notes about what was dishonest/didn't sit right with me, and when they didn't address it I moved on with my life. Not my monkeys, not my circus.”


Paris felt compelled to speak out on the film after Domingo — who plays controversial Jackson family patriarch Joe — made some innocuous-seeming remarks about her involvement with Michael at a benefit gala during the Venice Film Festival. Domingo thanked Paris and her brother, Prince, for their guidance, saying, “They're very much in support of our film,” and that Paris had been “very helpful” during the production. (Paris was also attending the event.)

	











	After Domingo's comments got picked up, Paris responded to him directly on IG Stories: “Don't be telling people I was ‘helpful' on the set of a movie I had 0% involvement in lol that is so weird.” (A rep for Domingo did not immediately return a request for comment.) 


	But Paris focused her dissatisfaction primarily on the film itself. She said after her script notes were ignored, she decided to leave the film “alone, because it's not my project.” Of the film's veracity, she seemed to directly address her dad's fans, pointedly adding: “A big reason why I haven't said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you are going to be happy with [the movie]. Like, a big section — the film panders to a very specific section of my dad's fandom that still lives in the fantasy. And they're going to be happy with it.”

	Mentioning other major biopics like the Queen/Freddie Mercury film Bohemian Rhapsody and the Mötley Crüe adaptation of The Dirt, Paris said, “The thing about these biopics is, it's Hollywood. It's fantasyland. It's not real. But it's sold to you as real.” 


	She suggested the same thing was happening on Michael: “The narrative is being controlled. And there's a lot of inaccuracy and there's a lot of just full-blown lies. At the end of the day, that doesn't really fly with me. I don't really like dishonesty. I spoke up, I wasn't heard, I fucked off. Y'all are gonna like the fucking movie. So just, go watch it, go enjoy it, do whatever, leave me out of it.”


	Paris did not offer any specific examples of what she felt was wrong with the film or its portrayal of her father. A representative for Lionsgate, the film's production company, also did not immediately return a request for comment. And despite Paris' qualms with the film, Michael does otherwise have the backing of the Jackson estate.


Michael has faced numerous delays and controversy over the course of its beleaguered production. Filming initially wrapped in May 2024, but its original April 2025 release date was pushed until October 2025 after 22 days of reshoots were required. After that date came and went, the latest April 2026 release was announced earlier this summer.


	According to reports, the reshoots centered on the film's third act, which was set to delve into the child molestation accusations against Jackson. But Michael reportedly violated a legal agreement between representatives for Jackson and then-13-year-old Jordan Chandler, who accused Jackson of molestation in 1993 and later received a $20 million settlement. That agreement also stipulated that Chandler's story and personhood could not be dramatized in a film about Jackson.

	As it stands, the first half of Michael is set to focus on the early days of Jackson's career, from his time in the Jackson 5 to his decision to go solo after releasing Off the Wall in 1979. The second film would cover the rest of the King of Pop's career, though its third act would likely sidestep the accusations Jackson faced. 


Michael is set to star Jackson's own nephew, Jaafar Jackson, in the lead role. Along with Domingo as Joe Jackson, the cast includes Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, Laura Harrier as music executive Suzanne de Passe, and Kat Graham as Diana Ross.

Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — his law slashing taxes for the wealthy and health care for the poor — is getting a rebrand. After meeting with the president's 2024 campaign team, Republican lawmakers are now calling their law a “working families tax plan.”


	This latest name, of course, is a misnomer: The law's tax cuts are designed to disproportionately benefit the wealthy and will do little to nothing for poorer Americans. And its provisions slashing Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are expected to force millions of people off their coverage. 


Polls show the law, which GOP lawmakers named the “Big Beautiful Bill” at Trump's insistence, isn't popular with voters. Republicans seem to be ceding that point now, with the new message coming from the White House. 


	Trump's top campaign advisers held a workshop Wednesday with House Republican lawmakers and their staffers. According to an invite published by Punchbowl News, Team Trump said it would track attendance at the event, conveying that “at least one staffer per office” was expected to attend. 

	











	“I'm told House Republicans are being told by the WH to start calling TRUMP's Big Beautiful Bill the ‘Working Families Tax Cuts' Plan in order to message it to voters better ahead of midterms,” a Fox News reporter posted on X during the meeting.


	As the event ended, a New York Times reporter noted that Republican lawmakers were now describing Trump's signature legislation as a “working families tax plan.”

	











	“So we are discussing the Working Families Tax-cuts Plan!” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) posted on Wednesday. “Some call it the ‘one big beautiful bill' and the reason is that it is the absolute best tool to give WORKING FAMILIES Tax Cuts!… thank you, President Trump!”


	Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) wrote, “The working families tax plan passed this year is a huge win for everyday families across rural Arizona. Radical democrats resent it because they wanted to keep giving Medicaid to illegals.”

	Vice President J.D. Vance previewed the big, beautiful rebrand in a recent Fox News appearance, touting the administration's “incredible working families tax cuts.” In an interview with USA Today, Vance called the bill “the biggest working families tax cut in a generation.”


	In truth, Trump's second tax law is designed to give a big hand up to America's wealthiest, not working families — which might explain the messaging issue.

	The U.S. military killed 11 alleged Tren de Aragua members during a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel leaving Venezuela and suspected of carrying drugs, according to President Donald Trump. 


	In a Truth Social Post on Tuesday, Trump said that on his orders, the military “conducted a kinetic strike” while “the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.” He posted a video of what appeared to be a small boat carrying a group of people bursting into flames, and said that no U.S. personnel were harmed in the strike.


	Trump also accused President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela of controlling Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. designated as a terrorist group in February. The Department of Justice is offering a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro and has accused the Venezuelan president of violating U.S. narcotics laws.


	“We just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug-carrying boat, a lot of drugs in that boat,” he told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, per Reuters. “And there's more where that came from. We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country, coming in for a long time … These came out of Venezuela.”

	











	Maduro previously warned that he would respond to any U.S. military action with an “armed fight” and claimed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was attempting to pull Trump into a war in the Caribbean. “Mr. President, Donald Trump,” the Venezuelan president said on Monday, per The New York Times, “watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood.”

	As the Associated Press reports, the U.S. government is increasing its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat what it says are threats from drug cartels, ed. In turn, the Venezuelan government deployed troops along its coast and border with Colombia, and has encouraged Venezuelans to join a volunteer militia.


	Maduro has also accused the Trump administration of trying to force him from office, and told reporters on Monday that if Venezuela was attacked by U.S. forces in the Caribbean, he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms.”

	In December 2006, Taylor Swift spent around three hours serenading a crowd of about 45 people at Jeff Jarrett's home in Tennessee. In a recent interview with TMZ Sports, WWE Hall of Famer recalled the “amazing experience” where the singer-songwriter, who had recently released her self-titled debut featuring “Tim McGraw,” hosted an impromptu private concert for his family a few months before his wife died.


	“It was Christmas of 2006. My first wife [Jill Gregory] was really ill with breast cancer. She passed away about five months after this, so she was really ill,” Jarrett said. Swift was a family friend who often babysat their young daughters. They were the ones who set the show in motion. “The girls wanted her to sing and play,” he continued, noting that Swift had to “actually run back home” to grab her guitar. 


	“She kind of bonded with the family, specifically with the girls,” Jarrett said. Swift continued to show up for the family after Gregory died. “What a very cool relationship that developed. When my wife passed away, Taylor would come around, and was really good with the girls.”

	Jarrett keeps in touch with Swift's father, Scott Swift, and is rooting for Swift and her fiancé, Travis Kelce. “It's very cool to see this side of Taylor,” he said. “She's early 30s, and I can just see little kids running around when Scott and Andrea have grand babies.

Paper clippings of a UFO sighting in Rendlesham.

Unexplained aerial phenomena, commonly branded as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) and more recently as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), remain one of history's most enduring enigmas.

While most sightings are dismissed as misidentifications or atmospheric oddities, a select few stand apart – defying scientific and governmental scrutiny and leaving behind more questions than answers. These are cases with solid physical evidence, radar confirmation, or witnessed by military and aviation professionals.

Let's delve into the 11 most compelling UFO sightings across the globe – incidents with documentation, official investigation, and mysteries that have persisted for decades despite analysis.

In November 2004, off the coast of San Diego, multiple US Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz Strike Group spotted a white object resembling a Tic Tac breath mint, maneuvering in ways that defied aerodynamics. It had rapid acceleration, abrupt stops, instant turns – with no visible propulsion. The object was moving in the area for around an hour.

The Pentagon officially corroborated these sightings in 2020. Commander David Fravor, a primary witness, described the object's physics-defying movement as “not like anything I'd ever seen”.

Japanese Airlines cargo pilot Kenju Terauchi, a veteran aviator, observed a strange phenomenon in the skies of Alaska while flying the JAL Flight 1628. Alongside his team, he encountered three UFOs for nearly fifty minutes.

Apart from Terauchi and his two crew members, the incident was also witnessed by civilian and radar operators, and later investigated by FAA officials. The FAA Division Chief, John Callahan, confirmed the radar evidence of the encounter and preserved copies of the data.

While the case garnered global acclaim, Captain Terauchi was demoted to a desk job for 'embarrassing' the airline, only to be reinstated later. The FAA briefing was officially buried, but Callahan retained evidence, later sharing it publicly as one of the strongest radar-verified UFO cases in history.

Stefan Michalak, a mechanic and amateur geologist, faced the most extraordinary incident of his life. He encountered a strange disc-shaped craft near Falcon Lake, Manitoba. However, the moment he approached it, Michalak was burned by a blast of hot gas through a grid-like vent. The blast left a grid pattern of burns on his chest and stomach.

While Michalak was the only witness, many others, including RCMP officers, doctors, US Air Force, and Canadian authorities, investigated the incident. The soil, clothing, and metal samples from the site tested radioactive.

Michalak's encounter went on to become a national sensation, documented as one of Canada's most famous, unexplained UFO encounters.

Often dubbed as Britain's Roswell, the Rendlesham Forest Incident became one of the U.K.'s most famous UFO cases, also garnering acclaim worldwide. In late December 1980, US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge saw strange lights descending into the forest.

The officials entered the woods and stumbled upon a metallic, glowing object. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, they witnessed flashing lights, hovering star-like objects, and recorded radiation readings.

Halt filed a memo and made a real-time audio recording during their investigation, now famously known as the ‘Halt Tape'. The officials also discovered that the radiation levels were ten times the normal background level during tests.

On October 4, 1967, residents in the village of Shag Harbor noticed strange orange lights in the night sky. Five teenagers witnessed these lights fluctuating in sequence, suddenly diving at a 45-degree angle toward the water's surface.

Surprisingly, the lights didn't sink into the water but seemed floating on it. A joint Navy, RCMP(Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and Coast Guard underwater search ensued after the residents reported this incident as an air crash.

However, the concerned authorities found no traces of a crashed aircraft. The Rescue Coordination Center later confirmed this fact, and the case was referred to as a UFO in the Government of Canada documents. To date, it remains one of Canada's most celebrated UFO cases.

Thousands of residents across Phoenix and other locations across Arizona were baffled when they witnessed a huge V-shaped UFO pass the night sky on March 13, 1997. People from various locations reported seeing the UFO moving silently across the sky.

About two hours later, the US Air Force dropped military flares in the sky, with rumors stating this was an attempt to cover up and discredit the UFO incident that occurred earlier in the evening.

Former Arizona Governor Fife Symington III later said, “I can say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I'd ever seen. And it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares don't fly in formation.”

During the 30th and 31st March in 1990, hundreds of residents across the Wallonia region of Belgium witnessed a strange, triangular formation of lights moving across the night sky. Many eyewitnesses described these craft-like objects as having three bright lights at each vertex and a central, red, pulsating light.

The Belgian Air Force used two F-16 fighter jets to intercept these objects, but the pilots couldn't make visual contact with the objects. The reason was that these unidentified objects descended from high altitudes of over 10,000 feet to as low as 500 feet in seconds.

The government was forced to acknowledge the anomalies officially, despite the lack of logical explanations regarding the sightings.

On April 6, 1966, more than 200 students and several teachers in the Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a grey, saucer-shaped object that was about twice the size of a family car. The mysterious craft hovered around the school for approximately 20 minutes, descending into a nearby field.

A few Australian skeptics tried dismissing the object as an experimental military aircraft. Still, the Air Force reported that they were not in the airspace at the time of the incident. Others tried to dismiss it as a massive balloon that happened to hover around the school.

In the aftermath, a few men in dark suits arrived at the school, warning eyewitnesses to never speak about the incident again.

On September 19, 1976, two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom II jets scrambled to intercept a luminous unidentified object over Tehran. Both jets saw their weapons and communications systems go haywire when they closed on the object. The functionality came back to normal only when they withdrew from the object.

Hundreds of civilians, including pilots, military officials, and ground observers across Tehran, witnessed this phenomenon. The US Defence Intelligence Agency compiled a four-page report, which was later sent to the White House, CIA, NSA, and Pentagon for analysis.

The event was labelled as one of the most credible military UFO encounters, and also became the subject of an Iranian film. Retired General Parviz Jafari testified about it publicly at the 2007 National Press Club conference in Washington, D.C.

On September 16, 1994, 60 children at the Ariel school in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, claimed they saw a hovering craft and strange creatures with black eyes in the school yard during recess.

Many described receiving a telepathic message warning humanity about harming the planet. The mass sighting drew international attention when Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack traveled to Africa to interview the children, later calling it one of the most credible UFO encounters ever.

Decades on, some witnesses remain visibly shaken, recalling trauma and vivid memories. However, the case continues to stand out as one of the largest collective sightings in modern history.

On April 24, 1964, Socorro police officer Lonnie Zamora witnessed a speeding vehicle when he heard a roar and saw a bluish-orange flame in the sky. Through investigation, he discovered an egg-shaped craft perched in an arroyo, flanked by two figures in white coveralls.

As Zamora came closer to the object within 150 years, the object lifted off with a roar and disappeared. It left behind scorch marks, indentations in the ground, and burned vegetation.

The Air Force took this case seriously under Project Blue Book, officially classifying it as ‘unexplained' after finding no evidence of a hoax.

Despite advanced aerospace technology and decades of investigation, these cases stubbornly resist ordinary explanation.

What singles them out is not a lack of skepticism but an abundance of credible data – diverse witnesses, physical traces, and repeated failure by authorities ot solve the mystery.

These cases remain the gold standard for UFO phenomena amidst growing government transparency and international interest. They raise unanswerable questions today, as when these UFOs first breached our skies.

Was it aliens, a top-secret government test balloon, or just “hyped up kids” spreading a wild tale of a flying saucer?

Was it aliens, a top-secret government test balloon, or just “hyped up kids” spreading a wild tale of a flying saucer buzzing their playground?

Nearly 60 years on from the incident that has been dubbed “Australia's Rowell”, the federal government is facing fresh calls to come clean on what it knows about the world-famous Westall UFO mystery.

Next year will mark the 60th anniversary of the incident known as Australia's largest mass UFO sighting. It's been the subject of documentaries, books and countless news articles and YouTube videos, with scores of witnesses sharing their stories over the years.

But six decades on, the ageing former students have never been given an official answer about what they saw — or why they were told to keep quiet.

“They just want to know what it was and why they were told to shut up about it,” said UFO researcher Grant Lavac, who has created a petition to parliament calling for an independent inquiry into the Westall incident.

On Wednesday, April 6, 1966, at around 11am, more than 200 students, teachers and members of the public observed three “metallic discs” or “flying saucers” with no obvious markings moving silently through the sky over Westall High School and Westall State School in Clayton South, about 25km southeast of the Melbourne CBD.

It was just before recess when a girl came running into the Year 9 science class of a young teacher, Andrew Greenwood, 20.

“This student bolted into the classroom and said, ‘Mr Greenwood, Mr Greenwood, there's a flying saucer outside!' The recess bell rang and there was a mass exodus of students onto the sports oval,” said Mr Lavac.

Witnesses claim they watched as one of the objects descended towards a wooded area about 1km south of the school, known as The Grange.

The object landed among the pine trees before quickly flying away, leaving large circles of flattened grass with well-defined, discoloured edges behind.

Mr Lavac, who spoke to a number of witnesses for a 2023 YouTube documentary, noted they “all very compellingly recalled that what they saw was not a weather balloon” but rather a classic “flying saucer in the shape of two saucers up-ended and turned facing each other”.

Marilyn Eastwood was 13 when she watched the three objects as she stood on the school sports oval.

“Kids were screaming and so forth, get out into the oval and there was flying saucers,” she told Mr Lavac. “Looked up in the air and there was one just hovering in the playground.”

She said she was among the group of kids who ran over to The Grange.

“I saw where it actually landed, the grass was flattened in a circular area,” she said.

“The speed that these flying saucers moved at was incredible. It was just unbelievable. Straight up and gone — vertical, horizontal, gone. Just amazing.”

Joy Clarke was 12 at the time and vividly remembers the events of that day.

“I was in class when students rushed in and told us the story,” she told news.com.au in 2016. “We rushed down to the oval and I saw three flying saucers on that day. My personal belief is they weren't of this world. They were definitely from somewhere else because I have never seen anything like it all.”

Ms Clarke said the army and police then arrived.

“We were told we were hysterical and it didn't happen, while men in black interviewed some of the other kids,” she said.

Terry Peck was playing cricket on the school oval when she saw the saucer and decided to chase it to The Grange.

“I was about six metres away from it,” she told the Herald Sun.

“It was bigger than a car and circular. I think I saw some lights underneath it. Two girls were there before me. One was terribly upset and they were pale, really white, ghostly white. They just said they had passed out, fainted. One was taken to hospital in an ambulance.”

Every year on April 6, a number of Westall witnesses gather for a reunion at The Grange.

“They use it as an opportunity to share memories and keep them alive, but also to voice their frustration that the government has not provided an official explanation for what they observed,” Mr Lavac said.

“More importantly they want to know why they were told to shut up about it.”

In the hours after the sighting, the area was flooded with emergency services, military personnel and media outlets.

The Dandenong Journal ran with coverage of the incident on its front page for consecutive issues and Nine News also reported the story on its 6pm bulletin.

Speaking to the Greater Dandenong Leader in 2005, former Year 10 student Ken Stallard described watching the 20-metre round craft fly over the school.

“So many of us saw it,” Mr Stallard said.

“It never occurred to us that it didn't happen or was an optical illusion. If it was, it was a pretty good optical illusion. It was 1966 … the space race was at its best. It was a mysterious time.”

Witnesses have consistently claimed they were told privately and collectively not to speak about the incident.

“Shortly after the incident an ad hoc assembly was called and the headmaster told all the students, ‘You're not to say anything about this event, you're not to talk about it,' essentially saying ‘shut up',” Mr Lavac said.

“That was reiterated individually to a number of students individually by people they thought were government officials or members of the military. That has been a source of their frustration for so long.”

Jacqueline Argent said she was one of the first three kids over the fence to look for the UFO landing site.

“Originally I thought it must have been an experimental-type aircraft, but nothing has emerged like that after all these years,'' she told the Herald Sun.

Ms Argent claims she was called into the headmaster's office and interrogated by three men immediately following the incident.

“They had good-quality suits and were well-spoken,” she said.

“They said, ‘I suppose you saw little green men.' I spoke to my parents about it at the time and they were pretty outraged.''

In 2021, Mr Greenwood came forward publicly for the first time, confirming he also witnessed the objects — and claiming he was “threatened” to keep quiet.

“I can remember running out into the oval, looking into the sky, and seeing these things, and just standing there absolutely transfixed,” Mr Greenwood told Seven's Spotlight.

“I haven't seen anything in my life like it before, haven't seen anything since.”

However Mr Greenwood, who passed away earlier this year, had a different recollection to the students. “It was a grey, almost cylindrical or cigar shaped object which moved with some degree of precision in the sky,” he said.

According to Mr Greenwood, two weeks later he was visited by two senior Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officers, one in a uniform and the other in a civilian suit.

He claimed the men threatened his job if he spoke about what he saw.

“Absolutely, I was threatened,” he said. “I was told that I should not say anything about it.”

Mr Greenwood said it “beggars belief for me, in Australia we've never had an official investigation and, flatly, I think there has been a cover-up”.

“I think someone has buried the Department of Supply report which I know exists,” he said.

In his petition, Mr Lavac writes that “allegations of a government cover-up, including the rapid response of military personnel, confiscation of evidence, witness intimidation and nondisclosure of a comprehensive report compiled by the then Department of Supply” warrant an investigation.

“Despite the risks posed to people, property and safety of flight, no official explanation has ever been provided by the government as to the source, identify and intent of what was observed at Westall,” he writes.

He has called on the RAAF to revisit its long-held position since 1996 that it sees “no scientific or other compelling reason” to investigate or collect reports of UFOs, now referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).

“As this continues to be the official position of the Department of Defence today, an investigation may help inform a formal review of this long-held position,” he writes.

The petition has attracted more than 350 signatures. If a petition reaches more than 50 signatures, it is usually forwarded to the relevant minister for a response.

Defence Minister Richard Marles has been contacted for comment.

Hazel Edwards was an English and maths teacher at Westall High on the day of the incident and believes it has been blown out of proportion.

The self-proclaimed sceptic suggests overly excited kids made up the story and were responsible for the media hype.

“I think there were a lot of kids that were hyped up,” she told news.com.au in 2016.

“Look at the so-called evidence, most of it is just hearsay.”

Although federal and state government agencies refused to comment about the incident at the time, government documents unearthed in 2014 offer an explanation for the sighting.

The documents revealed a secret radiation-testing project known as the HIBAL program — a joint US-Australian initiative developed to monitor atmospheric radiation levels using large silver balloons equipped with sensors between 1960 and 1969.

Each balloon was equipped with a 180kg payload and was followed by a light aircraft tasked with tracking it and triggering its 12-metre parachute via radio signal.

UFO researcher Keith Basterfield said examinations of the documents held by the National Archives and former Department of Supply indicate the mysterious flying object may have been a test balloon that was blown off course after being launched from Mildura.

“My hypothesis is that the incident involved not a UFO, but a high-altitude balloon, its parachute and large payload,” he told News Corp in 2016.

“The Westall object was described as being a white/silver colour which could describe the colour of an HIBAL balloon or parachute.”

Mr Lavac said if that explanation were true, “surely if it's classified 60 years later that is now not the case”. 

“And if it is prosaic, whether it was a high-altitude balloon or some other technology that was being tested, why doesn't the government come out and admit what it was?” he said.

“If it was something that was maybe not prosaic, it's a compelling reason for the RAAF to consider devoting resources to the investigation and reporting of UAP.”

Long gone are the Cold War days of nations competing to be the first to get their man on the Moon. Now there's a different, much more permanent goal.

The expedition will help NASA establish a human presence outside Earth, marking a first for the nation in Aussie space exploration.

Australia will experience a rare ‘black moon' this weekend – but the celestial phenomenon comes with a catch for eager stargazers.

THE CONJURING: LAST RIGHTS is frequently pretty effective in that it accomplishes what it sets out to do: create a creepy atmosphere and make you involuntarily spasm when a loud noise or a scary face flashes onto the screen. The problem, for me, is that I'm simply not that interested in what it's setting out to do.

This is also how I felt back in 2013 after reviewing the first film in the series—which followed Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as paranormal investigators trying to save a family from the vengeful spirit of a baby-killing witch—leading to me more or less ignoring the two sequels, the three movies in the Annabelle spinoff series, the two Nun movies, and The Curse of La Llorona. Enormously successful series! I do not begrudge the studio or the creatives their success, nor the audiences their scares. Just not for me.

The Conjuring: Last Rites opens with a flashback to the birth of Ed and Lorraine's daughter (played by Mia Tomlinson as an adult). While investigating a spoooooky mirror, a demon reaches out and touches the very pregnant Lorraine, who is shocked into an early birth. At first, it looks as though the demon has claimed the soul of the baby, but fear not: She lives. And she has her mother's ability to see evil spirits.

Two decades later, the spooooooky mirror shows up again, this time in the home of the Smurl family. One of the Smurl daughters receives it as a gift following her first communion and weird things immediately begin happening: a light fixture collapses, wounding one of the children; an evil presence starts pulling on telephone cords; and grown men start levitating on beds. Needless to say, the Warrens will be called in to help.

But it takes a very long time for them to be called in, and this is The Conjuring: Last Rites's biggest weakness. Yes, it does all the jump-scare stuff perfectly adequately, and yes, those moments are sprinkled in at appropriately timed intervals. (I imagine producer James Wan, who worked on most of the movies in this franchise as well as most of the Saw movies, has a big chart somewhere in his office mapping out precisely when and where these heart-rate spikes need to appear to maximize terror depending on the run time.) It just feels like everyone's spinning their wheels for a while as the Smurls suffer their torments and the Warrens meet their daughter's boyfriend.

One rarely profits by considering the logic behind anything that happens in a movie like this—the answer as to why one thing works when another thing doesn't is, roughly, “magic,” which is never satisfying—but I will say that I couldn't really figure out the “rules” for any of the hauntings or how to disperse them and banish the spirits back to hell, or wherever. It's not obvious to me why some hauntings affect everyone while the visions encountered by Lorraine and her daughter are made to simply disappear by closing her eyes and wishing them away. Nor is it particularly obvious why the Bible verses that do, eventually, dispel the evil spirits work when they work, and why they weren't invoked earlier.

Share

I don't mean to be difficult and it is, perhaps, beside the point—again, director Michael Chaves is very good at the whole “look up and see a scary face thing,” which is harder than it sounds to pull off—but I found myself wondering on at least two separate occasions precisely why a character was dangling from a noose. The mechanics of possession are never thoroughly explained, it all just kind of happens.

But then, what is life but a series of things happening? The things that happen in The Conjuring: Last Rites are appropriate for the film and the mood it's trying to set. And this is the paranormal, after all. Ghosts and ghouls and demons are, by their nature, mysterious. Perhaps we shouldn't ask too much of the story.

Besides: Who needs rules when we've got spooky, rotten faces to shove on the screen?

There was a brief moment in “The Departed,” where Vera and Matt Damon flirt when I wished they could whisk themselves away to a different movie where their spark could ignite into a romance. That magnetism between the actors is sorely missed during these anti-romantic times.

Exclusive: Director Michael Chaves had his own spooky encounter when filming The Conjuring: Last Rites 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Despite making many scary movies over his career, The Conjuring: Last Rites director Michael Chaves says he was never really a big believer in the supernatural, that is, until he had his first paranormal experience whilst filming the new horror movie.

""We shot [The Conjuring: Last Rites] in London, and I actually stayed in a haunted house. And I was, honestly, mostly, entirely a skeptic before shooting this movie,"" says Chaves to GamesRadar+. The director added that he and his family were staying at an ""old vicarage"" at the time of filming, which is the name given to a house where a vicar lives or once lived, as provided by the church.

""So my daughter one day showed me a picture on her iPad,"" continues Chaves. ""It was like a picture down the hall, and she was like, Do you see the man in the hall? It was kind of like shadowy, and there was like a mirror there, which obviously was kind of like in the movie. And I'm like, 'Sweetie, you're probably listening to me making the movie,' because I'm looking at it. I'm like, I can't see the figure or anything.""

 




However, Chaves didn't remain a skeptic for long. ""So everyone leaves to see a show. The whole house is empty… This place is like, over 200 years old. I wouldn't be surprised, 300 years old. This was, like, you know, super old Harry Potter house. I'm downstairs. I'm playing video games. It's totally quiet, and I hear voices. I hear male voices."" In a bid to find out who was talking, Chaves says he turned off the TV and looked outside, around the house, to find the culprit. But there was no one there.

""I hear it, and it sounds like it's coming from inside the house… It's like articulated, like two male voices talking to each other. Went through every room in the house, and there was, like, no one there, but literally, the spookiest experience I ever had,"" adds Chaves. ""And honestly, it was like the combination of that and then working with the Smurl sisters on the film… I am totally a believer after it, 100%”

Chaves has been involved with the franchise for many years, directing both The Nun and The Nun 2, as well as The Conjuring 3, aka The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, and The Curse of La Llorona. However, with a decade of making horror films under his belt, it seems fitting that the Warrens' final on-screen outing would bring Chaves' first ghostly encounter.

NASA has recently presented a statement that has caused great anticipation in the scientific and astronomical fields. Far from focusing on the Red Planet, this time the American space agency has turned its attention to another celestial body. Researchers have made progress regarding the possible existence of extraterrestrial life on a planet other than Mars, which changes ideas about where to search for life beyond Earth.

The surprising news has centered around Ceres, the dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. NASA has confirmed that this small planet shows clear signs of having had favorable conditions for life billions of years ago. It is important to note that, although it is not a large planet, Ceres has proven to contain chemical and energetic elements that could have supported simple organisms in a distant past.

The most recent study, published last August 20 and led by researcher Sam Courville, has produced surprising results. Scientists have used advanced thermal and chemical models to simulate the interior evolution of the dwarf planet over an extensive period. The data indicate that Ceres's subsurface had hot water and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, elements linked to environments favorable for microbial life on Earth.

These findings have not come in isolation, since in 2018 NASA's Dawn mission confirmed the presence of frozen water and salts on Ceres's surface. The brightest areas detected on the dwarf planet are the result of saline deposits, clear signs of hydrothermal activity that expelled liquids from the interior. Therefore, the existence of a continuous flow of hot fluids supports the hypothesis of an environment capable of sustaining life.

Sam Courville himself has explained that, on Earth, the mixture of hot water of underground origin with other compounds in the ocean creates an ideal ecosystem for microorganisms. This way, scientists firmly believe that Ceres could have had similar conditions in its history, which broadens the perspective of where to search for life beyond our planet. This approach opens new avenues for future explorations and space missions dedicated to confirming or ruling out the existence of extraterrestrial organisms.

Ceres is a cold and dry dwarf planet, where current conditions prevent the existence of liquid water. Its interior still generates some heat due to radioactive decay, but it is not enough to keep habitable environments on the surface. Thus, although today it is an inhospitable world, its past could have been very different.

This new focus on Ceres challenges the traditional search for extraterrestrial life centered on Mars and other larger planets. The evidence gathered so far suggests that even smaller bodies can harbor the necessary conditions for the existence of life. Thus, NASA and other scientific institutions will intensify their efforts to study these lesser-known worlds, seeking clues that could answer one of humanity's deepest questions.

After days of speculation that Trump had kicked the bucket, his much-anticipated first press conference ended in an underwhelming damp squib. The Big Orange Baby, not officially seen in person for a week, decided to tell the world that the US's Space Command “will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City”.

The unexpected move means the new phase of a multi-year “turf war” between new-home Alabama and the Space Command's former HQ in Colorado, a Democrat-controlled state. Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville tweeted of the occasion: ""For FOUR YEARS, I have fought to get U.S. Space Command moved to its SELECTED home at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.

“Thank you, President Trump and Secretary [Pete] Hegseth, for reversing Joe Biden's political cronyism and restoring MERIT and INTEGRITY to this process.”

The US Space Command is a military branch that was first founded in 1985, then relaunched by President Trump in 2019 as one of six military armed forces in the United States, with a special interest in extraterrestrial warfare.

The decision was made to bring the agency back following fears of new space technologies being developed by the US's international arch-enemies in Russia and China. In 2024, the latter launched its own space force scheme, the “People's Liberation Army Aerospace Force”, to up the ante. They are currently the only two space force military branches in the world.

The Space Command's mission, according to its own press releases, is to make sure the US can “fight and win on future battlefields” in the atmosphere and to “preserve peace, assure our freedoms, and guarantee the sovereignty of the United States for future generations.”

There are approximately 1,700 people directly employed by the Space Command's headquarters, and a further 18,000 military and civilian personnel under its authority.

Although it does not currently command “soldiers in space,” it oversees satellites, ground stations, radars, and control centres that support missions like GPS navigation, satellite communications, missile warning, and space surveillance.

Since the agency was relaunched in 2019, the question of where to put its headquarters has been at the heart of fierce debate. Originally, the Space Command was kept in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where the Space Command had been historically headquartered.

In January 2021, at the end of Trump's first term, the Air Force identified Huntsville in Alabama, a Republican state, as a potential new home and plans were made to relocate.

But, in 2023, President Biden cancelled the call, claiming the move would “hurt military readiness” – a move that Republicans criticised as politically-motivated and partisan.

A review in April 2025 by a Trump-controlled Defense Department determined that no reason could be established for Biden's decision and, yesterday, Trump confirmed that his predecessor's call would be reversed and that the Space Command will be finding a sweet home in Alabama.

Trump continued on the move: “The problem I have with Colorado, one of the big problems, [is that] they do mail-in voting. So they have automatically crooked elections.”

His announcement comes at the end of wild media speculation regarding his health and even possible death, with yesterday's news conference being his first public appearance in a week.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- ""The Conjuring"" universe comes to a close with one final spine-chilling case.

Based on real life events, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as Ed and Lorraine Warren in ""The Conjuring: Last Rites.""

For more than a decade, they brought the characters to life.

But this case is personal. It's not just about saving a family. It's about protecting their own.

Set in the 1980s, the Warrens have retired from paranormal investigating. But when the Smearle family becomes the target of a vengeful demon with a decades old grudge, Ed and Lorraine are forced back into action.

""For us, for me, what just makes this and for everyone, what will make this the ultimate is that this isn't just any old demon that the Warrens are dealing with. Like, we're dealing with something really sordid, that's got a score to settle with these particular two,"" Farmiga said. ""Like, this demon has had a history with the Warrens. It's got a bone to pick. It's cult it's come to its due. You know, we're not just dealing with some random evil that's just like after random souls.

This demon has a personal vendetta against these two. So, the stakes are higher than they've ever been.""

""Early on, it was every case that Lorraine took on and what it did to her emotionally, physically. And so you're always weighing the cost of these cases. But, I think it's the love and the relationship that has been the continual thread,"" Wilson said. ""So when we come back to it, because we'll all be different and the fears will all be different and all of that. But it's this. Alright. Where are you? Are you that one? Are you that one?""

""Yes,"" Farmiga said.

""It's that,"" Wilson said.

They have heard their share of interesting stories over the years from people who associate the stars with this franchise.

""I mean, we picked Lorraine's brain when she was alive, and, and, you know, we were friends with her and we would visit with her before every conjuring. And we would just, I mean, you know, we would hear after story after story. We would hear tapes, you know, that Tony Spear would play for us,"" Farmiga said. ""And it's just ludicrous what went down from, like, the smells they would encounter to the audio that they would encounter, and it's just outlandish. And it's like one of those things where there's so many crazy stories. I mean, thank God I've never encountered and I never want it because I don't need to, like, see it to believe it or smell it or hear it to believe it.""

""People will jokingly, you know, say I need you to come over and I'm dumb enough to probably think that I could handle it and it helped them. Naïve,"" Wilson said.

""Now I feel like I could, like, handle a situation if I have to,"" Farmiga said.

""Well, sure,"" Wilson said.

""I think in complete delusion, I bet you I could,"" Farmiga said.

Let's just hope no one has to find out.

PAN-India star Prabhas will soon head to Greece to shoot the pending songs of The Raja Saab. After wrapping up this romantic horror entertainer, the actor will move on to Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Spirit. It is well known that Prabhas plays a cop in this big-ticket film, while Animal fame Triptii Dimri plays the female lead.

Bollywood Hungama has now made a surprising claim about the Prabhas starrer in its recent report. The media outlet described Sandeep Vanga's directorial as an eerie supernatural thriller on the lines of M. Night Shyamalan's films. Earlier, many reports suggested that Spirit would be an intense action drama revolving around a cop who goes after an international crime syndicate, but this latest claim is completely contradictory.

Fans are now wondering why the actor would take up another horror film immediately after The Raja Saab. Pranay Reddy Vanga, in association with T-Series, will bankroll the project, while Harshavardhan Rameshwar will compose the music.","{'href': 'https://www.123telugu.com', 'title': '123telugu.com'}","other"

The couple welcomed their son Royce in August 2022, followed by their son Rowen in March 2025

 Matt Fraser is expecting another little one!


 The psychic medium, 34, and his wife Alexa, 27, are expecting their third baby together, announcing the exciting news exclusively with PEOPLE. The expectant mother is currently 18 weeks pregnant and expecting their new addition in February 2026.


 Fraser, who already shares sons Rowan, 5 months, and Royce, 3, with his wife, tells PEOPLE that the news of a third child is a dream come true.


 ""I have seen God working in serious ways, and it's amazing to now witness it happening in my own life,"" he says. ""Alexa and I have always talked about how beautiful it would be to have three children, and I always dreamed of having them by the time I turned 35, so I could enjoy every single moment with them.""


Kelsi-Mariah Oresman

 Echoing her husband's sentiments, Alexa says that while they've always wanted three children, she ""didn't think it would come so quickly.""


 “We've always known we wanted at least three children, we just didn't think it would come so quickly! It was a bit of a shock getting a positive pregnancy test only two months postpartum, but we knew right away what a blessing it is,"" she tells PEOPLE. ""Having children has been such an exciting chapter together, and although we're in the thick of it, the love in our house is overflowing.""


 Fraser admits to PEOPLE that he felt a mixture of emotions when he first heard the news.


 ""At first, I was scared, anxious, and overwhelmed. I'm the type of person who likes everything planned and thought out,"" he explains. ""But, once I processed what was happening, I realized this was the greatest blessing of all. God was giving us exactly what we had prayed for — everything we ever wanted.""

 The soon-to-be dad of three shares that he's already thought about some of the more practical things that come with having another baby, like whether the car is big enough or if there's enough room at the dining room table. However, he continues to be reminded that there's no perfect way to raise a child.


 ""I've learned that nobody wrote the book on parenting,"" he says. ""You learn as you go. You make mistakes. You grow, and, most importantly, you learn to trust and enjoy the journey. What felt unexpected at first quickly became the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Now I'm embracing this moment fully and have been in complete bliss ever since.”


 The couple will soon have three children under 5, and Alexa tells PEOPLE that although they have been busy, they've ""never been so fulfilled.""


 ""Yes, there are fingerprints everywhere, Goldfish in our couch cushions, and little feet running everywhere, but we wouldn't want it any other way,"" she shares. ""The boys are already growing so fast, so we are taking in every minute, and we can't wait to give them yet another sibling this next year. I can't wait to see the dynamic between the three kids!""

Check for daily updates on your sun sign

Moon phases, seasons, and other current happenings

I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway.

On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights.

I was most impressed by the Nebula reviews on the Apple Store, where the popular pick has collected 160,000+ ratings with an overall 4.6-star rating. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past?

Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. (FYI, some people might refer to asknebula reviews due to the brand's domain! Don't worry—they're the same company!)

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. It's transaction-based with various payment options available. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more.

The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. 

Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Before you select which person you'd like to chat with, you can view their profile with a breakdown of their years of experience, number of consultations, user reviews, and an overall rating out of five stars. You'll also see their cost per minute.

The Nebula app is free to download, while the website is free to visit. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience. 

When you sign up, you get a free 3-day trial, but it's important to know that you'll start getting charged for your subscription once the trial ends. Choose a weekly subscription for $7.99 per week, a monthly subscription for $39.99, or an annual subscription for $49.99.

While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose.

In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience.

When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc.).

From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings.

Horoscopes

The Horoscopes tab is where you'll find the most in-depth information on your own. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute!). 

Per its name, this is also the tab where you'll find your personalized horoscope for today, yesterday, tomorrow, the week, the month, or the year. In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. 

Similarly, the weekly horoscope will highlight your focus of the week and your monthly horoscope will highlight a focus of the month (e.g. ‘reflect and flow'), along with favorable days and challenging days for the month. 

The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms).

If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. 

Psychics

The Psychics tab is fairly straight forward. This is where you'll head if you want to start a one-on-one chat with a psychic. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc.).

If you start a chat with someone, your chat will live in the Chatroom tab. Otherwise, that tab will be empty.

Compatibility

The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Your own details will already be entered in there, but you'll need to add your partner (or potential partner or friend or family member!) and input their birth date, time, and place. 

Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. 

Readings

Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips.

My Nebula Astrology Review

The astrology side of the Nebula stood out to me immediately. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me. 

I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) has the exact same prediction for the day, week, year, etc. 

That's what I really love about Nebula. Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. It's not just about your birth month and date; it's about what year, month, day, and time you were born, and where. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. 

I also loved that I could actually see my full birth chart in detail. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. You can keep things high-level, or continue clicking through each element to learn more and more. I think I spent a full hour in the app the first time I opened it, and I was in the horoscopes tab the entire time.

After that first day, I continued to come back daily to read my horoscope. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day.

I also played around with the Compatibility tab, as I'd like to think any normal 30-something might. I entered my current partner's details and then followed up with everyone I've ever dated and all my best friends and family members. And yes, I even tested it with people I don't get along with so well. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on.

My Nebula Psychic Review

The one-on-one psychic chats were my second favorite part of the Nebula app, but I still appreciated the option. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom.

There are pros and cons to each! The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info.

Russia, even after the end of hostilities against Ukraine, will continue its information and psychological operations. The enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army,  stated Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.

""The next challenges we must be ready for after the fighting ends are how to protect our informational, humanitarian, historical, and value-based frontiers. Because even if one day the guns fall silent, the enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army, and this war will definitely continue,"" Yusov warned.

He emphasized that history often becomes intertwined with geopolitics, posing a significant challenge for Ukraine. According to Yusov, Russia's war against Ukraine has shown that the Geneva Conventions and international security mechanisms are ineffective.

""Our duty is to make them effective. This can be achieved through systematic informational work: exposing the truth, countering Russian propaganda, and documenting the war crimes of the aggressor state,"" he added.

In March, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, emphasized that Russia is expanding its PSYOPS units to influence Western countries. In particular, Moscow seeks to sow disappointment in NATO and promote the idea that cooperation with Russia is possible.","{'href': 'https://newsukraine.rbc.ua', 'title': 'RBC-Ukraine'}","other"

Q: 

“I'm just a patsy,” claimed Lee Harvey Oswald, President John F Kennedy's killer, on November 22, 1963. It was a phrase that launched a thousand conspiracy theories, helped by the fact that Oswald never had to flesh out his argument since he was murdered on live television two days later.

Oswald is not a character in William Boyd's latest Cold War thriller, but his words seem to reverberate in the plot, which takes place in that same fateful year in 1963. For the novel's hero, Gabriel Dax, a 33-year-old English travel writer turned spy for MI6, “I'm just a patsy” is less a desperate excuse and more of a sickening realisation. 

“He felt like some sort of indentured servant — wash the dishes in the scullery and then mop the floors upstairs,” Dax thinks after receiving orders from Faith Green, his bewitching handler. He would rather be off writing a florid book about the world's great rivers, yet here he is interviewing foreign dignitaries and relaying secret messages for purposes he can only dimly comprehend.

Dax's adventures are comfortingly retro with their Sixties world of telegrams and payphones, femmes fatales and hefty book advances, and fortified by near-constant drinking and smoking. Boyd also adds a grimy comic edge, perhaps inspired by the flatulent imagination of Mick Herron in his Slow Horses series; here, agents take their target practice lessons on a chicken farm in Leyton, while a hardback travel guide becomes a bludgeon in a pinch. 

• Read more book reviews and interviews — and see what's top of the Sunday Times Bestsellers List

The Predicament is the second in a planned trilogy after Boyd's 2024 novel Gabriel's Moon, and contains a host of predicaments for Dax. First, there are his efforts to keep a British triple agent safe in Moscow, which mainly involves spending the Russians' money “extravagantly” so they think he is on their side. Then there is his successful literary career, which is suddenly under threat after an older writer, one of his heroes, sues him for plagiarism. 

Dax's biggest source of frustration, however, is his love life, where he is “swithering between an agreeable reality” (his ex-girlfriend) and the “unattainable fantasy” of Faith. Dax is unhealthily obsessed with his boss, who calls him “my spy” to make clear where the power lies in their “maddening, compulsive” relationship. Yet there is a glint of promise: she is newly single again, having broken off her engagement to another man.

In contrast to Gabriel's Moon, which took a while to find its footing, the action of The Predicament surges along. After some cursory self-defence training, Dax is dispatched to Guatemala to help the CIA to get intel on a presidential candidate, which eventually draws him into contact with the mafia and a mission to foil — wait for it — a plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Boyd ups the authorial stakes by reaching for the daddy of conspiracy theories, putting his book in dialogue not only with famous fictional accounts of JFK's assassination like Don DeLillo's Libra, but also with the imaginations of every remotely conspiracy-minded reader, who has no doubt already settled on their preferred culprits for the president's murder.

Boyd injects some novelty into this well-trodden terrain: he transposes the action five months earlier to Kennedy's visit to neon-lit West Berlin and swaps out Oswald for a fictional gunman. He throws in all the classic Kennedy conspiracy theories, then runs with some and discards others. 

The result of all this effort can only be divisive: some readers will be underwhelmed while others will feel Boyd has pushed the preposterousness too far. I found it extravagantly enjoyable, although after I finished the contrivances started to settle in my head. An ideal reading situation might be to wait for the inevitable third instalment, then devour both books in one go without time to ponder which parts are devious red herrings and which Boyd left hanging unintentionally. After all, a good thriller, like a good conspiracy theory, doesn't have to be watertight, it just has to intrigue, flatter and entertain. That's what Lee Harvey Oswald was counting on.

In this article

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Wednesday criticized the Trump administration's decision to take a 10% stake in embattled chipmaker Intel, calling the investment ""a step towards socialism.""

Intel announced last month that the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, purchasing 433.3 million shares at a price of $20.47 per share, giving it a 10% stake in the company. Intel noted that the price the government paid was a discount to the current market price.

Paul said government ownership is ""a bad idea.""

""It's always a mistake to say, 'Well we have this one bad policy, all right, we'll tolerate a little socialism, but we don't want anymore,"" Paul told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""I think it's a bad idea.""

President Donald Trump said on Truth Social last month that the government's stake in the chipmaker is a ""great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.""

Trump has taken an increasingly heavy hand in the private sector, raising concern among conservative lawmakers like Paul, who have long opposed big government. In August, the Trump administration said the government would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials. It also took a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant.

Among the most vocal supporters in Congress of Trump's Intel deal has been Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont. Sanders, a longtime and vocal Trump critic, told news outlets last month that, ""Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return.""

But Paul said it's not smart to involve the government in the free market.

""I worry that the free market movement, the movement that was a big part of the Republican Party, is being diminished over time,"" Rand said.

            Florida will move to end all vaccine mandates in the state, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced Wednesday.
    


            The move would make Florida the first state to end a longstanding – and constitutionally upheld – practice of requiring certain vaccines for school students.
    


            The state health department will immediately move to end all non-statutory mandates in the state, Ladapo said at a news conference. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was also at the event, said state lawmakers would then look into developing a legislative package to end any remaining mandates.
    


            Ladapo said that every vaccine mandate “is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.”
    


            All 50 states have had school immunization requirements since the beginning of the 1980s, with incoming kindergartners needing shots to protect against diseases including measles, polio and tetanus. No states require a Covid-19 vaccine for schoolchildren.
    


Required vaccine coverage among US kindergartners dips again, new CDC data shows



            All states allow medical exemptions from these school vaccine mandates, and most also allow for exemptions due to personal or religious beliefs. Exemption rates have been on the rise for years in the US, with a record share of incoming kindergartners skipping the required shots in the 2024-25 school year.
    


            Florida's school vaccine exemption rate last school year– about 5% – was higher than the national average, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, and nearly all were for nonmedical reasons.
    


            “We are concerned that today's announcement will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, which will have a ripple effect across our communities,” Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.
    


            “For many kids, the best part of school is being with friends - sharing space, playing on the playground, and learning together. Close contact makes it easy for contagious diseases to spread quickly,” she said. “When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun. When children are sick and miss school caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.”

Ukraine's Western backers should accept that military efforts against Russia are failing and should instead focus on undermining its economy, including by sanctioning its trade partners, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Tuesday.

Germany remains one of Ukraine's largest arms suppliers and has pledged long-term backing for Kiev. Despite that support, Russian forces continue to make frontline advances, Merz told the ProSiebenSat.1 media outlet. He argued that the priority should now shift toward intensifying sanctions.

“We must ensure that this country, Russia, is no longer able to maintain its war economy,” he said. “In this context, I'm talking about economic exhaustion, which we must help bring about. For example, through tariffs on those who still trade diligently with Russia.”

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the comments on Wednesday, writing on Telegram: “Your exhausting rod is not long enough, Herr Merz.”

Moscow has touted its resilience to Western sanctions as a hallmark of Russian economic sovereignty and has questioned the logic of politicians who pursue such policies.

“Many of the things they do harm themselves,” President Vladimir Putin remarked at a business forum in May. “One would think they would not do this or that thing to avoid self-harm. But those dimwits do, pardon my words. Leading world economies are going into a recession just to spite us.”

Merz's government plans to cut welfare spending and rely on credit in order to sustain Ukraine aid and increase German military expenditure. The European Union's biggest economy has shown little growth for years, with no major improvements expected anytime soon.

The rejection of Russian pipeline natural gas in an attempt to punish Moscow over the Ukraine conflict has been cited as a major factor in the decline of the competitiveness of German businesses.

Joseph Ladapo, a long-time vaccine skeptic, says that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed

US politics live – latest updates

Children in Florida will no longer be required to receive vaccines against preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio and hepatitis, said Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, on Wednesday in a speech during which he likened vaccine mandates to “slavery”.

Ladapo, hand-picked for the role by Ron DeSantis, Florida's Republican governor, is a long-time skeptic of the benefit of vaccines, and has previously been accused of peddling “scientific nonsense” by public health advocates.

In his announcement on Wednesday, at a press conference in Tampa hosted by DeSantis, he said that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed, and that he expected the move would receive the blessing “of God”.

“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” said Ladapo, who altered data in a 2022 study about Covid-19 vaccines in an attempt to exaggerate the risk to young men who received one.

“People have a right to make their own decisions. Who am I, as a government or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Our body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”

Ladapo condemned lockdowns and vaccination requirements during the coronavirus pandemic as a time “when crazy things did happen”, and said that growing skepticism of vaccines were “reflections of God's light against the darkness of tyranny and oppression”.

Formerly affiliated with the controversial ultra-conservative America's Frontline Doctors group, Ladapo has long railed against Covid-19 vaccines. In 2023, he urged Florida residents to ignore public health advice and reject mRNA booster shots that he falsely claimed had not been tested on humans.

Several of his other positions on public health issues, such as promoting the removal of fluoride from drinking water and urging parents to reject measles vaccines for their children, have been called “dangerous” and a “disservice to Florida residents”.

His “slavery” comment, made with DeSantis at his side, was notable. The governor drew allegations of racism in 2023 when the state introduced a new education curriculum teaching that the “full truth” of America's history with slavery is that it was beneficial to those enslaved.

Florida's department of health currently has strict requirements for immunizations that must be given during childhood, which are posted to its website. No child can be enrolled in a Florida public school unless they have received a series of shots against a number of diseases.

Routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13m deaths among children born in the US between 1994 and 2023, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report published last year.

It estimated that the vaccine program nationally resulted in direct savings of $540bn and societal savings of $2.7tn.

Ladapo gave no details or timeline for the proposed repeal, but said his department would work with lawmakers and the DeSantis administration to make it happen.

“I love our lawmakers. They're going to have to make decisions … People are going to have to make a decision,” he said. “People are going to have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that the moral side is so simple.”

Ladapo also said that “it'll be wonderful for Florida to be the first state to do it”.

Florida's plan drew praise from Robert W Malone, a conservative physician and prominent anti-vaxxer appointed by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to his new advisory committee on immunization practices that replaced the independent panel he fired.

“Go Joe!” Malone said in a post to X, shortly after another tweet in which he said he spoke to Ladapo on Tuesday and called him “a measured scientist – who is on fire to change the system for the better”.

Others were not so convinced. Anna Eskamani, a Democratic Florida state representative, called the move “a public health disaster in the making”.

“Ending vaccine mandates is reckless and dangerous. It will drive down immunization rates and open the door to outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors and vulnerable Floridians at risk,” she said in a statement.

David Jolly, a former Republican congressman for Florida who is running as a Democrat to succeed DeSantis as governor when he is termed out in 2027, posted to X that he believed Ladapo's tenure could be limited.

“The next Governor gets to fire this guy. I know I would. Hopefully Byron Donalds or Paul Renner would do the same,” he wrote, referring to two high-profile Florida Republicans who have announced their candidacies.

“Since the 1980s, all states had school vaccines mandates. If Florida abolishes [its mandate], it would be the first in recent times to do so,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, who specializes in vaccines law and policy.

But she pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a law introduced yet, which is a big if. She noted that Idaho attempted to end school mandates in April, but ended up carving out exceptions for existing mandates – effectively rendering that part of the law moot – after pushback from advocates.

“I would also add that one reason all states adopted them is that evidence showed school mandates reduce and prevent outbreaks. If Florida does this, it's creating an unfortunate natural experiment with its children as guinea pigs,” Reiss said. “Children deserve better.”

The Florida department of health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China wrapped up a high-profile summit as a demonstration of its global leadership. But a breakthrough in strategic relations with member states such as India remains elusive, say experts. 

The China-hosted Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit concluded on Monday, highlighting Beijing's push to advance its vision for a new global security and economic order in the age of Trump 2.0.  

Joined by more than 20 world leaders, including from India and Russia, the bloc's largest summit wrapped up with a joint declaration signed by ten member states, pledging a deepened strategic alliance in the Global South.

""The declaration sent a joint message advocating fairness over dominance and a commitment to maintaining an open global economy,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference after the summit.

Wang also outlined that one major outcome of the summit was support for a multilateral trading system ""in the face of unilateral bullying resurfacing,"" in an apparent reference to the current US tariffs.

Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, and four Central Asian countries, the SCO has grown to ten member states, with a focus on strengthening the unity of the Global South.

Among the highlights of this year's summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance — his first visit to China since the deadly border clashes between the two sides in 2020.

On the sidelines, Modi met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and was photographed chatting and laughing with the two leaders in cordial gestures.

Claus Soong, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) focusing on the Global South, told DW that the summit ""looks pretty good"" for Beijing, as it showcased the country's ability to bring together global leaders.

He added, however, that while China continues to exert influence in the region, ""how well it is received is another question.""

During his speech at the summit, China's Xi urged SCO member states to strengthen strategic cooperation and to ""safeguard the achievements of World War II victory… and maintain international fairness and justice.""

Xi also highlighted ""the victory"" against Japanese aggression 80 years ago, saying it showcases ""the courage, resilience, and perseverance of the Chinese people, and is a legacy to be forever remembered.""

The emphasis on World War II throughout the summit comes as China prepares to stage a massive military parade on Wednesday, with Russian President Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expected to attend.

""I think that is something significant here. It's kind of like bringing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization under the narrative of China's military parade,"" Soong told DW.

But questions remain over whether countries gathering in China are embracing Beijing's ideological framing. The leaders of Turkey, Egypt and India, for example, will not attend the parade.

""At least some countries are trying to stay away from fully aligning with China, especially regarding ideology and how the legacy of the Second World War is interpreted and presented,"" Soong added.

Modi's high-profile visit to China to attend the summit came as US-India relations grew strained after Washington raised its tariffs on a range of Indian goods to as high as 50%.

China and India are among Russia's largest crude oil buyers and have resisted persistent pressure from US President Donald Trump to halt their purchases.

""This is favorable to China in a way that India is not as close to the US,"" Sana Hashmi, an affiliated scholar with the Research Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs, told DW.

She added that Beijing had used this year's SCO summit to project to the US that ""India is no more a part of your club and now India is coming to our orbit.""

After what Modi characterized as a ""fruitful"" exchange with Xi, both affirmed the two countries are ""development partners, not rivals.""

Xi also called on Modi to not let border issues ""define"" bilateral relations.

But from India's point of view, Hashmi said, it is more of ""a balancing act"" based on self-interest rather than ""a breakthrough or reset"" in the bilateral relations.

""There is a lack of trust between China and India,"" she said. ""Reviving this China-India-Russia partnership will be like repeating the same pattern and mistake.""

In the Tianjin Declaration, signed by SCO's ten member states at the end of the summit, no mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine can be found.

Instead, the SCO has condemned the Israeli and US strikes on Iran earlier this year and the Pahalgam attack, a deadly assault on tourists in India-administered Kashmir in April.

The inclusion has likely given ""India sufficient recognition to feel respected,"" Soong said.

However, India did not join the rest of the bloc's member states in supporting China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast global infrastructure and trade development strategy launched by China in 2013.

""India's absence in supporting China's BRI highlights ongoing structural issues in China–India relations,"" Soong said.

SCO summits have often been criticized for remaining largely rhetorical, rather than producing concrete plans for action, although China has insisted that tangible steps have been taken to ensure the bloc's ""better development.""

Regarding the pledges coming from the Chinese side, researcher Hashmi said: ""It's too early to say if these things are going to be translated into real actions and sincerity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Britain is at war with freedom, Farage tells US","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/09/03/farage-us-congress-speech-free-speech-britain/","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:12:18 GMT","

Nigel Farage said Britain was at “war with freedom” as he prepared to testify in US Congress over limits to free speech.

The Reform UK leader attended a hearing in Washington on Wednesday morning, raising concerns about British restrictions on freedom of speech in the US.

Mr Farage raised the case of Graham Linehan, the creator of Father Ted, who was arrested by five armed officers over posts he made on X about transgender people. Mr Farage earlier described Linehan's arrest as a “war on freedom”.

He also mentioned the case of Lucy Connolly, who was jailed over a social media post in the wake of the Southport attacks, and subsequently accused Sir Keir Starmer of holding her as a “political prisoner”. The British politician said he had intended to bring Mrs Connolly, but she was unable to travel to the States, owing to her conviction.

Speaking at the hearing, Mr Farage said free speech was based on “principles that [we] will fight and defend to the death your right to say something that we fundamentally disagree with”.

He added: “That is the absolute foundation, if you think about it, of free speech, of democracy, of living in freedom.”

Thank you for tuning in to today's live blog on Nigel Farage's testimony.

The Reform UK leader has spent the past three hours testifying before US Congress about threats to freedom of speech in Europe and the UK. 

This live blog is now closed.

After almost three hours, Nigel Farage has left the hearing.

He did so with some parting jibes from Democrats, who speculated he was running late for lunch with Donald Trump.

“One more,” Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin chided as the Reform UK leader left the chamber. “Blame it on me.”

Mr Farage did not bite.

The subsequent speaker addressed a long question to the British politician, only to be told that he had departed and could therefore no longer respond.

 

Nigel Farage has warned that the wording of the Online Safety Act is so “open-ended” it “could literally mean whatever you want”.

Responding to a question that required what speech can be restricted, Mr Farage said: “It leaves this entirely in the hands of local police forces to make their decisions.”

He added: “The other disturbing element of this is...this act can be changed on a whim by a government minister, or at the other end, it can be interpreted by Ofcom in ways that it sees fit. 

“This is not good legislation. It's totally open ended. It could literally mean whatever you want it to mean.”

Nigel Farage has called for the Trump administration to enter into talks with the British government about restrictions the Online Safety Act places on the free speech rights of American citizens.

“I do think there is a conversation to be had with the British government about the shape of their legislation and the impact it can have on American individuals, their liberty, and American companies,” he told the House Judiciary Committee.

“So, I am calling for, as a result of what's happened...the legislation's clearly doing the wrong thing. 

“I think it is cause for proper intergovernmental debate.”

Nigel Farage has hinted that he will meet with Donald Trump once his Congressional hearing is over.

Asked by Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, what he was doing next, Mr Farage declined to say.

“Free speech...You're not gonna tell me what you're doing this afternoon?” Mr Moskowitz asked.

“There's free speech [is] one thing. Discretion is quite a number two,” Mr Farage responded. When asked repeatedly by Mr Moskowitz if he would be meeting the president, Mr Farage just laughed.

“So, you're leaving to have lunch with the president,” Mr Moskowitz said.

Nigel Farage has pledged that Reform UK will repeal the Online Safety Act.

Asked from assurances about what Mr Farage and his allies would commit to,  he said: “You have my absolute word that a reform government will repeal the Online Safety Act.”

He added: “We'll go right back, actually, to legislation, back to 2010, under which these whole concepts of hate speak become to be interpreted in UK law.”

Responding to promises from Sir Keir Starmer that online regulation is designed to support children, Mr Farage said: “If it's about protecting kids, why does the legislation give Ofcom the most extraordinary and frankly arbitrary powers, and why is there the establishment under the act of an elite police force unit to monitor what is said online?”

His comments appeared to refer to a Telegraph exclusive last month, that revealed a secretive Whitehall “spy” unit has been used by the British government to target social media posts criticising migrant hotels and “two-tier policing”.

A House Democrat has berated Nigel Farage about the Epstein Files, despite the hearing being about freedom of speech in Europe and the UK.

Responding to repeated questions about whether the list should be released, Mr Farage said: “I'm here as a witness for what is happening in the United Kingdom.”

Eventually, one of Congressman Jared Moskowitz's colleagues intervened to point out that the Reform UK leader has already called for the files to be released.

Nigel Farage has said that common sense on freedom of speech will eventually prevail.

“The silent majority will win,” he said, in response to questions from a Republican lawmaker. “In the end, common sense. common decency, will prevail.”

Jamie Raskin has return to needle Nigel Farage, mocking him for his looks.

Responding to Mr Farage's claims he is the “most open person” to the press, Mr Raskin quipped “You are undoubtedly the handsomest man in the world”.

The congressman earlier praised the Reform UK leader for his “erudition and dazzling brilliance” before questioning why Mr Farage called for Pro-Palestinian protests not to take place on the day of an October 7 memorial.

When the Briton explained his reasoning, Mr Raskin advised him to take the idea of a written constitution “back to the UK”, because “freedom of speech applies 365 days a year here [in the US]”.

The subsequent speaker joked: “Maybe this Raskin Farage show could become a recurring event.”

Nigel Farage has defended JK Rowling for receiving “abuse on a huge scale” for her views.

“She very much comes from a liberal wing of politics, historically, but taken a view that women should be safe in women's spaces. That means changing rooms,” he said.

“She has faced cancel culture and abuse on a huge scale.”

Nigel Farage has dismissed allegations of being from the far-Right, arguing that his concerns about immigration and celebrating the British flag are mainstream.

Asked about the key issues that the European far-Right is engaged in, Mr Farage deadpanned: “If you're opposed to illegal immigration on a mass scale and the huge cost [to] a taxpayer and the risk to our communities...and if you like the flag, our national flag, then apparently you're far right.”

Nigel Farage has said that he thinks there is a limit to free speech.

Mr Farage told Congress: “Incitement...we will be absolutely joined together on that, we don't want incitement.

“We don't accept incitement.”

However, he said that if “people put out something irrational... but very quickly, put their hands up and apologise and learn their lesson” then “that is how the world works” and they should be forgiven, and not face legal action. 

Nigel Farage has issued an appeal to British voters, instructing them to vote for Reform UK if they want to see the restoration of freedom of speech.

Asked what can be done about current concerns about freedom of expression in the UK, Mr Farage said; “Well, ultimately, the people have to get what they vote for, and one of the reasons that we are seeing an extraordinary political revolution, that is happening in parts of Europe, and if you believe the polls, what is happening in the United Kingdom right now, is we want a government that comes in and gets rid...of all these laws.”

Underscoring that protecting children from “serious harm online” remains fundamental, he added that Britain needs to get back to a place where comments can be traded with fear of repercussions.

He said: “We will get back to the idea that I can insult you, you could insult me, Mr Raskin, you and I could have our chats, but we do it, you know, in a spirit that's not spiteful, and in a way that honours those who built our great countries.”

Nigel Farage has said that although Elon Musk is “spectacularly rude” about him, that is okay because he believes in free speech.

“I had a public fallout over a political issue with Elon Musk, I can't be bullied by anybody,” Mr Farage said.

“I haven't changed my mind. Last time I looked he was being spectacularly rude about me yesterday. That's life. We believe in free speech. We live with it.”

Nigel Farage has denied that Donald Trump is his “political mentor”.

Questioned by Georgia Democrat Hank Johnson over his connection to the US President, Mr Farage said he was a man he “admired very much”.

“He is somebody who you want the support of, and you have the support,” Mr Johnson said.

The Democrat also pointed out Reform UK's four seats in Parliament, adding: “Numbers don't lie”.

Mr Farage said he was a “fringe” politician, but pointed out that his party was projected to grow exponentially.  

A Georgia Republican has berated Nigel Farage about his relationship with Elon Musk.

In a confused understanding of Mr Farage and the tech billionaire's fallout, and perhaps of funding models in British politics, Henry Calvin Johnson Jr accused the Reform UK leader of relying on Mr Musk to fund his prime ministerial bid.

As Mr Johnson's questioning wore on, allowing Mr Farage little opportunity to respond, the Reform leader joked: “Can I get a coffee?” suggesting it was taking some time for him to get a word in.

When Mr Johnson's time expired, Mr Farage said: “I had a public fallout over a political issue with Elon Musk, and I can't be bullied by anybody.

“Last time I looked he was being spectacularly rude about me yesterday.”

Nigel Farage has entered into an amusing exchange with a Georgia Democrat.

Asked if he had come to the US last year, Mr Farage responded that he had been visiting the country since the 1980s.

Henry Calvin Johnson Jr, went on to ask if Donald Trump was Mr Farage's mentor, to which the Reform UK party leader flatly responded: “no”.

The Democrat then asked if Mr Farage is trying to become prime minister, to which he quipped: “I've been trying for years.”

Nigel Farage warned that we have lost our way on freedom of speech.

Responding to a question about what happened to the West's liberal understanding of the right to speak one's mind, he said: “We forgot the huge sacrifices that were made by citizens alive at that time to defend those principles against tyranny and against dictatorship.

“We've kind of lost our we've lost our way understanding why we are as we are, and I think that has permeated through the education system, where I'm not sure we've been teaching good values.”

Addressing the subject of how slavery is taught in school history lessons, he said “We spent decades driving slavery off the high seas. So whilst we were perpetrators to begin with, we actually, in the end, drove it off the high seas. 

“So we need to teach our kids a sense of balance about our history, about the sacrifice that's been made. That's my feeling. “

Nigel Farage warned that mocking religion could become an offence in the UK.

The Reform UK leader testified that Labour's plans to introduce an Islamophobia Law, which he warned could lead to it being an offence to mock Islam online.

Mr Farage pointed out that religion - including the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury - have always been subjects of mockery in British public discourse.

Nigel Farage said that arrests for so-called “hate speech” are “massive statistics”

Asked by committee chair about the12,000 arrests made in 2023 for offensive posts, he said: “These are massive statistics.”

He warned that the legislation means that “we finish up in a position where local police forces have to choose their own interpretations”.

Graham Lineham, better known as the creator of Father Ted, is an Irish comedy writer.

He made headlines on Tuesday after being arrested by five armed police officers after arriving at Heathrow airport, returning from Arizona, in the US.

Mr Lineham was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence over posts he published on X mocking trans people. The IT Crowd creator said his tweets were a “joke”.

The comedian said in a post on Substack that the officers had “escorted him to a private area” and explained he had been arrested for three tweets about transgender people

One of the tweets in question read: “If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops, and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.”

A Republican Congressman has hailed Nigel Farage as the “future prime minister”.

Darrell Issa, the California Republican, wished Mr Farage well, saying: “I hope more comes to the fringe parliamentarian, as you were called, and probably the future prime minister.”

Responding to Mr Issa, and picking up Democrat Jerry Nadler's earlier criticism, the Reform UK leader referred to his party as a “very big fringe”.

Nigel Farage has said that the Covid-19 pandemic “changed the game” when it came to assaults on freedom of expression.

“I don't think any point we really had a proper debate about infringement free speech until Covid. And I think Covid changed the game,” he told the House Judiciary Committee.

“I think the government, social platforms, big media, suddenly there were arguments that needed to be made that were banned.”

Nigel Farage has warned that freedom of speech legislation in Britain is a “sledgehammer that misses the nut”.

The Reform UK leader said that Sir Keir Starmer has “talked about our proud history of free speech, “but what  people say, what they do, are two very different things”.

“The argument is that the Online Safety Act, I repeat what I said earlier, may have been designed by the Tories with the best of intentions, but has turned out to be the sledgehammer that this is the nut. It's not protecting kids and it is damaging,” he said.

Democrats have laid out their line of argument. The threat to freedom of speech in the US does not come from across the Atlantic, but in the words of Rep. Jerry Nadler, “It is right here in Washington, sitting in the Oval Office.”

He is outlining what he sees as President Donald Trump's attacks on the media, listing the times that the president has sued major news organisations, such as the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the Epstein case -- something that American presidents have shied from in the past.

Republicans are leaning into accusations that European regulators have no right to limit what Americans can post, even if it is consumed in Europe. Democrats are bringing the argument back to Washington and Mr Trump. 

Jerry Nadler, the veteran Democrat, has dismissed Nigel Farage as a “fringe politician”.

“Our Republican colleagues have brought us here today to talk about Europe, they've invited a fringe politician from the United Kingdom to attack the laws regulating certain conduct online in his country and the European Union, laws that are intended to combat disinformation by hustler foreign actors, hate speech and other fraud,” Mr Nadler told the House Judiciary Committee.

A recent poll showed that Reform UK had taken out a 15-point lead over Labour.

Mr Nadler diverted the focus back to limits on freedom of expression in the US, saying: “There is a clear and present danger to free speech in America, but it is not across the Atlantic Ocean. It's right here in Washington, sitting in the Oval Office at a time when the greatest threat to the First Amendment rights of Americans resides in the White House.”

Donald Trump has taken aim at journalists who have criticised him since returning to Office, taking control of the White House pool, banning the AP from coverage and threatening to sue the Wall Street Journal.

Congress has rather jumped the gun on Nigel Farage. Jim Jordan, the committee chairman, introduced the Reform UK leader as “the right honorable Nigel Farage.”

The title is reserved for members of the Privy Council, which includes Cabinet ministers and other senior public figures, as well as some hereditary peers. Mr Farage may come to use the title soon, but he doesn't have it yet.

Another reminder of how Americans are bewildered by British public life, its titles and niceties.

Nigel Farage has warned that Graham Linehan's arrest serves as a warning to American citizens travelling to the UK.

The Reform UK leader described Mr Linehan's detention as “extraordinary” and said “this could happen to any American man or woman”.

The Father Ted creator was arrested after getting off a flight from Arizona to Heathrow over posts he made on X about transgender people.

“He put out some tweets months ago when he was in Arizona, and months later, he arrives at Heathrow Airport to be met by five armed police,” Mr Farage told the House Judiciary Committee. 

“Armed Police, not a big deal in the USA, a very big deal in the United Kingdom, five of them, and he was arrested and taken away for questioning. 

“He's not even a British citizen. He's an Irish citizen. This could happen to any American man or woman that goes to Heathrow that has said things online that the British government and British police don't like.”

Nigel Farage has said he tried to bring Lucy Connolly with him but she was blocked from travelling to the US because of her conviction.

Ms Connolly, the wife of an ex-Tory councillor, was imprisoned for three months in the wake of last summer's riots for an intemperate post she made on X about migrants.

Mr Farage told the committee: “I wanted to bring her with me today as living proof of what can go wrong. Sadly, the restrictions that have been put on her, banned her from making the trip, which is a very, very great shame.”

The Reform UK leader condemned Ms Connolly's post as “wrong” but pointed out she was sentenced to 31 months in prison, despite removing the statement three-and a-half hours later.

Nigel Farage has suggested using technology that blocks certain online content could be a solution to freedom of speech rows.

He said: “There is not a parent in the United Kingdom, and I would guess it's the same for America too, that is not concerned about content their children, as minors, can find on the internet. 

“I Myself begin to think that hardware might be one of the solutions that had the laptops that had sets would be programmed so that many, many apps and many, many services simply aren't available from these devices, but what we've done is to go down the legislative route.”

Nigel Farage has warned that we have forgotten the key principles of free speech.

“We've kind of forgotten, the Voltaire and principles that will fight and defend to the death your right to say something that we fundamentally disagree with. That is the absolute foundation, if you think about it, of free speech, of democracy, of living in freedom,” he said.

“It's kind of why we fought two world wars at massive, massive cost, to defend that very principle for ourselves and for many, many others around the country.”

Nigel Farage has begun his testimony by mocking Jamie Raskin, who just accused him of loving Vladimir Putin.

“I'm delighted to reacquaint with the charming, Mr. Raskin. Delightful testimony you gave me earlier on with your speech,” the Reform UK leader quipped. “But hey, that's fine. You can say what you like. I don't care, because that's what free speech is.”

The Reform UK leader has started to testify.

Jamie Raskin, the minority leader of the House judiciary, has accused Nigel Farage of  being a “Putin-loving imposter”.

Addressing Mr Farage's decision to testify in the US, the Democrat said: “He should go and advance the positions he's taking here in Congress today in Parliament, which is meeting today.

“If he's serious about it, to the people of UK who think this Putin-loving free speech imposter and Trump's sycophants will protect freedom in your country, come on over to America and see what Trump and Maga are doing to destroy our freedom.”

Jamie Raskin, the House Judiciary Committee minority leader, said Britain is not in a freedom of speech crisis.

Mr Raskin told the Committee hearing that there “is not free speech crisis in Britain” and laid into Nigel Farage for appearing on Russian television.

“Even though Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and a dictator who has regularly interfered in other countries democratic elections, no one has stopped Mr Farage from parroting Putin's absurd talking points,” Mr Raskin said.

“For a man who fashions himself as some kind of a free speech martyr, Mr Farage seems most at home with the autocrats and dictators of the world who are crushing freedom on Earth.”

Jamie Raskin, the Democrat representative for Maryland's 8th district has laid into Nigel Farage.

Mr Raskin said the Reform UK leader “a far-right pro-Putin” politician. He also pointed out Reform's four seats out of the 650 in Briatin's Parliament.

“He calls England an authoritarian regime, while saying that Vladimir Putin is the world leader he admires the most,” Mr Raskin said.

Jim Jordan has said that the Online Safety Act is the “engine of global censorship”.

“Europe is attacking free speech around the world, including here in America, laws like the Digital Services Act, the Online Safety Act, are the engines of global censorship regime targeting political speech disfavoured by European bureaucrats,” Mr Jordan told a House Judiciary Committee hearing.

He added that this has resulted in restrictions on American freedom of speech rights.

“The censorship mechanism is simple. The DSA and the OSA effectively require social media platforms to change their terms of service to moderate more content,” he said. “These companies have one set of standards that they apply globally because it's costly, impractical and harmful to user privacy to change content moderation rules based on a user's location. 

“So when platforms are first forced to change their terms of service to comply with European laws, it affects what we see, what we read what we say online here in America, infringing on Americans first amendment rights.”

Jim Jordan has claimed that UK freedom of speech legilsation helps China.

Referring to recent UK legislation, the House Judiciary Committee chair told a hearing: “These attacks on American companies won't result in a so-called European champion. 

“Instead, China wins as Europe hurts both itself and America. They make the user experience worse. They distort the digital marketplace by allowing less innovative and less efficient foreign companies, foreign competitors, to simply steal from us tech companies.”

Jim Jordan said that the Online Safety Act censors the digital town square.

He told the hearing: “These acts target our tech companies that provide the modern town square, and they are the engines of innovation in our global economy.”

He added that the EU and UK are “imposing burdensome requirements” on US tech companies.

He said: “EU and the UK are going after American companies that have grown to dominate the global tech landscape, regulations like the EU's digital markets Act and the UK's digital markets competition and consumers act impose burdensome requirements on us tech companies, while leaving their European counterparts untouched.”

Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that the UK Online Safety Act breaches American First Amendment rights.

Casting the legislation as a “shake down”, Mr Jordan said: “We're concerned about the attacks on free expression in Europe, the censorship, the arrest or offensive post, the chilling effect it all has on speech. 

“But we're more concerned, frankly, as Americans, about the limits the DSA [Digital Safety Act], the Online Safety Act in the UK, put on Americans first amendment rights and the Shake-down, and I think that's the appropriate term, the shake-down of American tech companies under the DSA, the OSA [Online Safety Act], and the digital marketing act in digital markets act in the European Union.”

Jim Jordan said Meta apologised for bowing to the Biden administration's demands for it to censor online free speech.

He said that last congress, the committee “investigated our government, the Biden administration, their attacks on free expression here in the United States, what Michael Shellenberger called, journalists called, the censorship industrial Complex. A government, big tech, big media, big, academia, all working together to censor America”.

Quoting Mr Zuckerberg, he alleged the tech boss said: “Yes, the Biden administration pressured us to censor, we did it, we're sorry and we won't do it again.”

The House judiciary committee hearing on freedom of speech is under way.

Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, is expected to testify soon.

The House Judiciary committee previously said it was “shocked” by restrictions on freedom of speech imposed on US citizens by UK online safety laws.

Writing for The Telegraph, Jim Jordan, the chair of the committee, last month revealed that he had travelled to the UK as part of a delegation to investigate the impact of law changes on online freedom of expression.

He wrote: “We led a delegation to Brussels and London to see how aggressive European speech regulations affect American free speech rights in the digital town square. What we saw shocked us.

“Today, robust debate has returned to the modern digital town square, supported by the Trump administration's efforts to root out the censorship-industrial complex in the United States.

“Despite these achievements, American free speech remains at risk. The threat now comes from foreign censorship laws that seek to have global effects, including here in the United States.”

Nigel Farage has warned that Graham Linehan's arrest is indicative of a “war on freedom” in Britain.

The Father Ted creator yesterday revealed he was arrested by police and locked in a cell upon landing at Heathrow over posts he made on X.

“The Graham Linehan case is yet another example of the war on freedom in the UK,” Mr Farage said ahead of his appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to raise the case.

“Free speech is under assault, and I am urging the USA to be vigilant.”

The Telegraph's associate political editor Tony Diver explains why Mr Farage is in Washington, DC, today.

Nigel Farage is expected to raise the case of Lucy Connolly with US lawmakers during his speech to Congress today. 

The hearing, “Europe's Threat to American Speech and Innovation”, will address how restrictions on freedom of speech in Britain could affect Americans. 

Ms Connolly, a former childminder and the wife of a Tory councillor, was jailed for 31 months over a social media post in the wake of the Southport attacks.

Her case was widely criticised as an example of authoritarianism, and she subsequently accused Sir Keir Starmer of holding her as a “political prisoner”.

Ms Connolly has since been released, but the ordeal continues to pose serious questions for the UK and its Labour Government.

People at the New Jersey prison are confined in cells so small they can touch both walls with their arms outstretched.

Many people incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison's West Compound are confined in cells so small they can touch the ceiling and both walls with their arms outstretched, according to a new report released on Tuesday by the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson. 

The Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment. 

New Jersey State Prison, a maximum security prison in Trenton, the state's capital, holds more than 1,300 people across its three compounds, North, South, and West. As part of their inspection of the West Compound, investigators conducted site visits and interviewed over 100 incarcerated people, as well as staff and prison leadership. 

Investigators found that West Compound prison cells, with the exception of one wing, “are very small.” Cells in the solitary confinement unit, which the Department of Corrections has named the Restorative Housing Unit, “are shockingly small,” measuring four feet by seven feet.

“People housed on 7-Wing [the Restorative Housing Unit] can touch the ceiling and can extend their arms to touch both side-walls of the cell,” the report says. “The same is true for much of the population in 1-wing, 2-wing and 6-wing, though these cells are larger than the ones in 7-wing.” 

The New Jersey Administrative Code requires that county jail cells have 35 square feet of unencumbered floor space in single-occupancy cells, but there are no minimum requirements for the size of prison cells, according to the report. Cells in only one wing of West Compound meet the county jail requirement. The other cells range in size from 35 square feet to 45 square feet, with beds that take up 13.5 square feet of floor space. 

Each cell has a sink and a toilet. The sinks have no hot water and the toilets are “directly exposed to the open bars of the cell door,” according to the report. 

Residents also have no privacy while showering, which has led them to bathe with their underwear on.

“[T]he West Compound does not have enclosed shower stalls that offer any modesty or privacy while bathing,” the report says. “Showerheads are positioned along the wall on the first floor of the housing unit, separated with makeshift dividers. People in the stalls are directly visible to those on higher floors of the housing unit.”

New Jersey is one of the country's fastest warming states, but there is no air conditioning in West Compound's housing units. This past summer, the state was hit with numerous heat waves. 

For more than half of West Compound's almost 200-year existence, experts have called for the prison's closure. In 1918, a commission created by the state legislature recommended replacing the prison, saying that it was “antiquated and inadequate” and “much too small for decent living,” per the report. More than 30 years later, in 1952, another committee advised the state's then-governor to build a new prison according to “standards of modern penology.” 

The report concluded with a plea to state leaders to finally heed that call. 

“The buildings in the West Compound were constructed nearly 200 years ago, and have been called antiquated and inhumane by New Jersey correctional leaders, policymakers, and subject matter experts for at least the last 100 years,” the report says. “Lawmakers and the Department of Corrections should prioritize and fund the demolition and replacement of the West Compound with modern correctional housing units that better meet the needs of the Department and the incarcerated population.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Using the phone while you poop greatly raises hemorrhoid risk, new study says","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/toilet-time-hemorrhoid-risk-wellness","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT","


    Jocelyn Solis-Moreira is a freelance health and science journalist based in New York.



            There's nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one's family, even just for a few minutes.
    


            The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones.
    


            There are consequences to sitting longer than we used to on the toilet: People are reporting a higher rate of hemorrhoids when they bring their smartphones to the bathroom, according to a new study in PLOS One.



Hemorrhoids are groups of veins in the rectum and outside the anus that can swell and enlarge due to increased pressure, which can create itchiness, discomfort, pain and bleeding.
    


Exercise may help patients with colon cancer live as long as those who never had it, study suggests



            This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study's senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
    


            All this scrolling is messing with people's health.
    


            “The entire business model of these social media apps is to distract us, make us lose track of time and addict us to the algorithm,” Pasricha said. “We're just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.”
    


            The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Confirmation of hemorrhoids was detected by endoscopy.
    


            Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media.
    


How to prevent doomscrolling from controlling you



            How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. About 37% of smartphone users spend over five minutes on the toilet compared with 7% of non-smartphone users.
    


            Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Over time, the increased pressure from the toilet seat can cause blood to pool in the rectum.
    


            “When you're sitting on an open toilet bowl, you have no pelvic floor support,” Pasricha said.
    


            Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture.
    


            Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn't ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. The squatted position is a better option for a smooth bowel movement.
    


            “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we're evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said.
    


            What about constipation? The study results suggest the issue is most likely the time spent sitting on the toilet rather than straining, Pasricha said.
    


Is the ‘fibermaxxing' trend good for you? Yes, and here's why



            People who used their smartphones weren't more constipated than those who didn't, she said. “They didn't actually strain harder to have a bowel movement than the ones who didn't. My hypothesis is that it's passive smartphone use that causes these hemorrhoidal cushions to become engorged and bulge, and that's what leads to hemorrhoids.”
    


            While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them.
    


            “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn't use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.”
    


            Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors.
    


            The simplest answer is to avoid bringing your phone to the bathroom. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Three to five minutes would be ideal.
    


            “A lot of expert consensus is three minutes per bowel movement, but everyone is different,” Shukla said.
    


            Setting a timer can be helpful if you're prone to mindless scrolling.

Western countries could “lose the game” to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) unless they reassess their approach to the Global South, Finnish President Alexander Stubb has warned. His comments come following the latest SCO summit in Tianjin, which has been seen as a show of unity among its members, which include China, Russia and India.

Speaking in Helsinki alongside Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, Stubb urged his Western European counterparts and the US to adopt a more “cohesive and dignified foreign policy,” particularly with regard to nations such as India, against which Washington had recently imposed extensive tariffs.

Efforts by Beijing and Moscow to promote a multipolar world order amount to an “attempt to undermine the unity of the global West,” he claimed.

Stubb cited a a “jostling of power and the weakening of multilateral institutions, rules and norms” since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Moscow and Beijing have argued that institutions like the IMF, WTO, and the World Bank have been used by the West to exert control. Russia and China, along with the 18 other countries which attended the SCO summit are pushing for a multipolar world order, where all players are treated equally.

“I disagree with this approach,” Stubb said, insisting that “multilateralism is the best way to drive cooperation forward.”

“My message not only to my European colleagues, but especially to the US, is that if we don't drive a more cooperative, more dignified foreign policy, especially with the Global South and the likes of India, we're going to lose this game,” he warned.

China and Russia have spoken out against Western hegemony and called for the end of the unipolar world order, dominated by Washington.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called on SCO members to oppose “hegemonism and power politics” and to work toward a fairer international system rooted in “mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and pursuit of shared development.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also reiterated calls for a multipolar world while stressing that organizations like the SCO are not meant to oppose any third countries and are meant to establish a more just global governance system.

PARIS, September 3. /TASS/. French President Emmanuel Macron's approval rating has fallen to its lowest point since his election in 2017, according to the results of a poll by the sociological service Verian for Le Figaro Magazine.

The poll reveals that 15% of French respondents approve of the job Macron is doing in the capacity of the head of state. Eighty percent of the polled respondents do not trust him, and another 5% of those surveyed found it difficult to answer.

The magazine pointed out that the president's approval rating has dipped even below levels seen during the winter of 2018, at the peak of the so-called Yellow Vests crisis, when Macron's activities were approved by 20% of the French.

As for the level of confidence in French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, it has dropped to 14%, while 82% opposed his policies. Another 4% declined to express their opinion on this issue.

The survey was conducted via an online questionnaire involving 1,000 people over the age of 18.

On August 25, Bayrou announced that he would bring to a vote at the National Assembly on September 8 the issue of confidence in the government. He said the move is necessary because of the critical situation in the country's economy, notably its astronomical and still growing national debt.

According to him, ""France's public debt is increasing by 12 million euros every hour"" and has already reached 3.4 trillion euros. Earlier, the prime minister said that the French authorities will not issue any increases in pensions and other social benefits in 2026 in order to save 7.1 billion euros and curtail the growth of the national debt.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Letter says Kennedy installed ideologues, endangered US health and ignored pleas as resignations mounted at CDC

US politics live – latest updates

A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human Services department (HHS) has demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health secretary's attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans.

The hard-hitting letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of the agency's chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.

It comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote in a New York Times guest essay that Kennedy's leadership, and ousting of the CDC director, Susan Monarez, months after he appointed her, was “unacceptable” and “unlike anything we have ever seen”.

The letter posted on Wednesday by a group calling itself Save HHS assails Kennedy for “endangering the nation's health by spreading inaccurate health information”.

It cites the resignations of other leading health officials, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Daniel Jernigan, the agency's director for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; and Debra Houry, its chief medical officer.

It also offers sharp criticism of Kennedy's installation of “political ideologues who pose as scientific experts” in leading roles, including on a key vaccine advisory panel. Several members have touted discredited theories, such as the long-disproven link between vaccines and autism.

Earlier this week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) severely restricted who could get updated Covid-19 vaccines, with Kennedy posting to social media that coronavirus “mandates” from the Biden administration were rescinded and that vaccines would be available only to those at highest risk.

“Our oath requires us to speak out when the constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,” the letter, co-signed by six partner organizations in the medical field, said.

“We warn the president, Congress and the public that Secretary Kennedy's actions are compromising the health of this nation, and we demand Secretary Kennedy's resignation.”

It calls for Trump to appoint a new health secretary “whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science”.

Trump this week expressed his displeasure at the chaos engulfing the CDC, acknowledging in a social media post that the agency was being “ripped apart” by the vaccines controversy. But he claimed drug manufacturers were to blame for allegedly not revealing publicly “the success or failure” of Covid vaccines.

The Trump administration also previously sided with Kennedy over Monarez's firing, which prompted bipartisan pushback and a walkout of dozens of CDC staff last month. Monarez, a long-serving government expert on infectious diseases, was confirmed in July, but fired because she was “not aligned with the president's agenda”, a White House statement said.

The 1,040 former and current HHS employees who signed Wednesday's letter said they were writing again because Kennedy ignored their earlier communication. A statement issued by HHS accused the group of “an attempt to politicize a tragedy” by claiming Kennedy's vaccine rhetoric played a role in an attack on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on 8 August in which a police officer was killed.

In its new letter, the group said that the HHS workforce is non-partisan, “implementing science-based policies developed under both Republican and Democratic administrations”.

It said: “We believe health policy should be based on strong, evidence-based principles rather than partisan politics. But under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS policies are placing the health of all Americans at risk, regardless of their politics.”

In a statement, the HHS communications director, Andrew Nixon, said: “Secretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it as the world's most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes.

“From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door – and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same. That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

The HHS employees signed their letter “in our own personal capacities, on our personal time, and without the use of government equipment”. It said “countless others” across HHS shared their concerns but “chose not to sign out of well-founded fear of retaliation and threats to personal safety”.

Up to 30 workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were placed on leave last week after they publicly signed a letter of dissent over Trump's dismantling of the agency and fears it would lead to a disaster like Hurricane Katrina in 2005.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

On display in Beijing were nuclear weapons launched by air, sea and land, laser weapons and four-legged drones

It was hardly a subtle attempt to project power. China showed off air-, sea- and land-launched nuclear weapons in its parade on Wednesday, a triad intended to demonstrate that Beijing's long-term aspiration is to match US military might.

Also on display were large underwater torpedo-like drones, intended to threaten western warships, as well as anti-drone lasers and four-legged “robot wolves”, all designed to be noticed, regardless of their actual military effectiveness.

Though China last fought a war in 1979 – a month-long conflict with Vietnam – it has been pursuing a sweeping military modernisation for a generation, increasing its defence budget by 13 times in dollar terms since the mid-1990s, while it threatens independent Taiwan with drills nearby.

At the heart of the parade was the nuclear formation, a deliberately ominous collection of missile launchers in batches of four on vast trucks, with easily visible designations written in the Roman alphabet to aid western observers.

China's Xinhua news agency said it was the first time Beijing had presented its nuclear triad, weapons it said were “China's strategic ‘ace' power to safeguard the country's sovereignty and nation's dignity”.

They included four new DF-61 intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles, each carried on 16 wheel trucks. It was unclear if they were armed. These were the “main surprise” for western analysts, according to Hans Kristensen, of the Federation of American Scientists.

The newly presented missile's range was roughly estimated at 7,500 miles based on its predecessor, the DL-41 – enough to reach Washington from Beijing. It is one of eight or nine Chinese ballistic missiles with an intercontinental range, raising questions of overkill. “How many ways do they have to be able to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile to deter?” Kristensen said.

Trundling along with it were new JL-3 ballistics for China's six Jin-class submarines with a range of 6,200 miles or more. And, to complete the triad, China's first-ever air-launched nuclear weapon, the JL-1, meaning Beijing joins a nuclear club composed of the US, Russia, India and probably Israel.

China's nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country's: it has an estimated 600 warheads, which is increasing at a rate of 100 a year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Its goal is to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to Washington, though even at that point Beijing's arsenal would be smaller than that of the US or Russia, both of which have more than 5,000 warheads in their stocks. However, such is the destructive power of nuclear weapons that a handful of warheads could kill hundreds of thousands, or more.

Other novel weapons shown off included two models of extra-large underwater drones, measuring 18 to 20 metres, including the AJX002, carried on specially elongated eight-wheeled trucks, part of a strategic weapons programme.

Their size means they are vastly different to the small sea drones that Ukraine has used in swarms to knock out vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet, and their capabilities are less than clear. But the intention is to pose a threat, and to be seen to be posing a threat, to the traditional US dominance of the Pacific.

Two types of laser air defence weapons were displayed, one for ships and one based on land, a cheaper means of fending off drones that western militaries are already hoping to use. Britain plans to fit four warships with a DragonFire laser from 2027, to better protect the vessels from drones used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

A handful of spindly four-legged land drones called robot wolves also attracted attention. However, if they could march, they were not allowed to, and instead were mounted on the back of other moving vehicles.

At a glance they appeared no more sophisticated than the growing number of land drones appearing on the battlefields of Ukraine, as remotely controlled fighters or trucks to rescue the wounded, though China's industrial capacity is such that a viable product could probably be made in vast numbers and possibly supplied to Russia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine's parliament passed in the first reading on Sept. 3 a draft law to legalize the country's virtual assets market and set out rules for taxation, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said.

Ukraine has one of the world's highest rates of cryptocurrency ownership, with around 16% of the population holding crypto assets before Russia's full-scale invasion, comparable to the U.S.

Despite its popularity, the market remains largely unregulated, with billions of dollars in annual transactions going untaxed.

The bill defines virtual assets as digital property that exists through blockchain technology. The assets would not be recognized as money or used as legal tender in Ukraine, but instead treated as movable property under civil law.

The draft sets a general taxation rate of 18% income tax and 5% military tax on transactions involving virtual assets. In the first year after the law comes into effect, withdrawals converted into traditional currency would be taxed at a preferential 5% rate.

The legislation was passed with the support of 246 lawmakers. Zhelezniak said further amendments will be introduced before the bill's second reading.

As artillery and bombs pound around Gaza's largest city and Israel promises a punishing new offensive, Palestinians in the city are paralyzed with fear – unsure where to go, when to leave and if they will ever return.

Israel has declared Gaza City, in the north of the territory, to be a combat zone while the military moves forward with plans to overtake it in a campaign to push Hamas into submission. Parts of the city are already considered “red zones,” where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.

That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the Israel-Hamas war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighbourhoods and Israeli leaders supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, departing the city now could mean leaving for good. Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, they say, could be deadly.

“The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red colour and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,” said Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians.

“So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.”

Ships carrying humanitarian aid and activists set sail from Barcelona to Gaza

Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction – some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly one million the U.N. estimates are in Gaza City – have left their homes in the city as of Monday, most to flee south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that co-ordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.

A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.

Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, said he can hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they “erase the area completely.”

Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighbourhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighbouring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by The Associated Press from early August and early September. The photos show that entire blocks that have been pummelled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.

“It's not something partial like before. It's 100 per cent,” he said. “The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.”

Palestinians say overcrowding in displacement camps across southern Gaza has worsened since the Israeli army last week declared northern Gaza and Gaza City a combat zone and ordered residents to evacuate.

The Associated Press

Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.

Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network, left his home in the upscale Rimal neighbourhood in the early days of the war and also returned there with his family in January. He, like Al Kurdi, said his family would likely leave Gaza City if their area receives an evacuation order.

But leaving this time would be different, he said. “Gaza will be levelled and destroyed. Last time, I had my car. There was fuel. Everyone had his income, his money.”

Back then, the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis still stood in southern Gaza.

Now, after months of bombardment, “there is no Rafah. Almost no Khan Younis,” Shawa said.

For others – medical workers, older and sick people – leaving Gaza City is nearly impossible.

“The elders, they're saying we will die here,” Shawa said. “This has pushed the other members of the family to stay, not to leave.”

“My aunt is elderly and can't walk, and my mother also struggles with mobility. We have so many belongings and no way to manage them. It feels unthinkable,” said Norhan Almuzaini, medical program officer in northern Gaza for the group Medical Aid for Palestinians.

Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighbourhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's centre.

Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began – three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.

When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City, she said: “I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometres.”

She paused, her voice breaking into tears.

“Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.”

Those who have left Gaza City over the past few months have found dire conditions elsewhere in Gaza. Their arrival has crowded already overflowing tent camps and sent prices of basic goods up.

Iman El-Naya, from Khan Younis, fled Gaza City three months ago. “The beach is crowded. Everywhere is crowded. There's no hygiene. It's a struggle to get water and food.”

“I go and stand in line for water. Getting bread is a struggle. Everything is even more expensive after the people from the north came here.”

Shorouk Abu Eid, a pregnant woman from Gaza City, was displaced to Khan Younis four months ago. She said the arrival of more people from the north is creating an even more tragic situation.

“There is no privacy, no peace of mind. Places I used to walk to in five or 10 minutes are taking me around an hour now because of the congestion. There's barely 10 centimetres between tents.”

Jamal Abu Reily lamented that the bathrooms are overflowing and that there's so little room for new arrivals.

“How are we going to all fit here? he asked. “Where are they going to stay? In the sea?”

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the program should wind down, speaking at a press conference in Mississauga, Ont. on Wednesday morning.Sammy Kogan/The Canadian Press

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the federal government to shut down the Temporary Foreign Worker program and immediately end the issuance of new permits, linking it to the rising youth unemployment rate, and saying it is flooding the job market with cheap labour. 

“Why aren't employers offering jobs to Canadian kids first? Why are they shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage labour?” he told reporters at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Wednesday morning. 

The Conservatives are proposing the creation of a separate, standalone program for “legitimately difficult-to-fill agricultural labour,” and to wind down the program gradually in regions with low unemployment rates. 

“We know why a foreign-owned mega-chain wants to be greedy – it's good for their corporate profits – but our immigration system doesn't exist to pad their bottom line,” Mr. Poilievre said. “That's why the government should immediately stop issuing new TFW permits, and end this wage-suppressing, opportunity-stealing program.”

The TFW program has been dogged in controversy for decades, largely due to allegations of worker abuse by employers. But it is a key immigration stream in Canada, and heavily used by agricultural employers and large retail and restaurant chains to fill a shortage of domestic labour. The government determines if employers are eligible to hire foreign labour by evaluating Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) applications – a document employers fill in to justify why they are unable to find local workers for the job. 

During the pandemic, the government expanded access to the program, resulting in a soaring number of LMIA approvals between 2022 and 2024. Ottawa has since tightened eligibility criteria in line with a policy goal of reducing the overall number of temporary residents in the country. 

Temporary foreign workers may get more flexibility to move jobs as Ottawa eyes changes to program

Federal government data shows that in the first half of 2025, 105,195 work permits were issued to workers entering Canada through the TFW program. By contrast, in 2024, there were more than 191,000 permits issued, and in 2023 there were approximately 183,000 permits issued. The Liberal government had targeted capping the number of TFW entries at 82,000 in 2025. 

In a statement to the Globe, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said that of the 105,195 permits, 33,722 were for new workers entering Canada, roughly 40 per cent of the total volume expected. 

The Liberal government has targeted capping the number of new TFW entries at 82,000 in 2025. 

At the Liberal Party's cabinet retreat in Toronto, Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized that the TFW program had a role to play in the economy. He said the government remains committed to reducing the proportion of temporary residents relative to the population, but noted that businesses are keen to have access to temporary foreign workers. 

“When I talk to businesses around the country, particularly in Quebec but elsewhere in the country, their number one issue is tariffs, and their number two issue is access to temporary foreign workers,” Mr. Carney said.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby group, condemned Mr. Poilievre's proposal to scrap the program, saying that there were “zero” employers of entry-level workers who use the program for cheap labour. 

“We have many parts of Canada – particularly in rural and remote communities – with very few available entry-level workers for jobs on which local people depend,” said Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, in a post on X.

Mr. Poilievre's criticism of the program as exploitative has been voiced for years by international human rights organizations and migrants rights groups. In particular, these groups disapprove of the closed work permit aspect of the program, which ties a worker's ability to work in Canada to a single employer. This design, critics say, increases a worker's dependence on the employer because they are unable to move jobs easily in instances of exploitation. 

In November of 2024, a parliamentary committee on citizenship and immigration recommended that Ottawa get rid of the closed work permit system entirely, and introduce regional or sector-specific work permits that would define sectors broadly, and provide workers with access to a wide range of employers. 

Separately, Employment and Social Development Canada – the ministry in charge of the TFW program – is exploring changes to the program that will see the introduction of a new stream-specific work permit for workers in the agricultural and fish processing industries. The work permit, which would be issued for two years, would allow workers to move between employers in the same sector as long as they have a new job offer. 

Syed Hussan, executive director of Migrant Rights Network, told The Globe that shutting down the program and creating a standalone temporary immigration stream for agricultural workers would still leave many temporary foreign workers in the country, because a significant number of TFWs work in agriculture.

In 2024, for example, roughly 78,000 foreign workers worked in agriculture, according to data from Statistics Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the total number of TFWs. 

“The issue is not how many people are here, it is what their rights and conditions are. If Pierre Poilievre really wants to end exploitation, he would create a path to permanent residency for temporary foreign workers who are stuck in a cycle of exploitation,” Mr. Hussan said. 

Mr. Poilievre's attempt to link the youth unemployment rate specifically to the Temporary Foreign Worker program is also debatable. In a recent note, Bank of Montreal chief economist Doug Porter said the rising youth jobless rate is related to the “extreme growth” in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds who have come to Canada as international students. “Unsurprisingly, when the youth population swells, it tends to drive up the youth jobless rate relative to others,” he wrote. 

In a recent interview with The Globe, Mikal Skuterud, a labour economist at the University of Waterloo, said that immigration is not the main driver of higher youth unemployment. Instead, he pointed to weak economic conditions and a sharp reduction in job vacancies that are making it tougher for people to secure employment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What is behind Indonesia's deadly protests?","https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-behind-indonesias-deadly-protests/a-73851059","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 01:31:01 GMT","

Indonesia is facing its worst unrest in decades. DW explores the root causes of the protests, the demands of demonstrators, and how civil society is responding to violent crackdowns.

A wave of protests in Indonesia turned violent last week after footage showed elite paramilitary police running over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan.

At least eight people have died, hundreds injured and more than 1,240 people have been arrested in the capital, Jakarta, since Thursday — and at least 20 people are missing, according to the KontraS rights group. 

The military was deployed across Jakarta on Monday as hundreds gathered outside parliament and clashes were reported in several other cities. Troops were also stationed along major streets in Surabaya, Bandung, Yogyakarta and Makassar, local reports said.

At the same time, civil society in the Southeast Asian archipelago has mobilized. Through social media and street demonstrations, a collective movement has taken shape.

The digital call spread quickly, amplified by public figures and influencers who circulated a list of demands to be met by the government within a week.

Indonesian authorities have since disabled TikTok's livestream feature, which had become a key platform for information-sharing and protest mobilization.

The current wave of demonstrations is rooted in long-standing structural pressures.

Mounting economic hardship, policies perceived as indifferent to the struggles of ordinary citizens and a political elite seen as lacking empathy have all converged to fuel public anger. 

World Bank data shows that about 60% of Indonesia's workforce still depends on the informal sector, without stable income or social protection.

This has been worsened by a shrinking middle class: millions slipping into lower-income brackets or outright poverty.

According to figures from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), nearly 10 million Indonesians experienced downward mobility in the past five years.

Meanwhile, food prices have surged, job opportunities narrowed, and more than 42,000 workers have been laid off since early 2025.

In June, the Indonesian government even stopped releasing official layoff data, citing concerns over ""public panic."" 

Amid these realities, a viral video of lawmakers dancing during the August annual parliamentary session became a potent symbol of elitist detachment.

Public anger deepened when parliament approved a housing allowance hike of up to 50 million rupiah (around €2,600/$3,000) per month, boosting lawmakers' already lavish compensation packages — starkly contrasting with Indonesia's per-capita monthly income of just 6.5 million rupiah, according to 2024 government data.

A 1994 Ministry of Finance decree still grants public officials a special tax allowance exempting them from paying personal income tax.

The situation reached a breaking point on Thursday when Affan Kurniawan, a motorcycle taxi driver, was fatally struck by an armored vehicle during a protest crackdown.

Affan, who struggled daily to survive on a modest income, became a tragic symbol of how marginalized Indonesians are being crushed under economic pressure.

The mass protests have carried several demands, including a call to cancel the proposed increase in allowances for members of parliament.

As violence against demonstrators intensified, the list of demands expanded. Citizens began rallying around a movement known as ""17+8."" 

Protesters are urging the government to address 17 urgent issues within a week. These include forming a team to investigate the killing of Affan Kurniawan, ending military involvement in civilian security, releasing detained demonstrators, prosecuting officers responsible for violence in the protests, and halting police brutality. 

Citizens also outlined eight structural demands, including reforming Indonesia's parliament, political parties, and national police institutions. They have requested the government to address their demands within a year.  

""At the very least, the points on parliamentary reform must be implemented. Otherwise, we will remain in this same position in the years to come,"" said Jovial da Lopez, a participant in the mass demonstrations. 

The demands were voiced not only by residents in Indonesia but also by Indonesians living abroad, including in Germany. 

""This is our expression of solidarity with friends in Indonesia. The demonstration also serves as a way to share information about what is happening there, as Indonesia is currently facing serious challenges,"" said Walter Ng, an Indonesian student based in Berlin. 

Walter and his peers echoed the same concerns raised by demonstrators in Indonesia.

""We call for an end to violence and brutality committed by security forces against civilians,"" Walter told DW.

""We also urge the government to halt tax increases that are placing greater pressure on the public. Furthermore, we demand the creation of space for dialogue and the protection of freedom of expression without intimidation or discrimination in any form."" 

On Sunday, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto summoned ministers to the State Palace and delivered remarks regarding the demonstrations. In his speech, Prabowo said that some actions in rallies amounted to ""treason and terrorism.""

Political communication expert from Padjadjaran University, Kunto Adi Wibowo, argued that Prabowo has yet to acknowledge the structural crisis affecting society.

""The president failed to identify the root causes. He does not recognize the existence of a crisis and views the tragedy during the protests as a non-systemic issue. This perspective is problematic,"" Kunto said. 

Prabowo also instructed the Indonesian National Police and the Indonesian National Armed Forces to take firm action against individuals involved in violence during the demonstrations.

Since then, military personnel have been stationed at various locations and have conducted night patrols, particularly in areas frequently used for protests. 

""The military is not trained to respond to peaceful protests,"" said deputy director of Amnesty International Indonesia, Wirya Adiwena. 

""They are trained for warfare and national defense,"" Wirya told DW. ""That is not the appropriate role when dealing with civilian demonstrations. So when the military is deployed to respond to public protests, how does the government perceive its citizens?""

President Prabowo also pledged to promote police officers who were injured while securing the demonstrations.

""Prabowo is siding with repressive forces by granting privileges and high praise to police and military personnel. This has further angered civilians and reflects a lack of sensitivity,"" Kunto said. 

Political and legal analysts have expressed concern that the state's militaristic approach could lead to impunity for law enforcement agencies. Amnesty International's Wirya is among them.

""Security forces may feel that violence is justified. Violence against individuals or families defending their rights is being normalized by the state,"" Wirya said.

Social media platforms have been flooded with posts offering free psychological counseling, medical services, legal aid, emergency contacts for missing persons and donation channels to help meet the needs of protest participants. 

Ordinary citizens have consistently shared messages online encouraging mutual care, rejecting racially charged provocations, verifying information and maintaining focus on demands directed at the government. 

""There is a growing call among citizens to build an empathy-driven movement and keep the focus on push back against authoritarian practices implemented by the state,"" said Wirya. 

Solidarity efforts have extended beyond Indonesia's borders, reaching neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. 

""The support from friends across Southeast Asia has been remarkable. Netizens from Malaysia and Thailand have even sent food to motorcycle taxi drivers,"" said Kunto, who also researches how social media informs political attitudes. 

""This solidarity transcends national boundaries.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Poles in the Wehrmacht: traitors or victims of Nazi Germany?","https://www.dw.com/en/poles-in-the-wehrmacht-traitors-or-victims-of-nazi-germany/a-73867717","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:16:08 GMT","

Up to 450,000 Poles served in the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany, during World War II. For years, they were viewed in Poland as traitors. But as an exhibition in Gdansk shows, the truth is more complicated.

Anyone entering the first room of the exhibition ""Our Boys"" in the Main Town Hall branch of the Museum of Gdansk is greeted by dozens of photos showing young men in the uniform of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.

Some of the men in the photos are smiling; some look extremely serious; some look sad.

At first glance, these photos are nothing out of the ordinary, considering that a total of 17 million men were called up to fight in the Nazi army between 1939 and 1945.

But these photos are unusual because they show citizens of Nazi-occupied Poland wearing the military uniform of the hated enemy's army.

The name of the exhibition, ""Our Boys,"" was taken from the title of a similar exhibition in Luxembourg.

The Gdansk exhibition addresses the subject of Polish citizens who served in Adolf Hitler's army — a matter that was long considered taboo in Poland and was for decades not spoken about, and even concealed.

""These were people from here: our boys, in other words. Their families still live here to this day,"" explains the museum.

Right-wing conservatives in Poland reacted to the opening of the exhibition in mid-July with hostility and indignation.

Poland's then president, Andrzej Duda, posted on X that to portray soldiers of the Third Reich as ""ours"" was both a ""historical falsehood"" and a ""moral provocation.""

""As a nation, the Poles were victims of German occupation and German terror, not perpetrators or participants,"" said Duda.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, also responded, calling the exhibition a ""blow to the Polish reason of state"" and saying that it ""called historic facts into question.""

PiS politicians with a banner emblazoned with the word ""traitors"" demonstrated outside the museum on the day the exhibition opened.

Even Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, deputy prime minister and minister of national defense in the center-left government of Donald Tusk, noted that the ""Our Boys"" exhibition did not serve Poland's politics of remembrance.

The wave of online hate toward the exhibition's organizers was so great that security measures had to be stepped up.

""Poland's politics of remembrance are very black and white: There are heroes or traitors,"" Andrzej Gierszewski, press officer for the Museum of Gdansk and one of the exhibition's curators, told DW. ""We wanted to show that there are nuances: the tragic fate of people who were put under brutal pressure in 1939.""

After Nazi Germany occupied Poland in the fall of 1939, large parts of Polish territory were unlawfully integrated into the Third Reich, including the regions of Pomerania (where Gdansk is located), Western Poland (including the cities of Poznan and Lodz) and Upper Silesia.

Prominent members of Polish society in these annexed areas — politicians, clerics, civil servants and teachers — were either murdered or sent to concentration camps.

Tens of thousands of Polish men and women were killed in this first wave of terror.

In the course of the ""Germanization"" process, all sections of the population that were seen by the occupiers as ""superfluous"" were displaced.

People whom the German authorities considered ""capable of being germanized"" were added to the German People's List (Deutsche Volksliste).

Being on this list came with certain privileges — including German citizenship that was restricted to ten years — but also obligations, including above all compulsory military service.

The German authorities alone decided who was put on the German People's List.

Those who did not make it onto the list faced retaliatory measures or could even be sent to a concentration camp.

By the end of the war, 2.9 million people in occupied Poland were on the German People's List.

As the situation on the fronts deteriorated for the Wehrmacht — especially after the defeat at Stalingrad in early 1943 — more new ""cannon fodder"" was needed.

Those who were called up faced an appalling choice: They could refuse to serve and go into hiding — which would have caused horrific trouble for their families, including being sent to concentration camps — or they could accept their fate and serve.

Most deserters who were apprehended were guillotined.

Almost 90,000 Polish Wehrmacht soldiers defected to the British and American armed forces on the western front. They later fought in Allied Polish units against Nazi Germany.

After the war, Poles whose names were on the German People's List were considered traitors. Some were convicted as collaborators.

This is why Poles who had served in the Wehrmacht did not speak about their past and hid or destroyed incriminating documentation. Family photos were altered to hide uniforms.

Many residents of Pomerania and Silesia lived with the trauma of being seen as second-class citizens.

Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk experienced firsthand that the past can be dangerous — even decades after the fact.

When Tusk ran for president in 2005, supporters of his opponent, Lech Kaczynski, claimed that Tusk's grandfather had volunteered for the Wehrmacht.

In reality, Jozef Tusk was forcibly conscripted in 1944 and defected to the Western allies after just under four months.

""Poland's historical memory is shaped and dominated by the center, Warsaw. The experience of people on the periphery — in places like Pomerania or Upper Silesia — is ignored,"" says historian Ryszard Kaczmarek.

In this way, he says, millions of people have been excluded from Poland's historical memory.

The lively debate about the exhibition within Polish society shows that a discussion of this subject is long overdue. Many people donated valuable documents and mementos to the exhibition's curators: photos, letters, uniforms and even iron crosses (a military decoration conferred by Nazi Germany for bravery during World War II) that had been kept hidden for decades.

After the first wave of protest against the exhibition, which was fueled by the political opposition, the situation calmed down. Visitors have the opportunity to write their opinion of the exhibition on pieces of paper in the final room.

The majority of comments are positive. ""I read and saw — and am grateful,"" wrote one visitor.

“Trump is claiming the right to conduct extra-judicial assassinations,” a civil rights attorney posted on X.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Experts are condemning the U.S. military strike that killed 11 people on a boat in the Caribbean on Tuesday, saying that the bombing was in violation of international law. The Trump administration has claimed — without providing evidence — that the casualties of the strike were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that it has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” 

The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. “TERRORISTS ELIMINATED. ADIÓS,” the post says, with an emoji of a person placing items in the trash.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the U.S. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.”

The Trump administration has circulated a brief black and white video that it says shows the fatal strike. AP reports that the White House “did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members.” The outlet also noted that the video “is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people” and “did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.”

Experts say the administration's deadly strike violated international law.

“Labeling someone a terrorist and deploying the military does not make them a military target,” Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to Truthout. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.” 

“Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is now at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture, in the context of the government's so-called “war on drugs” campaign.

“Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday.

Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.”

Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela's government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military's presence near the country. The Trump administration has also frequently accused people of belonging to Tren de Aragua to justify violations of their human rights. 

Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador's notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. The administration repeatedly accused the men of being Tren de Aragua members, despite the fact that a majority did not have criminal convictions. 

After four months, they were sent home to Venezuela in a prisoner swap deal between Venezuela and the United States. The men, including a soccer coach, a makeup artist, and a musician, have reported that they were physically and psychologically tortured at the prison. 

On September 2, an appeals court ruled that the Trump administration could not use the 18th century-era law to expedite removals of people it accused of being Tren de Aragua members. Before Trump, the law had been used just three times in American history — during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. It was last invoked to justify the internment of thousands of people with Japanese ancestry during World War II.

President Donald Trump says he could deploy the National Guard to fight crime in New Orleans after previously saying troops might be going into Chicago and Baltimore amid his ongoing federal crackdown in the nation's capital.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard to fight crime, potentially expanding the number of cities around the nation where he may send federal law enforcement.

Trump has already said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore following his administration deploying troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month. 

“So we're making a determination now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

Trump now frequently boasts about turning Washington into a “safe zone.” The White House reports more than 1,760 arrests citywide since the president first announced he was mobilizing federal forces on Aug. 7. 

But Washington is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to attempt to quell crime in other Democratic-controlled cities around the country would represent an important escalation. 

Trump's latest comments came a day after he declared “We're going in” and suggested that the National Guard might soon be headed for Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and Baltimore. That's despite state and local officials, as well as many residents, both places staunchly opposing the idea. 




New Orleans, however, is a Democrat-controlled in a red state run by Landry. 

“So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks,” Trump said. “It'll take us two weeks, easier than D.C.”

Shortly after Trump's comments, Landry said on social media, “We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” 

But city leaders immediately balked at the idea. 

“Crime is down in New Orleans,” City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, who is also a mayoral candidate, said via text message. “That would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!”

Councilmember Jean-Paul Morrell said it is “ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it.”

“Guardsmen are not trained law enforcement. They can't solve crimes, they can't interview witnesses and they aren't trained to constitutionally police,” Morrell said in a statement. “NOPD is doing a great job with the existing resources they have. Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.”

The City of New Orleans issued its own more conciliatory statement, saying “our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events” and that local officials “remain committed to sustaining this momentum.” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted last month on federal fraud charges and is set to be arraigned in the coming weeks.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly railed against Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for not requesting that the National Guard be deployed. 

“We could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago. If we don't have the support of some of these politicians, but I'll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago,” Trump said Wednesday. 

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have been adamant in saying Chicago doesn't need or want military intervention. In Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore have remained similarly opposed. 

In Washington, Mayor Muriel Bowser has said Trump's decision to take over her city's police force and flood streets with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in reducing violent crime — but she's also argued that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more city police officers in service.

President Donald Trump defended the lethal U.S. strike on a Venezuelan vessel Tuesday, saying the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States. “Obviously, they won't be doing it again,” Trump said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday justified the lethal military strike that his administration said was carried out a day earlier against a Venezuelan gang as a necessary effort by the United States to send an unmistakable message to Latin American cartels.

Asked why the military did not instead interdict the vessel and capture those on board, Trump said the operation would cause drug smugglers to think twice about trying to move drugs into the U.S.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said while hosting Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

Tuesday's strike was an astonishing departure from typical U.S. drug interdiction efforts at a time when Trump has ordered a major Navy buildup in the waters near Venezuela.

Later Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that such operations “will happen again.”

Rubio said previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked in stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and beyond.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Rubio said on a visit to Mexico.




Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on “Fox & Friends” that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was running his country “as a kingpin of a drug narco-state.”

Hegseth said officials “knew exactly who was in that boat” and “exactly what they were doing.” But the Republican administration has not presented any evidence supporting Trump's claim that operators of the vessel were from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were trying to smuggle in drugs.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not seen,” said Hegseth, who declined to detail how the strike was carried out. 

Trump and administration officials have repeatedly blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some American cities.

The president on Tuesday repeated his claim — contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment — that Tren de Aragua is operating under Maduro's control.

In announcing the strike, Trump said the operation, which he said killed 11, was carried out in international waters. He also noted that the gang is designated by the U.S. government as a foreign terrorist organization.

Unlike its counterparts from Colombia, Brazil and Central America, Tren de Aragua has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, which last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.

“We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,” said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime, referring to the Venezuelan gang by its initials.

Still, with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for Tren de Aragua to one day delve deeper into the drug trade, he said. Meanwhile, the rhetoric from officials in Washington who would blame TdA as a proxy for all Venezuelan drug traffickers assures it will remain a target of intense U.S. government focus.

“It is almost impossible today to determine who is TdA and who is not,” said McDermott. “Deportations and statements from the United States suggest that TdA is now being used as a catch-all description for Venezuelan criminals acting abroad.”

Some international warfare experts are questioning the legality of the strike.

“Intentional killing outside armed conflict hostilities is unlawful unless it is to save a life immediately,” said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an expert on international law and the use of force at the University of Notre Dame Law School. “No hostilities were occurring in the Caribbean.”

Hegseth was opaque in his comments on Fox about whether Trump was looking to press for “regime change” in Venezuela.

“Well, that's a presidential decision,” Hegseth said. He added that “anyone would prefer that” Maduro “would just give himself up. But that's a presidential-level decision.”

The U.S. announced plans last month to boost its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels.

Maduro's government has responded by deploying troops along Venezuela's coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.

Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Tuesday's strike clearly shows governments in the region, not only Maduro, the paradigm shift brought on by the U.S. decision to declare Tren de Aragua and Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

“This is a United States that sees security differently,” Berg said. “They've just demonstrated the ability to use deadly force in the Western Hemisphere, and they've already told Mexico that they're going to do the same thing on Mexican territory if they don't get the level of cooperation that they want.”

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse made their voices heard Tuesday on Capitol Hill, pressuring lawmakers to force the release of the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier and pushing back President Donald Trump's effort to dismiss the issue as a “hoax.”

Four Republicans — three of them women — have defied House GOP leadership and the White House in an effort to force a vote on a bill that would require the Justice Department to release the contents of the so-called Epstein files, with the exception of the victims' personal information. Two more Republicans will need to defect from party leadership and join every House Democrat to force the vote.

Survivors and accusers of Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, gathered on the Capitol lawn along with hundreds of supporters to demand the Trump administration provide transparency and accountability for what they endured as teenagers.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to quash the effort by putting forward his own resolution and arguing that a concurrent investigation by the House Oversight Committee is the best way for Congress to deliver transparency. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the matter as a “Democrat hoax.”

Other news we're following today:








The head of the FBI was in Cincinnati on Wednesday to help prosecutors and investigators announce a recent grand jury indictment targeting 22 Chinese suspects and four Chinese companies for allegedly shipping to the U.S. chemicals used to prepare fentanyl for sale.

FBI Director Kash Patel said he was in southern Ohio “to break the wheel of fentanyl trafficking in the United States of America.”

Authorities allege three people in Ohio were involved in obtaining several pounds of illegal cutting agents, which are used to increase the weight and potency of fentanyl. Indictments in the drug and money laundering case were handed up Tuesday.

It is unusual for an FBI director to travel outside of Washington to announce criminal charges, but Patel's presence was meant to underscore how the fight against drug trafficking has emerged as a top law enforcement priority for the Trump administration.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said he supports President Trump's suggestion to send federal troops to the state.

“We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” Landry said in an X post.

Landry has not responded to questions from The Associated Press about whether he requested that Trump send in federal troops.

New Orleans city council leaders and several mayoral candidates have rejected the need for federal troops, pointing to the city's plummeting crime rate this year.

But the office of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city's police released a joint statement thanking the federal government for its support.

“Our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events for a world-class city,” the statement said. “The City of New Orleans and NOPD remain committed to sustaining this momentum, ensuring that every neighborhood continues to feel the impact of these combined efforts.”

Cantrell, a Democrat, was federally indicted last month for allegedly lying about a relationship with her bodyguard

The president's political team sent out a fundraising email on Wednesday that said, “Chicago will be liberated” and “We're going into Chicago.”

The email pitch repeats some of Trump's remarks on Tuesday about his plans to order federal authorities to Chicago and then suggests people make a $15 donation “to join MAGA blitz.”

Federal officials have agreed to restore health- and science-related webpages and data following a lawsuit settlement with doctors' groups and other organizations.

The settlement was announced this week by the Washington State Medical Association, the lead plaintiffs in the case.

Soon after President Donald Trump's inauguration, federal health officials deleted information on topics like pregnancy risks and opioid-use disorder. This was in response to a Trump executive order to stop using the term “gender” in federal policies.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to restore more than 100 websites and resource.

Rubio dodged questions about if the people in the boat were warned before they were bombed, or if the government is concerned about raising the hackles of Latin American governments, some who perceive the strike as a shift back to the U.S. forcefully intervening in affairs in the region.

“We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. “It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen anymore.”

Rubio added that Trump as commander-in-chief has the authority “under exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.”

The House has rejected a Republican resolution to censure Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey and remove her from the House Homeland Security Committee.

The House voted 215-207 to set aside the censure resolution, with a handful of Republicans joining with Democrats in rejecting the effort.

The vote came after Republicans sought to punish McIver for a confrontation with federal law enforcement during a congressional visit to a new immigration detention facility in her home state.

McIver has pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside the facility in Newark in May.

Asked about details of the extraordinary strike that took place Tuesday, Rubio once again deflected operational details about how the U.S. confirmed it was a drug cartel in the boat or that they were heading toward the U.S. to the Pentagon.

But, Rubio went on to defend the operation, saying that previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Rubio said, adding that it is just the beginning of a larger U.S. operation in the region.

“We have seen those numbers drop historically, and that would not have been possible without the close cooperation between our two governments,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday. 

The positive tone and complimentary language toward Mexico reflects a shift for the Trump administration as it escalates its efforts to target drug cartels.

Eleanor Holmes Norton, 88, has made very few public appearances during the surge of federal law enforcement authorities and the National Guard although her office has been active in introducing legislation to end the use of military personnel and surge.

At a time when the city's authority to govern itself has been threatened, public pushback by its officials has been one of the few recourses to challenge Trump's move.

Norton, who has been the representative for the district since 1991, made the rare appearance Wednesday to slam Trump's takeover. She said the move has turned residents into “props in a political play to showcase his own power.”

Norton, long a champion of D.C. statehood and self-governance, was at the 1963 March on Washington as a 26-year-old Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker. She has been visibly slower in her public appearances this year.

As delegate, she is a non-voting member of Congress and requires close ties with allies in Congress.

House Republicans are standing up a select committee to re-investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, as they continue to contest what happened after Trump sent a mob of supporters to fight the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

The new panel, with eight members to be chosen by the House speaker, will have subpoena power to compel witness testimony. It is expected to produce a report of its investigation by Dec. 31, 2026.

Trump was impeached for inciting the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, but later acquitted.

While in Mexico City, Rubio said he was happy to see “the level of commitment” between U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime after meeting with President Sheinbaum.

“There are no other governments cooperating more” than the U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime,” Rubio said during a press conference Wednesday. “It's the closest cooperation we've ever had, maybe between any country, but definitely between the U.S. and Mexico.”

The U.S. and Mexican governments announced Wednesday that they were reaffirming their commitment to work together to strengthen security, combat cartels and stop trafficking along the border and fuel theft.

It comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was visiting Mexico City, meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and holding a news conference with Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente.

The leaders stopped short of initially announcing a formal agreement, which Sheinbaum has spent weeks pushing for. The governments said they established a “high-level implementation” to make sure new commitments were fulfilled. Mexico and the U.S. were already working together closely to combat cartels and fentanyl trafficking.

They said their relationship is “based on the principles of reciprocity, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, shared and differentiated responsibility, as well as mutual trust.”

A White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump was referring to Zelenskyy earlier. 

Trump in the Oval Office told reporters, “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly,” regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, but it wasn't clear if he meant Zelenskyy or Putin.

New Orleans city leaders recoiled at the notion of sending federal troops into the Big Easy, as President Trump suggested on Wednesday.

“It's ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it,” said City Council President J.P. Morrell. “Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.”

While Trump said New Orleans has a “crime problem,” city leaders point out that crime rates have dropped considerably this year. Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, according to the New Orleans Police Department.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last year, Landry established a state police force to operate in New Orleans. He also convened a special legislative session focused on combating crime, leading to harsher penalties.

New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch says she was “very direct” with the attorney general about her opposition to an enhanced federal law enforcement presence in the city.

“My message was we got this. We don't want or need the help of the National Guard in New York City,” Tisch said in an interview on a local ABC station Wednesday.

Tisch added that a federal deployment “creates real safety problems for us at the NYPD” and that “our National Guard are not trained to handle street crime in New York City.”

President Donald Trump this week said he's ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago and Baltimore, following similar actions in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles.

While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year.

Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. And murders had been reduced by a third, even when including the 14 victims of a Jan. 1 truck attack.

New Orleans City Council Vice President Helena Moreno condemned any notion of sending federal troops to New Orleans.

“This is about scare tactics and politicizing public safety,” said Moreno, the frontrunner in the mayor's race. “Ultimately leading to the misuse of public funds and resources to attempt to score political points. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.”

Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement.

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the strike on a boat carrying drugs from Venezuela shows that the U.S. will not tolerate drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.

He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.”

“And it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said.

Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser's announcement comes as the nation's capital looks to emerge from President Trump's federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Bowser's deal with the city's police officers includes a 13% pay increase as well as other incentives such as cost-of-living increases and an expanded take-home car program. Bowser has sought to add at least 500 officers for years, often publicly struggling with the D.C. Council over the issue. The department currently contains 3,188 sworn officers, with Bowser looking to boost that number up to around 4,000.

Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service.

“We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. “We don't need a presidential emergency.”

Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, along with Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, traveled to Houston to announce the seizure.

Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. After their seizure, the chemicals were brought to the Port of Houston.

The Trump administration has designated eight Latin American crime organizations, including the Sinaloa drug cartel, as “foreign terrorist organizations.” This gave Pirro's office the authority to execute the seizure under the terrorism forfeiture provision.

Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case.

“I'm having a conversation with him very shortly, and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said. He did not clarify if he was talking about Putin or Zelenskyy.

The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be.

Still, he said that the bloodshed in eastern Europe has to end, and expressed confidence that he'll be able to bring the conflict to a close.

“Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. He added, “They not soldiers from my country. This is my country. But I have a power to end things.”

After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans.

“So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

State and local officials, many of whom are top Democrats, have sharply opposed troop presence in Chicago and Baltimore. Landry, though, is a Republican.

The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”

Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans.

“They're bringing us together as a country,” Khanna said, of the stories of accusers, gesturing toward Greene with a smile. “I've never done a press conference with Marjorie before.”

Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment.

Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.

Their meeting Wednesday in Mexico City comes a day after Trump dramatically stepped up his administration's military role in the Caribbean with what he called a deadly strike on a Venezuelan drug cartel.

Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power.

“We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said.

Speaking to reporters before the Rubio meeting, she said what her administration planned to agree to with the United States is a “cooperation program about border security and the application of the law within the framework of our (respective) sovereignties.”

The president pushed back when asked why the U.S. carried out a lethal strike on a Venezuelan drug-carrying vessel on Tuesday instead of interdicting it and capturing the alleged smugglers. 

Trump said the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

The president said that “thousands and thousands of documents” had been released but that the “Democratic hoax” would continue.

“No matter what you do it's going to keep going,” Trump said. He added, “Really, I think it's enough.”

Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. And, while numerous documents have been released as part of the Epstein investigations, the majority contained information that was already public.

Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. One accuser asked Trump to come meet her at the Capitol so she could explain while the issue wasn't a hoax.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.”

Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.”

He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. China held a parade to recognize the 80th anniversary of the war ending.

The U.S. sanctioned a Chinese firm and its representatives on Wednesday, accusing them of involvement in making and selling synthetic opioids to Americans.

The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. 

“Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.”

China-based chemical companies are the primary source of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids entering the United States, regularly through Mexico.

People identifying themselves as Epstein accusers are calling on Trump for his help in making public remaining documents in the case.

Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.”

The political clash over calls for releasing the files has flummoxed House Republican leadership and been a sticking point for the Trump administration.

Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department, but they mostly contain information already publicly known.

The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison.

Lee Gelernt, who argued for the ACLU, said the use of “a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. This ruling will not be the final say on this matter. We are confident in our position, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”

The U.S. leader greeted his Polish counterpart at the South Portico of the White House with a hearty shoulder slap and exchange of big smiles.

The two stood side-by-side as four F-35 fighter jets flew over the White House, followed by another formation of four F-16s.

Trump and Nawrocki then went inside together.

The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. IT WILL END!”

He did not offer any additional comment.

Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Ukrainian officials will “try to connect” with President Trump to hear about new ways to increase pressure on Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.”

“When we speak about pressure, we mean air defense, we mean weapon deals, we mean drone production, and of course, of course, sanctions,” the Ukrainian leader said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

“Such signals we gave (the) president of the United States. He said ‘couple of weeks', and he will answer on this,” Zelenskyy said of Trump. “'Couple of weeks', in my understanding, it's two weeks or maximum three weeks. This Monday, two weeks ended.”

Attorneys for some alleged victims of Epstein and Maxwell also appeared alongside the lawmakers, in support of the discharge petition.

The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly.

Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke.

Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition.

A bipartisan set of House lawmakers has appealed to their colleagues to support a discharge petition that could force a House vote requiring the Department of Justice to release its Epstein files.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage.

“There is something that is rotten in Washington,” Khanna said. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”

The lawmakers spoke a day after the House Oversight Committee publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department on the sex trafficking investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. The files mostly contained information that was already publicly known or available, but the release showed lawmakers' eagerness to act on the issue, quickly reviving a political clash that has flummoxed House Republican leadership and roiled the Trump administration.

Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, another proponent of the petition, along with Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says when Trump called him recently to discuss the novel idea he thought: “That's genius.”

The idea is to give Republicans a chance to make their case to voters, who tend to reject the party in power during midterm cycles. Republicans are struggling to hold onto their majority in Congress.

Besides, the speaker added, Trump “loves a big show.”

They're working with Senate Republican Leader John Thune to make it happen.

“I think that's a done deal now,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a social media post by Trump on Wednesday that said he was conspiring with the leaders of North Korea and China against the United States.

Asked about the post at a news conference in Beijing, the Russian leader told journalists “the President of the United States is not without a sense of humor.”

“Over these four days, during negotiations of all kinds, both in formal and informal settings, no one has ever expressed any negative judgments on the current American administration,” Putin said.

Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a four-day visit. He took part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, held extensive talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with other leaders, and attended a military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also present at the parade. Kim and Putin held talks after the event.

The Russian leader also said everyone with whom he had spoken during his visit to China had “supported our meeting in Anchorage,” and expressed their hope that negotiations would end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

House Republicans emerged from a private meeting with White House officials rebranding Trump's signature bill: The Working Families Tax Cuts Act.

“We're so excited about that,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting.

Polling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.

The gathering comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers calls for the House to take up their bill that would force the Department of Justice to release its investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

It's an unusual grouping of lawmakers, including Republicans Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Democrat Ro Khanna. They're trying to use a rarely-used legislative maneuver to force a vote on their bill against the wishes of House Republican leadership.

“A nation that allows rich and powerful men to traffic and abuse young girls without consequence is a nation that has lost its moral and spiritual core,” Khanna said.

Around the news conference, a large crowd gathered with signs that said, “Believe the survivors,” and “Unlock the Epstein files.”

White House officials headed to Capitol Hill to huddle privately with House Republicans, sharing polling from Trump's political team as they frame their public messaging ahead of a busy fall session.

Attendance was mandatory at the basement session, a sign of Trump's grip on the GOP.

Despite their legislative success in passing Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts bill into law, Republicans held few town hall meetings this summer as they retool their pitch to voters.

The images from China offer a striking, maybe even sinister, message that there could be a new reconfiguration of rising power in Eurasia, an “Axis of Upheaval,” as one U.S. analyst has called it.

But there's also evidence that the events in Beijing are simply more of the self-interested, high-level jockeying that has marked regional power politics for decades:

Two days earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping huddled together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

The gatherings in China could be read as a defiant message to the United States and its allies. At the very least, they offered yet more evidence of a burgeoning shift away from a U.S.-dominated, Western-led world order, as Trump withdraws America from many of its historic roles and roils economic relationships with tariffs.

“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump posted in a social media message to Xi.

U.S. employers posted 7.2 million job vacancies in July, down from 7.4 million in June, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that layoffs rose slightly, and that the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was almost unchanged from June at 3.2 million.

The U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly due to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve and partly because Trump's trade wars have created uncertainty that is paralyzing managers making hiring decisions. The economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023.

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and their families are rallying in front of the Capitol as they press Congress to force more disclosure in the criminal investigation into the late financier.

A political clash is unfolding in the House over how Congress should proceed in a matter that has rattled both House Republican leadership and the Trump administration. On Wednesday, speakers at the rally often grew emotional as they recounted how they were lured into Epstein's abuse, and they demanded government accountability for the actions of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

“Our demands are clear,” said Sky Roberts, whose late sister Virginia Giuffre was an outspoken survivor. “Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her life. No leniency. No deals. No special treatment.”

Survivors also demanded that the Epstein files be released publicly and that anyone complicit be held accountable.

The special session agenda set by Kehoe also includes proposed changes to Missouri's ballot measure process.

One key change would make it harder for ballot initiatives to succeed. If approved by voters, Missouri's constitution would be amended so that all future ballot measures would need not only a majority of the statewide vote but also a majority of the votes in each congressional district in order to pass.

If such a standard had been in place last year, an abortion-rights amendment to the state constitution would have failed. That measure narrowly passed statewide on the strength of “yes” votes in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas but failed in rural congressional districts.

Missouri lawmakers are meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional map in ways that could improve the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress next year. The session was called by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and should run at least a week.

Missouri is the third state to pursue mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican lawmakers in Texas, prodded by Trump, was the first, approving a new map that increases the Republicans advantage in five more districts.

Democratic-led California fought back, asking voters to approve in November a plan to give Democrats a chance at winning five more seats.

Tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Florida's tuition waiver law was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling one of her signature achievements shows how much politics have shifted.

More than 6,500 students qualified for the waiver in Florida before DeSantis signed the bill revoking it as of July 1. At the University of Florida, a state resident pays about $6,380 in tuition, compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Now some of these students have switched to online programs to finish their degrees, and staying at home to avoid being detained.

Rubio is in Mexico City as President Claudia Sheinbaum was convening a security forum of all 32 Mexican governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor's office and security commanders. “Under no circumstance will we accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is detrimental to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the country,” she said Monday in her State of the Nation address.

Sheinbaum had been talking up a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that would protect Mexican sovereignty while combatting the flow of fentanyl north and weapons south. Sheinbaum sought to lower expectations Tuesday, saying it would be more like a memorandum of understanding to share intelligence.

“It is a relationship of respect and at the same time collaboration,” Sheinbaum said.

Trump suggested otherwise last month, saying: “Mexico does what we tell them to do.” 

All these hot-button issues for the Trump administration and its neighbors will top the secretary of state's agenda this week on his third trip to Latin America since becoming chief U.S. diplomat.

The trip comes as the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, including military deployments and what it said was a lethal strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel.

In talks with leaders in Mexico and Ecuador on Wednesday and Thursday, Rubio will make the case that broader, deeper cooperation with the U.S. is key to improving health, safety and security. But Trump has alienated allies in the region with persistent demands, threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions.

A man has been arrested after police said he placed incendiary devices near a local fire station in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.

Slater Chaia of District Heights, Maryland, has been charged with possession of a destructive device and possession of incendiary material with intent to create a destructive device, both felonies, stemming from incidents of littering Capitol Heights Fire Station 805 with what a criminal complaint called ""makeshift Molotov cocktails."" He also faces a reckless endangerment charge. 

Surveillance video shows him walking up to the fire station's property with two plastic bottles, and putting both on the ground next to a flagpole. He then moves one of the bottles to the pavement a few feet away from the mailbox, according to the video. He then allegedly retreats back to the flagpole, grabs the second bottle and walks to the mailbox and places it inside.

He was caught on surveillance footage on Aug. 13 at around 8 a.m., but according to WUSA9, there were two more instances of Chaia placing devices near the station, one on June 1, and another on July 15. Neither of those were caught on video. 

Police posted photos of the distinctive Tom and Jerry cartoon-themed Members Only jacket Chaia was wearing in the footage. 

The bottles reportedly contained an incendiary liquid and a wick.

According to NBC 4 Washington, police believe that the fire station was specifically targeted, but they do not know why. 

""God forbid one of our young people get ahold of one of these devices and become harmed,"" Prince George's County Bureau of Homeland Security Deputy Chief James McCreary said.

McCreary said the first devices were ineffective, but they were becoming more dangerous.

There's a Sununu in New Hampshire who is considering a run for the Senate in next year's midterm elections.

But it isn't former Gov. Chris Sununu, who earlier this year considered but decided against launching a bid in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in the key New England swing state.

It's former Sen. John E. Sununu, one of Chris Sununu's older brothers.

Top national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have held conversations with the former senator regarding a 2026 Senate campaign, a source told Fox News on Wednesday. 

RISING REPUBLICAN STAR ASHLEY HINSON LAUNCHES SENATE BID TO SUCCEED IOWA'S ERNST

 (Paul Steinhauser - FoxNews)

A source familiar with the conversations confirmed to Fox News that Thune and former Sen. Cory Gardner, chair of the Senate Leadership Fund, which is the top super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, recently spoke with Sununu.

The source added that Thune and Gardner are cautiously optimistic that Sununu will launch a campaign, in a race that's expected to be competitive and expensive.

Sununu, a former three-term representative, defeated then-Gov. Shaheen in New Hampshire's 2002 Senate election. But the senator lost to Shaheen in their 2008 rematch. 

Shaheen announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek re-election in next year's midterms, and Republicans are hoping to flip the seat as they aim to not only defend but expand their Senate majority.

TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT FRONT-AND-CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS

Word that Sununu, who turns 61 this month, was mulling a Senate bid was first reported by NOTUS.

There are currently two major Republicans in New Hampshire's Senate race.

Former Sen. Scott Brown, who served as ambassador to New Zealand during President Donald Trump's first term in the White House, announced his candidacy in June. 

Ahead of his campaign launch, Brown had been crisscrossing New Hampshire since late last year, meeting with Republican and conservative groups.

A month later, in July, three-term GOP state Sen. Dan Innis launched a U.S. Senate campaign.

Trump, whose endorsement in Republican primaries is extremely influential, has remained neutral to date. 

Veteran Republican strategist John Ashbrook, a co-host of the popular ""Ruthless"" podcast, told Fox News Digital that ""the more candidates getting into these races is an indicator that Republicans are on offense heading into an all-important midterm and that Trump's great success in the White House is actually wind in their sails as they pursue an effort to maintain the majority, that they should be able to maintain with good candidates on the field.""

FOUR KEY SENATE SEATS THE GOP AIMS TO FLIP IN NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Four-term Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the state's First Congressional District, is the clear frontrunner for the Democratic Party's Senate nomination.

But progressive organizer and biomedical scientist Karishma Manzur is also running for the Democratic nomination.

Pappas took to social media on Wednesday to emphasize that ""NH wants leaders who'll stand up to Trump and special interests to build an economy that works for all.""

""Instead the GOP is scraping the bottom of the failed candidate barrel. Whether it's corporate sellout John E. Sununu or MAGA puppet Scott Brown, NH voters won't buy it,"" Pappas argued.

Senate Republicans enjoyed a favorable map in the 2024 cycle as they flipped four seats from blue to red to win back the majority.

But the party in power – the Republicans – traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections. Nevertheless, a current read of the 2026 map indicates the GOP may be able to go on offense in some key states.

In battleground Georgia, which Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.

SENATE DEMOCRATS RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES IN PUSH TO WIN BACK MAJORITY

They're also targeting battleground Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring at the end of next year, as well as New Hampshire.

Also on the National Republican Senatorial Committee's target list is blue-leaning Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith isn't running for re-election.

But the GOP is defending an open seat in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tills decided against seeking re-election.

Republicans are also defending an open seat in red-leaning Iowa, after Sen. Joni Ernst's announcement on Tuesday that she won't seek re-election next year.

And Republicans will likely be forced to spend resources to defend Sen. Jon Husted of Ohio – who was appointed to succeed former senator and now-Vice President JD Vance – as he faces off next year against former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.

Meanwhile, Democrats are also targeting moderate Sen. Susan Collins – who has yet to announce her expected 2026 re-election – in blue-leaning Maine.

Novak Djokovic, a fan favorite at the U.S. Open, blew kisses to an unusually hostile crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium late Tuesday night after he defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets to advance to the semifinals. 

Fritz, the final American man left in the tournament, had home-court advantage and by the halfway point of the match, it appeared that the fans had successfully gotten under Djokovic's skin.

Fritz supporters continued to cheer for faults by Djokovic, and in the third set, when the match had surpassed 10:30 p.m., the Serbian tennis star had had enough.

""What are you going to do?"" he repeated as he approached chair umpire Damion Dumusois. 

The crowd booed as Djokovic mocked Dumusois' attempts to silence the crowd: ""Thank you. Please. Thank you. Please.""

Dumusois appealed to Djokovic that, regardless of his interjection, ""It's not going to help, Novak.""

Fritz would eventually take the set but lose the match, 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.

""I was just trying to survive,"" Djokovic said after the match. ""It's one of those days where you just have to grind.""

Djokovic won 25 of the 42 points that lasted at least nine strokes. He saved 11 of the 13 break chances he faced and won 10 of the 11 points when he served and volleyed.

The 38-year-old moved on to the semifinals, where he will face world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. 

For Fritz, his loss meant another year without an American men's singles champion at any Grand Slam. The drought dates back to 2003, when Andy Roddick last won at the U.S. Open.

'The Five' co-hosts discuss 'Squad' member Rashida Tlaib refusing to say whether she condemns 'children's heads being chopped off' by Hamas terrorists. 

FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is facing a GOP-led censure resolution on Wednesday after her fiery remarks at a pro-Palestinian conference.

Tlaib spoke at the People's Conference for Palestine in Detroit over the weekend, when she condemned both Democrats and Republicans for supporting Israel as its military campaign in Gaza continues.

Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., who introduced the measure, accused Tlaib of ""vilifying her colleagues, endangering the lives of Jewish people, and celebrating terrorism.""

""Her conduct is beneath that of a civilized person, let alone a member of Congress. I am calling on the House of Representatives to censure her remarks and put Democrats on notice for enabling and cheering on antisemitism in their own party,"" Carter told Fox News Digital.

DNC SUMMER MEETING DERAILED AFTER TENSIONS FLARE OVER DUELING RESOLUTIONS: ‘LOSING OUR FUTURE'

The Detroit-area progressive, the first Palestinian American elected to Congress, targeted the institution itself in her remarks. ""Outside of the decaying halls of the empire in Washington, D.C., we are winning. They are scared.""

She also brushed off colleagues' concerns about anti-Israel protests near their offices.

""They are scared. They send me videos and messages of people protesting in front of their district offices, people showing up at their town halls, and I was like, we're not all related. Those are fellow Americans,"" Tlaib said. ""Maybe you should meet with them and listen.""

Carter's resolution referenced other speakers at the event, tying their rhetoric to Tlaib's participation.

He pointed to remarks by Aisha Nizar, an activist with the Palestinian Youth Movement, who discussed disrupting the U.S. supply chain for F-35 combat aircraft.

""If one specific node of the F-35 supply chain is intervened in, it has a huge impact for our people back home,"" Nizar said. ""We need to be surgical. We need to be strategic. And we need to be bold in our actions. Because there are many different points of these supply chains of death that we can intervene in.""

Another participant, Nidal Jboor, founder of Doctors Against Genocide, reportedly said of leaders in the U.S., Europe and Israel, ""They must be locked up, taken out, neutralized to save children and humanity,"" according to a report by the Middle East Media Research Institute.

It remains unclear how closely Tlaib is tied to those figures, but Carter's resolution links her speech to past controversies over her criticism of Israel.

""Representative Rashida Tlaib has repeatedly displayed conduct entirely unbecoming of a member of the House of Representatives by calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and by dangerously promoting terrorism and extremism, while Israeli and American hostages remain in terrorist captivity,"" the resolution states.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza — which international organizations warn has created famine conditions — was launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,000 people in southern Israel, many of them civilians in their homes.

The conflict has split lawmakers in both parties, with a growing number of Democrats and even some Republicans criticizing the magnitude of Israel's response.

The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry claims tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Tlaib's office for comment.

 'America Reports' has the latest on the incident that is under investigation.

Two United Airlines planes were involved in a minor collision at San Francisco International Airport on Labor Day, the airline confirmed. 

""Monday night, a United aircraft being pushed back from the gate at San Francisco International Airport made contact with the tail of a parked United aircraft,"" a United spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

No injuries were reported, and passengers on both planes were able to board other planes to reach their destinations. 

The collision between UA796 — which was headed to Boston — and UA1871 — which was headed to Denver — garnered social media attention.

""UA796 was boarding passengers at the gate, the tug broke away on UA1871 and the aircraft rolled back,"" the post concluded. It included a photo that newsgathering website Storyful said was originally posted to Reddit.

Friends, 

As a member in good standing of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, I am simply appalled by our beloved organization's resolution declaring the conflict in Gaza a “genocide.” Our elite association of academics, researchers, and randos, which costs upward of $125 to join yearly, has allowed its once-sterling reputation to be forever tainted. 

Why do I speak up? Need it be said that as a member of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, I am one of the “world's top scholars” on the matter of genocide. It's not me saying this. It's the BBC, as well as virtually every major news organization in the world. Apparently, an impressive-sounding organizational name is all one needs to get into the papers. None of the reporters bothered to investigate who the “scholars” voting on the resolution were. Not even the names of the draftees were shared — a lack of transparency that undermines our credibility. 

Take the Jew-baiting “human rights” activist Agnes Callamard, of Amnesty International, who contends that an “overwhelming majority of members of the world's leading genocide scholars” backed a resolution that finds what is happening in Gaza “meet[s] the legal definition of the crime.” That is not true. A week ago, I could have voted on the genocide resolution, and my expertise is predominantly in '80s and '90s indie rock. 

Indeed, according to our dear former two-term IAGS advisory board member Sara Brown, only 128 of the association's approximately 500 members participated. There was no “consensus” on the resolution despite our communications officer Emily Sample falsely claiming so to the Washington Post. We should really have a meeting about her future at our organization.

While we typically debate controversial resolutions in “a virtual town hall” (or so I hear), leadership declined to hold any discussions on this matter, according to Brown. As a member in good standing, I have access to the organization's LISTSERV, which shows there were zero comments on the resolution before its passage. 

The resolution itself is an embarrassing collection of half-truths and lies. It reads like the work of an earnest college freshman who believes hyperlinking a bunch of biased sources is tantamount to research. We repeat a litany of uncorroborated accusations made by Hamas and others. Remarkably, our resolution goes beyond the accusation of the terrorist organization. Hamas, for instance, has said that 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including 17,000 children. We contend that Israelis murdered 50,000 children alone, a completely concocted number. But, like Hamas, we don't bother making any distinction between combatants and innocents. As highly respected scholars, we should be better than the Gaza Health Ministry.

We then cite organizations that have altered their definition of “genocide” for this conflict to place the burden of proof on Israel rather than those making the accusation. Is this how world-renowned scholars do their work? Because it seems like a shoddy shortcut. We don't even link to the work of a single one of our members. 

The war, which started when Hamas sent an army into Israel to murder, rape, torture, and kidnap civilians, including children, is tragic. But our organization has now created a precedent that makes virtually every conflict a “genocide.” If Israel wanted to commit genocide, it would not be sending hundreds of thousands of metric tons of food and supplies to Palestinians in Gaza. It would not provide clean water and move the population away from war zones. Israel has gone out of its way to avoid civilian casualties while fighting combatants who hide behind noncombatants (something that we never mention). 

THE GOP'S OVERCONFIDENCE PROBLEM

If a handful of unnamed members of our organization are willing to distort reality, not to mention decency, to spread the propaganda of a terrorist state, what is our scholarship really worth? The genocide accusation is a hoax. I think they know it. I think that's why there was no debate, why the authors of the resolution aren't named, and why barely anyone voted. 

We can do better.

Sincerely,

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem moved on Tuesday to fire multiple employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, accusing them of consuming pornographic content on their government-issued devices during work hours.

“These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography,” Noem said in a statement, noting at least one FEMA official consumed “racially charged” pornography that “involved bestiality.”

The Department of Homeland Security's statement cites two instances of inappropriate conduct.

The Washington Examiner contacted DHS for confirmation on how many workers were fired for consuming pornography on the job.

The workers were employed at the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Bluemont, Virginia.

“Under President [Donald] Trump's leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” Noem added. “For decades some of these bureaucrats engaged in every act imaginable instead of safeguarding the American people from natural disasters. That ends now.”

In July, the DHS Insider Threat Operations Center first identified an employee who used sexually charged language on a chatbot website that read the comments back in an accent.

One month later, the DHS center determined a government contractor stationed at the FEMA location accessed Reddit nearly 600 times over the course of a month and engaged in sexually explicit conversations online. Some of the content accessed included sexually graphic photos and videos, according to DHS.

Following its investigation, the department also noted that nearly half of FEMA employees frequently log into social media platforms while working.

Since taking office, Noem has been winding down operations at FEMA as Trump threatened to dismantle the agency.

NOEM FIRES 24 ‘DEEP-STATE' GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES EMBEDDED IN FEMA

Just last week, DHS announced that she had fired two dozen employees in FEMA's IT department who “brazenly neglected basic security protocols.” Their ineptitude was said to have caused “massive cyber failures,” including an agency-wide lack of multi-factor authentication when logging in.

A new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found roughly 2,500 FEMA employees have left the agency between January and June, a 10% decrease in its workforce.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The two sides are talking now, but in all likelihood, the fighting will continue.

At the height of the Iraq war, bloggers coined the term “Friedman unit” in reference to the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman's habit of claiming that the next six months would be critical in determining the outcome of the conflict.

Everything has sped up quite a bit in our post-Twitter era, so perhaps it's appropriate that the Ukraine war equivalent — the Trump unit — is only two weeks. President Donald Trump said last month he would give Russian President Vladimir Putin a “couple of weeks” to take serious steps toward ending the war before he imposed new penalties on Russia. “I'll know in two weeks what I'm going to do,” he told CNN. Trump has previously given Putin two more weeks in April, May, and July. (This is not the only issue that Trump has promised to resolve in a fortnight.)

Trump had promised to end the war within 24 hours of taking office, and eight months later, there appear to be two constants: Trump's frustration that Putin might be “tapping me along” as he continues to launch attacks on Ukrainian cities, and his seemingly unshakeable faith that Putin is serious about making peace — in which case, a resolution to the war may be just around the corner.

“I think [Putin] wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds,” he told French President Emanuel Macron in a hot mic moment at the White House on August 18. Two weeks later, he declared himself “very disappointed” in Putin.

None of this is to say that talks with Russia are pointless; even the most fleeting chance of a negotiated outcome should be explored. But the unfortunate fact is that there's a high likelihood this war will continue for quite some time.

The biggest change in the war since Trump took office is that the two sides are talking. US officials have been holding direct talks with their Russian counterparts over Ukraine since February, a reversal of the Joe Biden-era mantra that there would be no talks “about Ukraine without Ukraine.” Russia and Ukraine have also held their first direct talks since the first weeks of the war, agreeing to several prisoner swaps, but making little progress toward a ceasefire.

There's been some softening of the Ukrainian position. It was once an article of faith in Kyiv that it would not agree to an end to the war until Russian troops were expelled from all of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory. But now, Ukrainian leaders are pushing for a ceasefire that would leave a significant portion of its territory under Russian occupation, with hopes it could be regained later. Battlefield realities probably would have dictated this shift no matter who was in the White House, but Trump's desire for a quick end to the war, and Ukraine's need to keep him mollified, probably hastened it.

As for Russia, while even Putin may accept now that his military is unlikely to topple Ukraine's government entirely, it's not at all clear that he's backed down on demands that would essentially turn Ukraine into a subservient satellite state. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine not only give up territory currently under Russian control but that it cede additional territory that Russia has claimed but not yet conquered. Other recently reported demands include international recognition of Russia's territorial claims, Ukraine's political neutrality, and restrictions on its military and the international military aid it receives. These might just be maximalist negotiating positions, but some Russian observers say there are red lines Putin is unlikely ever to budge on.

“The unfortunate reality is that we haven't really learned very much [about Russia's willingness to compromise], and that we're basically in the same position that we were prior to the flurry of diplomacy, and maybe even slightly worse off,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program and the Center for a New American Security.

“In this kind of war, you can either win or you lose, and if you lose, it's disastrous for Russia.”

Since Trump's Alaska summit with Putin and his meeting in Washington with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Europe's leaders, much of the discussion in European capitals has been around future security guarantees for Ukraine, including what are reportedly “pretty precise plans” for post-conflict troop deployments to back up those guarantees. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said the US would provide some backing for these guarantees, though not “boots on the ground.”

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has stressed, however, that Russia wants to be part of the discussions over security guarantees, that it wants its ally China as one of the guarantors, and that there must be no foreign troops deployed to Ukraine. As such, all the discussions in Washington, Kyiv, and European capitals over what form these guarantees will take are still a bit theoretical.

“The whole question about foreign soldiers on Ukrainian soil, it's just absolutely a no-go for the Kremlin,” said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and analyst based in the United Kingdom at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Putin “would fight until the last soldier against it.”

Putin has repeatedly said that the “root causes” of the conflict need to be addressed, by which he means NATO expansion and the 2014 overthrow of Ukraine's Russian-backed government, which he describes as a Western-backed “coup d'état.” This is, in other words, about much more than “land swapping.”

Soldatov says the stakes of this conflict for Russian leaders who saw the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years following the Cold War as a period of humiliating defeat for Russia, should not be underestimated.

“They believe that this is an existential war, and not just with Ukraine, but with the West as well,” he said. “In this kind of war, you can either win or you lose, and if you lose, it's disastrous for Russia.”

All that being said, Russia is more than willing to continue to participate in negotiations, if only because Trump has been repeatedly unwilling to impose any serious consequences on Russia so long as it is nominally involved in the peace process.

“Putin thinks he has solved the Trump problem,” John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine now at the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “Trump has allowed his red lines to be crossed without taking any steps.”

If Putin doesn't actually want to make a deal just to do Trump a solid, could he be coerced through more pressure?

In recent days, the administration has touted its tariffs on India (White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called them “sanctions,” a fairly incendiary term in New Delhi) as evidence that the US is getting serious about dialing up the pressure. The road to peace runs, at least partly, right through New Delhi,” said Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro.

This is an odd stance: It's true that India now buys a significant amount of oil from Russia, but China buys even more, and the administration has been notably quieter about that. In any event, the tariffs seem to have pushed India closer to China rather than away from Russia.

There's little bilateral trade to speak of between the US and Russia, so Trump's preferred pressure tactic — tariffs — isn't well-suited for pressuring Putin. Experts say there are additional steps the US could take, such as cracking down more on the “shadow fleet” of oil tankers transporting Russian crude around the world in violation of wWestern restrictions, or seizing Russia's frozen sovereign assets.

Trump has also suggested removing restrictions on Ukraine's long-range strikes into Russia, which are having an impact on Russia's domestic energy supply. He has called Biden incompetent for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back,” which is notably not what he was saying at the time.

But Samuel Charap, a former State Department staffer now at the RAND Corporation, is skeptical of calls to dial up the pressure.

“The bottom line is that there is not a plausible pain threshold that we could cross that would make Putin fundamentally alter his approach to Ukraine,” he said.

What could presumably give Ukraine as much if not more leverage than any new weapons system or capability or sanctions program, is simply confidence that American assistance will continue. There have been some brief pauses in weapons deliveries to Ukraine as well as intelligence sharing since Trump took office, and it was recently reported that the Pentagon has been blocking Ukraine's use of long-range missiles.

For the time being, so long as Europe pays for the weapons, and so long as a Nobel-worthy peace deal looms, Trump seems inclined not to abandon Ukraine entirely. (His vice president may be a different story.) But there's no guarantee that Trump won't have a change of heart, and that alone is incentive for Russia to keep up the fight.

“I do think, from the Russian perspective, that there's still maybe some hope that Trump is going to grow frustrated with this process and walk away,” said Kendall-Taylor of the Center for a New American Security.

RAND's Charap, who has been a leading proponent of negotiations since the early days of the war, says we're still not far enough along into the process to know if there's a chance for a negotiated settlement. He points out that it took hundreds of meetings to negotiate the armistice that ended the Korean War, and 22 months to negotiate the Good Friday Accords in Northern Ireland. Though Trump has put great emphasis on holding a three-way summit between himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy, the details of these agreements tend to be hammered out over months in much less high profile meetings by much lower level officials. (Trump's staff cuts have thinned out the ranks of Russia experts at the State Department, National Security Council, and CIA.)

“We've seen that Russia is willing to talk,” Charap said. “Whether or not they're willing to end the war on terms that are acceptable to that Ukraine can live with — we've yet to fully test that proposition.” Testing that proposition, he emphasizes, will take time and patience.

Russia continues to make steady gains on the battlefield, albeit at a grindingly slow pace with shockingly high casualty rates. The unfortunate fact, though, is that Russia simply has more people and materiel to throw into the fight and — North Korea's soldiers and munitions notwithstanding — is less concerned about international support. The Alaska summit followed by this past week's shindig in Beijing showed that international efforts to isolate Putin are breaking down. Despite efforts to ramp up production in the US and Europe, Russia is still producing far more ammunition than its Western rivals, which — despite the justified attention given to high-tech drones — is still the key variable for a long, drawn-out war of attrition like this one. Even as the talks have drawn on, Russia has only intensified its efforts to gain ground on the battlefield and inflict damage on Ukrainian cities.

Past examples also suggest Putin may have time on his side. One widely cited study published in 1998 examining wars between democracies and autocracies in the 19th and 20th centuries found that once conflicts reached the 18-month mark, the “advantage in fighting passes to the autocratic state.” Why? States where leaders are less beholden to public opinion, less concerned about casualties, and more able to turn their entire domestic economy into a war machine tend to have the advantage.

This war passed that point 24 months ago. While Putin may eventually cut a deal, in all likelihood, he's far from finished.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why Ukraine's forces are turning to militarized e-scooters for combat runs","https://www.businessinsider.com/why-ukraines-soldiers-are-using-military-scooters-2025-9","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:51:00 GMT","

Ukraine's special operations forces and other front-line troops are using an unconventional ride for slipping past Russian lines, ferrying supplies, and dodging drones, a Baltic scooter maker says.

The Mosphera military e-scooters used by Ukrainian operators are made by Latvian firm Global Wolf Motors, are about twice the size of a regular scooter, and have motorcycle tires, Klāvs Ašmanis, the founder and CEO, told Business Insider.

These nimble, off-road e-scooters can hit 62 mph, cover up to 186 miles on a single battery charge, and weigh just 163 pounds, making them easier to handle than heavier bikes.

Ašmanis said they can make deliveries to the front lines, do reconnaissance in Russia-held territory, and quickly evacuate lightly wounded troops, among other missions, and Ukraine is putting them to work.

These atypical combat vehicles offer quiet mobility across varied terrain, but there aren't many of them in Ukraine, at least for the time being. Latvia, a NATO ally that borders Russia and a key Ukrainian partner nation, donated four scooters in 2023 alongside other equipment. Ašmanis said Ukraine now has 11 of the scooters and that units have asked for more. It's unclear if it will receive additional scooters.

Business Insider reached out to the Latvian defense ministry but did not receive a response on plans for future deliveries.

The scooters were initially designed for use on military bases, border patrol, and reconnaissance, but their use in Ukraine showed the company they had even more uses in real war. ""We were surprised by what they were truly capable of,"" the CEO said.

Ukrainian soldiers brought them to the front lines and inside occupied territory held by Russia.

Ašmanis said the scooters offer advantages over other vehicles being used in this war. For instance, they are smaller and lighter than traditional vehicles, they don't drown out the buzzing sound of drones, they're easier to quickly bail out of in an emergency, and the scooters don't require risking a car, truck, or other vehicle that could be packed with gear for other missions on quick, daring dashes.

He said they excel in forested areas. ""Its e-scooter-style wheelbase makes it easy to weave between trees"" and trails, while its 163-pound weight ""means that if it does get stuck, it's far easier to pull out compared to a motorcycle.""

They're also far easier to hide when not in use, in bushes or under branches.

The combat scooters aren't unique to Ukrainian forces. The Russians have employed e-scooters in fast-moving, dispersed ""scooter assaults."" Ukrainian officers have said these tactics make it harder to take out large numbers of troops at once with drones or artillery, though they're far from unstoppable.

Ašmanis said his vehicles are better suited to conflict than typical e-scooters, describing them as ""in the middle between scooter and motorcycle"" because it has much larger wheels, like motorcycles do, than regular scooters.

Scooter use reflects a broader shift in the war: both sides are scrambling for small, fast, flexible vehicles to supplement traditional combat machines. Troops have been turning to alternatives to systems like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, though those are still used, and heading into battle in civilian pickup trucks, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, scooters, and more.

Troops have even ridden bicycles in this war.

Rides like scooters are useful because they're relatively cheap, replaceable, and easy to hide, which is important in a conflict where larger, more expensive, and classically louder vehicles may be spotted and destroyed.

But scooters also come with limitations. Riders are exposed, offering little to no protection beyond their personal kit from shrapnel, small-arms fire, or harsh weather. Electric scooters are also highly dependent on batteries, which may not perform as well under certain conditions.

Most vehicles come with drawbacks, though. Motorcycles are fast but noisy. Ukraine's Lt. Col. Pavlo Shamshyn, the spokesperson for the Kharkiv Group of Forces, said earlier this year that Russia's motorcycles proved advantageous for Ukraine because the loud noise drowned out the sound of incoming drones. Armored vehicles are protected and often feature heavy firepower, but these are also higher-priority targets. These multi-million-dollar systems have been wrecked by cheap drones throughout the war.

Ukraine has been using whatever vehicles it can, from Western tanks like the American-made M1 Abrams to civilian pickup trucks equipped with .50 caliber machine guns. One Ukrainian unit created a motorcycle attack company earlier this year that is designed to quickly break through Russian positions.

There's a constant demand for vehicles, both military and civilian, on both sides of the war, which is chewing through weaponry.

Ukrainian military units and volunteer groups hold crowdfunding campaigns to get cars and other vehicles to soldiers, with some supporters buying them in other European countries and driving them into Ukraine.

Scooters are just one of the options in the mix. Like small drones, militarized pickups, and other improvised gear, they underscore how Ukraine and Russia are adapting anything they can to survive this grinding fight.

A federal judge just ruled that Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser, and Googlers seem pretty happy about it.

On Tuesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down penalties to Google after ruling its search business a monopoly. The US Justice Department, which filed the suit against Google in 2020, had proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. The judge ruled against this—one of several decisions made in the landmark antitrust case.

Google employees have been lighting up the company's central internal message board, filling it with jokes about the soaring stock and how Google no longer has to part with its beloved browser, per messages and memes reviewed by Business Insider.

One employee edited a caption of a scene from ""The Lord of the Rings"" to read ""Looks like Chrome is back on the menu, boys!"" Another played on an iconic scene from the movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" with Chrome — rather than Leonardo DiCaprio — announcing, ""I'm not ******* leaving.""

Several other posts celebrated Chrome's remaining part of Google. One employee took a photo of a sign from one of the offices that read, ""You belong here,"" adding the word ""Chrome.""

A Chrome sell-off could have been very painful for Google. The browser has become a huge distribution channel for the company's search advertising business, sucking up vast amounts of useful data.

Google's stock popped more than 6% in after-hours trading — something that Googlers also joked about inside the company.

""Sending support to Googlers who sold $GOOG recently,"" read one caption on a picture of a candle.

Several employees who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said they didn't think the outcome would affect them much and that it would be business as usual for most Googlers.

""I think people are mostly happy about the stock,"" said one of them.

The list of remedies handed down to Google on Tuesday included a ban on any exclusive deals to make its search engine the default, though it stopped short of banning payments to partners completely. Google was also ordered to share some of its search data with rivals.

A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Dollar Tree is seeing benefits from branching out into products that cost over $1.25 each.

The dollar store chain has spent the last couple of years adding items that cost more than its standard $1.25 price point. Dollar Tree has added items that cost $3 and $5 each, for instance, and experimented with items that cost as much as $7.

The strategy is paying off, executives said on Dollar Tree's latest earnings call on Wednesday, especially when it comes to serving new customers at its stores.

""Expanding our assortment to include items at a variety of price points is fast becoming the standard Dollar Tree model,"" CEO Michael Creedon said on the call.

He said the chain's wider range of prices lets it sell larger packs of some consumable goods and higher-quality items.

That wider range of products particularly appeals to shoppers from households with incomes of at least $100,000 annually. Such customers drove a ""meaningful portion"" of Dollar Tree's second-quarter sales growth, Creedon said. Dollar Tree largely beat analysts' expectations for the period, including with 6.5% growth in same-store net sales.

More affluent customers are coming to Dollar Tree stores for the ""thrill of the hunt,"" Creedon said.

""You come into Dollar Tree, you're not exactly sure what you needed, and by the end of the first aisle, there's a basket there because you got more than you thought you would,"" the CEO said. ""That's the Dollar Tree magic.""

One example comes from Dollar Tree's hardware department. Dollar Tree used to offer hammers for $1.25 each, but they sold poorly, CFO Stewart Glendinning said on Wednesday's call.

Then, Dollar Tree started selling a more expensive version of the tool. ""We've got $5 hammers now,"" he said. ""We can't keep those in stock.""

Those kinds of items are ""creating more interest for consumers in a way that is very positive to the shopping experience and also to our revenue line,"" Glendinning said.

The chain still has lots of items for the lower-income consumers who have traditionally formed its shopper base, Creedon said. For instance, shoppers have been buying $5 backpacks, which can cost more at other stores, as their kids head back to school, he said.

However, dollar stores have benefited over the last few years as more customers — especially high-income consumers — have turned to chains like Dollar General and Dollar Tree to save money.

Last year, Dollar Tree saw many customers turn to its stores to shop around the holidays, CEO Creedon said on Wednesday's call.

While Dollar Tree hopes to repeat that performance during this year's holiday season, it's facing more hurdles than last year. Earlier this year, the chain took a hit from tariffs. It's still unclear how much duties on imports from some countries, especially China, will be in the long-run, Creedon said.

Then, there's the lingering effect of inflation on Dollar Tree shoppers' budgets.

""If you look over the last four or five years, prices have increased significantly across the entire retail landscape,"" Creedon said. ""Things cost more for families.""

""As a result of that, we're cautious"" about the future, he said.

OpenAI is increasing the size of its secondary share sale by more than $4 billion, CNBC has learned.

The artificial intelligence startup is giving eligible current and former employees the opportunity to sell roughly $10.3 billion in stock, up from the $6 billion it was initially targeting, according to a person familiar with the offering.

The sale will be at a $500 billion valuation, in line with expectations, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private. OpenAI's latest fundraising round earlier this year valued the company at $300 billion.

OpenAI presented the offer to employees on Wednesday. Staffers who have held shares for more than two years have until the end of September to decide whether to participate, the person said. The transaction is slated to close in October.

Participating investors include SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T. Rowe Price, the person said. 

Thrive Capital declined to comment. Representatives for the remaining firms did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

OpenAI is among a handful of high-valued tech startups offering periodic opportunities for employees to sell a portion of their equity to lighten the pressure to go public. SpaceX, Stripe and Databricks have also used secondary sales to help employees lock in some gains.

In November, OpenAI allowed employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares as part of a tender offer with SoftBank.

In this article

Newsmax filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing conservative media giant Fox News of acting as a monopoly and suppressing its right-leaning competitors.

""Fox has sought to protect and expand its monopoly power in the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market by engaging in a suite of anticompetitive behaviors,"" attorneys for the outlet wrote in the suit in federal court in southern Florida.

The lawyers allege that Fox News coerces distributors into ""exclusionary and restrictive agreements,"" and that it has used ""intimidation tactics"" to hurt Newsmax — including hiring ""private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives.""

""But for Fox's anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier 'critical mass' for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property,"" they wrote in the suit.

A Fox News spokesperson curtly replied, ""Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.""

In a phone interview with CNBC later Wednesday, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy shot back, ""Then why did they spend so much time throughout the years blocking and suppressing us?""

Ruddy is a former reporter for the New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who created Fox News.

""Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over,"" Ruddy said in a separate statement.

Newsmax wants a judge to issue a permanent injunction barring Fox's allegedly exclusionary agreements. 

It also seeks a judgment for three times the amount of damages that it has allegedly sustained by Fox, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest ""at the highest legal rate.""

Ruddy told CNBC that Newsmax believes the total damages figure will be ""significant and serious.""

The suit alleges that Fox, which has long been the most-watched cable news network on television, uses multiple strategies to ""coerce distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels.""

Fox either explicitly or tacitly makes access to its content conditional on distributors agreeing not to carry those channels, the suit alleges.

If they do, Fox imposes financial penalties on those distributors, by requiring them ""to carry and pay high fees for Fox's little-watched channels like Fox Business,"" according to Newsmax.

Fox also allegedly ""inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing."" 

""These tactics constitute unlawful restraints of trade and flow directly from Fox's unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market,"" the suit alleges.

""Fox's longstanding and ongoing practices have harmed and will further harm, competition and consumers in the United States.""

The antitrust complaint is the latest legal headache for Fox News, which has been the target of multiple high-profile and pricey lawsuits in recent years. 

In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to settle a defamation suit over false claims said on its air about Dominion Voting Systems rigging the 2020 presidential election. In August, Newsmax also agreed to pay $67 million to settle similar defamation claims.

A similar suit filed by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, is currently headed for trial. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion.

Newsmax, meanwhile, earlier settled a similar lawsuit and paid $40 million to Smartmatic.

Florida plans to end all state vaccine mandates, including for children to attend schools, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, a prominent immunization critic, announced Wednesday.

The move would make Florida the first-ever state in the U.S. to withdraw from the requirements that are credited with increasing vaccination rates in communities and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. The rollback could result in fewer school children getting immunized against deadly viruses such as polio and measles, and comes as Florida leads the Southeast in nonmedical vaccine exemptions among kindergartners.

""The Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law, all of them. All of them. Every last one of them,"" Ladapo said during a news conference, adding that the state has ""maybe half a dozen"" shots mandated in the state.

All states currently have vaccine requirements to attend public schools, though exceptions vary by state. Florida is among the states that already allow parents to object to vaccines on religious grounds.

Ladapo said vaccine mandates ""drips with disdain and slavery,"" even though they are intended to protect public health. Vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans $540 billion in direct health-care costs over the past three decades, according to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in August.

Ladapo has long stoked fears about vaccines, and his stances on shots and other measures have drawn criticism from the public health community. Last year, he called for a halt to using mRNA Covid-19 shots, citing false claims that the jabs could contaminate a person's DNA.

The move comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S., gutting a key government immunization panel, canceling funding for mRNA shot development and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Etherealize, the advocacy group for the second-largest blockchain formed of heavy hitters like former Ethereum Foundation lead developer Danny Ryan and former Wall Street trader Vivek Raman, has raised $40 million, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

The funding round was led by Electric Capital and Paradigm. The round appears to be the firm's first cash injection since receiving grants from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation in 2024 to kickstart its operations.

Etherealize is part of a growing trend within the Ethereum community to formalize operations and fully make the case for the blockchain as ""the settlement layer for the world."" Other changes include shakeups at the Ethereum Foundation, which hired two new co-directors and is attempting to right what had been a confusing development schedule.

""Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world's most battle-tested, open financial network. This raise kicks off the 'Institutional Merge' — upgrading institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails,"" Etherealize President Danny Ryan, who led development of Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake called the Merge, said in the release. 

Raman previously told The Block that Etherealize is specifically aiming to pitch institutions on the decentralized blockchain and ETH as an asset. One of the first official moves from the group was to publish a price report that suggested ETH could reach $8,000-$80,000 in the ""short-term"" as a monetary reserve and commodity asset.

Additionally, Etherealize builds institutional-grade, zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure. It is also working on a ""settlement engine optimized for institutional tokenization workflows"" and a ""suite of applications designed to bring utility and liquidity to tokenized fixed income markets,"" according to the announcement. 

Since officially launching in January, Etherealize says it has made inroads with Wall Street, including ""top banks, asset managers, and payment networks"" to influence their product development as well as regulators. Notably, Raman testified before the House Financial Services Committee during deliberations on the Clarity Act.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ondo debuts over 100 tokenized US stocks and ETFs on Ethereum, with BNB Chain and Solana support to follow","https://www.theblock.co/post/369284/ondo-tokenized-stocks-etfs-ethereum-bnb-chain-solana","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:30:02 GMT","

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Tokenized real-world asset issuer Ondo Finance and the Ondo Foundation have launched 24/7 onchain access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and ETFs.

The project's Ondo Global Markets platform is available to eligible Asia-Pacific, European, African, and Latin American investors, with plans to scale to over 1,000 assets by year-end, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Ondo Global Markets enables users to mint and redeem tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs, 24 hours a day, five days a week, with access to traditional exchange liquidity. The solution provides exposure to the total economic return of U.S. stocks and ETFs, backed and secured by those assets held at one or more U.S.-registered broker-dealers and cash in transit. While the platform itself excludes U.S. and UK retail and institutional participants, the tokenized stocks and ETFs are transferable peer-to-peer onchain 24/7.

""Many tokenized stock offerings today remain confined to siloed platforms with restricted transferability, or suffer from low liquidity,"" the project said. ""Ondo takes a different path: Global Markets is designed for accessibility, giving investors the ability to transfer tokenized equities across wallets, exchanges, and protocols, while providing seamless onchain access to robust traditional exchange liquidity across hundreds of stocks.""

The Ondo Global Markets platform was previously unveiled in February, designed to offer exposure to securities listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, including fixed-income ETFs and individual stocks of companies such as Apple and Tesla, now available on Ethereum as of Wednesday. Blockchain support is set to expand to BNB Chain and Solana ""soon,"" the project said, with interoperability powered by LayerZero.

The platform is also said to offer issuers permissionless integrations to give decision-making power to stakeholders.

""Ondo Global Markets is a breakthrough in financial access,"" Ondo Finance founder and CEO Nathan Allman said. ""Global investors can now access the largest selection of transferable tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs onchain. We saw stablecoins export the U.S. dollar by bringing it onchain. Now, Ondo Global Markets is doing the same thing for U.S. securities.""

Ondo tokenized stocks are supported by leading crypto wallets, exchanges, protocols, and infrastructure providers at launch, including OKX Wallet, Bitget Wallet, Trust Wallet, Gate, BitGo, Ledger, LayerZero, Morpho, and 1inch, with Chainlink serving as the oracle platform for trusted asset price data.

1inch, for example, has upgraded its Swap API to enable access to these tokenized real-world assets through its dapp, wallet, and partner platforms in eligible jurisdictions. ""By upgrading the 1inch Intent-based Swap API, we're now enabling efficient, jurisdiction-aware access to tokenized assets through the 1inch ecosystem, helping reduce barriers and expand access where permitted,"" 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz said in a separate statement.

""The 1inch Swap API plays an important role in powering Ondo Global Markets by enabling efficient onchain execution for our tokenized assets, helping us deliver deep liquidity and competitive pricing,"" Ondo Finance Chief Strategy Officer Ian De Bode said.

According to an announcement on Wednesday, Ondo is also integrating with the startup Block Street, which calls itself a chain-agnostic ""unified liquidity layer for tokenized stocks."" Block Street aims to offer institutional-grade liquidity rails for these assets, ""bringing borrowing, shorting, and hedging at scale to DeFi.""

The system uses ""two-way markets"" that enable users to borrow tokenized stocks using USDT and borrow USDT against their stocks like ""AAPLon, NVDAon, and TSLAon,"" according to its website. The startup is a relatively recent player, according to its statement, with its testnet attracting more than 200,000 users. It also cites Citadel, Point72, and Jane Street as backers.

Ondo is not the only crypto project launching tokenized security solutions, with Kraken and Backed recently expanding xStocks support to BNB Chain, Tron, and Ethereum alongside Solana, including AAPLx, TSLAx, SPYx, and NVDAx. Currently, xStocks are available for trading on Kraken 24 hours a day, five days a week, extending access beyond traditional market hours, and weekend trading is planned for the future. However, when withdrawn to a self-custodied wallet, xStocks can be traded onchain at any time. Bybit and Gate have also launched support for xStocks.

Furthermore, Robinhood also recently expanded into onchain equities, offering more than 200 tokenized versions of U.S. stocks to EU users on Arbitrum. Meanwhile, Coinbase is seeking SEC approval to bring tokenized stocks stateside.

""Tokenized financial assets are moving from pilot to at-scale deployment. Adoption is not yet widespread, but financial institutions with blockchain capabilities in place will have a strategic advantage,"" according to a recent McKinsey report cited by Block Street, which estimates that, even excluding stablecoins, the total tokenized market cap could reach $2 trillion by 2030.

Earlier this year, Ondo announced the launch of its own Layer 1 blockchain called Ondo Chain, which is designed to accelerate the creation of institutional-grade financial markets onchain. However, the project has not outlined any plans to launch the tokenized stocks and ETFs on the network as yet.

In July, Ondo and Pantera Capital unveiled plans to invest $250 million in real-world asset projects, hoping to bring traditional financial markets and the digital assets sector more closely together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Price predictions 9/3: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK, HYPE, SUI","https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-3-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-link-hype-sui","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:40:50 GMT","

 Bitcoin bulls are trying to get back into the driver's seat by pushing the price above $112,500. Will altcoins follow? 

Key points:

Bitcoin made a strong comeback, confirming that dip buyers were present at lower levels; higher levels could continue to attract sellers.

Select altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, indicating a positive sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $112,500 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls are trying to extend the recovery. The relief rally attracted buying in spot BTC exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, which recorded $332.7 million in net inflows, according to SoSoValue data.

A positive sign for the crypto bulls is that gold (XAU) made a new high above $3,500 (per ounce) on Tuesday. History shows that BTC follows gold with a lag. BTC's median rise following gold's new all-time high is 30% at three months, and 225% at 12 months. If history repeats, BTC could rally to the $135,000 to $145,000 zone by early December.

However, September's weak seasonality is a risk for the bulls in the near term. Network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that BTC plunges 100% of the time between Sept. 16 and Sept. 23, with a typical decline of 5%.

What are the critical resistance levels to watch out for in BTC and the major altcoins? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

BTC rose back above the breakdown level of $110,530 on Tuesday, indicating solid demand at lower levels.

There is stiff resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($112,438), but if the bulls overcome it, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($115,640). Such a move suggests that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may then attempt a rally toward $124,474.

If bears want to retain the advantage, they will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA and swiftly pull the Bitcoin price below $107,255. If they manage to do that, the pair could plummet to $105,000 and eventually to the vital support at $100,000. 

ETH (ETH) closed below the 20-day EMA ($4,379) on Monday, but the bears could not pull the price to the $4,094 support.

The bulls are trying to make a comeback by maintaining the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,500 and, after that, to $4,664. Sellers will try to defend the zone between $4,664 and $4,956 because a break above it could resume the uptrend toward the next target objective of $5,662.

The 50-day SMA ($4,072) is the critical level to watch out for on the downside. If this support cracks, the Ether price could tumble to $3,745 and then to $3,354.

XRP (XRP) bounced off the $2.73 level on Monday, indicating that the bulls are aggressively defending the level.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($2.93), which is sloping down. The XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a break and close below $2.73. That could start a downward move to $2.20.

Buyers will have to thrust the price above the downtrend line to negate the bearish pattern. The XRP price may then rally toward $3.40, signaling that the pair may remain stuck between $2.73 and $3.66 for a while.

Buyers are trying to sustain BNB (BNB) above the 20-day EMA ($849), but the bears have kept up the pressure.

If the 20-day EMA gives way, the BNB/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($811). Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and $794.

If the price turns up and breaks above $869, it suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The bulls will then try to push the price above $881, challenging the overhead resistance at $900. A break and close above $900 signals the start of the next leg of the uptrend to the psychological level of $1,000.

Solana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($197) on Tuesday, signaling that the positive sentiment remains intact.

Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $218 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. That clears the path for a rally to $240 and then to $260.

The uptrend line is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. Sellers will have to drag the price below the uptrend line to invalidate the bullish setup. The Solana price may sink to $175 and thereafter to $155. 

Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.21 support but are struggling to push the price above the moving averages.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.22) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could slump to $0.19 and then to $0.16.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.22). That suggests the Dogecoin price may oscillate inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days.

Cardano (ADA) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern for a few days, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.

If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.84), the ADA/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to mount a vigorous defense at the downtrend line, but if the bulls prevail, the Cardano price could rise to $0.96 and later to $1.02.

Instead, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to pull the pair to the support line. That is a critical level for the bulls to defend because a break below the channel may sink the price to $0.68.

Related: Classic XRP price chart pattern targets $5 as spot ETF reality draws closer

Chainlink (LINK) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day EMA ($23.45).

The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns down from the current level, the LINK/USDT pair could find support at the 50-day SMA ($20.99).

Contrarily, buyers will gain the edge in the near term if they push and maintain the Chainlink price above $24.06. If they manage to do that, the pair could march toward $26 and then $27.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned up from the uptrend line on Tuesday, but the bears are likely to sell at higher levels.  

A break and close below the uptrend line invalidates the bullish ascending triangle pattern. That may pull the Hyperliquid price to $40 and subsequently to the solid support at $35.51.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price maintains above $45.50, it suggests that the bulls are buying on dips. The HYPE/USDT pair could then ascend to the overhead resistance at $49.88. This is a crucial level to watch out for because a close above $49.88 opens the gates for a rally to the pattern target of $64.25.

Sui (SUI) closed below the $3.26 support on Monday, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.

The bulls pushed the Sui price back above $3.26 on Tuesday but are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears at the 20-day EMA ($3.45). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the risk of a break below $3.11 increases. The SUI/USDT pair could then plummet to $2.80.

Alternatively, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($3.67).

Oops, something went wrong

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Trimont LLC, a heavyweight in commercial real estate servicing with $730 billion in managed loans, has started using JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) Kinexys blockchain network to process payments in minutesrather than the typical two-day turnaround. The milestone came in August, marking Trimont's first use of Kinexys, and CEO Bill Sexton says broader rollout is already underway. The system automatically identifies incoming payments, checks for sufficiency, and disburses funds to lendersno more manual chasing, no more delays. There's significant financial benefit to our clients being able to receive the payments two days earlier, Sexton told reporters.

Is JPM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

That may sound like operational plumbing, but in fixed-income and real estate finance, time is cash. Kinexyswhich launched in 2019 and currently handles $3 billion in daily volumesis still tiny compared to JPMorgan's $10 trillion payments footprint, but it's gaining traction as programmable money becomes more than just whiteboard theory. JPMorgan enabled smart-condition payments in 2023, allowing real-world transactions to execute even outside banking hours. The tech underpinning stablecoins is now being weaponized not for retail speculation, but for institutional-grade capital movement.

Programmable payments are one of the innovations that blockchain and digital currencies bring to the digitization of money, said Kinexys co-head Naveen Mallela. Trimont's move may be the early innings of something bigger: large-scale money flows shifting to blockchain rails, not because of crypto hype, but because the infrastructure finally works. For investors watching the intersection of real estate, enterprise software, and digital financethis could be a tipping point worth circling.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Galaxy Digital Stock Crosses Into Blockchain as Tokenization Opens New Era","https://www.tipranks.com/news/galaxy-digital-stock-crosses-into-blockchain-as-tokenization-opens-new-era","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:50:51 GMT","

Galaxy Digital has started offering investors the option to tokenize their stock.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) stockholders now have the option to turn their shares into digital tokens on the blockchain. The crypto-finance and data center company said investors can tokenize their shares through Superstate, a fintech startup in its venture portfolio. This process allows shares to be legally represented on-chain while still carrying the same rights and protections as traditional stock.





So far, 21 investors have used the system, with a total of 32,374 Galaxy shares tokenized on the Solana blockchain. The project is mainly designed for institutional investors and professional traders, who are more familiar with navigating registration requirements and digital asset platforms.

The company's leadership said they want to do more than just talk about blockchain's potential. Instead, they are actively moving stock trading onto blockchain rails. Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research, said the company wants to push things forward rather than wait for regulators to give them a green light.

By linking real stock to blockchain tokens, Galaxy is offering investors the chance to trade shares with the benefits of digital assets. These benefits include 24-hour trading, faster settlement, and the ability to use peer-to-peer transactions.

Tokenization has been discussed for years, but many firms held back due to unclear rules. Galaxy and Superstate are taking a different approach. They said their initiative works within current laws and that they are engaging directly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The biggest roadblock is Automated Market Makers, which are blockchain-based trading engines. Regulators have not yet set rules for how these can operate with securities. As a result, Galaxy's tokenized shares can be traded directly between investors but cannot yet be bought and sold on demand in a fully open market.

Other companies have experimented with tokenized assets, but most used synthetic derivatives rather than real shares. Robinhood (HOOD) introduced U.S. stock tokens in Europe, and Kraken added tokenized trading on Ethereum. However, Galaxy's method is different. It gives holders direct ownership rights, making the tokens legally equal to their regular stock.

Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said this step is a milestone that the entire industry can learn from. He added that while this does not create a full tokenization revolution today, it opens the door to one in the near future.

Kevin O'Leary is turning away from NFTs and putting millions into rare, physical collectibles, specifically high-end sports cards.

The ""Shark Tank"" star and O'Leary Ventures chairman recently co-purchased a $13 million dual Logoman card featuring Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan, he said during an interview with CoinDesk TV's Jennifer Sanasie. The card is one-of-a-kind, and O'Leary—often called ""Mr. Wonderful""—sees it as a cornerstone of his growing “index” of unique collectibles.

""The majority of the returns over 20 years have accrued to the collectors who bought the piece uniques,"" O'Leary said, comparing the strategy to his long-standing investments in Andy Warhol art and luxury watches. Rather than outbidding others, O'Leary partnered with two investors to acquire the card. ""I'd rather own 33 and a third of it than zero,"" he said.

Pouring millions into rare sports cards isn't a passion project—it's a calculated bet. ""It once traded for $75,000 years and years ago, but it shows you the price appreciation,"" O'Leary said.

""Grown men are going to weep when they see this,"" he added.

Despite the overlap with tokenization, O'Leary made it clear that he has no interest in NFTs. 

""NFTs turned out to be a fad,"" he said. ""I'm only buying assets that are physical assets... That [NFT] fad came and went. I'm very fortunate I didn't get involved in that because I never understood it.""

O'Leary's sharp dismissal of NFTs comes just a few years after the market exploded in popularity. In 2021, trading volume on NFT marketplaces surged to $25 billion, up from just $95 million the year before, according to data from DappRadar and Chainalysis. Celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Steph Curry rushed to launch collections, while major brands including Nike, Adidas and Coca-Cola entered the space. 

But the hype was short-lived. NFT sales volumes fell more than 80% by mid-2022 amid the broader crypto downturn, and prices for high-profile collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks plunged from their peaks, according to the data.

O'Leary's issue with NFTS is the lack of physical existence of the assets. ""Where is the asset? Where can I put my white glove on and go touch it? That's what you can't do with an NFT.""

However, he said his collectibles ""will one day be tokenized,"" because ""it would be much easier to deal with and manage them in an index that way.""

O'Leary frames this shift as part of a larger mission: ""Wall Street on chain."" 

He believes blockchain infrastructure can modernize how assets are managed—improving transparency, liquidity and trust in markets that still rely heavily on intermediaries.

He remains bullish on foundational cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, and infrastructure plays like mining operators and exchanges.

Blockchain gaming is revolutionizing how we engage and entertain.

It integrates virtual worlds with digital ownership and meaningful gameplay. With unique NFT assets, play-to-earn incentives, and immersive metaverse worlds, this primer lays out the essentials for curious players. Read on to explore the budding world of interactive entertainment and what's in the cards for the future of fun.

Early tests in blockchain gaming were modest in size. Many originated from independent developers curious about trying something different. Through the years, the idea expanded into a flourishing industry with refined titles that hold their own in design and gameplay against conventional gaming fare.

Directories simplify discovery by offering lists of games with specific information on how they operate, what wallets they employ and you can encounter in terms of interactivity. Ratings from the community provide another filter, enabling new players to browse the consensus of others before joining in. The progression from haphazard experimentation toward organized curation demonstrates how quickly blockchain gaming has evolved.

Play-to-earn has established a different dynamic between players and the games that entertain them. Rather than simply enjoying the game for personal enjoyment, you can now be rewarded for achievement, competition, or discovery. These rewards are intrinsically designed into most games.

These define how communities are established and how individuals decide to engage in leisure activities. Listings allow users to contrast reward schemes. Some games center around gradual progress, others around victories achieved by competition and others around creativity. This allows you to choose a game that is considered fun and suits your preferred manner of playing.

NFTs introduce a sense of ownership to gaming that never existed prior. Rather than being trapped within a lone title, assets like avatars, collectables, or worlds directly belong to the player. Customization, in this case, has real permanence to it. It also means that things can go on after a lone gaming session is over. Directories offer good information about how various games use NFTs—not as character upgrades, but as world-building tools or tradable items.

The end result is that there's a gaming world in which creativity is encouraged and in which players have a good idea that things they create or accumulate are still in their possession. It inspires inventive design for the developer, as assets can have a life of their own after players are involved.

Metaverse games break down boundaries around what it means to play. They are more than levels or mission-based. They provide access to whole virtual worlds where interaction is as much at the forefront as gameplay. You can gather, investigate, create and socialize in virtual realms that change over time.

Databases help locate these experiences. They provide insight into how each game approaches world-building, avatars and festivals or other community gatherings. Ratings also provide information on those that achieve a balance between fun gameplay and a strong sense of affiliation. For many, the appeal is less about competition and more about being part of a dynamic, social world in which gaming and community intersect.

Even though the interest in this case is gaming, listings of directories that include blockchain titles often dovetail with trackers that keep tabs on assets and tokens. These are often visited by gamers eager to go further in search of early projects. These give a peek into things that are hot and why.

These are especially helpful to anyone eager to learn how to find new crypto coins but also experiment with new games, as the same tech meaningfully intertwines the two spaces. Some are more interested in gaming, while for others, interest in digital assets steers them to the gaming side.

With so much choice, coming to the right decision can feel daunting. That's where carefully curated directories make all the difference. They let you filter by wallet support, so there's guaranteed compatibility with what's in place already. They make comparison of reward mechanics a doddle, demonstrating how various games strike a balance between effort and progress.

They also highlight gameplay genres. That makes it simpler to choose whether to go for competitive quests, role-playing explorations, or social metaverse browsing. Perhaps best of all, they include community ratings that demonstrate how, in practice, games deliver. When all these pieces are in place, players can decide confidently, knowing that their next experience will be in tune with their interests and style.



Gaming on blockchain has become an environment in which ownership, creativity, rewards and socializing all intersect. NFTs make digital assets secure. Play-to-earn revolutionizes engagement. Metaverse worlds welcome community. Directories support discovery. The future of fun is happening in real time. For players, that means unprecedented control and choice. Using curated comparison tools that pit wallets, rewards, gameplay and community sentiment against each other, anyone can access the things that are most important to them. The next generation of gaming is now here. It is immersive and it is empowering.

Ever since cryptocurrency moved from the margins of the financial ecosystem into the mainstream, crypto crimes have been on the rise. Today's global crypto market is valued at $3 trillion, and news about the latest criminal activity tied to the pseudonymous digital currency is no longer the exception but the norm. As a result, crypto-related legal investigations are proliferating for fraud, ransomware attacks, money laundering, insider trading, tax evasion, and a litany of other crimes.

From large international crypto hacks to white-collar fraud, crypto crimes can be successfully unraveled through methodical blockchain tracing. With sophisticated techniques, digital forensic experts use blockchain tracing to follow the money through complex transactions, peel back layers of anonymity, and ultimately unmask the actors and their actions with tangible evidence.

Understanding how forensic investigators solve real-world crypto crimes requires a solid grasp of cryptocurrency and blockchain fundamentals as well as the most effective tracing methods and tools available.

The basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain

At a basic level, cryptocurrency is an entirely digital form of currency secured by cryptographic methods that hide identifying information. Crypto is decentralized, meaning there is no central authority, such as a government or bank, overseeing the currency. Instead of transactions being private, transactions are publicly visible and transparent on blockchain. There are some exceptions to this, but most tend to follow this pattern.

Given that users are identified by strings of numbers, not names, there is a common misconception that crypto transactions are anonymous. In reality, crypto transactions are pseudonymous, and users' identities can often be uncovered with the right kind of tracing.

The primary differences between traditional government-issued fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency are summarized below.



Cryptocurrency is powered by blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across many computers and makes them visible to the public. Blockchain's most notable features are:

Think of blockchain as a notebook (ledger) shared openly with everyone, where each page (block) is connected to the previous page. Everyone can see each entry clearly, and once written, an entry cannot be erased or changed. These transparency and security features have generated a groundswell of trust among the general public.

Why cryptocurrency matters in today's economy

Approximately 861 million people around the world use cryptocurrency.[i] This includes more than one in four Americans.[ii] The growth and appeal of cryptocurrency are fueled by several factors, including:

Key techniques for effective crypto tracing

With an extensive user base, crypto transactions generate massive amounts of blockchain data. Navigating this data and successfully tracing crypto transactions calls for skilled investigators, a keen understanding of crypto criminal behaviors and transaction patterns, and advanced technical tools.

Investigators may use various blockchain tracing techniques. Among the most common are:

Advanced blockchain tracing tools

One of the biggest crypto tracing challenges lies in the sheer volume and complexity of blockchain data. Professional tools are the key to efficiently and effectively applying tracing techniques to this digital sea of information. These tools can visualize highly complex transaction patterns, attribute crypto addresses to offline identities, automate monitoring, and much more, allowing investigators to transform detailed data into actionable intelligence.

Key capabilities of professional crypto tracing solutions include:

Staying ahead of crypto crime

The crypto landscape and, in turn, the challenges of crypto tracing are constantly changing. However, as blockchain technology continues to evolve, so will the techniques used for tracing illicit activities. By continually honing tracing strategies and staying on top of the latest technological capabilities, we can ensure blockchain remains a tool for transparency and accountability—not crime.

Home - Companies - Coinbase Just Launched a Groundbreaking Futures Product Mixing Big Tech and Crypto ETFs

TL;DR

Coinbase has unveiled a first-of-its-kind derivatives product that merges the performance of leading U.S. technology stocks with cryptocurrency ETFs into a single tradable instrument. The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures, set to debut on September 22, aims to give investors diversified exposure across two historically separate markets while offering capital efficiency and strategic risk management.

The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index consists of 10 equally weighted components, combining the “Magnificent 7” U.S. tech giants with Coinbase's stock and two crypto ETFs associated with BlackRock. The stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla, while the crypto portion includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) rounds out the list. Each asset represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weighting.

These futures contracts are monthly and cash-settled, with each unit representing $1 multiplied by the index price. For example, if the index is valued at $3000, a single contract would have a notional value of $3000. This structure is designed to be straightforward for traders while enabling efficient capital deployment. MarketVector serves as the official index provider, overseeing composition and rebalancing.











Coinbase positions the product as a tool for thematic exposure to innovation and growth, combining transformative technology companies with blockchain-native assets. The built-in diversification helps mitigate overexposure to any single stock or ETF, while the multi-asset nature allows for more nuanced risk management. The company describes this launch as the beginning of a “new era of multi-asset derivatives” that broadens access to different asset classes in one package.

At first, the Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures will be offered via partner trading platforms. Coinbase has announced intentions to provide access to retail investors soon, indicating a wider rollout plan. By integrating both traditional equities and crypto ETFs, Coinbase is targeting a growing demand for products that straddle the line between conventional finance and digital assets.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), a newly public bitcoin mining and treasury firm backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, opened for trade Wednesday morning after completing its merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP).

Wasting little time, the company filed for an at-the-market equity raise of up to $2.1 billion with which to continue building its bitcoin BTC$112,223.03 holdings (which footed to 2,443 coins at the time of the merger).

Shares have rocketed 60% to $11 versus the $6.90 price at the time of the merger Tuesday evening.

Its the latest chapter in American Bitcoin's rapid formation, which began in March through a combination of the Trump brothers' American Data Centers and Canadian mining firm Hut 8 (HUT). Hut 8 now holds an 80% ownership stake in the newly listed entity.

American Bitcoin's business combines bitcoin mining with a corporate treasury approach centered on accumulating the asset. Since its inception earlier this year, the company has amassed 2,443 bitcoin, worth approximately $160 million at current prices. This hybrid model — mining bitcoin while holding it as a balance sheet asset — mirrors strategies used by other high-profile mining firms such as Marathon Digital.

Queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) can give birth to ants of their own species (left) and, using a cloning trick, offspring of a different one (Messor structor, right). Credit: Jonathan Romiguier, Yannick Juvé, Laurent Soldati

A common type of ant in Europe breaks a fundamental rule in biology: its queens can produce male offspring that are a whole different species. These queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) are sexual parasites that rely on the sperm of males of the ant species Messor structor. They use this sperm to breed an army of robust worker ants, which are hybrids of the two species.

Data now show that, in the absence of nearby M. structor colonies, M. ibericus queens can clone male M. structor ants by laying eggs that contain only M. structor DNA in their nuclei. The findings were published in Nature on 3 September1.

“It's an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says Jacobus Boomsma, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.

Iberian harvester ants co-exist with M. structor in some parts of Europe, which has historically given M. ibericus queens an abundant supply of M. structor males to mate with.

Pupating ants make milk — and scientists only just noticed

But evolutionary biologist Jonathan Romiguier at the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier in France and his colleagues noticed something strange on the Italian island of Sicily: they found Iberian harvester ants everywhere but not a single colony of M. structor.

When the researchers peered inside colonies of the Iberian harvester ant, they found two types of ant that looked very different. Genetic analyses confirmed that the colonies contained both M. ibericus and M. structor, despite the lack of M. structor populations on the island.

Further analyses solved the mystery: Iberian harvester queens clone M. structor ants to maintain a supply of their sperm. They then mate with those M. structor ants to produce hybrid workers that take care of the colony, including by building the nest and foraging for food. In effect, M. ibericus has domesticated M. structor and its genome, Romiguier says.

Trying to boost the volume at your end-of-summer parties? The JBL Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is discounted by $20 on Amazon, bringing the price down to just $130. That might not sound like a huge discount, but it brings it more in line with its competitors, and temporarily erases the price bump from the previous version.

We've given high marks to several rounds of the JBL Flip series speakers, thanks to their great battery life, portable form factor, and impressive volume. JBL upgraded this generation of the Flip with some important upgrades, like a larger battery, improvements to the tweeter, and a detachable strap for when you're on the move. It's currently our editors' favorite Bluetooth speaker, beating out a variety of other great options.

The audio quality is as great as ever, with surprisingly sharp detail for such a small and portable speaker. It's punchy and bold, with a sound profile that's designed to stand out even at a crowded backyard barbeque or pool party. While it gets a little distorted at max volume, our reviewer noted that it does get really loud, breaking 75 decibels a few feet away. There's a mobile app too if you want to tweak the equalizer yourself, or use one of the presets.

It's sturdy too, with an IP68 weather-resistance rating, which should help it avoid any issues on your beach day with sand or splashing. There are some other minor changes that JBL says improve the shock rating for the speaker, which should help protect it from the bumps and scratches it'll surely experience on your next adventure.

One downside here is that the JBL Flip 7 switched from the proprietary PartyBoost to the new Auracast system. The upside is better compatibility with other Bluetooth speakers, but it also means older models of the Flip aren't available for multidevice listening. It's a good future-proofing feature, but if you aren't currently looking at a new phone or earbuds, it might not be that exciting.

For just $130, you could do a whole lot worse than the JBL Flip 7, with a great feature set, excellent audio, and all the portability features we've come to expect from a premium Bluetooth speaker.

A pivotal antitrust ruling aimed at addressing Google's search monopoly may have handed Microsoft its best competitive opening in many years — but it's still a slim one, and it's not clear if the Redmond company will even consider it worth the effort.

In the long-awaited decision Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta barred Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on browsers and smartphones, such as the search giant's longstanding deal involving Apple's iPhone.

“The evidence presented required no guesswork about the exclusive agreements' impacts on competition — they ‘froze' the search ecosystem in place,” Mehta wrote in the ruling.

The court noted that Google paid an estimated $20 billion to Apple in 2022 alone to be the exclusive default search engine on Safari, a deal the ruling now makes illegal. That arrangement, the judge found, not only locked out rivals like Microsoft but also created a strong disincentive for Apple to build a competing search engine of its own.

But under the ruling, Google can still spend billions to secure default slots, as long as partners remain free to preload or promote rivals. That leaves Microsoft to fight both Google's scale and its checkbook.

So as an additional fix, Mehta also ordered Google to syndicate its organic search results and text ads to rivals for up to five years on commercially reasonable terms. For Microsoft, that could mean the ability to offer its users search results and ads backed by Google's industry-leading index.

That could help Microsoft's Bing search engine — and by extension its Copilot chatbot — compete more effectively against Google's search dominance. The stakes are higher than ever given the foundational role of search in the emerging world of artificial intelligence.

But it's not clear if Microsoft will try to take advantage of the remedies. Contacted by GeekWire on Wednesday, a spokesperson said the company had no comment on the ruling. 

In the meantime, the decision is already drawing harsh critiques from some legal experts, business leaders, and competitors. That's because the ruling falls well short of the deep structural changes sought by the Justice Department and state attorneys general. 

The plaintiffs asked the court to consider measures such as breaking off Google's Chrome browser or banning the multibillion-dollar payments Google makes to secure default placement. 

Judge Mehta rejected those proposals, citing the risk of harming partners and consumers. As a result, Google retains the ability to pay huge sums to remain the default choice, while still benefiting from the powerful network effects of its scale.

Google's critics called the ruling overly lenient and a missed opportunity. Some industry analysts called it a “big whiff” by the judge — suggesting it will do little to loosen Google's grip on the market in practice, even if it creates new openings on paper.

In a twist of historical irony, Microsoft's own antitrust case from two decades ago played a central role in the ruling. Judge Mehta leaned on that case as his main precedent, even writing, “Like Microsoft before it, Google has thwarted true competition.” 

The earlier case set the standard that antitrust enforcers don't need to prove rivals would have thrived without the illegal conduct — only that the conduct helped preserve monopoly power. 

But it also limited the remedies, steering Mehta away from a breakup of Google and toward narrower steps: banning exclusive contracts, ordering data-sharing, and requiring syndication for five years.

In theory, at least, Mehta's ruling means Microsoft could get Bing preloaded on smartphones under new distribution deals, while relying on syndicated Google results in the short term, and using the associated data-sharing remedy to better train Bing's own systems. 

Over time, the idea is that Microsoft would build up the volume of queries and user data it needs to compete independently, rather than being permanently reliant on Google.

Microsoft has been working for years to improve its own search index, frequently touting the parity of its own search results in head-to-head comparisons with Google over the years.

However, in Google's antitrust trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the power of device and software defaults, reinforced by habit, is nearly impossible to overcome.

“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella told the court, describing Microsoft as being caught in a “vicious cycle” in which Google's defaults give it more data, which improves quality, which makes it harder for competitors to win distribution.

Google shares are up more than 8% this morning on news of the ruling.

Google announced on Wednesday that it's bringing a slew of new features to the Android ecosystem and Pixel devices. The tech giant is introducing Material 3 Expressive to Pixel phones, Adaptive Audio for the Pixel Buds Pro 2, on-wrist navigation for the Pixel Watch, new AI writing tools in Gboard, enhanced audio sharing capabilities, the ability to create custom Android bots, and more.

Starting Wednesday, Material 3 Expressive is coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices, as well as Pixel Tablet. Google says Material 3 Expressive will make your Pixel feel even more personal, as you can use Live effects to add animations to your lock screen's wallpaper and create customized calling cards for contacts.

Later this month, Google is bringing Adaptive Audio to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, allowing the buds to adjust to your surroundings so you can remain alert while listening to your music. Plus, you'll be able to use your buds to have clear talks with Gemini when you're in a loud environment. You can also accept or dismiss an incoming call by nodding or shaking your head.

Additionally, Pixel Watch users can now start walking or biking navigation on their phone in Google Maps and then have it automatically displayed on their smartwatch. 

As for the new AI writing tools in Gboard, you can now revise your tone to be more formal, expressive, or concise. You can also quickly fix your spelling and grammar. Google says all proofreading and rewriting happens on your device, which means your data remains private.

Google also announced that you can now pair two LE Audio Bluetooth headphones to your Android phone so you and another person can listen at the same time. With audio sharing, you can listen to a song at the same time or watch a movie together using your own headphones. The tech giant says this feature could be helpful in several different instances, like when you're in a busy cafe or commuting on a train. 

Plus, you can create a QR code to share audio with a group by starting a private broadcast that other people can join. The feature lets multiple people listen to the same playlist on their own headphones, which Google says could be used to do things like host a silent disco.

Google highlighted that the redesigned Quick Share feature on Android makes it easier to share and receive content, allowing you to instantly switch between sending and receiving, preview photos before sharing, and open received files immediately. Plus, there's a new progress indicator that shows you live updates about what percentage of the file has been transferred.

Last, Google announced that it's introducing Androidify, which is a way to build your own Android bot by uploading a selfie or writing a prompt. Androidify uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to caption the photo and Imagen to generate your custom Android bot. In some cases, it uses Veo 3, Google's latest video generation model, to animate your bot.

Inspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school.

“I got to meet fruit professors who are the best in the world at what they do,” Wu told TechCrunch. “Through talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.”

He dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely.

On Wednesday, Orchard Robotics announced that it raised a $22 million Series A funding led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, and with participation from returning investors, including General Catalyst and Contrary.

Although the idea of using computer vision for specialty crops isn't new, Wu says that the largest farms in the U.S. still rely on manual sampling to make critical decisions about farm operations.

Since farmers inspect only a small percentage of their crops, their estimations of how many healthy fruits they have on their vineyard or orchard can be extremely imprecise.  

“If you don't know what you're growing in the field, you don't know how much chemical to apply to it. You don't know how many workers to hire to harvest it. You don't know what you can actually sell and market,” Wu said.

Orchard's small camera attaches to tractors or farm vehicles, collecting ultra-high-resolution images about fruit health as the operator drives through the field. Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health.

The data is then uploaded into Orchard's cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning, or thinning.

Orchard is already in use in some of the country's largest apple and grape farms, and the startup recently began to offer its technology to blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and strawberry growers.

The company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard's direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas.

Wu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard's product offerings.

He hopes Orchard's evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance.

“Our ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data,” Wu said. “We want to collect the data, then build an operating system on top of the data, and then eventually own all the workflows in the farm, and that's going to have the potential to expand our market by quite a bit.”

After years of people constantly nudging Instagram about releasing an iPad app, the social network is finally launching one today. This means users will no longer need to use the iPhone app, which is not optimized for larger screens, or Instagram for web on the iPad.

The new app defaults to the Reels screen, allowing you to scroll up and watch short videos on a larger screen.

The iPad app has nearly all the features of the phone app when it comes to consumption. Stories appear at the top of the app, and you can access different options from the left-hand sidebar, like the following feed, DMs, Search, Explore, and notifications.

Instagram's Feed on iPad has three options: “All” for recommended posts and reels from accounts you follow; “Friends” to look at posts and reels from mutuals; and “Latest” to see posts and reels in chronological order. You can also reorder these feeds according to your preference.

Until now, Instagram on iPad was just a blown-up iOS app, which wasn't pleasant to look at. The company said that it has now revamped the experience to suit the big screen. For instance, when you are watching a reel, you can look at comments on the side, and when you are in the messages tab, you can open a particular conversation while looking at all the active chats on the left.

While Instagram has existed for nearly 15 years, the company didn't make an iPad app a priority until now. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said multiple times in the past that the company was in no hurry to develop an iPad version. Earlier this year, The Information reported that Instagram was finally building an iPad app.

This also gave birth to third-party viewers like Retro in the past to make the Instagram experience better for iPad users.

The new Instagram app for iPad is available for all iPads running iOS 15.1 or later, the company says.

Amid lawsuits alleging child safety concerns, online gaming service Roblox announced on Wednesday that it's expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to provide age and content ratings for the games and apps on its platform.

The company said that by year's end, the age-estimation system will be rolled out to all Roblox users who access the company's communication tools, like voice and text-based chat. This involves scanning users' selfies and analyzing facial features to estimate age.

This age-estimation tech is combined with other systems, including ID age verification and verified parental consent, to provide a more accurate measure of a user's age, Roblox says — especially when compared with simply having kids type in a birth year when they create an account. The company notes that it's also planning to launch systems that will further limit communications between adults and minors on its platform.

Meanwhile, the company's partnership with IARC will see Roblox replacing its own content and maturity labels with those used by rating agencies worldwide. That means users in the U.S. will see ratings from the ESRB, while other countries will see those used by their own ratings authorities. Players in the Republic of Korea will see ratings from GRAC; players in Germany will see ratings from the USK; and players elsewhere in Europe and the United Kingdom will see ratings from the PEGI, for instance.

This system is meant to help parents better understand what sort of games their kids are playing, based on factors that could raise concerns, like whether game content features blood or gore, violence, substances, gambling, adult language, and more.

These updates follow earlier moves the company announced in July, designed to better protect younger users. 

Roblox introduced a series of safety features, including the age-verification system that analyzes users' ages via video selfies. This information is used to prevent users younger than 13 from accessing certain features within Roblox, like the ability to voice and text chat without filters. Roblox also prevents users ages 13 to 17 from adding users to their “trusted connections” unless they know them in real life — something Roblox verified through contact imports or QR code scans.

The move also follows the rollout of increasingly strict laws and regulations around the world that require social platforms to verify users' ages, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and Mississippi's age-assurance law, which has already seen social network Bluesky stop serving users in the state. Similar laws are in various stages in other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Roblox has invested in safety features over the years as well.

Among its tools is Roblox Sentinel, an open source AI system designed to detect early signals of child endangerment. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when there are servers where a large number of users are breaking its rules, so it can take them down.

Despite the company's efforts, child predators still manage to access the platform and target children, according to complaints filed by Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill and in other lawsuits across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

In addition, The Guardian recently reported on a research study that discovered that kids on Roblox's service can still easily come across inappropriate content and interact with bad actors.

More recently, a popular Roblox farming simulator game, Grow a Garden, made headlines because its players began buying and selling its virtual items on online marketplaces for real money, in violation of the platform's rules. Parents and others raised concerns that the game was luring in children, then pushing them to spend cash to keep up with other players.

The changes to the ratings system may not put an end to all these bad experiences, but it could at least provide parents with more insight about the games their kids are playing. 

“Roblox is committed to creating a safe platform for our users and empowering parents to make the best decision for their children,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, in a prepared statement. “We're excited to partner with IARC and hope it will provide parents globally with more clarity and confidence regarding age-appropriate content.”

When congressional Republicans took a sledgehammer to the Inflation Reduction Act last summer, advanced geothermal startups were largely spared. Drilling for renewable energy appears to be one of the few things that engenders bipartisan support.

Now, with the uncertainty settled, geothermal companies are announcing deals that promise to pave the way for broader deployment of their technology.

Houston-based Fervo Energy said on Tuesday it has picked a supplier for key parts of its power plants, signaling that the second phase of the Cape Station project in Utah was moving full steam ahead. The startup said that Baker Hughes, the major oil field services and energy technology company, would design and deliver five steam turbines. Altogether, they'll generate 300 megawatts of electricity 24/7, enough to power around 180,000 homes. 

Fervo is one of several startups pursuing deeper, hotter geothermal wells. The company has adapted directional drilling techniques used by the oil and gas industry to tap rocks nearly 16,000 feet below the surface. At that depth, temperatures are expected to maintain a steady 520˚ F.

Behind the Baker Hughes deal is $206 million in financing that Fervo secured in June, which is split between $100 million in project-level preferred equity from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, Bill Gates' climate investment fund; a $60 million bump to an existing loan from Mercuria, a global energy trading company; and $45.6 million in bridge debt financing from an X-Caliber Rural Capital affiliate, a rural infrastructure investment firm. Trump energy secretary Chris Wright oversaw an investment into Fervo in 2022 when he was CEO of Liberty Energy.

Meanwhile, fellow startup Sage Geosystems said last week that it had signed an agreement with geothermal developer Ormat Technologies to deploy its technology at one of Ormat's existing power plants.

If all goes as planned, Ormat will license Sage's “Pressure Geothermal” technology, which injects water into fractured rock under pressure, where it absorbs heat. When the water returns to the surface, Sage harvests both the heat and pressure from it, using both to spin turbines to generate electricity.

Because geothermal power plants generate heat around the clock, they've attracted the interest of data center developers. A recent analysis said that the technology could generate enough electricity to supply nearly two-thirds of data center demand by 2030.

I'd hazard this goes both ways, too.  That is, it is not just in terms of how much the computer is capable of doing, but what the real world systems being modeled can do.  For a fun example, you can make a sorting network that can sort integers on a computer rapidly, but that doesn't necessarily help you sort a physical quantity of anything.  Is akin to making a computer that can win a game of chess, but only if the human moves the pieces for it.All too often, people present programs as if they are truths independent of either model or computer.  Which is doubly wrong as they are constrained by the model of the language they are implemented in, as well as being dependent on the model of whatever problem they are describing.

I feel like some authors would really benefit from writing a first draft and then condensing it down to 1/n. In this case, like 1/10.The author has an interesting and explicit model as a table for how to classify some languages. Everything else is either fluff or should be a separate article. For example, you either assume we're talking about moder languages, or your model needs to be way broader and more theoretical. Tangents about days when langauges were tied (at least way more than today) to hardware were unnecessary.  That also goes for the biased way the author talks about their favorite languages.It's also rife with things that, quite frankly speaking - I don't know what the hell they're talking about. It's almost like satire about how Haskellers are so clueless that they never think about run-time considerations. Or meandering thoughts on language theory (gotta drop in references to random wiki articles somehow I guess) about how it shapes our thoughts which don't amount to much because they say nothing interesting because they keep it too vague where the real answer is it depends. Or the loaded statements the author makes about Rust (in an honestly confusing way by framing it through the paretto front). Rust does not have the same guarantees as something with GC like Java. Even if you disagree with me on that, we should at least agree that this isn't as settled as the author makes it out to be.

A fine thread trailing back to the human.The imago-machines of Arkady Martine's ""A Memory Called Empire"" come to mind. Once integrated with another's imago, one is not quite the same self, not even the sum of two, but a new person entirely containing a whole line of selves selves melded into that which was one.

IMHO the phrasing here is essential to the argument and this phrasing contains a fundamental error. In valid usage we only say that two things are like one another when they are also separate things. The usage here (which is cleverly hidden in some tortured language) implies that there is a ""thing"" that is ""like"" ""being the organism"", yet is distinct from ""being the organism"". This is false - there is only ""being the organism"", there is no second ""thing that is like being the organism"" not even for the organism itself.

That's exactly what I'm saying is erroneous. Consciousness is the first thing, we are only led to believe it is a separate, second thing by a millenia-old legacy of dualism and certain built-in tendencies of mind.

reply

If you don't believe that, then you face the challenge of describing what the difference is. It's difficult to do in ordinary language.That's what Nagel is attempting to do. Unless you're an eliminativist who believes that conscious experience is an ""illusion"" (experienced by what?), then you're just quibbling about wording, and I suspect you'll have a difficult time coming up with better wording yourself.

I also don't think it's fair to say I'm just quibbling about wording. Yes, I am quibbling about wording, but the quibble is quite essential because the argument depends to such a large extent on wording. There are many other arguments for or against different views of consciousness but they are not the argument Nagel makes.(Though fwiw I do think consciousness has some illusory aspects - which is only saying so much as ""consciousness is different than it appears"" and a far cry from ""consciousness doesn't exist at all"")

Here's Billy the bat perceiving, in his special sonar sort of way, that the flying thing swooping down toward him was not his cousin Bob, but a eagle, with pinfeathers spread and talons poised for the kill!He then points out that this story is amenable to criticism. We know that the sonar has limited range, so Billy is not at least perceiving this eagle until the last minute; we could set up experiments to find out whether bats track their kin or not; the sonar has a resolution and if we find out the resolution we know whether Billy might be perceiving the pinfeathers. He also mentions that bats have a filter, a muscle, that excludes their own squeaks when they pick up sonar echoes, so we know they aren't hearing their own squeaks directly. So, we can establish lots about what it could be like to be a bat, if it's like anything. Or at least what is isn't like.

Nagel's paper covers a lot of ground, but none of what you described has any bearing on the point about it ""what it's like"" as a way to identify conscious experience as distinct from, say, the life of a rock. (Assuming one isn't a panpsychist who believe that rocks possess consciousness.)

Bringing it back to bats, a failure to imagine what it's like to be a bat is just indicative that the overlaps between human and bat modalities don't admit a coherent gluing that humans can inhabit phenomenally.

How it at all related to let's say programming?Well, for example learning vim-navigation or Lisp or a language with an advanced type system (e.g. Haskell) can be umwelt-transformative.Vim changes how you perceive text as a structured, navigable space. Lisp reveals code-as-data and makes you see programs as transformable structures. Haskell's type system creates new categories of thought about correctness, composition, and effects.These aren't just new skills - they're new sensory-cognitive modalities. You literally cannot ""unsee"" monadic patterns or homoiconicity once internalized. They become part of your computational umwelt, shaping what problems you notice, what solutions seem natural, and even how you conceptualize everyday processes outside programming.It's similar to how learning music theory changes how you hear songs, or how learning a tonal language might affect how you perceive pitch. The tools become part of your extended cognition, restructuring your problem-space perception.When a Lisper says ""code is data"" they're not just stating a fact - they're describing a lived perceptual reality where parentheses dissolve into tree structures and programs become sculptable material. When a Haskeller mentions ""following the types"" they're describing an actual sensory-like experience of being guided through problem space by type constraints.This creates a profound pedagogical challenge: you can explain the mechanics of monads endlessly, but until someone has that ""aha"" moment where they start thinking monadically, they don't really get it. It's like trying to explain color to someone who's never seen, or echolocation to someone without that sense. That's why who's never given a truthful and heartfelt attempt to understand Lisp, often never gets it.The umwelt shift is precisely what makes these tools powerful - they're not just different syntax but different ways of being-in-computational-world. And like the bat's echolocation, once you're inside that experiential framework, it seems impossible that others can't ""hear"" the elegant shape of a well-typed program.There are other umwelt-transforming examples, like: debugging with time-travel/reversible debuggers, using pure concatenative languages, logic programming - Datalog/Prolog, array programming, constraint solvers - SAT/SMT, etc.The point I'm trying to make - don't try to ""understand"" the cons and pros of being a bat, try to ""be a bat"", that would allow you to see the world differently.

Indeed, basic vim-navigation - (hjkl, w, b) is muscle memory.But, I'd argue the umwelt shift comes from vim's modal nature and its language of text objects. You start perceiving text as having an inherent grammar - ""inside parentheses"", ""around word"", ""until comma."" Text gains topology and structure that was invisible before.The transformative part isn't the keystrokes but learning to think ""delete inside quotes"" (di"") or ""change around paragraph"" (cap). You see text as composable objects with boundaries, not just streams of characters. This may even persists when you're reading on paper.That mental model often transforms your keyboard workflow not just in your editor - but your WM, terminal, web browser, etc.

Physicalism is an ontological assertion that is almost certainly true, and is adhered to by nearly all scientists and most philosophers of mind. Solipsism is an ontological assertion that could only possibly be true for one person, and is generally dismissed. They are at opposite ends of the plausibility scale.

It's difficult to read posts that rely so heavily on AI generated prose.Everything's a numbered/bulleted list and the same old turns of speech describe any scenario.That aside, what's really keeping this from being useful is showing some results. How well does this approach work? Who knows. If the data is sensitive, seeing it work on an open source repo would still illuminate.Also, we hear lots elsewhere about the limitations of relying on embeddings for coding tools, it would be interesting to know how those limitations are overcome here.

Curious if you tried that - how much variation does the AI do or does the grounding in codebase and prompts keep it  focused and real?

For the past two years, the U.S. has been supplying tens of billions of dollars worth of military aid to Israel so that it can bomb the living crap out of the civilian population in Gaza. Now, as multiple human rights organizations accuse Israel of committing genocide in the region, America's billionaire developer president seems to think it's time to spin the bloodshed into real estate gold.

The Washington Post has managed to get its hands on a 38-page prospectus that outlines an alleged U.S. plan for Gaza, now that the region has been reduced to rubble. The plan, dubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, is said to be circulating the Trump administration right now. It involves “temporarily relocating” the region's two million Palestinian inhabitants so that a series of high-tech smart cities can be constructed—an agenda that would appear to be consistent with prior comments made by Trump, who, in February, claimed he wanted to transform the corpse-strewn wreckage of Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”

The espoused plan is complicated, but in essence, it would convert Gaza into a “trusteeship” administered by the U.S. for a period of at least 10 years. During that time, the Gazan population would be largely moved out so that a big, westernized urban hub could be constructed. The Post notes that these relocations would occur through so-called “voluntary” departures, or—for those who choose not to leave voluntarily—a process whereby they are placed in “restricted, secured zones inside the enclave during reconstruction.” Additionally, it sounds a lot like the Gazans who currently own land in the region are going to be offered a cryptocurrency token in exchange for the legal right to convert it into commercial real estate. The Post reports:

Those who own land would be offered a digital token by the trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to finance a new life elsewhere or eventually redeemed for an apartment in one of six to eight new “AI-powered, smart cities” to be built in Gaza. Each Palestinian who chooses to leave would be given a $5,000 cash payment and subsidies to cover four years of rent elsewhere, as well as a year of food.

Those supposed “smart cities” will include “residences, commerce, light industry and other facilities, including clinics and hospitals, schools and more.” Additionally, other infrastructure will be built, including several high-tech manufacturing hubs, ports, highways, and something called “The Elon Musk Smart Manufacturing Zone.” Eventually, the expelled Gazans will be invited back to the new metropolises, the document claims:

Gazan families who remain, or leave and then return after residential areas are completed to exchange their land tokens, would be offered ownership of new 1,800-square-foot apartments the plan values at $75,000 each.

The plan appears to involve a substantial amount of effort (and, presumably, money) from the U.S., which is interesting, since it seems like the primary beneficiary of the development will be Israel. That said, the exact financials of the deal aren't totally clear. The Washington Post writes that the plan “purports to require no U.S. government funding and offer significant profit to investors.” However, the prospectus also notes that the plan requires “$70B-$100B in public investment, triggering a $35-$65B private investment.” The document mentions substantial sums of money coming from state-backed companies in Saudi Arabia. When questioned by Gizmodo about the cost in public dollars of the leaked plan, the State Department declined to comment but did not deny the authenticity of the document. The circulated plan appears to be just one of several currently being considered.

One of the most recent estimates places the Gaza death toll at well over 60,000, with women and children accounting for about half of the dead. Another 145,870 people are said to have been wounded. Additionally, a recent study from Brown University found that Israel has killed more journalists in the past two years than the “U.S. Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined.” On Monday, the world's leading genocide scholars' organization declared that Israel was committing genocide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Why Is Google Climbing Today? Here Are The Basics","https://gizmodo.com/google-stock-monopoly-win-2000652847","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:35:48 GMT","

Google investors were overjoyed on Wednesday in response to a long-awaited decision in a high-profile federal antitrust case against Google. 

On Tuesday, federal judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google could get to keep its Chrome browser, despite a previous ruling also by Mehta declaring that the tech giant's search business was a monopoly.

In response, Google stock had its largest upside non-earnings-related overnight gap up since it was added to the S&P 500 in 2008, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

Instead of divesting, the court is asking Google to share search index and user data with its competitors and refrain from exclusive contracts (though with carve outs that allow some exclusive contracts.

The major reason behind this decision that's being largely considered a win for Google was supposedly the advent of AI.

“The emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case,” Judge Mehta said in the ruling. 

“For the first time in over a decade, there is a genuine prospect that a product could emerge that will present a meaningful challenge to Google's market dominance,” the court ruled.

The court said that “unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future.”

Based on the many witnesses that painted generative AI as a budding competitive threat to Google search business, the court decided that “market forces” would decide the future of Google's search engine market dominance. 

How that is supposed to play out we will see in the coming years, but the testimony given by top executives from Google and Apple at the trial could show a roadmap of how the tech industry is thinking about it.

Last year, Judge Mehta declared that Google holds a monopoly in online search and search-tied advertising. On Tuesday afternoon, the judge decided on remedies to this ruling that would open the search engine space up for competition.

Some expected that the judge would rule Google to divest from Chrome, a decision that would have been the most obvious way to combat a monopoly. But instead the judge went with more subdued actions that mostly aimed at limiting Google's exclusive contracts, which was along the lines of what the tech giant had asked for at court.

Google requested that the remedies be limited to barring the company from entering into exclusive distribution agreements, and nothing more, because “the GenAI technology space is highly competitive and any further restrictions would unfairly hobble it in that fight,” court documents show.

Although Google's Gemini trails competitor product OpenAI's ChatGPT, the tech giant's generative AI offerings are still doing considerably well as Google aims to further increase its investment in scaling out the technology.

The decision was undoubtedly a win for Google, and parent company Alphabet's stock.

“This is a monster win for Cupertino and for Google,” Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities analyst and global head of technology research, wrote in an analyst note on Tuesday. 

Cupertino-based Apple is also considered a winner, even though the company was not a party in the trial, as the court decided to spare its billions of dollars worth deal to have Google the default search engine on the Safari browser.

Competitors were dismayed. 

“We do not believe the remedies ordered by the court will force the changes necessary to adequately address Google's illegal behavior,” a spokesperson for search engine DuckDuckGo told Gizmodo on Tuesday.

Generative AI and general search engines (referred to in the lawsuit as GSEs) have a complicated relationship.

Generative AI technologies, and specifically chatbots like ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, are used by millions to answer questions that a few years ago would have been a Google search query. 

The chatbots also often include links to websites as citations in the answers they provide, much like a search engine would guide the user, albeit to more options. Search engines have taken over this role so much that many websites and media organizations who rely on these clicks to keep their business going are understandably worried.

“Chatbots perform an information-retrieval function like that performed by GSEs,” the ruling said, adding that although the chatbots “are not yet close to replacing” search engines, “the industry expects that developers will continue to add features to GenAI products to perform more like GSEs.”

In his testimony, Apple's Eddy Cue, senior VP of services,  said that generative AI products “may be having some impact” on search engine usage. 

“The volume of Google search queries in Apple's Safari web browser declined for the first time in 22 years, perhaps due to the emergence of GenAI chatbots,” Cue said.

When asked what it would take for Apple to choose any other competitor over Google as the default search engine for its browser, Cue said that no existing search engine could dethrone Google, but a generative AI product might if it evolved the right way. 

That is, the LLM technology itself is already doing fine, but what would provide the competitive edge would be if generative AI products grow their search index, aka the data available for retrieval.

“What that will do is create a product that gives better results, new capabilities. You know, those are things that people are interested in today,” Cue said.

How much of a competitive edge do they have?

But despite the obvious competitive risk posed to search engines by AI, generative AI has also been integrated into search engines to increase their competitive edge.

Google's search head Liz Reid said during the trial that Google Search queries have increased by “more than hundreds of millions of queries a month in the U.S. alone” since introducing AI Overviews in search.

At the company's earnings call in July, CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google's new AI features were now driving “over 10% more queries globally.”

The executives also said that Google is looking into ways that its GenAI product Gemini can be a search engine access point by kicking commercial queries back to Search, court documents show.

As Google wins this lawsuit on the basis that AI will prove to compete with its most precious product, the focus now shifts to how the tech industry will contend with this complicated dynamic between  its most prized emerging technology that is AI and search engines that provide the foundation of the current internet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","New York's ‘Big Bang Machine' Passes Critical First Test","https://gizmodo.com/powerful-particle-detector-in-new-york-passes-critical-standard-candle-test-2000652143","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:15:20 GMT","

We know very little about the first few microseconds after the Big Bang. We have theories, most of which we're still double- and triple-checking to see if they actually make scientific sense. The research process can seem tedious at times, but a newcomer from Long Island offers promising advances in our quest to understand how our universe came to be.

In a recent paper for the Journal of High Energy Physics, researchers with the sPHENIX Collaboration announced that it had passed a “standard candle” test with flying colors, correctly catching and measuring the energy level of colliding gold ions traveling close to the speed of light.

The sPHENIX detector is a 1,000-ton, two-story-tall instrument equipped with a powerful camera that catches and measures 15,000 particle collisions per second. It's the much-awaited upgrade to PHENIX, a now-retired detector at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).

“This indicates the detector works as it should,” Gunther Roland, a physicist at MIT and the sPHENIX Collaboration, told MIT News. “It's as if you sent a new telescope up in space after you've spent 10 years building it, and it snaps the first picture. It's not necessarily a picture of something completely new, but it proves that it's now ready to start doing new science.”

Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. Usually, these two particles are nearly impossible to pull apart, unless they're in an environment with extremely high temperatures and pressures—such as the few microseconds immediately after the Big Bang.

Under such conditions, quarks and gluons would have existed separately in a dense, soupy plasma known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The RHIC attempts to replicate these conditions by flinging particles in opposite directions. When some of these particles smash into one another, they release a gigantic load of energy that exists very briefly—for a sextillionth of a second—as QGP.

“You never see the QGP itself—you just see its ashes, so to speak, in the form of the particles that come from its decay,” Roland said. “With sPHENIX, we want to measure these particles to reconstruct the properties of the QGP, which is essentially gone in an instant.”

Passing the test bodes well for the detector's future. However, the team wants to put it through a few more quality checks. The sPHENIX detector is like a “giant 3D camera” tracking the number, energy, and paths of particles generated by a single collision, the researchers said.

“sPHENIX takes advantage of developments in detector technology since RHIC switched on 25 years ago to collect data at the fastest possible rate,” Cameron Dean, a postdoctoral student at MIT and a member of the sPHENIX Collaboration, also told MIT News. “This allows us to probe incredibly rare processes for the first time.”

Ironically, the very features that make sPHENIX so impressive are also why it requires a lot of maintenance. But the researchers are hopeful they're on the right path. As of now, sPHENIX is busy collecting data for RHIC's 25th and final run, after which the collider's successor, the Electric-Ion Collider, will take over.

“The fun for sPHENIX is just beginning,” Dean said.

One of the first laptops with Intel's upcoming Panther Lake processors showed up at IFA 2025 with little fanfare. At Acer's press conference in Berlin, we found the Swift 16 AI, using the upcoming chip based on Intel's 18A process.

Acer Swift 16 AI

Processor

Intel's Panther Lake processors

Display

Up to 16-inch 3K, OLED, 120 Hz

Memory

Up to 32GB LPDDR5X

Connectivity

Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, Dual USB Type-C Thunderbolt 4

Trackpad

""World's Largest Haptic Trackpad with Stylus Support""

The system wasn't prominently featured in the press conference, which included an AMD-based Swift Air 16 alongside a number of gaming laptops. What we know is limited largely to the placard that sat next to the system at Acer's showcase.The system has a 16-inch, 3K OLED display (likely 2880 x 1800) with a 120 Hz refresh rate. It will support up to 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and the latest connectivity standards, including Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. However, it's using Thunderbolt 4 rather than Thunderbolt 5.The trackpad looks quite large (we don't have an exact size). Acer calls it the ""largest haptic trackpad with stylus support,"" and the stylus support does heavy lifting. There aren't too many laptops that let you write on the touchpad.

This is the first system we've seen with Panther Lake that will head to market, but Acer is only saying that the system will launch in 2026. We have seen the chip's progress throughout the year. At CES 2025, ODMs like Wistron, Pegatron, and Compal showed designs for systems. Then at Computex, we saw the chips in Intel's own validation systems.At Deutsche Bank's 2025 Technology Conference, Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zisner said that ""[Panther Lake] is still on track [to launch this year]... Things are looking good. Our first SKU will be out by the end of this year, and then we will have more SKUs in the first half of 2026, and you will really start to see the volume ramp as we kind of migrate through 2026."" That's a long window where this laptop, as well as others using Panther Lake, could pop up. But it's likely we'll see more of Panther Lake at CES 2026 in early January.

A 16-µg dose of lubiprostone, a medication used in the management of constipation, improved or preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with moderate disease. The effects likely resulted from stimulating gut bacteria to produce spermidine, which enhanced mitochondrial function and protected the kidneys from further damage.

“Lubiprostone is a previously unknown therapeutic agent for CKD that improves renal function by modulating mitochondrial function. The primary objective of CKD treatment is to improve renal function rather than target surrogate markers, such as uremic toxins or proteinuria/albuminuria,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Shun Watanabe, Department of Clinical Biology and Hormonal Regulation, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. It was published online on August 29, 2025, in Science Advances.

The clinical study period was relatively short and involved a small sample size. The renoprotective effects observed were secondary and exploratory endpoints, warranting cautious interpretation. The study was limited to Japanese participants, which restricted generalizability to other ethnic groups or broader CKD populations.

This study was supported by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development Translational Research Network Program and Research on Development of New Drugs, along with grants from other sources. One author had a patent of lubiprostone for CKD in Japan.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

For decades, Medicare's approach to improving the care a patient receives has remained largely unchanged: Reward success and penalize failure.

But clinicians and policy experts have long questioned whether giving bonuses to hospitals that achieve quality standards and docking so-called underperforming doctors and facilities is the best way to achieve the goal. Skeptics now have a growing body of convincing evidence showing the approach is not working.

“At this point, it's clear that Medicare's pay-for-performance programs have cost the system more than they have benefited patients. The programs have largely been a failure,” said J. Michael McWilliams MD, PhD, a professor of medicine and health care policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a senior advisor to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation. “It's time to pull back and rethink.”

Health systems with fewer resources, less money, and a higher proportion of disadvantaged patients often remain at the bottom. Others say some clinicians and hospitals game the system, choosing measures that are easy to meet to become a “top performer.”

As Medicare heads into its 60th year, some experts say policymakers need to take a completely different tack, such as rewarding incremental improvement by health systems. Other analysts believe more clinician input and better use of technology are all that is needed to improve what the program already does. One aspect on which everyone agrees? It's time for change.

Medicare's quality improvement (QI) initiatives include the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which rewards acute care hospitals with payments based on metrics such as mortality, healthcare-associated infections, and patient experience. CMS withholds 2% of hospitals' Medicare payments each year and redistributes the money as a bonus or penalty of 2%, depending on how they perform.

The Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), meanwhile, gives rewards or penalties to physicians who care for patients with Medicare Part B. Clinicians must select measures from one of four domains: quality, cost, improvement activities, or promoting interoperability. Payment adjustments in MIPS generally range from -9% to +9%.

Multiple studies and reports have found the metrics CMS uses are not valid in proving if the care provided was high quality or not. Rebecca Andrews, MD, a professor of medicine and director of primary care for Patient Centered Medical Home and Comprehensive Pain Center, UConn Health, in Farmington, Connecticut, said many of the measures do not take into account the usual workflows that exist in hospitals or outpatient environments.

“So then what the hospitals have to do is craft all these new workflows just trying to meet these performance measures and quality improvement initiatives, rather than focusing on the whole goal of them, which is improving patient care,” said Andrews, who chairs the American College of Physicians (ACP) Board of Regents, which manages the business and affairs of the college.

Other studies show low-performing hospitals frequently care for needier patient populations with less access to care to begin with. These patients present to hospitals sicker and prone to readmissions, mortality, or complications because of social determinants of health.

“Patients may have more social determinants of care playing into some of those outcomes, and there's been efforts over the years to try to equalize that, but with anything that you try to scale this large, the devil's always in the details, and some people get hurt,” said Jeff Pothof, MD, MMM, the chief quality officer at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin.

“There's also a belief that some hospitals may avoid treating sicker patients to maintain lower readmission or complication rates,” he said.

But like any massive government program, outcomes can be nuanced and in some areas, Medicare's quality strategy has worked, said David Levine, MD, chief medical officer and senior vice president for Vizient, a company that helps health systems improve performance.

The gains have been greatest in areas such as readmissions for heart failure, pneumonia, and myocardial infarctions, with hospitals reporting fewer readmissions overall, Levine said.

In addition, when Medicare created connected penalties to the prevalence of catheter-associated urinary tract and central line-associated bloodstream infections, health systems prioritized those conditions and rates fell, Pothof said.

Some health systems likely had robust departments prior to the advent of Medicare's quality programs. But when penalties became involved, hospitals with less investment in QI built more robust systems to prevent preventable issues like hospital-acquired infections, Pothof said.

Policy experts said a shift from punishing low-performing hospitals to helping them would go a long way in achieving positive change and enhancing quality.

Strategies could incorporate measures of a hospital's individual progress alongside fixed benchmarks and provide tiered incentives that allow hospitals at all performance levels to earn rewards if they show meaningful gains, Levine said. Another idea: allow a “ramp-up” period for low-performing hospitals to avoid punitive consequences while working toward benchmarks.

“An effective program would reward progress and not just reward a certain performance level,” he said. “It takes time to improve, and that should be recognized and rewarded.”

Pothof said more focus on patient-reported outcomes would be helpful to advance QI.

“This is, if I replace your knee, how do you feel we did with that knee replacement?,” Pothof said. “Are you doing the things you love to do? Are you mobile? Things like that.”

The US could also learn from international models, Levine said. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England is an independent regulator that inspects, rates, and supports clinicians and hospitals. When problems are identified, the CQC provides action plans, improvement coaches, and follow-up support rather than penalizing, he said.

Australia, meanwhile, focuses on minimum standards but emphasizes continuous QI, Levine said. Australian regulators conduct regular audits, provide education and capability-building, and accreditation is not punitive, he said. Instead, underperforming hospitals are required to improve with external support.

“These strategies, if adapted thoughtfully, could help create a more equitable and effective approach to quality improvement in American healthcare,” he said.

Pothof said the future of QI will likely include some form of artificial intelligence to improve patient outcomes.

For example, at UW Health, staff are already using a computer model that examines hundreds of patient variables and creates associations to alert clinicians to which patients may develop conditions like sepsis, Pothof said.

“Ideally, we would get a day's heads-up that Bob in Room 5 is actually going to get pretty sick with sepsis about 24 hours from now,” Pothof said. “These models are not necessarily fully flushed out yet, but I think that's going to be a big deal for healthcare.”

While no major legislative reforms are currently in the works, physician organizations are trying to address how QI programs can be improved. For instance, the ACP meets regularly with quality reporting and regulatory agencies like CMS to discuss changes and find common ground to improve current systems, she said.

“We have been able to push back a little bit and say, ‘Let us give you some perspectives about why there's no evidence for this,' or ‘you're penalizing an individual hospital or an individual physician here, when it's a much bigger issue with elements that actually are out of our control,'” said Andrews, who chairs ACP's Performance Measures Committee.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has proposed an incentive payment system aimed at replacing MIPS. The new payment system would reinvest excess penalties in QI by helping under-resourced practices. It would also eliminate the win-lose model and reduce physicians' maximum penalty.

In 2025, nearly 50% of solo practitioners, nearly 30% of small practices, and 18% of rural practices received a MIPS penalty of up to -9%, according to the AMA.

These percentages are too high, said Bobby Mukkamala, MD, president of the association. A new model, he said, would “help practices avoid steep penalties, improve patient outcomes, and use resources more efficiently.”

McWilliams said he hopes in the future, QI becomes more local. For example, accrediting bodies might ask physicians and nurses at individual facilities about safety and quality issues that could be improved. The health system would then be required to address those problems to maintain accreditation.

Creating more meaningful metrics would likely help health systems retain clinicians who want to provide the best patient care, said Andrews.

Clinicians “feel like they have to check boxes that are not doing things that improve either the quality of health or the quality of life for their patients or that add to safety,” Andrews said. “And that's very frustrating because they went into medicine to provide good care. It's part of the reason that a lot of physicians leave healthcare.”

A secondary analysis of four trials found no significant benefit of adding behavioral therapy to the combination of buprenorphine and medical management for individuals with opioid use disorder in terms of remaining opioid-free or using buprenorphine consistently.

“Due to the impact of OUD [opioid use disorder] on quality of life, functioning, and mortality risk, efforts to optimize treatment response are of critical importance,” the authors of the study wrote. “Results of this secondary analysis of four randomized clinical trials highlight the efficacy of buprenorphine treatment when combined with medical management for opioid use disorder,” they added.

This study was led by R. Kathryn McHugh, PhD, of the Division of Alcohol, Drugs and Addiction at the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. It was published online on August 20, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The studies included differed in the duration of treatment, the dosing, and the types of behavioral therapy provided. Some studies excluded certain types of polysubstance use or co-occurring psychiatric disorders. All the studies were conducted before fentanyl and fentanyl analogues became common and before new injectable buprenorphine formulations were introduced.

This study received support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. One author reported receiving personal fees from Alkermes and Eli Lilly and Company. Another author reported receiving honoraria from the American Society of Addiction Medicine and reported that their spouse founded Playbl, which distributes video games for substance use prevention.

Among patients with chronic respiratory conditions, a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program using minimal equipment demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life, as well as reductions in dyspnea severity, that were comparable to those observed with a program using specialized gym equipment. Benefits persisted through 12 months, with similar serious adverse events.

“Keeping exercise equipment simple and keeping it minimal should be incorporated in policy action toward making evidence-based pulmonary rehabilitation models more accessible to people living with chronic respiratory disease,” experts wrote in an accompanying commentary.

The study was led by Claire M. Nolan, PhD, College of Health, Medicine, and Life Sciences, Brunel University of London, Uxbridge, England. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

COVID-related restrictions led to missing data. Noninferiority could not be demonstrated for participants in the upper quartile of baseline incremental shuttle walk distance, suggesting that minimal-equipment PR may be less effective for individuals with higher functioning capacity. PR adherence was also lower than expected.

The study was supported by the United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration-registered King's Clinical Trials Unit at King's Health Partners, partially funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London, and some other sources. Some authors disclosed receiving research grants, personal fees, or nonfinancial support or having other ties with NIHR, Brunel University of London, University College London, London, England, or other organizations.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses that affect both males and females, but research in Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica indicates that sex may influence the characteristics and course of these conditions.

The research included 1,516 individuals from the multicenter PsyCourse Study: 543 with bipolar disorder, 517 with schizophrenia, and 456 healthy controls.

Several differences between groups and sexes were identified in age at diagnosis, age at treatment, illness duration, illicit drug use, and smoking. For example, females in the schizophrenia group were older than males at first outpatient treatment compared with females in the bipolar disorder group. Moreover, those who were older at first outpatient treatment presented a longer duration of illness. Regarding substance use, the highest rates were observed in males with schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance than those with schizophrenia. Among individuals with bipolar disorder, females reported better performance in verbal memory and psychomotor speed than males. Both females and males with serious mental illnesses showed higher rates of thyroid alterations than healthy controls.

Our findings reveal a clear message: sex-sensitive treatment is essential for improving clinical outcomes, promoting healthy habits, and managing comorbidities.""

Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has developed a human vascularized liver cancer-on-a-chip model to evaluate vessel remodeling and cell death in response to embolic agents. This novel platform reflects the microenvironment of liver tumors, particularly a functional and perfusable microvasculature that can be embolized. This powerful in vitro tool aligns with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) efforts to reduce animal testing and promote alternative methods, including microfluidic devices that mimic human organs.

Embolic treatment for liver cancer is a minimally invasive therapy delivered through a catheter into the hepatic artery to block tumors' blood supply and starve them of oxygen and nutrients. This approach can be combined with chemotherapy or radioactive beads to enhance its effect. However, the development of novel embolic agents is often optimized in animal models, which differ significantly from humans at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels.

A vascularized cancer-on-a-chip offers a human-relevant, ethically sound alternative to animal testing, aligning with the growing push for non-animal technologies in preclinical drug development.""

Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator

To bridge this gap, Dr. Jucaud's lab developed a vascularized embolization-on-a-chip model that replicates the microvascular networks of liver cancer. This platform incorporates a tumor spheroid surrounded by perfusable capillary-mimicking blood vessels in a microfluidic organ-on-a-chip system. To mimic the embolization of the hepatic artery, the inflow of perfusable microvasculatures can be occluded with embolic agents loaded via a catheter. The efficacy of embolic agents is easily measured through the quantification of tumor cell death, vessel regression, cytokine release profile, and cell-surface marker identification.

""By integrating functional blood vessels into a liver cancer-on-a-chip system, we can replicate the unique vascular dynamics that drive hepatocellular carcinoma growth and response to embolic therapies, something traditional cell cultures and animal models cannot achieve,"" said Dr. Huu Tuan Nguyen, first author of the publication.

""This platform allows us to deliver embolic agents directly into microengineered tumor vessels, closely mimicking the clinical procedure and providing unprecedented insight into how tumors respond at the cellular and tissue level,"" said Dr. Vadim Jucaud. ""Beyond therapy testing, the vascularized model provides a powerful tool to study how embolization alters tumor hypoxia, immune infiltration, and angiogenic signaling, all of which are critical to advancing precision oncology.""

This innovative model provides insight into embolization dynamics and opens the door to next-generation embolic agents, potentially accelerating translation of discoveries into clinical treatments for liver cancer.

Public health and access to lifesaving vaccines are on the line in a high-stakes leadership battle at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s push to fire CDC director Susan Monarez is more than an administrative shake-up. The firing marks a major offensive by Kennedy to seize control of the agency and impose an anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda that will have profound effects on the lives and health of all Americans, public health leaders say.

Kennedy wants to see the Pfizer and Moderna messenger RNA-based covid-19 vaccines pulled from the market, according to two people familiar with the planning who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to the press. He's also set his sights on restricting or halting access to some pediatric immunizations, some public health leaders say.

His actions have already reduced federal help to states, creating the potential for more infectious disease outbreaks and incidences of foodborne illness. Some public health leaders say they expect Kennedy will use the CDC to publicize health information that isn't grounded in science.

""It's crazy season,"" said Richard Besser, former acting CDC director during the Obama administration. ""People want information they can trust to make critical decisions about their health. Until now, we've been able to say look at the CDC. Unfortunately, we're not able to do that anymore.""

HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard disputed the criticism.

""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again, dismantling the failed status quo that fueled a nationwide chronic disease epidemic and eroded public trust in our public health institutions,"" Hilliard said in a statement.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Kennedy and Commissioner of Food and Drugs Marty Makary have reiterated that covid shots will remain available for Americans who need and want them.

""The Trump administration is restoring Gold Standard Science as the sole guiding principle of health decision-making,"" Desai said in an email. ""Only the Fake News could ignore these facts to continue pushing Democrat talking points and hysteria.""

The shake-up began last week, when Kennedy sought to fire Monarez, a microbiologist who'd just been confirmed by the Senate in July. She refused to leave the position, and her lawyers said Kennedy sought to oust her because she wouldn't fire senior staff or follow unscientific directives. Four top career officials at the CDC resigned on Aug. 27 in protest.

Career staffers at the CDC and some public health groups had hoped President Donald Trump would intervene and put the brakes on Kennedy. Instead, the White House backed Kennedy, saying Monarez was fired.

Trump on Sept. 1 demanded that drug companies show that covid vaccines work, in a further sign he's not set on defending the shots.

""I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as 'BRILLIANT' as many say it was. If not, we all want to know about it, and why???"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Operation Warp Speed was the initiative that Trump himself announced in 2020 to accelerate the development of covid vaccines, including the Pfizer and Moderna shots. The vaccines have proved safe and effective in multiple clinical trials; a study published in JAMA Health Forum estimated that they saved about 2.5 million lives worldwide.

CDC staffers are worried the agency's next director won't fight for science, according to an employee who asked not to be identified for fear of professional retaliation.

Trump's support for Monarez's ouster was a watershed moment that signaled there are no checks on Kennedy and his agenda, public health advocates say. Leading congressional Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Kennedy's firing. Hundreds of HHS staffers have also implored Congress to intervene, saying Kennedy threatens science and public health. He is slated to testify Sept. 4 before the Senate Finance Committee.

Kennedy said in a message to CDC staff that his focus is on boosting the agency's reputation and leadership. The Atlanta-based agency was already reeling after the Trump administration pushed out thousands of its staff and a gunman who reportedly believed the covid vaccine had caused him health problems fired hundreds of rounds at its campus last month, killing a police officer.

""The CDC must once again be the world's leader in communicable disease prevention. Together, we will restore trust,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Together, we will rebuild this institution into what it was always meant to be: a guardian of America's health and security."" He said his deputy, Jim O'Neill, would serve as acting CDC director.

Nine former CDC directors or acting directors who served under both Republicans and Democrats criticized Kennedy in the aftermath of the Monarez firing, saying in an op-ed in The New York Times that the impact on public health is ""unacceptable, and it should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.""

HHS spokesperson Hilliard took exception with this point, listing four covid vaccines that continue to get the nod for use.

However, the Food and Drug Administration last

 week approved updated covid mRNA boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. The CDC has also stopped recommending the shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Previously, the shots had been advised for anyone 6 months or older.

As a result, many people who don't meet the criteria but want the vaccine will have to get prescriptions or consult with their doctors. Insurance may not always cover the shots, which can run around $200. Major drugstores such as Walgreens and CVS have said the shots may not be available at all pharmacies and may require a prescription.

The American Academy of Pediatrics on Aug. 19 broke with the administration, recommending that all young children get the covid vaccine. Insurance still may not cover the cost in some cases and parents could face obstacles in getting the vaccines without a prescription.

Kennedy and his team changed official covid vaccine recommendations even though there have been no new safety issues. A dose of the 2023-24 covid mRNA vaccine prevented significant illness and death across all age groups, according to a study published in August led by a University of Michigan researcher. The virus killed about 1,000 people a week in the U.S. in mid-January, and cases are rising again and expected to accelerate this winter.

Kennedy has handpicked a vaccine advisory committee for the CDC that is reviewing mRNA-based covid vaccines, which he falsely claimed in 2021 were ""the deadliest vaccine ever made."" The covid vaccine review is being led by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has said without evidence that the shots cause serious harm, including death. If the committee recommends against them, Kennedy and the FDA could then begin the process of removing them from the market.

Taking mRNA-based covid shots off the market would leave consumers with fewer options for protection. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that treats the infection in high-risk adults, would be available.

The CDC advisory committee reviewing the covid shots is also probing a long-debunked link between aluminum, used in many childhood immunizations such as those for hepatitis A and pneumonia, and autism or allergies.

The group's findings are expected to support the erroneous link, some public health officials say. HHS could then require drugmakers to undertake costly reformulations of the shots or stop manufacturing them altogether.

""That would set up the elimination of all childhood vaccines,"" Besser said.

The advisory group's next meeting is set for Sept. 18, although Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has called for the meeting to be indefinitely delayed. Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, voted for Kennedy's confirmation as HHS secretary after receiving assurances, he said, that the longtime vaccine opponent wouldn't disrupt the U.S. vaccination system. Kennedy's promises, Cassidy said, included that he wouldn't change the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Kennedy removed all of the panel's members in June and replaced them with his own appointees, including anti-vaccine activists.

Kennedy's move to put his stamp on the CDC means states that have long relied on the agency's expertise and help in crises such as disease outbreaks will largely be left to fend for themselves, said Ashish Jha, who served as President Joe Biden's covid response coordinator from 2022 to 2023.

""States are going to be left on their own,"" Jha said. ""States will struggle with the CDC incapable and dysfunctional. Our system is not designed for states to go it alone.""

The CDC typically plays a critical role by assisting states with disease surveillance, public health interventions, and outbreak response, especially when a crisis spills across state lines. An outbreak of measles this year led to more than 1,400 cases nationwide, and states including Texas, where the outbreak was identified, struggled to get help from the CDC.

A CDC program that has long tracked pathogens in food has already reduced the number of hazards it looks for from eight to two, which public health leaders say is making it harder to identify outbreaks. Staff overseeing a CDC program that tracks outdoor pollution that can exacerbate asthma also have been cut.

The agency runs a hotline that doctors around the country can call to get treatment and other types of advice. Under Kennedy's watch, the CDC has had to pare assistance because of staffing reductions, said Wendy Armstrong, vice president at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

""Lives are 100% at stake, no question about it,"" Armstrong said. ""That you can no longer trust the recommendations out of the CDC is just devastating. It's appalling to think we can't trust that information is science-based anymore.""

Kennedy wants to shake up CDC leadership because he sees the agency as the heart of corruption and resistance within the federal health bureaucracy, according to people familiar with his planning. Kennedy has said the agency suffers from malaise and bias.

Many public health leaders, however, view the CDC as under siege by an administration they say is corrupting science for its own ends. HHS staffers signed onto a letter that now has more than 6,800 signatures, saying Kennedy is ""endangering the nation's health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.""

Kennedy has also been fending off mounting criticism of his response to the shooting at the CDC's headquarters. He responded to the attack on social media, hours later, after first posting pictures of himself fly-fishing.

Some younger staffers are considering leaving and some workers feel like the shooting accelerated Kennedy's overhaul of the agency, the CDC employee said.

With the battle for control of the CDC still raging, public health leaders are now looking to Congress to put the brakes on Kennedy. Some Republican lawmakers have called for a review of Kennedy's actions.

""These high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee,"" Cassidy said Aug. 27 on the social platform X. Cassidy had backed Monarez to lead the agency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Schedule High-Profile Copa America Rematch for ‘Final' 2025 Friendly","https://www.si.com/soccer/usmnt-copa-america-rematch-final-2025-friendly","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 19:59:09 GMT","

Ahead of co-hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026, the U.S. men's national team will reportedly square off against the country that sealed their Copa América fate in 2024: Uruguay.

Their final friendly of the calendar year will take place Nov. 18, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The U.S. Soccer Federation reportedly was in talks with Brazil, but couldn't come to an agreement on a time and place.

It'll be the first time since July 2024 that these two countries face off against each other. The USMNT met Uruguay to conclude Copa América Group C play with La Celeste emerging victorious. The host nation was eliminated from the competition after the game given the USMNT lost to Panama the game prior. 

Gregg Berhalter was subsequently relieved of his duties and in came former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino. The high-profile coach has delivered mixed results so far. While there have been some positive wins in friendlies, a Concacaf Gold Cup final loss to Mexico and a fourth-place exit in the Concacaf Nations League earlier this year stain his first year in charge.

The team is looking for momentum any way possible. There are no more competitive matches before the World Cup, so friendlies are the best opportunities Pochettino and his team will get. 

The USMNT play two international friendlies during the September break against South Korea and Japan. Star forward Christian Pulisic was called-up for the games after missing the Concacaf Gold Cup over the summer.

Also included in the September squad are MLS standouts Max Arfsten, Matt Freese, Tristan Blackmon, Alex Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna. Abroad, the likes of Tyler Adams, Damion Downs, Tim Weah, Josh Sargent and Chris Richards return. Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie were not named to the squad.

Before Uruguay, they'll also face Ecuador and Australia in October. 

Uruguay and the USMNT previously played each other in a friendly back in 2022 ahead of the World Cup in Qatar.

Hello! The men's international break is well and truly here, the focus squarely on the 2026 World Cup as qualification continues in a handful of continents and the rest keep busy with all-important friendlies. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update before international matches come thick and fast.

All times U.S./Eastern

Wednesday, Sept. 3🌎 CWCC: Washington Spirit vs. Vancouver Rise, 7 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+🇺🇸 USL Championship: Hartford Athletic vs. Indy Eleven, 7:30 p.m. ➡️ ESPN+

Thursday, Sept.4🌍 WCQ: Bulgaria vs. Spain, 2:45 p.m. ➡️ FS2🌎 WCQ: Brazil vs. Chile, 8:30 p.m. ➡️ Universo🌎 WCQ: Guatemala vs. El Salvador, 10:30 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino may have billed this international break as the last chance to vet inexperienced players before the World Cup, but the latest roster is headlined by a few familiar faces, and a years-old quandary -- who exactly is going to be the USMNT's starting forward at the World Cup?

The competition is likely down to four players -- Patrick Agyemang, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi and Josh Sargent -- and while Agyemang recovers from hernia surgery and Pepi is in the early stages of a return from a knee injury, Balogun and Sargent will shoot their shot this month. Balogun has the chance to suit up for the national team for the first time after an injury-plagued year and may still be the frontrunner for the job, though Sargent theoretically poses a stiff challenge.

Sargent has five goals in four matches to start the season with Norwich City, sticking around at the Championship club after drawing interest elsewhere over the summer, including from Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The task in front of him now is translating that form to the national team – Sargent enjoyed a 15 goal season with Norwich last campaign but saw his USMNT opportunities come and go, missing out on this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup roster in what Pochettino described as a ""football decision"" at the time. This month's friendlies, then, are the latest in a dwindling number of chances for Sargent to break an international goalscoring drought that dates back to November 2019.

A handful of teams could book their spots at the 2026 World Cup this month as qualification tournaments continue, with many of the world's national teams targeting the 35 spots at next summer's competition that are still up for grabs.

South America's qualification tournament comes to a close this month, with three teams still in the mix for one guaranteed spot at the World cup and an additional berth in the intercontinental playoff. Colombia are the favorites to take that guaranteed spot and could get across the finish line as soon as Thursday, when they host fellow contender Bolivia in Barranquilla. Los Cafeteros have a five point lead over Bolivia (and a four point advantage over Venezuela), a win enough to collect the last guaranteed spot at the World Cup. That would leave Venezuela and Bolivia to duke it out for a spot in the playoff when CONMEBOL's qualification run concludes, each with an uphill battle of their own to climb – Venezuela will host Colombia, while Bolivia will welcome Brazil in the qualification finale.

Meanwhile in Africa, there are still four games to go in the first round of qualification but two regulars could get the job done this month if all things tilt in their favor. Morocco, the 2022 World Cup semifinalists, are poised to be the first team from the continent to book their spot at the 2026 tournament with a win over Niger on Friday plus a Tanzania loss to Congo on the same day. Egypt could join them on Tuesday if they win the two games on their plate this month against Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.

No spots are up for grabs in Europe or North America, though each continent kicks off major stages of qualification this month. A handful of heavy-hitters in Europe will actually begin their qualification journeys over the next couple of days, including the last three teams from the continent to win the World Cup – France, Germany and Spain – while Portugal also makes up the list as teams begin to compete for the 16 spots that are available to them. In North America, the third qualification round will begin this month and end in November with three teams booking their spots at the World Cup and two more playoff spots up for grabs later. After the three hosts, Costa Rica target back-to-back World Cup trips while Concacaf Nations League finalists Panama and regional heavyweights Jamaica are among the favorites to finish the job by November.

Ticket prices for next year's FIFA World Cup will range initially from $60 for group stage matches to $6,730 for the final, but could change as soccer's top event adopts dynamic pricing for the first time.

The prices are up from a range of $25 to $475 for the 1994 tournament in the United States and the U.S. dollar equivalent of $69 to $1,607 when ticket details were announced for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

""I think the message is 'Get your tickets early,' especially if you know where you will be because you live in that city or you're a fan of the three hosting nations, and then you know already when and where they will play,"" said Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer. ""So that's the message: 'Get your tickets early,' because anything could happen.""

- FIFA announces details to apply for 2026 World Cup tickets
- FIFA issues resale site warning for 2026 World Cup tickets
- Kennedy Center to host 2026 World Cup draw

Dynamic pricing was also used for this year's FIFA Club World Cup, when tickets were cut from $473.90 to $13.40 for the semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium.

""I didn't know about [dynamic pricing], but it means that the prices can go up or can go down,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said during the Club World Cup, ""and for us, the important element is to fill stadiums to give opportunities to people to come.""

Added Schirgi: ""It's key to highlight FIFA's mission and FIFA's objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations. And as part of that mission, which we take very seriously, we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it's always a balance between different factors.""

Next year's tournament runs from June 11 to July 19 and will be played at 11 sites in the U.S., three in Mexico and two in Canada. The tournament expanded from 32 nations to 48 and from 64 games to 104.

The initial draw period will be limited to Visa cardholders and will run from 11 a.m. ET on the opening day, Sept. 10, through 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 19. Those picked to buy tickets will be notified starting Sept. 29 and will be given a time slot to purchase starting Oct. 1. Although tickets for all 104 matches are being put on sale, receiving a time slot does not guarantee tickets will be available.

Sales will be capped at four tickets per person per match, with no person being able to purchase more than 40 for the totality of the tournament.

FIFA said it has no additional details on prices to announce.

A second phase, called an early ticket draw, likely will run Oct. 27-31, with purchase time slots from mid-November to early December.

A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. FIFA said tickets will be available closer to the tournament ""on a first-come, first-served basis.""

FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform.

Hospitality packages have been sold since May. For the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19, prices range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person.

Fans can purchase tickets to follow a certain team or purchase for a certain site.

American Airlines announced Wednesday that its AAdvantage loyalty program members can redeem miles for World Cup tickets, starting with executive platinum and concierge key members on Oct. 13, with platinum pro, platinum and gold added the following day and all members having access as of Oct. 15.

Thirteen teams in the field have been determined. The United States, Canada and Mexico are assured World Cup spots as the host nations, while reigning champion Argentina with Lionel Messi and perennial power Brazil are among the teams that have already secured qualification.

The host nations will play all three of their group stage matches on home soil. The U.S. will open June 12 in Inglewood, California, then play June 19 in Seattle and again June 25 back in Inglewood. Canada will play June 12 in Toronto, then June 18 and June 24 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mexico will play June 11 and June 24 in Mexico City, with a June 18 match in Guadalajara.

Speaking ahead of France's opening 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Iceland, Kounde said the relentless pace of fixtures was taking a toll.

""It's not just about the players,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday.

""There are families. I also think about all the people who work around football and who are sometimes victims of this relentless pace.""

France face Ukraine in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday and Iceland in Paris next Tuesday.

Kounde, who plays for Barcelona, did not feature in this year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which ran from June 14th to July 13th in the United States, but the 26-year-old still hinted at the tournament's impact on the already packed season.

Manchester City's Rayan Cherki and Arsenal's William Saliba have pulled out of the double header with injury, while Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele missed training on Tuesday because of a thigh injury.

PSG, who reached the Club World Cup final, played 65 matches in the 2024/25 season.

""It's a whole ecosystem,"" he said.

""Sometimes in life, when we overdo things, we stop appreciating them. When we see too much, we no longer give it the same importance. 

""That's what's happening with football - it's overconsumption.""

The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup added 63 matches to the summer schedule, prompting criticism from players and clubs over fatigue and injury risks.

Kounde urged football's governing bodies to reflect on the long-term sustainability of the current model.

""These are things we need to put into perspective,"" he said. ""And I think they need to change.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Here's when you'll be able to buy FIFA World Cup tickets. 

The countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is on, and FIFA has released the full timeline for when tickets will be available.

The majority of tickets will be sold through random lottery drawings — three phases in total — before the remaining tickets go on sale to the public on a first-come, first-served basis, similar to past tournaments.

The World Cup will take place next summer in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, including in Philadelphia, where six matches will be played at Lincoln Financial Field. 

Prices will vary widely: Early group stage matches will start at $60, while the most expensive seats, for the World Cup final, will start at $6,730. And prices may climb even higher — FIFA confirmed it will use “dynamic pricing,” meaning costs could change depending on demand.

Interest is already sky-high. FIFA officials say 8.5 million people have created a FIFA ID account to apply for tickets.

Here's what you need to know about the phases, dates, and how to apply.

The first phase, called the “Visa presale draw,” is fast approaching.



When: Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. through Sept. 19 at 11 a.m. 

How to apply: Create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets, log in during the window, and complete the Visa presale draw form (a Visa card is required to be eligible).

Need more detail? The Inquirer has a full guide on how to enter the presale draw with step-by-step instructions.

What's included: Single-match tickets to all 104 games, plus venue-specific and team-specific options. That means fans in the Philadelphia area could buy tickets for matches at Lincoln Financial Field — if selected.

Next steps: Winners will be notified starting Sept. 29 and assigned a date and time in October to buy tickets.

When: Oct. 27–31

How to apply: Use your FIFA ID to fill out the early ticket draw form at FIFA.com/tickets.

Next steps: Winners will get purchase time slots in mid-November through early December.

The random selection draw is the final phase of random ticket lotteries before the remaining World Cup tickets can be purchased without applying through a random lottery.

When: Early December–Spring 2026 (after the final draw on Dec. 5, when teams and groups are set)

How it works: Same process as earlier lotteries, but this time you'll apply for tickets to specific matches.

Once the lotteries end in the spring, any remaining tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. FIFA will also launch an official ticket resale platform at FIFA.com/tickets.

Supporter tickets — for fans who want to sit in their team's fan sections — will be made available closer to the tournament.

⚽ Bottom line: The first chance to apply for tickets opens Sept. 10, and you'll need a FIFA ID and a Visa card to enter. Additional lottery phases and open sales will follow, so even if you don't land tickets right away, more opportunities are coming.","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"

Spain and Bulgaria open their UEFA qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in a tight group with Turkiye and Georgia.

By Kevin Hand

Who: Bulgaria vs Spain
What: UEFA qualifiers for 2026 FIFA World Cup
Where: Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia, Bulgaria
When: Thursday, August 4, at 9:45pm (18:45 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 6:45pm (15:45 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

European football turns its focus for the next week to qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the run-in for the nations intensifying dramatically ahead of the global event.

Qualifying on the continent will now start a six-game, 11-week sprint from Thursday to advance to the tournament being played in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at why this is the opening game of this stage for hosts Bulgaria and 2010 champions Spain.

Among those starting their qualifying program are top-tier teams who played a thrilling set of Nations League games in March and June.

Since the introduction of that tournament in Europe, teams that have progressed to that latter stages of that competition only join the World Cup qualifiers at a later stage.

Portugal were crowned champions as they beat Spain 5-3 on penalties in the 2025 final in June.

Spain had overcome France in the semifinal, while Portugal beat Germany. The rest of the qualifiers for the latter stages of that tournament are also only entering the World Cup qualifiers now.

Turkiye and Georgia complete Group E of the UEFA World Cup Qualifiers.

There are six groups of four which are only now beginning their World Cup qualifying campaigns.

There are a further six groups of five teams which have already completed four qualifying matches to this stage.

The top teams from each of the groups qualify directly for next summer's World Cup, while the second placed teams enter playoffs in order to progress.

Two teams are eliminated from the reduced four-team groups, while three teams are eliminated from the already under way five-team groups.

The 12 runners-up from the current groups will be joined in the playoffs, scheduled in March, by four best-placed sides from the Nations League groups that don't qualify automatically from this stage.

The purpose is to give those sides a bonus chance of qualifying should they run into trouble in the current groups.

Those extra teams could include, remarkably, San Marino, 210th and last of the men's national teams ranked by FIFA. They are currently bottom of Group H in the qualifiers with four defeats from their four games, but finished top of Group 1 in League D of their last Nations League campaign.

The 16 European playoffs teams will be seeded into four knockout brackets of four teams each.

They play single-game semifinals and finals on March 26 and 31, to decide the four remaining World Cup slots.

The extra World Cup entries given by FIFA, and Nations League knockout stage expanded by UEFA, have changed the qualifying formula.

Europe now has its first World Cup qualifying groups of just four teams since those that finished in November 1989, just days after the Berlin Wall fell and reshaped the continent.

High-ranking nations that once had to play in groups of five or six teams across 15 months now have a condensed program playing two games in each of three straight months.

An injury could remove a key player for the entire qualifying program. Germany will not have Jamal Musiala, who sustained a serious leg injury playing for Bayern Munich at the Club World Cup in July.

The format changes again next year. After the 2026 World Cup, the FIFA schedule for men's national-team games will combine the separate September and October breaks into a four-game block over back-to-back weekends.

European champion Spain's reward for beating the Netherlands in the Nations League quarterfinal in March was to land in a four-team group with Turkiye and Georgia, two breakout successes at Euro 2024.

Georgia, with star winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, was the most dangerous team among third-seeded options in the draw last December. Georgia hosts Turkiye on Thursday and plays at Spain on October 11.

The hardest group in terms of prediction is probably the four-team group of Switzerland, Sweden, Slovenia and Kosovo.

Switzerland was an impressive quarterfinalist at Euro 2024 yet must face some of Europe's most expensive forwards – Slovenia's Benjamin Sesko, now at Arsenal, and a Sweden attacking line of Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga who were collectively signed for more than $300m this season by, respectively, Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle.

This is only the sixth meeting the Europeans – despite the fixture dating back to 1933.

Spain have won four of the encounters while the other match was a 1-1 draw in the group stage at Euro 96 in England.

Legendary Bulgarian forward Hristo Stoichkov gave his side the lead from the penalty spot but Alfonso Perez levelled for Spain.

The first meeting resulted in a 13-0 home win for Spain in a friendly in May of 1933.

This is the first meeting between the countries in more than two decades, with Spain winning the last encounter 1-0 in a friendly in 2002.

Their last competitive meeting was at the France '98 World Cup, with Spain winning 6-1.

The biggest conundrum for Bulgaria is who to start in goal with Aberdeen's Dimitar Mitov and Levski Sofia's Svetoslav Vutsov vying for the gloves.

The home side are set to deploy a five-man defence to negate the attacking threat of Spain.

Barcelona's Gavi, Paris Saint-Germain's Fabian Ruiz and Crystal Palace's Yeremy Pino all miss out due to late injuries.

Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Aleix Garcia and Rayo Vallecano forward Jorge de Frutos have been called into the squad as replacements.

Mitov; Minkov, Dimitrov, Petkov, Nedyalkov, Nurnberger; Despodov, Shopov, Gruev, Milanov;

Simon; Porro, Le Normand, Huijsen, Cucurella; Pedri, Zubimendi, Olmo; Yamal, Williams, Oyarzabal

Four years after reaching his first major semi-final at the US Open in 2021, Felix Auger-Aliassime is once again into the last four in New York, this time thanks to an inspired comeback against eighth seed Alex de Minaur on Wednesday afternoon.

On the verge of falling two sets back, the free-hitting Canadian won an absorbing 85-minute second set to draw level, then held his nerve under pressure to claim a gritty 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5, 7-6(4) victory after four hours, 10 minutes. Awaiting Auger-Aliassime in his second major semi-final is either defending champion Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti, while De Minaur slips to 0-6 in Grand Slam quarter-finals.

“It was just a lot of nerves today during the whole match, it wasn't pretty at all times, but that's what Grand Slam matches are,” said Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview. “Somedays you won't feel your best but I was willing to dig deep and do everything I can to stand here right now.

“It feels amazing. Four years ago… It feels like more. It was a tough couple of years but it feels great to be back in the semi-finals. It's been an amazing tournament so far. It's not over, there's some tennis to play and the biggest challenges are yet to come, but that's what I live for.”

FELIX FACES THE SEMI-FINALS ONCE MORE 🤩 Four years later, Auger-Aliassime returns to the @usopen SF's 🙌 #USOpen pic.twitter.com/T9UC9NSOu5

Auger-Aliassime had raised hopes of a Nitto ATP Finals berth by winning titles in Adelaide and Montpellier through the opening two months of the year and, after a mid-season struggle, he has thrust himself firmly back into the conversation. With his deep run in New York, which includes a third-round win over third seed Alexander Zverev, Auger-Aliassime is up eight spots to 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

Ahead of her US Open doubles quarterfinal match, Canadian Leylah Fernandez showed off some serious jump rope skills. Fernandez and her partner, Venus Williams, were beaten in straight sets by Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova.

We've all seen Leylah Fernandez's skills on the tennis court, but have you seen how she handles a jump rope?

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

Look at that wizardry, just like a heavyweight fighter before a title bout.

The Canadian showed off her rope excellence before her doubles quarterfinal match at the US Open, where she -- alongside her new partner and pal, Venus Williams -- fell 6-1, 6-2 to the top-seeded team of Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova.

Despite the defeat, it was a memorable week for the 22-year-old, whose run with Williams became one of the stories of the tournament after they accepted a wild card into the draw. The pair won three straight-set matches -- including upsets of a pair of seeded teams -- before running into the top two doubles players in the world.

Reflecting on their run, the former US Open singles finalist said she learned so much from her brief partnership with the 45-year-old icon. But perhaps more than anything, she was inspired by the joy that Williams plays with after all these years.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

""It's just been an incredible week and a half being here and learning so much from Venus,"" Fernandez said. ""I'm just kind of like a sponge, so I'm just kind of sucking everything in and learning and just trying to improve my tennis game. Today didn't go our way, but there's definitely a lot of positives for myself going forward, and seeing Venus playing on court for joy just kind of brought me back as to why I started playing tennis.

""It's probably the most important thing, is that I started playing tennis for the love of the game, and for bringing joy on court -- not only for myself, but also for the fans.""

It was positively joyful in Louis Armstrong Stadium for their four matches, with the crowd backing them from first ball to last. They complemented each other beautifully on court, and adorably played to the fans, with Venus twirling after victories and encouraging Fernandez to follow suit.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

Their chemistry was obvious, so much so that Venus said Fernandez is her favorite doubles partner ever outside of her sister, Serena. (High praise considering the Williams sisters won 14 doubles majors together.)

On the singles side, Fernandez won her first two matches -- against Rebecca Marino and Elsa Jacquemot -- before falling to top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets in the third round.

NEW YORK—Rest and relaxation typically aren't associated with the US Open, but Jessica Pegula is making an exception.Start with her results in Flushing Meadows: She's played five matches, and they've all ended in straight sets. The most recent, a 6-3, 6-3 victory over 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, lasted a tidy hour and 26 minutes—her second-longest match of the tournament.Beyond her efficiency on the court, Pegula has probably rested as much as possible off it. That's because of an abnormally consistent schedule for an event that leans into the frenetic.

It's a little weird. Jessica Pegula, on her 2025 US Open schedule

It started on the first day of main-draw play—a Sunday—August 24. Pegula wasn't a fan of the US Open's decision to add a third day to the first round, but she made the most of it, winning her night match 6-0, 6-4—earning her two days off, highly unusual during a major. Even this seen-it-all veteran was unsure how she'd spend her tonnage of idle time.“It's a little bit different than I'm used to, so I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do tomorrow—whether I take the day off and chill, or want to practice, or keep it low key,” Pegula told me afterward in an exclusive chat. “Two days off, I've never had to do that before. It's a little weird.”As our conversation in a hallway by the entrance to Arthur Ashe Stadium continued, Sunday turned to Monday.“With the late finish, though, I think it's kind of nice that I don't have to worry too much about feeling that I only have a day to recover.”High seeds, particularly if they're American, are desirable attractions for US Open tournament officials. They often headline night sessions in Ashe or, during the first three rounds, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Pegula hasn't played under the lights since that opening Sunday, enabling her to develop a routine while colleagues deal with uncertain start times and bizarre sleep patterns. Pegula's second and third-round matches were scheduled second on Ashe, and her fourth-round and quarterfinal contests were on first.

“I think it helps when you can get into a rhythm,” Pegula told Tennis Channel's Jon Wertheim on Tuesday, after reaching her second Grand Slam singles semifinal. “I love being able to play first. It's nice, during the day, everyone's in a good mood and happy. And then, if you win, you're done. It's nice just to go to back to the hotel.”“Always great to have similar schedules from day to day,” Mark Knowles, one of Pegula's two coaches, shared with me over text. “Very helpful.”On top of that, Pegula's Sunday start ensured she'd be playing the first set of matches each round. She'll head into Thursday's (night) semifinal with a full day of rest, unlike, say, Iga Swiatek or Amanda Anisimova, who play on Wednesday.Of course, so will her opponent, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka—who got some unlikely rest of her own with Marketa Vondrouosova's sudden withdrawal.

She embraced it, right? Mark Knowles, on Pegula's 2024 US Open run

The only thing unusual about this match-up is that a trophy isn't at stake. The three most recent Sabalenka vs. Pegula matches, all in the last 13 months, have been giant hard-court finals: at Cincinnati and the US Open last year, and in Miami earlier this year.And like all seven of Sabalenka's wins over Pegula in their nine meetings, they ended in straight sets.Pegula last stood across the net from Sabalenka during Fan Week, after competing in the mixed doubles. She decided to cut their cold and windy practice short, describing it as “terrible.” Then she went to an escape room in the city with friends, and enjoyed a couple of beverages. (Not her first in New York.)

Two weeks later, she's back in the final four.She will surely try something different this encounter, but it may be more mental than tactical. It may be more…relaxing.“Instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly,” Pegula said in her press conference on Tuesday, “enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final, and I'm playing the best player in the world.”She echoed a similar sentiment to Wertheim: “Back myself, and know that I can play good tennis. That I'm a great player.”The 31-year-old has reminded us of that this US Open—a tournament where, after eight months of globetrotting and grinding tennis, any advantage helps. Physically, she comes into her latest Sabalenka showdown with plenty in the tank. Mentally, she appears to be in her best head space in months.Emotionally?

(Usually tight-lipped about her family, the Buffalo native made another reveal in our conversation, when I asked her about HBO's latest season of Hard Knocks, featuring her beloved Bills: “People say my dad's in it a lot—he's pretty funny, which is true,” Pegula says with a laugh. “Maybe that's kind of why I don't want to watch, because it's like, a little embarrassing.”)If Pegula is to overcome Sabalenka, the US Open would be a fitting venue. It was here, last year, that she snapped a six-match losing streak in Grand Slam singles quarterfinals. She also did that against a world No. 1, Swiatek.Referencing the pressure-filled moment, Knowles asks me after a Pegula practice at Indian Wells in March: “She embraced it, right?”“She hadn't gotten past the quarterfinal stage—which, by the way, millions of players would sign up for. The win over Iga was obviously super important, bright lights in New York City, trying to get over that hump.”Pegula followed that with another breakthrough result, over Karolina Muchova in the semis. Victory seemed unlikely when Pegula trailed 6-1, 2-0 and faced break point. But out of position, she sprinted to get her racquet on a Muchova forehand with a defensive stab, and the Czech overcooked the volley. It was the match's turning point.“For me, that was probably a greater victory, because that showed true adversity,” Knowles recalls. “As I told her the minute she walked off the court—and I've been around a long time—99 percent of players would have just said, my run's come to an end.“She was able to dig deep. She's a tenacious player, but she's an incredible fighter.”

The win over Iga was obviously super important, bright lights in New York City, trying to get over that hump.”Pegula followed that with another breakthrough result, over Karolina Muchova in the semis. Victory seemed unlikely when Pegula trailed 6-1, 2-0 and faced break point. But out of position, she sprinted to get her racquet on a Muchova forehand with a defensive stab, and the Czech overcooked the volley. It was the match's turning point.“For me, that was probably a greater victory, because that showed true adversity,” Knowles recalls. “As I told her the minute she walked off the court—and I've been around a long time—99 percent of players would have just said, my run's come to an end.“She was able to dig deep. She's a tenacious player, but she's an incredible fighter.”

Success is... Jessica Pegula, ten days ago

A word that keeps surrounding Pegula this season is “challenges.” When I asked her what success at this US Open is, way back on Sunday, August 24, she said, “it's dealing with the challenges, the ups and downs.” When she won a WTA 250 in Austin in early March, she thanked Knowles in her champion's speech for “accepting the challenges every single day.”A week later at the BNP Paribas Open, I asked Knowles what he thought Pegula meant by that. He gave a remarkable answer:“It's always fascinating when you work with great athletes, and she's one of those. I've known a lot of them, and I've played at a pretty decent level as well. I understand all the stuff that goes into it. It's not just the hitting of the tennis ball or those types of things, it's a grind. I was taken aback at how hard she works—pretty impressive—but there's also a balance there.“I think with any coach, when they start working with a player, you want to hear from the player, you want to see how they react, how they deal with pressure, all the different things, and then you want to ingratiate your own philosophy. You've got to understand, she's been very successful before me, and will probably be very successful after me. So it's about trying to make our relationship, and the same with (fellow coach) Mark Merklein. We're in tandem, we're a full team, we're all on the same page, which I think helps a lot.“What's important for Jess, like all great champions, is they demand a lot of themselves. That's probably what she was referring to. Trying to see an athlete fulfill their potential. And there's going to be challenges. If there wasn't, everyone would be doing it.”

At 45 years, old, the former world No. 1 partnered Leylah Fernandez to reach the quarterfinals.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 03, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 03, 2025

NEW YORK—Having already achieved a Hall of Fame-worthy career multiple times over, Venus Williams still sees room for growth after her summer comeback ended at the US Open on Tuesday.“I think after this tournament I can really see where I want to improve, what I can work on,” Williams said following a quarterfinal-round defeat in women's doubles. “Yeah, I think that it's all great feedback. But also, I had a lot of chances to play a lot of matches here, which is what I would desperately need to get better. I saw myself improving so much with every match I was playing.”Off the court for 16 months, Williams made a valiant return to action at 45 years old this summer, winning her first singles match since 2023 at the Mubadala Citi DC Open and pushing two-time semifinalist Karolina Muchova to three sets in the first round of this year's US Open.

Despite the disappointing exit, Williams rebounded in doubles with Fernandez, a 2021 singles runner-up. In their first tournament as a pair, they upset No. 6 seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez en route to the last eight, where they ultimately fell to top seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.“In a lot of ways, we just ran out of time,” Williams said. “I wish I could have played better today for Leylah. I blame myself for a lot of it. I just wasn't there. I think with a few matches I could have been a stronger partner today.”The five-time Wimbledon champion has been reluctant to commit to more tournament after the US Open swing, blaming her ambivalence towards long flights as she seemingly ruled out the upcoming Asian Swing and even the 2026 Australian Open.

“I do have commitments, you know, places I said I'd be, people expecting me to be there, like, the next few weeks,” said Williams. “So I have to go and show up. But I'm very serious about my commitments. I would never want to cancel now, so I'll try to keep those.“If there is opportunity for me to play, then hopefully I can get back somewhere this year. I just don't know. I really don't.”For all the talk of Williams' age, the press conference with Fernandez ended with a bit of levity when the former No. 1 was asked about Will Smith, the Academy Award-winning actor who played her father Richard in the eponymous King Richard biopic in 2021.Q.

We were always on the court practicing. My dad only let us watch educational programs growing up, so never really got to see ""The Fresh Prince"" until I grew up. It was, like, major for me as a 20-year-old to watch that, but it never gets old.Will Smith is a legend. The fact that he did such an honor to play my dad, and he took it -- you can't understand how seriously he took it. He really put his whole life into it, and he got rewarded for it too.

This semifinal was the most anticipated first meeting of the 2022 ATP season. It's safe to say, after Alcaraz's win, in three hours and 35 minutes, that the match and his performance lived to up to all of those expectations, and may have added a few more for the future. “Both of us played an incredible match.” READ MORE2023 Roland Garros SF: Djokovic wins, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1Through two sets, the match was played at hyper speed and delivered on all of its shotmaking promise.

Rather than a harbinger, the match now feels like a one-day celebration of the sport. All of its elements will stay in the mind's eye of everyone who watched. The sun-filled, tension-filled Centre Court. The royalty, Spanish and English, young and old, rooting like hardcore fans. The world's two best players pushing each to their physical and mental limits. “I grew up a lot since that moment in the French Open.” READ MORE2023 Cincinnati F: Djokovic wins, 5-7, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (4)If any final deserved a third-set tiebreaker, it was this one.

There was little between the two players in the first half hour of the match as they traded holds through the first seven games. That's when Djokovic pounced, winning five of the next six games.

The Cooldown Room - Stroopwafel Challenge with Alba Larsen

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

Yuki Tsunoda scored for Red Bull at the Dutch Grand Prix, and the Japanese racer has been reflecting on his P9 finish at Zandvoort.

Yuki Tsunoda finally broke his points scoring dry run in the Netherlands, finishing ninth despite mechanical woes as Red Bull got both cars home in the top 10 on a day that the Japanese racer called “special”.

Having not scored for Red Bull since his P10 in Imola back in May, the pressure has been mounting on Tsunoda to start picking up the points – and his cause was not helped by having an older-spec car than team mate Max Verstappen, nor the form of the two Racing Bulls drivers, who were picking up points on a regular basis.

But Tsunoda finally had his car upgraded to the same spec as Verstappen's before the summer break, and looked to be in touch with his team mate throughout practice at Zandvoort.

His Qualifying did not quite go to plan – Tsunoda has not made Q3 since Miami – and he started outside the top 10 in P12. But a good getaway got him onto the fringes of the points, after he opted to start on the soft compound tyres.

Because of that, a relatively early pit stop for fresh rubber was required and that meant Tsunoda could not make the most of the Safety Car periods. He did stop again under the second for some more soft tyres but lost out to traffic – and was forced to make that C4 compound last 22 laps to the finish.

“There were a lot of moments where the Safety Car didn't help. At some point I was P15, and the second Safety Car didn't help at all, so [it] gave me a lot of challenges – almost too much,” Tsunoda said afterwards.

His race nearly unravelled further when a radio call came after he complained about a throttle map issue – the team telling their man that he was going to have to drive around the problem, which saw him not getting any power until he had applied 40% throttle.

“The last stint, even though I was out of the points still, I got some big issue that normally, probably in the first few years I would have kind of… not given up, but lose the confidence to drive fast,” Tsunoda explained.

“But I stayed focused, and in the end I got P9 which makes me really happy and even in those circumstances, [I was] able to overtake a couple of cars, which wasn't easy.

“Normally P9 is not really special, but especially after seven races and with the car in that situation – that was special to me and gives me some confidence.”

Tsunoda has scored just nine points since he joined Red Bull at the third round of the season, enduring a difficult run that has included plenty of bad luck along the way. Having the same spec RB21 as his team mate has definitely made a difference – even if the result in Hungary before the summer break did not reflect that.

“I think the last especially three races, the team pushed me and gave me a lot of things to gain performance on the car and that helps a lot.

“So I massively appreciate the team for having massive support and it's time for myself to adapt as much as possible and score points and be as close as possible with Max. It is just something, like I said, I needed a lot... I'll keep pushing.”

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

Isack Hadjar secured his first podium finish in Formula 1 at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Racing Bulls team boss Alan Permane surprised by his pace.

Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane has admitted that running towards the front of the field during the Dutch Grand Prix ""was actually pretty comfortable"", as the team secured a podium finish.

Isack Hadjar put in one of the performances of the weekend, taking fourth place on the grid behind both McLarens and Max Verstappen at the Zandvoort Circuit.

Having held his position at the start, the 20-year-old kept both Charles Leclerc and George Russell at bay during various points, and when Lando Norris ahead retired in the closing stages, it allowed Hadjar to become the youngest Frenchman to claim a Formula 1 rostrum.

""A bit dazed, a bit over the moon, excited. Honestly, I can't wait to get to Monza, all of those [races]. Proud of the team,"" said Permane when reflecting on the podium, the team's first since 2021 when it was known as AlphaTauri.

""I don't want to sound blasé but at the start of the race I thought it was going to be tricky to race the Ferraris and the Mercedes. And then after 10 laps you think, this is going to be okay, we've got this.

""The Safety Car came and that gave us a relatively straightforward stop on to the hard tyre and from then it would have been a run to the end and we had the pace, we were pulling away. So fourth was actually pretty comfortable, which is lovely to say.""

While Hadjar was able to claim an unexpected result, team mate Liam Lawson was left frustratingly outside the points after a collision with Carlos Sainz when running seventh and on course for his fifth points finish of the season.

""Such a shame for Liam. He was doing well, he got a great start,"" said Permane, with Racing Bulls now seventh and only 20 points behind Williams in the Teams' Championship in fifth.

""I don't know where he would have finished, I guess he would have finished with the Mercedes had he not been taken out by Carlos. These things happen, he'll come back strong and we can expect him to be back in Monza fighting.""

The Cooldown Room - Stroopwafel Challenge with Alba Larsen

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

The F1 Nation crew review all the talking points from a dramatic Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

Zandvoort played host to an action-packed Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, with Oscar Piastri taking victory, McLaren team mate and title rival Lando Norris retiring, and Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar claiming a superb maiden podium finish.

Marcin Budkowski, who worked with Piastri at Alpine and has held engineering roles at Ferrari and McLaren, joined F1 Nation host Tom Clarkson in the paddock post-race to reflect on all the drama and talking points.

After Norris' late mechanical failure, Piastri's seventh victory of the season moves him 34 points clear at the top of the Drivers' standings. What does that retirement mean for Norris' title hopes and his approach for the rest of the year? How did Piastri end up getting the better of Norris after trailing him in all three practice sessions?

Budkowski shares fascinating insight into how different Piastri is in the cockpit compared to out of the car with his helmet off, and why the Australian has surprised him after having some doubts about his title-winning credentials.

Norris' loss was Hadjar's gain, as the Frenchman jumped up a place from P4 to P3 to score his first podium in F1. How did Hadjar execute his best weekend in F1 so far? And should Red Bull promote him to be Max Verstappen's team mate in 2026?

Elsewhere, Ferrari had a weekend to forget with a double retirement, after Charles Leclerc was taken out by Kimi Antonelli and Lewis Hamilton crashed into the barriers. Budkowski tells Clarkson why he thinks Antonelli is going through a difficult patch at Mercedes and why Hamilton's struggles with the car remind him of Daniel Ricciardo at McLaren.

The feature with Lex Luthor and Superman will arrive in 2027.



		By Aaron Couch, Borys Kit 

	September 3, 2025 9:49am	




James Gunn has unveiled the next project in his Superman Saga. Man of Tomorrow will be in theaters July 9, 2027, the filmmaker revealed on Instagram on Wednesday.


	The announcement was accompanied by a drawing by DC head Jim Lee featuring Lex Luthor in a green and purple mech suit, with Superman leaning against him, a slight smile on his face as he holds a screwdriver. Luthor's armored suit, designed to battle Superman, has been seen for decades in the comics and in animation, but never in live-action.




	Gunn has been teasing this new feature for weeks, saying that his next project won't be a direct sequel to Superman, but will feature characters audiences already know from his summer hit.

	“I've already finished the treatment for the next story in what I'll call the ‘Superman Saga,'” Gunn told The Hollywood Reporter last month at the premiere for his TV show Peacemaker. “I'm working on that and hopefully going into production on that not too far away from today.”


	It's unclear what the story will be, but there was a Superman: Man of Tomorrow animated movie in 2020 that also featured Lobo (Jason Momoa plays the antihero in next summer's Supergirl). The animated movie was based on a 2003 miniseries titled Superman: Birthright that was a modernization of the Superman origin story.


	Coming up, DC Studios has filmmaker Craig Gillespie's Supergirl due out June 26, 2026, with James Watkins' horror title Clayface slated for Sept. 11, 2026.

	











	Gunn is coming off of Superman, which earned strong reviews and introduced a slew of new characters to populate the DC Universe, not just Superman (David Corenswet), Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) and Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), but heroes such as Guy Gardner (Nathon Fillion), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced).


	With $611.6 million globally, Superman stands as the top-grossing comic book movie of the year, but the sum also reflects the more challenging theatrical landscape when it comes to superheroes, particularly internationally. (In 2013, Zack Snyder Superman feature Man of Steel topped $670 million globally.)


Superman ended with a crying Luthor being taken away into custody. Wednesday's post on Instagram seems to say he will return, more determined than ever … but with Superman's friendly stance, perhaps some sort of alliance could end up being forged. Let fandom speculate away.

The Warrens wrap up their role in 'The Conjuring' universe with this latest entry in the hit horror franchise. 


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	It's not just the floorboards that are creaky in the ninth entry in the venerable Conjuring horror franchise. It all began with the 2013 original, depicting the exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. That indomitable duo is back for one last go-around in The Conjuring: Last Rites, and it must be said that they look tired.


	And why wouldn't they be, considering the travails they've been through in their previous films? Not to mention that Ed suffered a heart attack in the last one, from which he is still recovering. As this installment set in 1986 begins, the couple are semi-retired, reduced to giving talks in virtually empty lecture halls to young people who are much more excited about Ghostbusters.

The Bottom Line

	
	A franchise suffering from fatigue.
	



Release date: Friday, September 5Cast: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Mia Tomlinson, Ben Hardy, Steve Coulter, Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Beau Gadson, Kila Lord Cassidy, John Brotherton, Shannon KookDirector: Michael ChavesScreenwriters: Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick

								2 hours 15 minutes			






	Of course, just when the Warrens thought they were out, they're pulled back in for one last case. Specifically, the real-life case of the Smurls, an extended family living in a Pennsylvania coal town who experience things going bump in the night after they make the mistake of purchasing a hideous, hand-carved wooden mirror featuring cherubs at its top.




			Related Video		







	Unfortunately for them as well as the film's viewers, it takes a long time for the Warrens to arrive. As a matter of fact, everything takes a long time in this attenuated entry clocking in at a bloated 135 minutes. It begins with an unnecessary prologue set in 1964 depicting the birth of the couple's daughter Judy, who nearly doesn't survive.

	











	When the action shifts forward 22 years, it resembles an old-fashioned television show, with the now-grown Judy (Mia Tomlinson) and her boyfriend Tony (Ben Hardy) arriving for a family get-together that includes much comic banter, a lively game of ping-pong, and Tony nervously asking Ed and Lorraine for their blessing before he proposes to their daughter. Lorraine beams with pleasure, while Ed registers grumpy disapproval like every dad in every family sitcom ever.


	It soon becomes clear that Judy has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, leading her to become aware of the Smurl family's plight. Also aware is her parent's old friend Father Gordon (franchise veteran Steve Coulter), who goes to see a bishop to request help for the beleaguered family. Not surprisingly, the visit doesn't go well.


	So it's left to the Warrens, with Judy and Tony in tow, to head to Pennsylvania where the Smurls have become a media sensation. Cue the predictable spooky mayhem as everyone battles a series of evil manifestations, including dolls, that by now feel all too familiar in their jump scares. This is the kind of haunted house movie in which everything seems to happen in dark rooms, the characters armed only with flashlights, as horrific storms rage outside. It's the kind of movie in which a character enters a dark attic alone, because she's apparently never seen a scary movie before.


The Conjuring: Last Rites trades heavily in nostalgia, with numerous callbacks to past adventures and frequent visitations to the Warren's “Artifact Room,” where Annabelle still resides in her locked cabinet. And since we've been watching the Warrens battle demonic entities for 12 years, they now feel like old friends. Farmiga and Wilson haven't lost their appeal, and with their relaxed chemistry they make for engaging company.

	











	But it all feels old hat by now, with returning director Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun II) failing to bring much freshness or vitality to the proceedings. The stateliness of it all feels even more old-fashioned in light of such recent audacious and original horror films as Sinners, Weapons, and everything directed by Jordan Peele.


	Despite its title and final moments informing us of what happened to the real-life Warrens in their last years (complete with archival clips and photographs), the family tradition may live on, cinematically at least. Tomlinson delivers a terrifically intense performance as the psychically gifted Judy, leading one to think she could easily headline yet another Conjuring offshoot.

Disney stayed No. 1 as Warners roared back to life, Universal remained steady as ever and streamers pulled off a big coup ('F1: The Movie').


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Disney maintained its lead in summer marketshare at the 2025 box office but the toast of the town was Warner Bros., which came in a close second thanks to standout hits including Weapons, Superman and Apple Original Films' record-smashing F1: The Movie starring Brad Pitt, as well as enjoying carryover money from spring blockbusters A Minecraft Movie and Sinners. Not so long ago, some thought Warners film studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy were gone. Not anymore.


	Heading into the season, Weapons and F1 were nowhere to be found when Fandango put out its annual survey of the top-10 most anticipated summer films. The survey was close to being bang-on correct regarding No. 1 on the list, which was Jurassic World Rebirth. Many in Hollywood were dubious as to whether Universal and Amblin could reboot the Jurassic franchise for a third time, and birth a new trilogy more than three decades after Steven Spielberg's dinos first stomped onto the big screen in 1993's Jurassic Park. But relaunch it they have.

					Summer Box Office Clobbered by Kryptonite: Domestic Revenue Barely Matches Last Year		
			









Jurassic World Rebirth is the summer's second-biggest film, with more than $855.6 million in worldwide ticket sales behind Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch (Lilo was No. 9 on Fandango's list). Yet Lilo is the only film of the year so far to have crossed $1 billion globally, with total earnings of $1.33 billion through Sept. 1. It has played both to families and to nostalgic teenagers and Gen Zers who grew up watching the 2002 animated film of the same name about the friendship forged between a lonely Hawaiian girl and a troublesome, pet-like, blue alien. Like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, it points to the limitless financial potential of tapping into such nostalgia.

	











	Warners rebound has been anchored by Joseph Kosinski's F1: The Movie. The big-budget Formula One movie finished Labor Day with more than $613 million in worldwide ticket sales, a sum no one thought possible considering its lead star is in his early 60s and this particular racing sport has never been all that popular in the U.S. (that's why no studio would shell out $200 million to $300 million to make the racing film; instead Apple Original Films made the pic, and brought on Warners as its distribution and marketing partner).


	On Aug. 27, FI broke its latest record when passing up Warner and DC Studios' Superman, a feat few could have imagined. It also is the top-grossing sports pic of all time, and the best of Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation.


	Abdy and De Luca also became heroes of the summer box office when originality paid off in a major way with the mid-August release of Zach Cregger's Weapons. The film has became a cultural sensation, grossing north of $250 million to date against a $38 million budget. (Naysayers were just as dismissive when Ryan Coogler's original pic Sinners, another De Luca and Abdy project, opened in theaters in April. They were silenced when the pic topped out north of $455.7 million globally.)


	It's true that Superman, which has earned $611 million to date worldwide, has given DC a much longed-for win over Marvel, but the Man of Steel can't exactly gloat. Superhero fatigue at the box office, a phenomenon which is now impacting the foreign box office in a major way, remains a major issue.

	











	Elsewhere, the ever-steady Universal remained in fine standing this summer between Jurassic World Rebirth and DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon, which is the third top-grossing Hollywood title of the summer with a global cume of $629 million (it's the first time DWA has borrowed from the Disney playbook and made a live-action adaptation of one of its library titles).


	Paramount and Sony both had tough summers, albeit for different reasons. The former was in the midst of waiting for the Skydance merger to close as it released Tom Cruise's latest Mission: Impossible movie, The Final Reckoning. Sony was left bereft in terms of having a summer tentpole to release because of delays related to the labor strikes, say insiders.


	On Sept. 2, Comscore revised its summer revenue estimate after it finished tallying Labor Day numbers. For the period May 2-Sept. 1, domestic revenue came in at $3.672 billion, a decline of 0.10 percent from last year's $3.672 billion. Comscore initially forecast a decline of 0.2 percent.


	Below is summer domestic, international and global revenue broken down by the five major legacy studios.

Gunna's DS4EVER edged out Abel's Dawn FM by 2,300 units to take the top spot on the Billboard 200 back in January 2022.


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Alleged phone calls made from jail by Young Thug have been leaked in recent days, as the YSL honcho faces snitching allegations stemming from a 2015 conversation with authorities surrounding a Lil Wayne tour bus shooting. 


	Thugger continues to distance himself from Gunna, who was released nearly two years before Thug after reaching an Alford plea deal in the YSL RICO case in December 2022, as Thug believes his mentee snitched on him.


	One recent alleged jail phone call involving Thug found him claiming that he paid $50,000 for streams to help Gunna's DS4EVER album debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 over The Weeknd's Dawn FM in 2022.

	“Like, the No. 1 album you just had right now, I paid for you to have the No. 1 album,” he said. ”You didn't honestly earn a No. 1 album over The Weeknd, my boy. I paid for that sh–. I never said anything to him. I never told him that.”




	He continued: “We just got the plug on that. You never earned a No. 1 album. I spent 50 extra grand buying motherf—ing streams for you.”


	Gunna earned his second No. 1 album atop the Billboard 200 in January 2022 in a tight race against The Weeknd. DS4EVER launched with 150,300 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 13, according to Luminate.


	The album's first-week sales figure was nearly entirely comprised of streaming. SEA units comprised 144,600 (equaling 193.5 million on-demand official streams), while album sales held 4,700 and TEA units comprised 1,000. 


	It was also the most-streamed album that week and Gunna added a Drake collaboration titled “P Power” to the project's track list on the final tracking day. DS4EVER was on sale for $7.99 on the iTunes store and could be purchased digitally on his website for $4. 


	As for The Weeknd, Dawn FM bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 148,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 13, according to Luminate.


	Of the total, SEA units made up 131,300 (equaling 173.04 million on-demand official streams of the album's songs), while album sales bested Gunna's total with 14,800 and TEA units comprised 1,900.

The former Pink Floyd bassist recently said in an interview that he ""never"" cared about Black Sabbath.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Jack Osbourne has two pointed words for Roger Waters: “f–k you.” The comment came in an Instagram post from Osbourne on Tuesday (Sept. 2) in response to a recent interview with the former Pink Floyd bassist and solo act who said he didn't “give a f–k” about the late Ozzy Osbourne‘s solo music or that of his band, Black Sabbath.

	











	“Hey Roger Waters. F–k you,” Jack Osbourne wrote in his post. “How pathetic and out of touch you've become. The only way you seem to get attention these days is by vomiting out bulls–t in the press. My father always thought you were a c–t — thanks for proving him right [clown emoji.]” 


	In an interview with The Independent Ink, Rogers was discussing the state of British politics when he said, “Ozzy Osbourne, who just died, bless him in his whatever state that he was in his whole life. We'll never know. Although he was all over the TV for hundreds of years wit his idiocy and nonsense and… the music, I have no idea. I couldn't give a f–k.

	The comments from Waters, 81, came six weeks after Osbourne's death on July 22 at age 76 of a heart attack, just weeks after performing for the final time at the all-star July 5 Back to the Beginning concert featuring tributes from Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Mastodon, Lamb of God and dozens more.

	











	Waters' rant about Osbourne continued with another dig at one of Ozzy's most infamous moments. “I have no interest in biting the heads off chickens or whatever they do. I couldn't care less, you know,” he said, with the interviewer clarifying that it was a bat whose head Ozzy famously bit off, not a chicken. “That's even worse, isn't it?” 


	The comments on Jack Osbourne's post doubled-down on his Waters diss, with fans writing, “People have to ask who Roger Waters is, but no one has to ask who Ozzy is. Enough said,” as well as, “Your Father was The Best Judge of Character” and “disrespecting those who have passed away is a reflection of your character. Obviously Roger has none. God speed Ozzy! You are loved and missed.”

Paramount Pictures continues its streak of high-profile deals, sealing a first-look, multi-picture deal with Will Smith and his company Westbrook.


	Following the closing of the Skydance merger last month, the new pact with Smith will focus on creating global, four-quadrant theatrical movies with franchise-starting and IP-based films.  


	The terms encompass a first-look deal with a development commitment to franchise-starters positioned as starring vehicles for Smith, which include the thriller Sugar Bandits and Rabbit Hole. Westbrook will be based on the Paramount lot in Hollywood.

	











	Based on the book Devils in Exile by Chuck Hogan, Sugar Bandits follows a former Special Forces soldier who runs an elite vigilante squad working to wipe out the drug trade in Boston.

Rabbit Hole will be penned by Dune scribe Jon Spaihts; plot details are unknown at this time.


	The deal marks another huge win for Paramount, which has been on a streak of luring big-time talent under new boss David Ellison. Last month, the Duffer brothers, who had a strong relationship with Netflix going back to the debut of Stranger Things, signed a four-year deal with Paramount last month that stunned the industry.


	Smith and Westbrook previously had their deal with Sony for decades. 


	Paramount has also been busy on the content front, recently acquiring the rights to adapt a feature film based on the Activision video game series Call of Duty. It also made a big splash the day the Skydance deal closed, landing the coveted package High Side starring Timothée Chalamet, with James Mangold directing.

	











	Smith and Westbrook are repped by CAA.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate‘s feature take of Freida McFadden novel The Housemaid will now be released on December 19 instead of Christmas Day.


	The studio is so over the moon about the Paul Feig-directed thriller starring Sydney Sweeney, Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar that the plan is to get the age 18-24 bunch who are off from college, who'll then spread the word of mouth on the pic heading into Christmas.


The Housemaid will now open against 20th Century Studios' James Cameron event title Avatar: Fire & Ash. Note, The Housemaid in its young, heavy-female skew is counterprogramming to that family event title. The Housemaid will also be sharing the marquee with wide entries in Paramount/Nickelodeon's SpongeBob Movie: The Search for Squarepants and Angel Studios' Zero A.D.

	Sweeney's previous romantic comedy with Glenn Powell, Anyone But You, bowed on the Friday before Christmas in 2023 to $6 million and did an awesome 14.7x multiple stateside for an $88.3M take, $220.3M worldwide, becoming one of Sony's most profitable titles that year.  In The Housemaid, Millie (Sweeney) is trying to escape her past and accepts a job as a live-in housemaid for the wealthy Nina (Seyfried) and Andrew Winchester (Sklenar). But what begins as a dream job quickly unravels into something far more dangerous — a sexy, seductive game of secrets, scandal and power. Behind the Winchesters' closed doors lies a world of shocking twists that will leave you guessing until the very end.Pic also stars Michele Morrone and Elizabeth Perkins. Rebecca Sonnenshine wrote the screenplay off McFadden's novel. Producers are Todd Lieberman, Feig and Laura Fischer.

			By Nada Aboul Kheir, Nancy Tartaglione 


Kaouther Ben Hania's Gaza-set drama The Voice of Hind Rajab, one of the buzziest titles coming into this year's Venice Film Festival given its subject matter, received what might be a film festival record 23-minute and 50-second ovation after its world premiere Wednesday evening, when the audience broke into chants of “free Palestine” after the lights went up.


	It was certainly the biggest response at this year's festival for the drama, which reconstructs the events surrounding the killing of 6-year-old Hind Rajab, her four cousins, her aunt and uncle, and the two paramedics who came to her rescue after their car came under fire by Israeli forces as they tried to flee Gaza City in January 2024.

	











	The killings took place some three months into Israel's ongoing military operation in the Gaza Strip, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 terror attacks, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 61,000 people living in the Palestinian territory.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Here in Venice, it's thought that Pedro Almodóvar's English-language debut, last year's The Room Next Door, had been the ovation record-holder at 18 minutes. The longest recorded applause at a film festival had been a 22-minute standing ovation for Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth at the Cannes Film Festival.

	After tonight's screening, as the “free Palestine” chants began, Hind Rajab actor Motaz Malhees took one of many Palestinian flags in the audience and held it up in the gallery. Several audience members were seen and heard sobbing during the film — and some were still crying even after it ended.

	Last week, a number of Hollywood A-listers came on board Hind Rajab as executive producers including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer. Phoenix and Mara were present today at the Venice photo call for the film and attended the premiere screening, where the cast of the film held up a photo of Hind Rajab amid the ovation.

	Tunisia has already selected the drama as its submission for the Best International Feature Oscar.


	At the film's press conference this afternoon, Ben Hania and her cast entered the room, and were greeted with a standing ovation, after which actress Saja Kilani took the mic and gave an impassioned speech on behalf of the film's crew.


	“Enough of the mass killing, the starvation, the dehumanization, the destruction, and the ongoing occupation,” Kilani said. 


	“This film is not an opinion or a fantasy. It is anchored in truth. Hind's story carries the weight of an entire people. Her voice is one amongst 10s of 1000s of children that were killed in Gaza in the last two years alone. It is the voice of every daughter and every son with the right to live, to dream, to exist in dignity. Yet all of it was stolen in front of our unblinking eyes.” 


	On Saturday, a large protest gathered on the Lido in support of Palestine and to denounce Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. 


	In his review, Deadline's Damon Wise called the movie “extraordinary” saying it “could be the lightning rod that supporters of the Gazan cause are waiting for, an urgent procedural that uses cinematic means — close, hand-held takes and a camera that paces around like an expectant father — to make its point.”


	He also noted, “This vital movie is not about the how or the when, it is all about the why.”


	Ben Hania is one of Tunisia's most internationally renowned directors. Her last film, Four Daughters, was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2024 Academy Awards, having been presented in Competition at Cannes and winning the Golden Eye award.


	Her previous film, The Man Who Sold His Skin, was also nominated at the Oscars, for Best International Feature in 2021.


The Voice of Hind Rajab is produced by Nadim Cheikhrouha under his Mime Films and Tanit Films banners. Additional producers are Odessa Rae at New York-based RaeFilm Studios and James Wilson at London-based Jw Films Production.


	The Party Film Sales is handling international with a number of key distributors already on board. CAA Media Finance reps North America.

Great.  Maybe we should divide The Venice Film Festival into two halves with walls and checkpoints.

Feel bad for Hinds and her family but the chants of “free Palestine” during the standing O are disgusting. I won't have anything to do with Venice going forward.  This is just another example of how out of touch with mainstream America most filmmakers are.

Gotta be honest with you big dawg, I don't think this French-Tunisian co-production was very concerned about mainstream American interest when they were making a film about the murder of a Palestinian child

The fact that everything is getting a standing ovation is proof that it all sucks.

The Odyssey will get a one hour standing ovation.

Sickening

Yes, what Palestinians have endured for the last 75 years or so is sickening.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Alien: Earth gives in and becomes an Alien movie","https://www.avclub.com/alien-earth-recap-season-1-episode-5-in-space-no-one","Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:32:00 GMT","

Alien: Earth has landed at its inevitable flashback episode. “In Space, No One…” takes viewers back to the first five minutes of the series, allowing writer-director Noah Hawley to elaborate on the USCSS Maginot‘s final hours and craft a legacy prequel that uses the Alien language against us. Hawley establishes an efficient and economical simulacrum of Alien that builds on the pilot and undermines what typically happens in one of these movies. The result is less of a retread and more of a trial run, as if Maginot‘s failures informed Yutani's plans for the Nostromo. 

Before jumping into the new episode, it's worth revisiting the show's prologue. Amid Schmuel's (Michael Smiley) civics lesson are crucial details and characterizations that help viewers make sense of the latest episode. We see Petrovitch's hints at sabotage (eating before cryo because he won't be sleeping long and corrupted security footage that he'll “investigate”) as Morrow glimpses Zaverni's (Richa Moorjani) and Bronski's (Max Rinehart) flirtations, which the cyborg will use as leverage over his superior to take control of the ship. What I once saw as shorthand for “an Alien movie” is the first chapter in a whodunit playing out in Morrow's head. However, Morrow makes a poor Philip Marlowe in “In Space,” because the saboteur is almost less of a problem than the crew's own stupidity and cynicism. 

The episode starts about three-and-a-half months after the prologue. A man named Clem (Tom Moya) wakes Morrow from cryosleep to rattle off a litany of problems facing the ship. A fire burned up its fuel and destroyed its navigational system. Two Face Huggers escaped; the captain died in surgery; and another crew member, Bronski, is mid-Face Hug. Curiously, Clem's interests lie in Zaverni and Bronski's sex life. It's the first hint at what Hawley has in store for the episode: a crew of immature, distracted, and tired people more worried that Morrow is in his underwear than the fate of their captain. The Maginot takes its name from the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications France built along its border with Germany in the years leading up to World War II. It failed. Germany invaded and conquered France, and the Line has since come to represent a costly false sense of security. That can explain some of the actions of the Maginot‘s crew because all the preventative measures designed to keep safe are only as effective as the people using them. Morrow muses that the ship's recent troubles must be the result of sabotage or incompetence. It's both. 

Coming off several episodes of hybrid-heavy philosophizing, “In Space” gives the show a jolt of energy as we watch this crew of numbskulls get torn apart by their own foolishness. “Another victory for the enemy of reason,” Rahim says while watching over Bronski's body. “This space bug is proof of how stupid smart people can be—smart enough to build ships capable of space travel, of splitting the atom, and decoding the genome, but too stupid to realize, you don't bring parasites home with you.” Rahim sums it up nicely: Maignot‘s crew are d-u-m-b. The ship's engineer's apprentice, Malachite (Jamie Bisping), might be the dumbest character ever to grace an Alien movie, and that is really saying something. However, while his stupidity can be irritating, it's Chibuzo's (Karen Aldridge) carelessness that really does them in. How can she forget to screw the top on her bug jar or properly secure The Eye? It's hard to imagine. But Chizubo, like Malachite, is more interested in eating than following protocol, and it leads to both of their deaths. That's not sabotage; that's incompetence. 

One could apply the false sense of security to the audience. Hawley knows we know what an Alien movie is and wants to use that against us. I appreciate the swerves. Characters that appear to be synthetics of the Ash mold, like Mr. Teng (Andy Yu), who are prime saboteur suspects, turn out to be nothing more than creepy assholes. Set pieces, like a dinner table chestburster scene, don't go as planned. In fact, the bursting happens offscreen, with the Xenomorph hiding for much of the episode. Instead, the tension surrounds Malachite sipping Chibuzo's drink and infecting himself with the ticks. When Malachite's time comes, it's through another visual callback, this time to Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) spotlit death in the 1979 original. But the episode isn't merely in service of subversion. Hawley deepens Morrow's character, and Babou Ceesay is more than up to the challenge, finding pockets of sadness, obsession, and frustration in his performance. We get to see what the worst parts of a man actually are: grief. Morrow left his daughter so that he could leave in the service of his surrogate mother, Yutani, the elder. As he goes through his daughter's letters to him, we see the letter from the company informing him that, eight years into his mission, she died in a house fire. Her effects will be there waiting for him when he returns in 53 years. That is some bleak shit.

But Morrow has something the others don't: purpose. There's a strain of nihilism circulating in the crew that manifests in Petrovitch. Throughout the episode, the crew is reminded that they are expendable—it's not kept a secret, unlike in Alien. Morrow reminds them. MU/TH/UR forces Zaverni to acknowledge it. It's enough to make one of them vindictive. As Morrow learns, while looking through the ship's communications, Petrovitch is working for Kavalier. In exchange for a hybrid body, Petrovitch will crash the ship in Prodigy City. “You can't stop it,” Petrovitch says. “They want their monsters. Here they come.” He doesn't care about humanity and seems almost happy to give them what they deserve. His goals aren't so different from Morrow's. Morrow just prefers a different corporate overlord. The episode ends with Morrow reaffirming his mission to the younger Yutani. He stares off from her balcony as Smashing Pumpkins' “Cherub Rock” kicks in. “Freak out and give in. Doesn't matter what you believe in,” Billy Corgan sings. “Stay cool. And be somebody's fool this year.”

What's scarier than aliens or doppelgängers? Perhaps the waiting game for a highly anticipated film from an acclaimed director with a constantly shifting release date? If that's high on your list of phobias, Jordan Peele and Universal have a scare in store for you. The Get Out director's next film—his first since 2022's Nope—has been quietly removed from the studio's 2026 calendar, Variety reports. 

As is typical of Peele's work, there are no known details about the film's plot or cast. We do know that it was originally supposed to premiere around Christmas 2024, but it was rescheduled due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes. It was then pushed to October 2026 for a (perhaps thematically appropriate) Halloween release, but it has since vanished from the calendar entirely. A source close to the project did tell Variety that Peele was at work on the film, so it seems like it's still happening—just a little later than originally planned. Cameras reportedly haven't rolled yet, so it could be a while until we hear anything definitive.

Like Peele's prior films, this one is being described as a “horror thriller.” The director also spoke about it—albeit vaguely—on the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast in 2024. “I do feel like my next project is clear to me, and I'm psyched that I have another film that, you know, could be my favorite movie if I make it right,” he said. 

Peele has been keeping busy as a producer in the meantime. Last year, he helped rescue Dev Patel's Monkey Man from Netflix obscurity. Later this month, Universal will also release Justin Tipping's Him, a film he produced starring Tyriq Withers and Marlon Wayans. Him follows a rookie football player's journey to the top, with what seems like an appropriately Peele-esque supernatural twist somewhere along the way. That film kicks off September 19 in theaters.

The Onion had the chance to do the funniest thing, and the satirical newspaper (and birthplace of the very website) didn't miss its opportunity. It bought Infowars last November, only to have it snatched away shortly after. Thankfully, in a new interview with Wired, Onion CEO Ben Collins confirmed that its publisher, Global Tetrahedron, is still “absolutely trying” to regain control of Infowars and its testosterone-boosting supplements. It even has a plan for the website should the sale ever go through. “If we end up with the supplements,” Collins said, “I still don't know what to do with them, but we are absolutely trying. We have a whole plan for what to do with Infowars if and when we get it.”

InfoWars founder Alex Jones was sued for a billion dollars by the families of Sandy Hook victims and found guilty of defaming murdered children and their families. As a result, Jones' assets and website, Infowars, were sold at auction. The Onion‘s publisher, Global Tetrahedron, put in a bid and won. However, after The Onion announced its new supplement arm, Jones' lawyers contested that the sale had been conducted improperly, and a judge blocked the sale. Collins clarified what happened with the sale and why a judge “wiped away about like 18 months of court decisions.” Throughout the interview, Collins discusses the media's “overt capitulation” to the Trump administration. That applies to judges, too. “The judge took it away from us because he was also scared of what was going on,” he said. “He basically wiped away about like 18 months of court decisions. I mean, I would be spooked too.”

Collins points out that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is run by Infowars regulars Dan Bongino, currently the deputy FBI director, and Kash Patel, the FBI director. “[Infowars] was a feeder system to the administration,” Collins said. “So to be afraid of that is natural. But it also shows that putting your foot in the ground as a business and as a human being is important right now.”

Painting an attractively-composed picture of Italian theater legend Eleanora Duse (1858-1924), festival favorite Pietro Marcello has for his latest feature swapped an underdog striving to achieve — as seen in 2019's “Martin Eden” — for an achiever striving to maintain. In a post-war landscape where everything is uncertain, the decades-strong and since-retired actress Eleanora Duse (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) announces her return to the stage, signaling the start of a singular rise and a simultaneous fall; an ever-tightening grip on her passions whilst her relationships with those she loves and is loved by disintegrate around her.

 








Related Stories We Want Filmmaker Chandler Levack to Be Our New Best Friend — Her ‘Mile End Kicks' Shows Why Hollywood Welcomes Back the Fresh Prince: Will Smith Has a New First-Look Deal with Paramount 

It should be noted that Eleanora Duse is a historical figure of whom there is very little documentation. Hardly anything was recorded of her acting or voice, which is why Marcello — who has equally worked in documentary forms over the years — has opted for a fictitious exploration of her life. It is a shame then that the figure that he conjures is so one-dimensional. Bruni Tedeschi, who has a striking resemblance to historian Mary Beard in this role, plays Duse with a perpetually raised voice and wild-eyed fervor for theater that is, at first, uncomfortably parodic.

 










Her commanding presence is undeniably powerful, but we're granted little in which to root her intensity. Marcello himself admits in the film's press notes that filming the theater scares him, and unfortunately it shows. “Duse” suffers for the scarcity of the pursuit that it and its inhabitants purportedly care so passionately about. When the stage is finally set for a rehearsal, doubts about Marcello's approach escalate. “I did not learn how to shout without losing my voice just to be told to lower it” yells Gabriele D'Annunzio (Fausto Russo Alesi), creative and romantic partner of Eleanora Duse, as he intimidates and educates a new member of the company. For the first act of Marcello's film, you would believe the director had imbibed this idea as a mantra for himself. It is hard to understand someone or grow sympathy for them when they won't stop yelling at you, and when all the world's a maximalist stage for the ensemble of “Duse,” an emotional response is hard to elicit.

Stepping into this equation like a salve is Noémie Merlant, the film's standout performance and true emotional core, playing Eleanora's soft-spoken daughter, Enrichetta. Frequently pictured getting in and out of boats, the clear blue sea lapping behind her, she never stays long. She is cast away by her mother, who wishes nothing to interfere with her theater. In an almost-stirring early scene, she is denied entry to Duse's new play, forced to walk away tearfully with her kids in tow. It's a shame that the film's screenplay, penned by Marcello and co-writers Letizia Russo and Guido Silei, sidelines her just as Eleonora does.

 










There's a real sense that “Duse” has been structured the wrong way around. We are introduced to the supposedly legendary figure of Elenora Duse and her desire to return to the stage before we've seen even a glimpse of her performing on one. The rise of fascism encroaches on her like a disease, culminating in a personal invitation from Mussolini himself, but we're dealt countless scenes of Eleonora's psychosis before we're granted a contextual explanation of what feeds it. The gradual cementing of this satisfying micro-macro parallel does little to counter the one-note nature of the central performance that must be endured for the hour that precedes it, even if “Duse” may play more immediately and understandably to a domestic audience. Archival footage appears to be spliced between scenes in place of exterior establishing shots, but, if anything, these glimpses are frustratingly intriguing, allowing us to wonder what a deeper delve into the world surrounding Eleonora might have elucidated about her life and the theater she strives to perform.

All this is presented in a continuous stream, where characters will note the passed time to each other, their conversations stretching across years in a matter of minutes to a disorienting effect which becomes poignant in the film's final act. Eleanora's psychosis takes on richer meaning as the acting slows and characters are forced to confront one another — and themselves. Bruni Tedeschi is in a one-woman play for too long, and the film finally has a chance to sing as Merlant re-enters the picture.

 










A cursory post-screening internet search of Eleonora Duse reveals that she dabbled in film acting, and almost worked with D.W. Griffith. In her later life, she was the partner of Lina Poletti, one of the first out lesbian women in Italy. But neither of these absent episodes fit the overly-neat, tried-and-tested narrative arc found in Marcello's film. There's an intriguing thread to pull on in the mother-daughter relationship, which could have been expanded on earlier — ultimately it is too little too late.

“Duse” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Tame Impala came back in July with “End of the Summer,” and Kevin Parker has now shared another new song. “Loser” comes with a music video directed by Sam Kristofski and starring Joe Keery, the Stranger Things and Pavements actor who records his own music as Djo. Watch the video below.

In the clip, a woman storms off from Keery and peels away in a car as he tries, and fails, to convince her to stay. The dejected actor stumbles over to a marketplace to buy a drink, shoplift a lighter, and strike out with a lottery ticket. After sitting on the stoop for hours, he locks eyes with a different woman in the passenger seat of a sedan and picks up her discarded cigarette butt. In the song's final moments, Keery is momentarily replaced by Kevin Parker—who, in the same haircut and outfit, sighs and mutters a hopeless “fuck”—before it flashes back to the actor.

Here's one strategy I forgot in my “finding weird shit” column: Listen to what your younger relatives recommend. fakemink came as a tip from my very tapped-in cousin. I used to play Mario Kart DS with him at family functions and now he's making beats for yuke and Ja66 and keeping me apprised of what's happening in the German SoundCloud scene. He sent me some fakemink links in the middle of last year. The Londoner's voice, pitched up so it's somewhere between sped-up Lucki and a Galaxy Gas freestyle, sounded slick over every weird ass beat. It could be melted funk on “White Ash” or lattices of glitches like “Thank God”—the regal dryness of fakemink's bright and crispy voice lent everything a poignant, bittersweet feeling.

A few months later, I edited his first written interview. After flaking on the writer several times, he finally hopped on a call and rambled about sharing a life philosophy with Alexander McQueen and how his jerky snare patterns come not from SoundCloud wizards but Drake's “Headlines.” When we titled it “fakemink wants to save London rap,” it felt like wishful thinking. How is this random kid with 10,000 monthly listeners supposed to take over?

Now it feels like a prophecy. In July, Drake brought out the 20-year-old during one of his headlining sets at Wireless Festival. fakemink stormed across the mainstage, performing a few of his biggest hits while the crowd of OVO glazers and hungry Brits embraced him like the messiah. fakemink has since racked up an improbable flurry of cosigns. Over the last few days alone, Clairo followed him, Timothée Chalamet posted up at his show at a boxing ring, and Frank Ocean shared photos of him on his Instagram story.

The hype is in overdrive, so much so that people are declaring he's lost his soul and calling him an industry plant. He's at the forefront of the British scene—alongside upstarts like Fimiguerrero, Jim Legxacy, YT, and Len—but also quickly surpassing it, primed for global crossover. How did we get here, and is this 20-year-old Drake and Dean Blunt diehard worth the fanfare?

In the early days, before he was fakemink, he was 9090gate. He smoked weed and recorded music from a bedroom crammed with knickknacks and guarded by blackout curtains. He filmed Instagram Lives, including one where he got hit by a car. Over the last couple of years, he has slowly developed a style he calls “dirty luxury”: think food stains on a $10,000 t-shirt. It's not a super original concept—opulent grime has been the ethos of countless MCs from Rocky to Lone. He wants to give it a fresh spin with his own production and beats from some of the most exciting oddballs in the underground, like deer park, cranes, Yurkiez, mag, and reklus1ve. “Bambi,” produced by prblm, conjures up a drunken walk home at 3 a.m. with rain drizzling lightly over your head. Others like “Bite My Lip” and “Crush” have a deliciously decayed shimmer that makes them feel like 2000s prom hits from an alternate dimension. fakemink's one of a few in this corner of the underground who writes out lyrics ahead of time instead of punching in fragmented bursts. As a result, his vocals have a kind of stately yet starry-eyed quality, giving structure to these deformed, cosmic beats from the internet abyss. It reminds me of the way Takeoff's unvarnished tone anchored his Migos partners' Auto-Tuned warbles.

The delightful curl of his voice makes simple hooks tickle the ear, as on “Kacey Lola,” which sounds like an ode to an it girl but is actually a tribute to the benzo medication Ksalol. But his best moments ditch the ennui and open up. “I'm sorry to all the bitches that I know I'm leadin' on/If you need a shoulder to cry on, I'll give you one,” he confesses on “Baklava” over a beat that samples Camera Can't Lie's “Losing You” and feels like jacuzzi bubbles in the brain. “It's sad 'cause I know that we will never ever hug again/Never ever fuck again, no, we'll never kiss again.”

His best music has a tortured spiritual tension: “Addicted to this money like it's porn, man, I need it,” he cries on “Loser Monologue.” On maybe his most intoxicating song to date, “Music and Me,” fakemink wrestles between material decadence and an ascetic lifestyle, which fans interpreted as an internal struggle he's going through as a Muslim. “Would you ever trade your life for desire?” he raps breathlessly, seemingly unsure of the answer. He isn't a philosopher, but his jaded yet joyous internal monologues hit for a generation of kids who, as fakemink groans on the shivery “Zealousy,” feel “always so fried” and “never know why.”

His rise has really accelerated in the last few months, trampolined by hits like “LV Sandals” with EsDeeKid and Rico Ace, the frayed bloghouse bounce of his and Suzy Sheer's “Easter Pink,” and “MAKKA,” a collab with Ecco2k and Mechatok that's like a Skins theme for the 2020s. There has been no full-length project since his 2023 mixtape London's Saviour, just a relentless streak of loosies.

His shtick isn't too radical when you zoom out. Part of the appeal certainly comes from the popular notion that there's been a void of new rap megastars in the younger generation, and the disdain some people have for “empty” SoundCloud rap pyrotechnics. fakemink satisfies both the oldheads and the new-gens, the moshpit NPCs and the technical obsessives. In Drake's case, he's clearly latching onto whatever he thinks is cool as an attempt to stay relevant. Like his idol Dean Blunt, it can at times feel like fakemink's coasting off enigmatic rawness; hooks like ""Terrified, feel it under your skin/How much of yourself are you gonna lose 'til you win?"" gesture at depth without going much further than vague aphorisms. People perceive him as thinking hard about every decision he makes, but he recycles a lot of the same lyrical tropes—about striving, winning, being existentially confused. Maybe his self-professed homebody nature means he doesn't have many stories to tell, just the flexes and aspirations swirling in his brain. It remains to be seen whether this is his ceiling or if he's able to shape a full vision out of the two sides of his sound—the introspective depth of earlier music like London's Saviour with the glinting adrenaline of his latest single “Braces.”

On X, he regularly writes “Today Is My Favourite Day,” along with encouraging exhortations to appreciate every little moment. He seems like the kind of guy to unironically post “Live Laugh Love,” someone almost excruciatingly aware of the passage of time, keen to squeeze every second for all its worth. “For 8 years I performed to an audience of none, My biggest fan was my laptop screen. Believe in yourself for 10 years n see where it takes you,” he wrote the other week. Disney-style optimism is an attractive trait for someone in a generation wracked by doom and anxiety. I hope the industry doesn't suck the passion out of him.

Donald Trump's least convincing impersonator, Ron DeSantis, is bringing the president's attacks on science and the health and safety of children to the Sunshine State. 


	DeSantis' handpicked state surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced Wednesday the state will move to eliminate all vaccine requirements for children to attend public schools. That means Florida children will no longer need to get vaccinated against measles, polio, mumps, or chickenpox. It would be the first state to eliminate such requirements.


	Speaking about vaccine mandates on Wednesday, Ladapo said: “Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” adding: “Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and God.” Ladapo is best-known for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines, including the claim that mRNA-based vaccines may threaten “the integrity of the human genome.” 


	DeSantis additionally announced the launch of a state MAHA Commission, named after the “Make America Healthy Again” slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary and one-time brain-worm haver Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 

	











	DeSantis said the state's commission will work toward “improving transparency and accountability in health care” and “restoring trust in the medical profession and in public health.”


	The governor's pledge to end all childhood vaccine mandates in Florida comes as the Trump administration, led by Kennedy, conducts a sweeping assault on science and the ability of Americans to vaccinate themselves and their children. It comes as measles, a highly contagious disease that was once eradicated in the United States, is spreading throughout the country once again.

	











	Kennedy has long promoted the baseless theory that some childhood vaccines cause autism, and once claimed “there's no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” 


	Under RFK Jr.'s leadership at the Health and Human Services Department (HHS), the Trump administration has restricted eligibility for Covid vaccines and booster shots, and there's concern the administration will attempt to remove them from the shelves altogether. Last week, the White House attempted to oust the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), creating chaos throughout the agency.

	In June, Kennedy fired members of the panel that advises the CDC on vaccine safety, so he could attempt to replace them with non-experts who share his views. 


	DeSantis is now making Florida healthy again the same way Trump and Kennedy are doing so at a national level: by putting everyone at risk of getting diseases that vaccines have protected us from.

	It was part party palace, part personal sanctuary, and all spectacle. Now, Jackie Gleason's legendary estate in New York‘s picturesque Hudson Valley—better known as the Mothership—has reemerged for sale at $5.5 million with Corcoran's Heidi Henshaw.

	











	Commissioned by the late comedian and musician as a retreat from filming the groundbreaking 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners, the spaceship-like residence in Cortlandt Manor is one of the most unusual homes ever built for a Hollywood icon. Gleason, famously fascinated with UFOs and metaphysical theory, dreamed up the circular home that embodied futuristic ambition while showcasing old-fashioned craftsmanship.

	To execute his otherworldly vision, Gleason tapped architect Robert Cika, a protégé of Frank Lloyd Wright, who enlisted a Scandinavian shipbuilder to help realize the extraordinary design. At least some of the prefabrication work took place inside an airplane hangar before the copper-roofed house was assembled on-site. It took five years and a reported $650,000, partly underwritten by Gleason's bosses at CBS, before the Mothership was completed in 1959.


	The mid-century masterpiece is defined by its curving, organic architecture: there are no right angles anywhere in the 3,950-square-foot main residence. Banks of floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interiors with light, while the vaulted wooden ceiling evokes the hull of a ship and metal vents mimic stylized fish. Gleason even purchased an entire marble quarry in Italy to ensure the finest stone for the home's flooring and massive fireplaces—some slabs so large they had to be delivered to the site by helicopter.


	The circular plan includes three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, one half bathroom, a curved stainless-steel kitchen, a dining room, a spacious living area, and a circular library and office. Many original details, including built-in cabinetry, closets, and bespoke furnishings, remain intact.

	The home was conceived as much for entertainment as for solitude. Gleason's late-night soirées reportedly drew the likes of Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and even President Richard Nixon. Three dramatic swooping bars, a marble dance floor, and a game room with a shuffleboard table speak to its party-ready pedigree. Yet the Mothership also offers serenity, seclusion, and an intimate connection to the natural world, with panoramic views of its wooded 8.6-acre setting just an hour north of Manhattan.

	The estate includes two additional dwellings: a smaller, secondary “spaceship,” long used as a bunkhouse and glamping spot, and the Barracks, a charming (and far more conventional) 1930s stone Colonial Revival home that functions as a guesthouse. A cultivated vegetable and herb garden, plus a gardening shed, round out the retreat.


	The estate last traded hands in 1976 for just $150,000, when CBS sold the property following Gleason's move to Florida. It briefly surfaced for sale back in 2018 for $12 million but never sold.

I'm always fascinated by descriptions of circular houses as having “no right angles anywhere.”. Where the floors meet the walls is all right angles. The window frames in this house are all rectangles, with four right angles in each one.

In any event, it's an interesting house and I do love the living room fireplace.

September 3, 2025



House lawmakers are reviewing new legislation that would codify distinct protections for whistleblowers who disclose information about any use of U.S. government funding to study “unidentified anomalous phenomenon material” — or matter associated with objects observed in air, space, or sea domains that cannot be immediately explained.

From UFOs to modern and transmedium UAP, the government has a complicated history in terms of its handling of reports about craft that appear to transcend the capabilities of existing technology, and records documenting related incidents. 

But efforts to compel more transparency and oversight have continued to emerge in recent years, largely due to mounting public pressure and mandates from Congress.

The UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, introduced last week by Reps. Tim Burchett (R-TN) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), marks the latest move by lawmakers to help shield people who want to share information with Congress but fear retaliation — and motivate more of them to come forward.

A member of Burchett's team told DefenseScoop in an email that the bill is identical to legislation put forward in November during Congress' last session. If passed, they said it would ultimately add “provisions for individuals to report on the use of taxpayer funds to evaluate or research [UAP] to existing whistleblower protection statutes.”

This version of the bill was referred to the House committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Armed Services, and Intelligence for consideration.

Burchett and Luna are among a small cadre of policymakers who have been steadily prioritizing whistleblower hearings, public engagement sessions and other legislative efforts to promote more accountability and disclosure from the intelligence community, Department of Defense and other agencies regarding UAP.

On Wednesday, Luna announced a hearing on “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” that's officially set for Sept. 9.

The Committee on Oversight and Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which she chairs, will host the event next week. Recurring transparency concerns and the effectiveness of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) are among several topics that will be up for discussion.

The panel of four witnesses testifying will include two Air Force veterans — Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland.

“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety,” Luna said in a statement. “Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution.”","{'href': 'https://defensescoop.com', 'title': 'DefenseScoop'}","other"

We have received text from H.R. 5060: UAP Whistleblower Protection Act. This bill was received on 2025-08-29, and currently has 1 cosponsor.

Here is a short summary of the bill:


 This bill, known as the UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, aims to enhance protections for federal employees, including military personnel and contractors, who disclose the use of federal taxpayer funds for evaluating or researching unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) material. The key points of the bill include the following:



 The bill modifies existing laws to ensure that federal civilian employees, members of the military, contractors, and members of the intelligence community are protected when they disclose specific information about the allocation of taxpayer funds for UAP-related activities. This includes:



 The bill explicitly applies to:



 The main objective of this legislation is to encourage transparency by ensuring that individuals who report potential misuse of taxpayer money related to UAP research can do so without fear of repercussions. By reinforcing protections for whistleblowers, the bill aims to foster an environment where federal employees feel safe to speak out about wasteful or questionable government spending, particularly in connection with UAP-related projects.



 The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and has been referred to several committees, including:



 These committees are expected to evaluate the provisions of the bill according to their areas of jurisdiction.



 If passed, this bill could result in increased reporting of UAP-related activities by federal employees due to improved protections against retaliation. The exact implementation details and how these changes will be enforced are to be determined following the bill's advancement through the legislative process.

The franchise exits stage right with this final go around, in which our middle-aged exorcists take their time getting to the jump-cuts

The first Conjuring, released in 2013, was a profitable hangover from the previous decade's Omen, Amityville and Exorcist retreads, goosing 21st-century audiences with things-going-bump-in-the-night tricks copped from comparable 1970s theatrical and TV movies. Yet despite sequels that went big (2016's The Conjuring 2, converting the Enfield poltergeist saga into a 4DX-ready theme-park ride) and then sideways (2021's true crime-adjacent The Devil Made Me Do It), the series' underlying mechanics have proved stubbornly resistant to change. The current multifaceted horror renaissance makes this an apt moment for the franchise to exit stage right; facing these upstart punks, the generally sluggish Last Rites presents as something akin to dad-rock horror, doing with jump-scares what Status Quo used to do with power chords.

One selling point – that these films are character- rather than carnage-driven – now seems to be a liability. After a nicely cast prologue describing their days as young parents, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are reintroduced in 1986, when the film positions these middle-aged squares as yesterday's exorcists, heckled by students who would rather talk Ghostbusters, in the way today's cinemagoers will emerge discussing Weapons or Sinners. They head for a Pennsylvanian household whose antique mirror doubles as a portal to hell, but ithere are 75 minutes of beigey soap before the usual satanic hokey-cokey kicks off, forcing us to consider the threat Armageddon poses to the forthcoming nuptials of the Warrens' daughter Judy (Mia Tomlinson).

The squareness may be the point: the Warrens have become reassuring touchstones for folks who don't want their horror too messed-up. Within its own narrow parameters as a delivery system for bland guignol, Last Rites may meet that core audience's specifications. Wilson and Farmiga remain solidity incarnate, capable of enlivening even speculative spiritual dialogue. The film-making pulls no surprises out of the hat, though, and gives no indication that it would if it could. There's another creepy doll, demonic makeup from the Linda Blair Fall '73 range, and an ascent of a darkened staircase – but the floorboards have never seemed creakier. Last Rites has Howard Jones on the soundtrack and still feels obdurately Victorian.

Rubio vows more strikes on cartels smuggling arms and drugs from South America.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday defended President Donald Trump's strike on a drug cartel-operated vessel off of Venezuela and vowed the U.S. will no longer ""sit back"" when it comes to ""nacro-terrorism.""

In response to questions about the Marine strike Tuesday that hit a vessel in the southern Caribbean Sea while allegedly carrying members of Tren de Aragua smuggling narcotics headed for the U.S., Rubio said, ""We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise.""

The strike apparently killed 11 members of the group, which was designated a terrorist organization in February, and marked a significant shift from the U.S.'s previous seize-and-apprehend policy when countering international gang networks.

MADURO CLAIMS US SEEKS 'REGIME CHANGE THROUGH MILITARY THREAT' AMID CARIBBEAN BUILDUP

""The president of the United States has determined that narco-terrorist organizations pose a threat to the national security of the United States. I don't need to explain to you why,"" Rubio said, noting that the group is known to traffic not only drugs, but arms and people. 

""These are not stockbrokers. These are not real estate agents who, on the side, deal a few drugs. These are organized, corporate, structured organizations who specialize in the trafficking of deadly drugs into the United States of America,"" Rubio said. ""They pose an immediate threat to the United States. Period.""

In speaking to reporters from Mexico, where he was also hashing out counter arms and narcotics agreements, Rubio argued the previous policy of seize and apprehend was ineffective.

""Because these drug cartels, what they do is they know they're going to lose 2% of their cargo — they bake it into their economics,"" he said. ""What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them.""

The secretary further pointed out that the arms groups like Tren de Aragua are apparently getting a hold of unconventional weaponry, including drones, and continue to pose an increasingly serious threat to international security. 

""We are increasingly concerned that these cartels are now in possession, not just of landmines and grenades. We're now seeing the deployment of drone technology by narco-terrorist groups operating out of Venezuelan territory,"" he added, noting that they are being used to threaten security forces in neighboring states like Columbia.

Rubio confirmed the strategy employed on Tuesday is how the U.S. will continue to counter international narcotics and arms smuggling. 

""It'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know. But the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations,"" Rubio said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department arrested an Alabama man who deputies said showed up armed with brass knuckles, knives, high-capacity magazines and body armor after allegedly making threats against a Catholic monastery in California.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department said deputies detained Joshua Michael Richardson late last month following reports of threatening emails he sent to St. Michael's Abbey. Investigators said the emails, reported on August 28, contained language interpreted as threatening. 

The situation escalated when investigators said Richardson drove from Alabama to Southern California and showed up in person at the abbey, where deputies said he made additional threats. A priest who encountered Richardson notified the sheriff's department two days later, triggering a swift investigation.

Sergeant Gerard McCann told the Orange County Register that it is believed Richardson made the drive from Alabama and arrived in California on the same day he went to the abbey.

Deputies said they quickly located and detained Richardson. A search of his vehicle uncovered weapons and tactical gear, including large-capacity magazines, body armor, knives, and brass knuckles. He was taken into custody without incident and booked into the Orange County Jail.

On September 1, the Orange County District Attorney's Office formally charged Richardson with several offenses, including possession of brass knuckles, carrying a concealed dagger, possession of a large-capacity magazine and making criminal threats, according to KTLA.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Jarryd Gonzales, spokesperson for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, confirmed the incident and thanked local law enforcement for their prompt action.

""The Diocese of Orange has been made aware of a threat directed toward St. Michael's Abbey. Local law enforcement responded swiftly, and a suspect has been apprehended,"" Gonzales said. ""We are grateful to the authorities for their quick action in ensuring the safety of our parish community.""

Gonzales noted that the diocese is taking the incident seriously in light of rising threats against churches nationwide, pointing to the recent shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, where a gunman opened fire during Mass.

""In today's environment of increased threats against churches, and particularly mindful of recent events in Minnesota, our parishes and schools continue to strengthen security efforts and remain vigilant to help protect our parishioners, students and staff,"" 

The sheriff's department has increased patrols near the monastery, which sits on a 320-acre former ranch, while the abbey itself has enhanced its private security.

Sheriff's officials stressed the importance of community vigilance.

""While incidents like this can feel unsettling, they also highlight the power of community,"" officials said. ""If something seems off, say something. Trust your instincts and report suspicious activity, whether it is a strange message, unusual behavior, or something that does not sit right. Your call could stop a crime before it happens.""

A federal judge just ruled that Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser, and Googlers seem pretty happy about it.

On Tuesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down penalties to Google after ruling its search business a monopoly. The US Justice Department, which filed the suit against Google in 2020, had proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. The judge ruled against this—one of several decisions made in the landmark antitrust case.

Google employees have been lighting up the company's central internal message board, filling it with jokes about the soaring stock and how Google no longer has to part with its beloved browser, per messages and memes reviewed by Business Insider.

One employee edited a caption of a scene from ""The Lord of the Rings"" to read ""Looks like Chrome is back on the menu, boys!"" Another played on an iconic scene from the movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" with Chrome — rather than Leonardo DiCaprio — announcing, ""I'm not ******* leaving.""

Several other posts celebrated Chrome's remaining part of Google. One employee took a photo of a sign from one of the offices that read, ""You belong here,"" adding the word ""Chrome.""

A Chrome sell-off could have been very painful for Google. The browser has become a huge distribution channel for the company's search advertising business, sucking up vast amounts of useful data.

Google's stock popped more than 6% in after-hours trading — something that Googlers also joked about inside the company.

""Sending support to Googlers who sold $GOOG recently,"" read one caption on a picture of a candle.

Several employees who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said they didn't think the outcome would affect them much and that it would be business as usual for most Googlers.

""I think people are mostly happy about the stock,"" said one of them.

The list of remedies handed down to Google on Tuesday included a ban on any exclusive deals to make its search engine the default, though it stopped short of banning payments to partners completely. Google was also ordered to share some of its search data with rivals.

A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

In this article

American Eagle said Wednesday its partnership with Sydney Sweeney has been its ""best"" advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. 

The company's splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the ""Euphoria"" star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift's new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

""The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,"" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. ""We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value."" 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here's how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It's expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter. 

So far this year, American Eagle's performance has been marred by merchandising missteps, tariffs and an uncertain consumer that's being more selective when spending money on products like clothes and shoes. 

To turn things around, American Eagle launched its campaign with Sweeney ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season, but in some ways, that also backfired when it incited outrage from some customers. 

The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans"" — led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre and a nod to eugenics. Meanwhile, those on the right celebrated the campaign, leading President Donald Trump to weigh in and call it the ""hottest"" ad around.

More widely, the campaign also faced pushback from some who said the ads were overly sexualized and out of touch, leading them to wonder what type of consumer the company was targeting. 

The campaign launched on July 23 at the tail end of American Eagle's fiscal second quarter, but the company said it's so far been a success, despite the pushback it received. The Sweeney campaign, along with the partnership it launched with Kelce, has led to ""meaningful improvement in the business"" with comps so far this quarter up in the mid-single digits. American Eagle said it's gained 700,000 new customers and that traffic across channels has been ""consistently positive"" throughout August, despite some news reports indicating the contrary. 

The Sweeney campaign has led to denim sellouts, double-digit traffic growth and increased awareness and engagement, the company said. The Sydney Jacket sold out in one day and The Sydney Jean, a custom style that donated 100% of proceeds to the Crisis Text Line, which provides mental health support, sold out in one day. 

Meanwhile, American Eagle's launch with Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, the day after he announced his engagement to the pop star, drove three times more sales in one day than past collaborations did in a week, the company said. Many of the items, specifically ones worn by Kelce and his fellow athletes, sold out.

American Eagle's partnerships with Sweeney and Kelce highlight the work the retailer is doing to stay relevant with consumers and cut through the noise as spending remains soft. 

It's also facing stiff competition from peers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap and Levi's. Recently, Gap launched its ""Better in Denim"" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit ""Milkshake."" Meanwhile, Levi's has had an ongoing campaign featuring Beyoncé while Abercrombie has taken a sports focus and partnered with the NFL. 

Compounding American Eagle's challenges is the uncertain tariff environment. American Eagle has been working to reduce its reliance on China to under 10% this year but it also has a heavy manufacturing presence in Vietnam and India, which have been the subject of reciprocal tariffs.

With bitcoin BTC$112,205.65 stuck just above $110,000 and ether (ETH) consolidating after hitting fresh records, Solana SOL$209.69 has emerged as a standout performer in the crypto market recently.

The token traded around $211 on Monday, up 33% from early August lows, making it one of the best performers in the CoinDesk 20 Index in the past month. Against bitcoin, SOL has gained 34% over the past month, and it has strengthened 14% versus ETH since mid-August.

The rally reflects a broader rotation into altcoins, analysts said.

""The season of profit redistribution among holders of cryptocurrencies continues,” Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, said in a market note shared with CoinDesk. He said liquidity has been moving out of BTC into second-tier tokens, with ""a noticeable increase in the positive dynamics in capital flows to SOL.""

Such flows could be long-term as corporate investors look for large, liquid projects to hold, Gorev added, naming SOL alongside with XRP XRP$2.8584 as the ""next interesting market ideas.""

Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, tipped SOL to replicate ether's turnaround earlier this year. He pointed to Ethereum's resurgence after stablecoin adoption, strong ETF inflows and the relentless bid from digital asset treasuries, or DATs, helped ETH rally nearly 200% since April.

 ""SOL appears poised to repeat the exact same playbook that ETH just executed in the coming months,"" Dorman wrote in a fresh report.

The first U.S.-listed Solana ETF launched in July, but it was futures-based. Several asset managers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have filed for spot products with decisions due later this year, Dorman said.

Meanwhile, at least three Solana-focused DATs are raising funds that could channel up to $2.65 billion into SOL over the next month, he added.

At only one-fifth of ETH's market capitalization, SOL's price could be even more reactive to the flows if they materialize.

""SOL might be the most obvious long right now,"" Dorman said. ""If the price of ETH rose almost 200% on roughly $20 billion of new demand, what do you think happens to SOL on $2.5 billion or more of new demand?""

Recent news could also add to the momentum. Nasdaq-listed digital asset conglomerate Galaxy Digital tokenized its shares on Solana, while the approval of the Alpenglow upgrade promises to improve transaction speed and finality.

There was a lot of hype ahead of Lady Gaga's appearance on Netflix's Wednesday, but now that all of season two has dropped, it's clear that her new song, “The Dead Dance,” has an equally important presence in the series. No spoilers if you haven't binged the new episodes yet, but you can also enjoy the song on its own thanks to the Tim Burton-directed music video.

Though Burton has a cinematic filmography stretching back 40 years—all the way to 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, his feature debut—Wednesday is his first major foray into TV, and his list of music video credits also isn't terribly long. However, even if “The Dead Dance” wasn't part of his Netflix show, it's a pretty ideal pairing of artistic mindsets here; the eerie black-and-white palette suddenly shifts into lurid color as Lady Gaga invites all her pals to the undead doll disco.

Speaking to Tudum earlier this year, Lady Gaga explained “the inspiration for ‘The Dead Dance' was a breakup, and it was all about the way that we sometimes feel when it's over; how a relationship ending can kill our ability to feel hopeful about love. It's got this really cool, funky beat underneath it. And that is when the song becomes not just about the relationship; it becomes about having fun with your friends when you've been through something tough and amazing. I can't wait for people to listen to it.”

Wednesday season two is now streaming on Netflix.

Breakthrough hollow-core design pulls ahead of glass after 40 years.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Microsoft-backed research team from Lumenisity (a spinout of the University of Southampton Optoelectronics Research Center) has built a hollow-core cable with what it claims is the lowest signal loss ever recorded in any optical fiber. Published in Nature Photonics on Sept. 1, the team claims to have achieved 0.091 dB/km at 1,550nm using a design known as double nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (DNANF). This figure undercuts the ~0.14 dB/km floor of today's best silica fibers — and that number hasn't meaningfully improved since the 1980s. According to the researcherrs, this is “one of the most noteworthy improvements in waveguide technology for the past 40 years.”

Conventional single-mode fiber guides light through glass, slowing signals to roughly 200 million meters per second, which is two-thirds of their potential vacuum speed. In contrast, hollow-core fibers route photons mostly through air — reducing latency by nearly half and minimizing nonlinear effects. This, however, comes with a steep penalty: hollow-core designs leak energy at rates exceeding 1 dB/km, effectively confining them to short, specialist links. The DNANF design solves this by using concentric glass tubes that are just microns thick. These act like tiny mirrors, bouncing the light back into the air core and suppressing higher-order modes. Testing this on 15km spools using multiple measurement methods, including optical time-domain reflectometry, confirmed attenuation under 0.1 dB/km. Equally important: loss remained below 0.2 dB/km across a 66THz spectral band. That's far broader than the narrow telecom windows where silica performs best. Also, chromatic dispersion — which is where different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds through a medium — is reported to be seven times lower than it is in legacy fiber, which could simplify transceiver design and reduce energy use in network gear. Microsoft's 2022 acquisition of Lumenisity was a clear sign that it intended to push hollow-core tech out of the lab and into production. At the time, the company's hollow-core fibers were achieving around 2.5 dB/km loss, which was still a far cry from the traditional ~0.14 dB/km floor of glass fiber.Following a pilot project conducted alongside the team's research, Microsoft told Network World that some 1,200 km of the new fiber is actively carrying live traffic. During 2024's Microsoft Ignite conference, CEO Satya Nadella announced that the company plans to deploy 15,000 km of fiber across the Azure network over the next two years to support AI connectivity. Francesco Poletti, who co-invented the design, said that the low levels of loss achieved could let operators “skip one in every two or three amplifier sites, resulting in significant reductions in both capital and operational expenditure.”Of course, there are still some challenges. Scaling production will require new tooling, and standards have yet to be written. But for the first time ever, a fiber that carries light through air is both faster and less lossy than the glass it's trying to replace.

Transdermal estradiol-2 (E2) hormone therapy was associated with significantly better episodic memory in postmenopausal women than no hormone therapy, while oral ET was associated with significantly better prospective memory performance, a new study suggested.

Neither delivery method of E2 — the most potent estrogen — was linked to differences in executive function performance.

Investigators also found that earlier age at menopause onset was linked to worse memory and executive function performance.

“This study highlights that the type of estradiol therapy used may influence cognitive performance differently across various types of memory. Understanding these links could help inform more tailored approaches to maintaining brain health after menopause,” study author Liisa A.M. Galea, PhD, of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said in a news release.

The study was published online on August 27 in Neurology.

Researchers analyzed data on 7251 cognitively healthy participants (mean age at baseline, 60.5 years) enrolled in the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging. The average age at menopause onset was 51 years. Overall, 4% used transdermal E2 therapy, 2% took the pill form, and the remaining 94% never took hormone therapy.

Women taking only E2 or E2 and progesterone/progestin were included in the E2 group. Transdermal delivery included gels and vaginal MHT. Investigators controlled for age, years of education, and vascular risk to account for significant differences among the groups.

Earlier onset of menopause was significantly associated with reduced episodic memory, reduced prospective memory, and reduced executive function (P < .001 for all). The association with reduced executive function was significantly stronger in carriers of the APOE e4 allele than in noncarriers (P = .011) and individuals with four or more children (P < .001).

Higher scores for episodic memory, such as recalling past events, were observed among women taking transdermal E2 than among those who never used MHT (P = .007).

The researchers speculated that this formulation, unlike oral E2, bypasses first-pass hepatic metabolism and leads to higher, more stable concentrations of E2.

Higher scores for prospective memory, such as remembering an appointment or to take a medication, were observed among women taking oral E2 than among those who never took MHT (P = .015). The authors hypothesized that a lower dose of E2 could be necessary to improve prospective memory.

“While we cannot say hormone therapy causes these effects, it adds to the conversation about how best to support brain health after menopause,” Galea said.

The cohort primarily had White individuals with higher incomes, and the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. In addition, the study data did not allow analysis of how hormone therapy dosage, duration, or timing might influence cognition.

The question about the potential cognitive benefit of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the subject of long-standing debate, Eva Hogervorst, PhD, professor of psychology, School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, England, noted in an accompanying editorial.

While the study's findings about the type of E2 administration are important, “The small numbers of MHT users should perhaps caution overinterpretation of these diﬀerential results,” Hogervorst wrote.

These findings stand in contrast to longer-term randomized controlled trials like the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study and the Early vs Late Intervention Trial, Hogervorst pointed out. In these trials, no significant effect of MHT on cognition was observed up to 4 or 5 years later.

In addition, the current study included only healthy women. How the therapy might influence cognition for women in poor health, women who underwent early or premature (surgical) menopause, or women of different ethnicities, remains unclear, Hogervorst wrote.

The study was independently supported. The authors of the study and the editorial reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Women's Soccer

The London City Lionesses and Togethxr, a media and commercial company co-founded by Alex Morgan, Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim, announced Wednesday that the newly promoted Women's Super League (WSL) side will wear ‘Everybody Watches Women's Sports' on the front of their kits this season in a new partnership.

London City will debut the shirts on Sept. 6 in their opening WSL match against Arsenal at the Emirates.

“We're joining forces to reaffirm that the future of women's sports is here,” Morgan said in a press release. “It's global, and it's inevitable. London City Lionesses were born to disrupt football, and Togethxr was born to disrupt sports media.”

Business owner Michele Kang purchased the London City Lionesses in December 2023, adding them to her portfolio alongside the Washington Spirit in the NWSL. Kang acquired Olympique Lyonnais in December 2024, rebranded the eight-time Champions League winners to OL Lyonnes in May this year, and was appointed president of the club the following month. All three teams are housed under Kang's multi-club ownership group Kynisca.

The Lionesses earned promotion to the WSL for the first time in May this year and is the only fully independent club in the league.

“London City Lionesses was founded to reimagine women's football – to be bold, independent, and drive women's football forward. Our partnership with TOGETHXR reflects that same goal and allows us to do it at pace,” said Kang in the release.

The assertion of society's interest in women's sports started out as something of a trend when Togethxr first released shirts in December 2023. Morgan and Bird regularly wore them to sporting events and shared them with fellow athletes and other celebrities, such as University of South Carolina women's basketball head coach Dawn Staley, Serena Williams, Shaquille O'Neal, and Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis.

Over time, Togethxr expanded its inventory with more ‘Everybody Watches Women's Sports' colorways and features catering to different sports, teams, and moments, including a version for the Olympics that translated the slogan into French and its own partnerships with other clothing brands to produce bespoke lines of the shirt and other merchandise. By 2024, the collection had generated $6 million in revenue for the company, according to Sportico.

The collaboration with London City is listed as a partnership, meaning Togethxr is not sponsoring the club, as is typically the case when a brand appears on the front of a team's kit. The move mirrors one Kang made shortly after becoming the controlling owner of the Washington Spirit in March 2022, when the D.C. club teamed up with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and honored the institution as its front-of-kit feature for that season.

Both the home and away Lionesses shirts are available for pre-order on the team's website.

Denis Bouanga's hat-trick made him the top scorer in African qualifying for the 2026 Fifa World Cup with eight goals overall

Gabon boosted their hopes of a first appearance at the Fifa World Cup by moving top of their qualifying group for the 2026 finals with a 4-0 away win over Seychelles.

Denis Bouanga scored a first-half hat-trick as the Panthers ran riot in neutral St Pierre, Mauritius.

The LA FC forward needed less than four minutes to open the scoring after being left unmarked seven yards out to convert Teddy Averlant's cross from the right.

The West Africans doubled their lead in the 34th minute when Bouanga swept home a cutback, and Bouanga completed his treble seven minutes before the break by firing in a volley from 10 yards out.

The tempo of the game dropped in the second half but Yannis M'Bemba got Gabon's fourth goal when his header squeezed over the line in the 89th minute.

Seychelles are the lowest-ranked African nation, at 203rd in the world, and have never won a World Cup qualifier.

Gabon are two points clear of Ivory Coast at the top of Group F, having played one game more than the reigning continental champions.

The Elephants will regain top spot if they beat Burundi at home on Friday (19:00 GMT).

Gabon will then host the Ivorians on Tuesday in a match that is likely to decide who wins the group and qualifies automatically for the 2026 finals.

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon reflect on the Dutch Grand Prix, where both drivers brought home points for Haas.

Ollie Bearman managed to recover from a pit lane start to finish an incredible sixth in the Dutch Grand Prix, giving Haas much to celebrate as they brought home a double-points finish, with Esteban Ocon crossing the line in 10th.

The result was extra impressive when considering their starting positions, but the drivers were keen to stress it was one born out of hard work, with excellent strategy calls contributing to their haul of points in Zandvoort.

Bearman's drive was arguably the more surprising, given the youngster opted for a pit lane start to change some power unit components after qualifying just 19th on Saturday. He started on the hard tyre and ran a very long first stint, Haas opting not to pit under the first Safety Car unlike the majority of the field.

The team needed another Safety Car to make their strategy work, and they got just that when Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli crashed, Bearman diving into the pits for his one and only stop. That left him solidly in the top 10, and not only did he hold station, but the rookie kept close enough to Antonelli to profit when the latter's time penalties were applied.

“We got lucky today for sure, but sometimes you need to be in the right place at the right time,” Bearman explained after the race.

“Good calls on strategy, the car was quick as well which always has to be the case as well. The guys did a good job, gave me a great car. We were a bit unlucky I would say after Qualifying, we had a few misfortunes which meant that we started from last, but to score points today is a very good feeling.”

Bearman had to work hard for his score, sticking close to his team mate in the first stint as both started to struggle on aging tyres, and then keeping some faster, fresher shod cars at bay. It was his first points score since Bahrain, and his best finish of the season so far.

""Nice to get back in the points. It has been a long time coming for sure, the team have been working incredibly hard, and I think we are getting there step by step.

""We've got some things to work on and also myself, I'm far from perfect, still making too many mistakes. But we are on the right path and I really have high hopes,” he concluded.

Team work was key in Zandvoort, with Ocon – who started 18th and was the first Haas driver to breach the top 10 – helping Bearman at points in the race. The Frenchman could have felt aggrieved that his team mate finished ahead, given Ocon was running in front for much of the race – but he stopped one lap earlier than Bearman, and that cost him a handful of places.

“It's very positive as a team to have a double-points finish for both of us,” Ocon said. “Got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car, I think I lost maybe three positions or four. But overall, very satisfied with that. Well done to Ollie, he has done a fantastic race also and that's big for us, it is a big result.

“We helped ourselves during the race. We were 10th and 11th during the time and Ollie dropped back from DRS and the team asked me to give him DRS [drag reduction system] and we just kept pushing forward, both of us together.

“And then I boxed and the Safety Car came at the wrong time so I fell backwards, but Ollie benefited from that. So as a team it was good, definitely strong points. I knew there was something we could play here, even starting from the back, it makes crazy races for sure. But happy with the outcome for the team and hopefully we can do more of that at the next one.”

Haas remain ninth in the Teams' Championship, but at least have kept in touch with Kick Sauber ahead, and only need another strong weekend to close the gap in what is increasingly turning into an incredibly tight midfield fight.

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

“Pressure is the best motivation for all of us,” Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur tells host Tom Clarkson on this week's episode of Beyond The Grid.

Fred Vasseur leads Formula 1's most storied team. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the Tifosi – Ferrari's passionate fans – want to see Charles Leclerc or Lewis Hamilton on the podium.

But what they, the rest of Italy and Ferrari fans all over the world really want Vasseur to deliver is the Formula 1 World Championship.

On this week's episode of F1's Beyond The Grid podcast, Vasseur tells host Tom Clarkson how Ferrari are building a team to fight for titles, and the high-priority objectives of his high-pressure job: getting the best out of Leclerc, and supporting Hamilton as he continues to adapt to Ferrari – the challenge of which Vasseur says may have been underestimated.

He talks about his 5am starts in search of success, and why returning Ferrari to the top of the sport will take time – even with two proven stars in the cars.

It's been three years since Will Smith, on the night he won his first Academy Award for his performance in “King Richard,” changed his career forever (and for the worse) by slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage. In the immediate aftermath, Smith was banned from the Oscars ceremony for 10 years, and he's spent years rehabilitating his public image, including most recently going back to his rap roots as The Fresh Prince.

Hollywood appears to have forgiven him. 

Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and their company Westbrook have now signed a first-look deal with Paramount that will see Smith starring in and producing multiple features, ones the studio is labeling “global, four-quadrant theatrical movies.” Under the pact, Paramount has already announced two projects that are meant to star Smith and that the studio also hopes could be the start of new franchises. Westbrook will also get some fancy office space on the Paramount lot.

First up for Smith is “Sugar Bandits,” which is based on the book “Devils in Exile” by author Chuck Hogan. The film was previously set up at Universal but Paramount has acquired all rights and have it in development, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire. Hogan is the author of “Prince of Thieves,” which later became Ben Affleck's “The Town,” and “Devils in Exile,” originally published in 2010, is the story of an Iraq War veteran who begins running jobs ripping off drug dealers in Boston. And the second project is “Rabbit Hole,” which is an original screenplay being written by “Dune” scribe Jon Spaihts, though no details on that one just yet.

 










It's a major opportunity and major shift in the industry perception of Smith, who did star in 2024's “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and has still proven to be a bankable star with that film (it made $404 million worldwide), but between a few films put into development with old collaborators like Michael Bay and some other notable projects set up at Westbrook, saying he's taken a step back is an understatement.

Paramount, which has flashy new owners in Skydance, has been aggressively making deals with big names to bolster its film roster, all par for the course for a new regime looking to make a name for themselves. It won a bid for a James Mangold project that would reunite him with Timothée Chalamet, it recently wrenched the Duffer Brothers away from Netflix to produce and direct films, series, and streaming properties, and it also this week inked a deal with video game developer Activision to bring the massive “Call of Duty” franchise to the screen.

Smith is just another feather in their cap and proof that David Ellison and company aren't going to be shy about taking a few big swings.
