                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced on Wednesday that it's bringing a slew of new features to the Android ecosystem and Pixel devices. Google says Material 3 Expressive will make your Pixel feel even more personal, as you can use Live effects to add animations to your lock screen's wallpaper and create customized calling cards for contacts. Additionally, Pixel Watch users can now start walking or biking navigation on their phone in Google Maps and then have it automatically displayed on their smartwatch. As for the new AI writing tools in Gboard, you can now revise your tone to be more formal, expressive, or concise. You can also quickly fix your spelling and grammar. Google also announced that you can now pair two LE Audio Bluetooth headphones to your Android phone so you and another person can listen at the same time. The tech giant says this feature could be helpful in several different instances, like when you're in a busy cafe or commuting on a train. The feature lets multiple people listen to the same playlist on their own headphones, which Google says could be used to do things like host a silent disco. Google highlighted that the redesigned Quick Share feature on Android makes it easier to share and receive content, allowing you to instantly switch between sending and receiving, preview photos before sharing, and open received files immediately. Plus, there's a new progress indicator that shows you live updates about what percentage of the file has been transferred. In some cases, it uses Veo 3, Google's latest video generation model, to animate your bot. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

A Microsoft-backed research team from Lumenisity (a spinout of the University of Southampton Optoelectronics Research Center) has built a hollow-core cable with what it claims is the lowest signal loss ever recorded in any optical fiber. Published in Nature Photonics on Sept. 1, the team claims to have achieved 0.091 dB/km at 1,550nm using a design known as double nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (DNANF). Conventional single-mode fiber guides light through glass, slowing signals to roughly 200 million meters per second, which is two-thirds of their potential vacuum speed. In contrast, hollow-core fibers route photons mostly through air — reducing latency by nearly half and minimizing nonlinear effects. This, however, comes with a steep penalty: hollow-core designs leak energy at rates exceeding 1 dB/km, effectively confining them to short, specialist links. The DNANF design solves this by using concentric glass tubes that are just microns thick. Testing this on 15km spools using multiple measurement methods, including optical time-domain reflectometry, confirmed attenuation under 0.1 dB/km. That's far broader than the narrow telecom windows where silica performs best. Also, chromatic dispersion — which is where different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds through a medium — is reported to be seven times lower than it is in legacy fiber, which could simplify transceiver design and reduce energy use in network gear. Francesco Poletti, who co-invented the design, said that the low levels of loss achieved could let operators “skip one in every two or three amplifier sites, resulting in significant reductions in both capital and operational expenditure.”Of course, there are still some challenges. Scaling production will require new tooling, and standards have yet to be written. But for the first time ever, a fiber that carries light through air is both faster and less lossy than the glass it's trying to replace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a lot of hype ahead of Lady Gaga's appearance on Netflix's Wednesday, but now that all of season two has dropped, it's clear that her new song, “The Dead Dance,” has an equally important presence in the series. Though Burton has a cinematic filmography stretching back 40 years—all the way to 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, his feature debut—Wednesday is his first major foray into TV, and his list of music video credits also isn't terribly long. However, even if “The Dead Dance” wasn't part of his Netflix show, it's a pretty ideal pairing of artistic mindsets here; the eerie black-and-white palette suddenly shifts into lurid color as Lady Gaga invites all her pals to the undead doll disco. Speaking to Tudum earlier this year, Lady Gaga explained “the inspiration for ‘The Dead Dance' was a breakup, and it was all about the way that we sometimes feel when it's over; how a relationship ending can kill our ability to feel hopeful about love. And that is when the song becomes not just about the relationship; it becomes about having fun with your friends when you've been through something tough and amazing. Wednesday season two is now streaming on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school. “Through talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.” He dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely. Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health. The data is then uploaded into Orchard's cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning, or thinning. The company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard's direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas. Wu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard's product offerings. He hopes Orchard's evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance. “Our ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data,” Wu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pivotal antitrust ruling aimed at addressing Google's search monopoly may have handed Microsoft its best competitive opening in many years — but it's still a slim one, and it's not clear if the Redmond company will even consider it worth the effort. In the long-awaited decision Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta barred Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on browsers and smartphones, such as the search giant's longstanding deal involving Apple's iPhone. That arrangement, the judge found, not only locked out rivals like Microsoft but also created a strong disincentive for Apple to build a competing search engine of its own. But under the ruling, Google can still spend billions to secure default slots, as long as partners remain free to preload or promote rivals. That leaves Microsoft to fight both Google's scale and its checkbook. For Microsoft, that could mean the ability to offer its users search results and ads backed by Google's industry-leading index. But it's not clear if Microsoft will try to take advantage of the remedies. Judge Mehta rejected those proposals, citing the risk of harming partners and consumers. Google's critics called the ruling overly lenient and a missed opportunity. Judge Mehta leaned on that case as his main precedent, even writing, “Like Microsoft before it, Google has thwarted true competition.” But it also limited the remedies, steering Mehta away from a breakup of Google and toward narrower steps: banning exclusive contracts, ordering data-sharing, and requiring syndication for five years. In theory, at least, Mehta's ruling means Microsoft could get Bing preloaded on smartphones under new distribution deals, while relying on syndicated Google results in the short term, and using the associated data-sharing remedy to better train Bing's own systems. Over time, the idea is that Microsoft would build up the volume of queries and user data it needs to compete independently, rather than being permanently reliant on Google. Microsoft has been working for years to improve its own search index, frequently touting the parity of its own search results in head-to-head comparisons with Google over the years. However, in Google's antitrust trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the power of device and software defaults, reinforced by habit, is nearly impossible to overcome. “You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella told the court, describing Microsoft as being caught in a “vicious cycle” in which Google's defaults give it more data, which improves quality, which makes it harder for competitors to win distribution. Google shares are up more than 8% this morning on news of the ruling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minutes after the perpetrator of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis last week was identified, YouTube appeared to delete several videos they had shared that morning. But not before the videos were downloaded and reshared in full on X. “X's feed algorithm is fully designed to maximize engagement, even negative engagement,” says Laura Edelson, an assistant professor in the computer sciences college at Northeastern University who specializes in tracking disinformation online. “In these conditions, conspiratorial, extreme content tends to perform very well. And when you couple that with the fact that with X's significantly weakened content rules, this is exactly what we would expect to result.” X did not respond to WIRED‘s request for comment. An 11-minute video from the shooter, which was shared by dozens of X accounts in the minutes after her identity was revealed, includes a wide array of guns and ammunition. As extremism researchers warned people against jumping to quick conclusions given the huge swath of digital, written, and video content that needed to be analyzed, X users took very little notice. The same day, screenshots from the video were used by everyone from elected lawmakers and senior government officials to law enforcement personnel, activists, podcasters, and conspiracy theorists on X to push particular narratives about what was to blame for the latest mass shooting. Information about the shooter, who identified as transgender and changed her name to Robin Westman when she was 17 years old, spread like wildfire on X, pushed by a huge list of right-wing figures, including Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, and Musk himself. X's own AI-powered chatbot Grok refuted the idea that transgender people disproportionately carry out mass shootings. Left-wing podcaster Benjamin Dixon, who describes himself as “Pastor of Antifa,” described the shooter on X as “a right wing incel aggrieved white boy.” Instead, some have determined that the shooter was likely part of a growing group of nihilistic violent extremists whose sole motivation is the violence itself. Argentino also warned that nihilistic violent extremists can be performative, their messages and writings designed in part to trick people into boosting specific phrases out of context. “These kind of attackers put on a performance, there is a script they follow and part of that script is trolling journalists or leaving ironic items in the hope someone in the media will bring on the Streisand effect to further spread their attack and be immortalized,” says Argentino. But on X, where posting first and often is rewarded more than posting accurate and verified information, such warnings repeatedly fall on deaf ears. “Context collapse is a rhetorical device that we see a lot in breaking news events—twisting real quotes or events to mislead or presenting it without the context in which it was said,” Nina Jankowicz, the former Biden administration disinformation czar who is now CEO of the American Sunlight Project, tells WIRED. “This is particularly prevalent on microblogging platforms like X, where users are disincentivized to read more than 280 characters or past the headline of a news item.” Since Musk's takeover of Twitter in late 2022, almost every move he's taken with regards to content moderation has made it more difficult to find accurate and timely information on X. More recently, users have relied on Grok to fact-check posts, which also hasn't helped. This lack of oversight, combined with a new verification system that rewards posts with the highest engagement over verified sources, has resulted in a toxic stew of disinformation flooding the platform during major global breaking news events. “There are certain narratives about mass shootings that will instantly find homes on X, and nothing holds them back from spreading.” The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NewDays, a Seattle startup using a generative AI therapy to treat people with mild dementia, today announced $7 million in funding to expand its service. “We've had this large group of people that for the longest time has been told there is no cure, there is no drug that can fix your disease, there is no drug that can stop your disease,” said co-founder Babak Parviz. “Basically, you cannot do anything, just live with it … And what we're saying is that there is hope so you can actually take charge and meaningfully, actually do things that can make your life better and make life better for your loved ones.” Parviz, who serves as CEO, launched the startup last year with Chief Innovation Officer Daniel Kelly. Parviz was a vice president at Amazon where he led the company's Grand Challenge initiative to discover new areas of operation. Kelly previously oversaw engineering teams at Amazon and Google X. The need to support seniors with cognitive decline is massive. An estimated one-third of Americans 65 and older have either dementia or mild cognitive impairment, said the NewDays team. NewDays' strategy for care is based on research from the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT), a study that provided virtual chats between healthcare providers and elderly participants that was led by a Harvard Medical School scientist. The project showed demonstrable benefits, slowing cognitive decline and reducing loneliness. But a model using human clinicians isn't scalable to serve the millions of Americans alone who need treatment and the costs would be prohibitive. So NewDays offers AI-generated conversations that aim to mimic the treatment provided in I-CONECT. The chats with Sunny will cover a users' interests and reminiscences. They'll practice skills needed in day-to-day life, like remembering a series of questions that come up naturally in conversations with friends and family. “We don't want to be a substitute for their social connections,” Parviz said. “We want to be an amplifier there and sort of the builder of confidence, so they can actually practice with us and then go to do more human-to-human conversations.” Kelly said that his father has moderate dementia and enjoys talking with Sunny during stretches of 30 minutes or more. “He knows that this is a piece of software and he can open up to it and not be worried about making mistakes or repeating himself, and it just kind of allows him a lot of freedom to have conversations in ways that he might refrain from when he's interacting with other people,” Kelly said. NewDays' leaders said they do not share outside of the company any data collected in the conversations unless it's needed for someone's care. Seattle's Madrona Venture Group and San Francisco's General Catalyst provided the seed round funding.

At Acer's press conference in Berlin, we found the Swift 16 AI, using the upcoming chip based on Intel's 18A process. The system wasn't prominently featured in the press conference, which included an AMD-based Swift Air 16 alongside a number of gaming laptops. What we know is limited largely to the placard that sat next to the system at Acer's showcase.The system has a 16-inch, 3K OLED display (likely 2880 x 1800) with a 120 Hz refresh rate. There aren't too many laptops that let you write on the touchpad. This is the first system we've seen with Panther Lake that will head to market, but Acer is only saying that the system will launch in 2026. At CES 2025, ODMs like Wistron, Pegatron, and Compal showed designs for systems. Then at Computex, we saw the chips in Intel's own validation systems.At Deutsche Bank's 2025 Technology Conference, Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zisner said that "[Panther Lake] is still on track [to launch this year]... Our first SKU will be out by the end of this year, and then we will have more SKUs in the first half of 2026, and you will really start to see the volume ramp as we kind of migrate through 2026." But it's likely we'll see more of Panther Lake at CES 2026 in early January. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display. Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital. The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.” Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nevertheless, the survey suggested a strong upgrade cycle ahead for Apple, with 68.3% of iPhone owners saying they will be buying an iPhone 17, which is expected to be announced next week. “We don't see the lack of a foldable product significantly impacting Apple's iPhone unit sales,” said William Kerwin, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar Research Services in Chicago. “We continue to see foldable phones as a relative market niche, with high price points and low volumes,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This is part of why Apple has held off on the form factor so far.” “We don't see a future foldable hampering sales for the iPhone 17 lineup this fall,” he added. Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that “considering” switching was a weak measure for measuring loyalty. “There's a big leap between considering and actually switching,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We don't see a massive shift from iOS to Android or from iPhones to foldables,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for EMEA devices at IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass. “The numbers on foldables are still very low,” he told TechNewsWorld. We expect that to grow faster when Apple launches a foldable device.” “I'm sure there's a lot more users waiting for Apple to launch their foldable device rather than rushing now to a foldable from Samsung or other vendors,” he said. “In 2023, they accounted for approximately 1.4% of the overall smartphone market,” he told TechNewsWorld. Current U.S. iPhone model shares show that larger-screen formats like Pro Max and Plus already make up more than a third of sales, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a market research firm in Chicago. “Still, foldables make up a small percentage of overall smartphone shipments, mostly appealing to early adopters and power users.” “The SellCell survey reveals a palpable sense of impatience,” Vena said. “About a third of iPhone users are at least open to switching if Apple delays too long. He acknowledged, however, that the foot-dragging was “characteristic of Apple at its best.” “The company typically waits until a new category is mature before jumping in,” he explained. “Foldables are still ironing out durability, cost, and software optimization issues. “There are still issues with foldable screens and other areas that emerge over time. Apple would want the technology to meet their high standards, and that is why they have not released one yet.” “Traditionally, iPhone users have been a lot less willing to overlook UX imperfections,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The SellCell survey appears to demonstrate some discontent, although we'd describe it as curiosity about foldable phones rather than unhappiness with the current iPhone models,” observed Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “Consumers want new stuff all the time, so we prefer to look at actual behavior.” “Apple may end up redefining the foldable space when it finally enters, much as it did with smartwatches and tablets — much to the ironic chagrin of Samsung,” added Vena. When that happens, foldables could go from niche curiosity to everyday device.” His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I can happily write the same to-do list in six different places in a single day (good thing I test digital notebooks and paper planners). I often find myself rewriting the little brainstorms in my Notes app because the ideas are still banging around in my brain, asking to be let free onto a page, digital or not. But not every brainstorm or list needs a full-size page. That's where ReMarkable's latest digital notebook comes in. With a 7.3-inch e-paper display and a gentle front light, it's a good size that fits in your hand as you jot down notes or an idea while you're on the go—the classic reporter's notepad turned digital. The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is identical to the Paper Pro that launched last year in technology, just in a smaller profile (no small feat). You can write in color, add color highlights, and it has a soft frontlight for writing in dim environments. The front light doesn't get as bright as a Kindle or smartphone, but it does make the screen legible. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It magnetically sticks to the right side of the tablet, and that's how it connects and charges. Much will depend on how much you use it, but I expect you'll probably have to charge it two times a month, three if you're rigorously using it every day. The Move is 4 inches by a little over 7 inches, and weighs only 8 ounces (though it weighs 12 ounces with a case and stylus on), with a 16:9 aspect ratio in portrait mode, and a 4:3 aspect ratio in landscape mode to match ReMarkable's larger models. That makes it sharper, but I didn't see a huge screen difference looking at the paper-like screens side by side. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move can sync with your existing ReMarkable notes, but it has its own special page size designed for the smaller form. I saw similar gray bars if I pulled up a PDF or document on the Move and zoomed out to see it in its entirety. Usually, you won't see these bars on the Move if you're opening up a standard set of notes. The notebooks you started on ReMarkable's larger e-ink devices will adjust to fit onto the Move's smaller screen in portrait mode, and resume their normal size if you rotate to landscape mode. The Move responds quickly to whichever orientation you move it to, whether it's in your hand or flat on a desk. Recent software updates actually make all ReMarkable devices more responsive to orientation adjustments—my larger Paper Pro used to ignore rotations until I activated the keyboard on the attached Type Folio case, but now it flips around just as fast as the Move. It was easy to grab and write down notes from an impromptu call with an exterminator after an ant infestation in my pantry (nothing like some late summer desperation from my neighborhood ant colonies). All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It was comfortable to stack on top of a Hobonichi Techo and carry around the house without feeling like my hand could drop either item, and layered nicely on top of my planner when it was laid open if I wanted to fill out my planner's weekly spread and then write down my extended to-do list on the Move. It can fit into my favorite small handbag, and just about every handbag I own besides my shorter belt bags. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Move was less convenient for PDFs and typed materials, but not impossible to use. Already typed copy on a different ReMarkable adjusts to fit the Move's screen, which felt very much like reading on a Kindle. It was more effort to zoom in and annotate or edit something on a PDF, like changing a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet. While you can't type directly on the Move, you can convert your handwritten text into type, which works quickly and does a good job recognizing block writing and cursive alike. The color is also a really fun addition that you won't find on every digital notebook. It paired nicely with the color coding I like to do in my paper planners to help visualize different sections, though you only have nine colors for pen tools (including black and white) and six colors for the highlighter (including gray). It's not as wide a gamut as you'll get with real-life highlighter packs, but still enough color to spice things up. Earlier this year, the company debuted ReMarkable Methods, which added a new library of templates and workbooks designed by users and even the BulletJournal.com team. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's another new feature for Connect subscribers: Handwriting Search, which can search through your notes even if they aren't typed. It takes a little while to scan your notes, but after that, I could easily search words or even parts of words to find results; searching “phan” would pull up my notes from the Dungeons & Dragons campaign The Lost Mines of Phandelver, while searching “Friday” pulled up various to-do lists I'd written. You can flip through how many times a word appears in the notes, too, with a set of arrows that appear in the right-hand corner of the note after you use Handwriting Search. This feature is only available if you join the Beta program, but it will roll out later this year. You won't need a Move to access it, but you will need to be a Connect subscriber. The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is my new favorite digital notebook. It's the perfect size to grab and jot down random ideas and a complicated list, and you can still zoom out to draw larger sketches or switch to landscape mode. It's more affordable than the Paper Pro, and a good size for anyone mostly looking to jot down everyday notes and tasks rather than long-form distraction-free writing. But keep in mind, this is still a $449 notepad. Sometimes, all you need is a $25 reporter's notebook. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
