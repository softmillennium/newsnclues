“Trump is claiming the right to conduct extra-judicial assassinations,” a civil rights attorney posted on X.

Experts are condemning the U.S. military strike that killed 11 people on a boat in the Caribbean on Tuesday, saying that the bombing was in violation of international law. The Trump administration has claimed — without providing evidence — that the casualties of the strike were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that it has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” 

The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. “TERRORISTS ELIMINATED. ADIÓS,” the post says, with an emoji of a person placing items in the trash.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the U.S. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.”

The Trump administration has circulated a brief black and white video that it says shows the fatal strike. AP reports that the White House “did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members.” The outlet also noted that the video “is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people” and “did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.”

Experts say the administration's deadly strike violated international law.

“Labeling someone a terrorist and deploying the military does not make them a military target,” Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to Truthout. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.” 

“Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is now at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture, in the context of the government's so-called “war on drugs” campaign.

“Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday.

Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.”

Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela's government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military's presence near the country. The Trump administration has also frequently accused people of belonging to Tren de Aragua to justify violations of their human rights. 

Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador's notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. The administration repeatedly accused the men of being Tren de Aragua members, despite the fact that a majority did not have criminal convictions. 

After four months, they were sent home to Venezuela in a prisoner swap deal between Venezuela and the United States. The men, including a soccer coach, a makeup artist, and a musician, have reported that they were physically and psychologically tortured at the prison. 

On September 2, an appeals court ruled that the Trump administration could not use the 18th century-era law to expedite removals of people it accused of being Tren de Aragua members. Before Trump, the law had been used just three times in American history — during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. It was last invoked to justify the internment of thousands of people with Japanese ancestry during World War II.

            The move would make Florida the first state to end a longstanding – and constitutionally upheld – practice of requiring certain vaccines for school students.
    


            The state health department will immediately move to end all non-statutory mandates in the state, Ladapo said at a news conference. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was also at the event, said state lawmakers would then look into developing a legislative package to end any remaining mandates.
    


            Ladapo said that every vaccine mandate “is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.”
    


            All 50 states have had school immunization requirements since the beginning of the 1980s, with incoming kindergartners needing shots to protect against diseases including measles, polio and tetanus. No states require a Covid-19 vaccine for schoolchildren.
    


Required vaccine coverage among US kindergartners dips again, new CDC data shows



            All states allow medical exemptions from these school vaccine mandates, and most also allow for exemptions due to personal or religious beliefs. Exemption rates have been on the rise for years in the US, with a record share of incoming kindergartners skipping the required shots in the 2024-25 school year.
    


            Florida's school vaccine exemption rate last school year– about 5% – was higher than the national average, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, and nearly all were for nonmedical reasons.
    


            “We are concerned that today's announcement will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, which will have a ripple effect across our communities,” Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.
    


            “For many kids, the best part of school is being with friends - sharing space, playing on the playground, and learning together. Close contact makes it easy for contagious diseases to spread quickly,” she said. “When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun. When children are sick and miss school caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.”

On display in Beijing were nuclear weapons launched by air, sea and land, laser weapons and four-legged drones

It was hardly a subtle attempt to project power. China showed off air-, sea- and land-launched nuclear weapons in its parade on Wednesday, a triad intended to demonstrate that Beijing's long-term aspiration is to match US military might.

Also on display were large underwater torpedo-like drones, intended to threaten western warships, as well as anti-drone lasers and four-legged “robot wolves”, all designed to be noticed, regardless of their actual military effectiveness.

Though China last fought a war in 1979 – a month-long conflict with Vietnam – it has been pursuing a sweeping military modernisation for a generation, increasing its defence budget by 13 times in dollar terms since the mid-1990s, while it threatens independent Taiwan with drills nearby.

At the heart of the parade was the nuclear formation, a deliberately ominous collection of missile launchers in batches of four on vast trucks, with easily visible designations written in the Roman alphabet to aid western observers.

China's Xinhua news agency said it was the first time Beijing had presented its nuclear triad, weapons it said were “China's strategic ‘ace' power to safeguard the country's sovereignty and nation's dignity”.

They included four new DF-61 intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles, each carried on 16 wheel trucks. It was unclear if they were armed. These were the “main surprise” for western analysts, according to Hans Kristensen, of the Federation of American Scientists.

The newly presented missile's range was roughly estimated at 7,500 miles based on its predecessor, the DL-41 – enough to reach Washington from Beijing. It is one of eight or nine Chinese ballistic missiles with an intercontinental range, raising questions of overkill. “How many ways do they have to be able to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile to deter?” Kristensen said.

Trundling along with it were new JL-3 ballistics for China's six Jin-class submarines with a range of 6,200 miles or more. And, to complete the triad, China's first-ever air-launched nuclear weapon, the JL-1, meaning Beijing joins a nuclear club composed of the US, Russia, India and probably Israel.

China's nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country's: it has an estimated 600 warheads, which is increasing at a rate of 100 a year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Its goal is to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to Washington, though even at that point Beijing's arsenal would be smaller than that of the US or Russia, both of which have more than 5,000 warheads in their stocks. However, such is the destructive power of nuclear weapons that a handful of warheads could kill hundreds of thousands, or more.

Other novel weapons shown off included two models of extra-large underwater drones, measuring 18 to 20 metres, including the AJX002, carried on specially elongated eight-wheeled trucks, part of a strategic weapons programme.

Their size means they are vastly different to the small sea drones that Ukraine has used in swarms to knock out vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet, and their capabilities are less than clear. But the intention is to pose a threat, and to be seen to be posing a threat, to the traditional US dominance of the Pacific.

Two types of laser air defence weapons were displayed, one for ships and one based on land, a cheaper means of fending off drones that western militaries are already hoping to use. Britain plans to fit four warships with a DragonFire laser from 2027, to better protect the vessels from drones used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

A handful of spindly four-legged land drones called robot wolves also attracted attention. However, if they could march, they were not allowed to, and instead were mounted on the back of other moving vehicles.

At a glance they appeared no more sophisticated than the growing number of land drones appearing on the battlefields of Ukraine, as remotely controlled fighters or trucks to rescue the wounded, though China's industrial capacity is such that a viable product could probably be made in vast numbers and possibly supplied to Russia.

    Jocelyn Solis-Moreira is a freelance health and science journalist based in New York.



            There's nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one's family, even just for a few minutes.
    


            The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones.
    


            There are consequences to sitting longer than we used to on the toilet: People are reporting a higher rate of hemorrhoids when they bring their smartphones to the bathroom, according to a new study in PLOS One.



Hemorrhoids are groups of veins in the rectum and outside the anus that can swell and enlarge due to increased pressure, which can create itchiness, discomfort, pain and bleeding.
    


Exercise may help patients with colon cancer live as long as those who never had it, study suggests



            This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study's senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
    


            All this scrolling is messing with people's health.
    


            “The entire business model of these social media apps is to distract us, make us lose track of time and addict us to the algorithm,” Pasricha said. “We're just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.”
    


            The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Confirmation of hemorrhoids was detected by endoscopy.
    


            Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media.
    


How to prevent doomscrolling from controlling you



            How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. About 37% of smartphone users spend over five minutes on the toilet compared with 7% of non-smartphone users.
    


            Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Over time, the increased pressure from the toilet seat can cause blood to pool in the rectum.
    


            “When you're sitting on an open toilet bowl, you have no pelvic floor support,” Pasricha said.
    


            Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture.
    


            Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn't ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. The squatted position is a better option for a smooth bowel movement.
    


            “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we're evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said.
    


            What about constipation? The study results suggest the issue is most likely the time spent sitting on the toilet rather than straining, Pasricha said.
    


Is the ‘fibermaxxing' trend good for you? Yes, and here's why



            People who used their smartphones weren't more constipated than those who didn't, she said. “They didn't actually strain harder to have a bowel movement than the ones who didn't. My hypothesis is that it's passive smartphone use that causes these hemorrhoidal cushions to become engorged and bulge, and that's what leads to hemorrhoids.”
    


            While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them.
    


            “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn't use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.”
    


            Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors.
    


            The simplest answer is to avoid bringing your phone to the bathroom. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Three to five minutes would be ideal.
    


            “A lot of expert consensus is three minutes per bowel movement, but everyone is different,” Shukla said.
    


            Setting a timer can be helpful if you're prone to mindless scrolling. Pasricha also recommended checking in with yourself after two TikTok videos to see whether you're having a productive toilet session. If the magic isn't happening, it's better to get up and try again later than to sit and wait on the toilet bowl.
    


            Ghanta explained it best: There are many things in life we're rushing to get through, and we often say to slow down and take time to smell the roses. But not on the toilet.

As China and Russia's leaders walked shoulder to shoulder on Sept. 3, a hot mic captured them discussing increasing longevity through organ transplants, possibly living to be 150 years old.

The conversation, livestreamed through Chinese state media to billions online and on television, made international headlines as China watchers scrutinized the implications, with many pointing to longstanding concerns about forced organ harvesting.

People at the New Jersey prison are confined in cells so small they can touch both walls with their arms outstretched.

Many people incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison's West Compound are confined in cells so small they can touch the ceiling and both walls with their arms outstretched, according to a new report released on Tuesday by the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson. 

The Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment. 

New Jersey State Prison, a maximum security prison in Trenton, the state's capital, holds more than 1,300 people across its three compounds, North, South, and West. As part of their inspection of the West Compound, investigators conducted site visits and interviewed over 100 incarcerated people, as well as staff and prison leadership. 

Investigators found that West Compound prison cells, with the exception of one wing, “are very small.” Cells in the solitary confinement unit, which the Department of Corrections has named the Restorative Housing Unit, “are shockingly small,” measuring four feet by seven feet.

“People housed on 7-Wing [the Restorative Housing Unit] can touch the ceiling and can extend their arms to touch both side-walls of the cell,” the report says. “The same is true for much of the population in 1-wing, 2-wing and 6-wing, though these cells are larger than the ones in 7-wing.” 

The New Jersey Administrative Code requires that county jail cells have 35 square feet of unencumbered floor space in single-occupancy cells, but there are no minimum requirements for the size of prison cells, according to the report. Cells in only one wing of West Compound meet the county jail requirement. The other cells range in size from 35 square feet to 45 square feet, with beds that take up 13.5 square feet of floor space. 

Each cell has a sink and a toilet. The sinks have no hot water and the toilets are “directly exposed to the open bars of the cell door,” according to the report. 

Residents also have no privacy while showering, which has led them to bathe with their underwear on.

“[T]he West Compound does not have enclosed shower stalls that offer any modesty or privacy while bathing,” the report says. “Showerheads are positioned along the wall on the first floor of the housing unit, separated with makeshift dividers. People in the stalls are directly visible to those on higher floors of the housing unit.”

New Jersey is one of the country's fastest warming states, but there is no air conditioning in West Compound's housing units. This past summer, the state was hit with numerous heat waves. 

For more than half of West Compound's almost 200-year existence, experts have called for the prison's closure. In 1918, a commission created by the state legislature recommended replacing the prison, saying that it was “antiquated and inadequate” and “much too small for decent living,” per the report. More than 30 years later, in 1952, another committee advised the state's then-governor to build a new prison according to “standards of modern penology.” 

The report concluded with a plea to state leaders to finally heed that call. 

“The buildings in the West Compound were constructed nearly 200 years ago, and have been called antiquated and inhumane by New Jersey correctional leaders, policymakers, and subject matter experts for at least the last 100 years,” the report says. “Lawmakers and the Department of Corrections should prioritize and fund the demolition and replacement of the West Compound with modern correctional housing units that better meet the needs of the Department and the incarcerated population.”

This trope has long been used to justify repression of anarchists, communists, liberals, immigrants, and unions.

Listening to the incendiary rhetoric emanating from Trump and MAGA world, one would think the United States of today, decades after the collapse of the communist bloc, was enmeshed in an existential struggle against communism. Even before his election win in 2024, Trump claimed his opponents' economic policies were at the extremes of leftism. Kamala Harris, he said, had gone “full communist.” With Trump setting the tone — and now ensconced in the White House — his minions have amplified that rhetoric as a way of justifying their repressive onslaught. For example, Homeland Security Director, and anti-immigrant stormtrooper, Kristi Noem told the press in July that liberals “are actually turning out to be a bunch of communists and Marxists.” In like fashion, Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff Steven Miller — speaking in Washington's Union Station after the military was dispatched to that city, proclaimed, “We're not going to let the communists destroy a great American city.” The tenor and tone of all this show no signs of abating, as the fascistic moves and raw assertion of power continues.

That the trope of anti-communism is being invoked and retains such power, is in no small measure a testament to the legacy of the anti-communist initiatives of the 20th century. This writer's forthcoming book, Menace of Our Time: The Long War Against American Communism, takes a deeper dive into that history. Given the moment we find ourselves in, it is worth exploring some.

In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. What followed was a wave of repression in which his assassin, an erstwhile anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed, all within two months of the shooting. In the aftermath, New York State passed a law proscribing what it called “criminal anarchy,” making it a felony to advocate — not plan for, let alone move to carry out — revolution. The law would serve as a major weapon against organized leftists, specifically communists, who emerged in the early years of the 20th century.

Fast-forward 18 years, and an anarchist bombing at the home of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer triggered the Palmer Raids, a key chapter of what would come to be called the First Red Scare — a government roundup of thousands of anarchists and communists, hundreds of whom would be deported. Arrested in this period and prosecuted under the criminal anarchy law was the then-communist Benjamin Gitlow, convicted and imprisoned for publishing a document called The Left-Wing Manifesto. The conviction, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, was upheld. As the court wrote in its opinion, “It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration.” This principle of anti-advocacy — a fundamental negation of the First Amendment — would remain the law of the land for decades. It would also be a major instrument leveled against domestic communists.

This period also saw the rise of a young up-and-comer in the U.S. Justice Department: J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, who was modernizing the Bureau of Investigation (later the Federal Bureau of Investigation), created a filing system of anarchists and communists that would be a cornerstone of the FBI's work going forward. The bureau also deployed government informants who gathered intelligence, facilitated raids, and spread insidious rumors about the loyalty of dedicated comrades. It was a methodological template that would come to serve the FBI well.

While the fallout from the Palmer Raids subsided by the mid-1920s, the communists, who would cohere into the Communist Party USA (CPUSA or CP), would become the preeminent target of the FBI and other anti-communist forces. In doing so, it confronted the repressive bite of not only the bureau, but also the anti-syndicalism and criminal anarchy laws that had been passed in nearly every state in the U.S. — to say nothing of the routine harassment by right-wing forces and local police.

Such was the situation as the country entered the Great Depression. It was during this time that rank-and-file communists and their supporters fought for unions, the unemployed, and opposed lynchings and the larger Jim Crow system. In doing so, they confronted unceasing pushback — firings, violent attacks on their meetings, arrests on the picket lines, beatings by police, and even killings. All of this was facilitated by a media sounding a hyperbolic alarm against a communist menace.

That alarm would grow shriller as the country approached World War II. The communists, whose initial anti-war position was at cross purposes with the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, were targeted by early predecessors of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. They also saw their leader, Earl Browder, imprisoned for traveling under a false passport. At the same time, new anti-communist laws were enacted: the Voorhis Act, requiring the registration of agents of a foreign power (i.e., the CP); the Hatch Act, proscribing communists in government; and the Smith Act against teaching the principles of revolution. It was also during this time that Roosevelt bestowed extraordinary powers on the FBI to target domestic communism. That led to measures such as the creation of a custodial detention list — essentially a concentration camp scheme to round up communists if an emergency order was given. When the communists abandoned their anti-war position with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the repression abated — though hardly ended. It was a circumstance that would not last.

With the onset of the Cold War, the government undertook its most aggressive wave of anti-communist repression ever, imprisoning or holding under indictment dozens of the party's top leaders by way of the Smith Act. This formal repression also fostered a social climate where communists became pariahs of the first order.

An indication of how deeply anti-communist sentiment penetrated the public consciousness could be seen in a 1954 poll by the Opinion Research Corporation. When asked if congressional committees hurt innocent people, 49 percent of the respondents said yes. Then, when asked if innocent people could be hurt in the process, 58 percent said, hurt or not, it was more important to uncover communists. The vast majority of Americans also said that communists should be stripped of citizenship, that the government should be allowed to tap their phones, and that it was a good idea “for people to report to the FBI any neighbors or acquaintances whom they suspected of being communists.” That this repression garnered such support — despite the modest actual influence of U.S. communists  —  was an example of how a negative consensus could be built through unrelenting demagoguery. In the fifties and to a lesser degree in the sixties, it was communism; in the eighties and nineties, it was terrorism, in the wake of 9/11 it was Islam, first Al Qaeda, then ISIS, and now again it is “the communists” and “the woke left.” The names may have changed, but the methodology has not.

While the fever pitch of the Second Red Scare would lessen as the fifties gave way to the sixties, the pursuit of the CP did not. This era witnessed the initiation of the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO), the first and possibly the most extensive of all their notorious surveillance and infiltration efforts.

One example can offer insight into the program's myriad operations: the case of Aaron Libson, a closeted gay man and communist activist living in Philadelphia. In 1966, Libson was arrested by undercover police in a “tearoom”  —  a restroom in a public park used for gay encounters  —  on a sodomy charge. When the FBI, who knew Libson was a communist, learned of the arrest, they snapped into action with a COINTELPRO operation. As an FBI memorialized, the point was to “neutralize Libson with the party and embarrass the party generally.” To achieve this, they anonymously called James Dolsen, the head of the Philadelphia CP, as well as one of their press contacts “who has been used quite successfully in the Counterintelligence Program and has always protected the Bureau's interests.”

Libson describes what followed:

“When I had the arrest, I pleaded nolo contendere  —  I do not wish to contend  —  on a Friday. The next day, Saturday, I woke up and got ready for work, and as I looked at the paper that morning, there was a small article saying, ‘Local Red arrested.' I had a suicide plan ready just in case it came out, so I thought, OK, this is it and I carried out the plan. … I wasn't going to do anything at my house where my family would find me, so I rented a room at the Arch Street YMCA. I'd packed some of the crystal stuff you clean toilets in some tin foil, and I swallowed that and laid down and waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. In the interim, I'd called a friend of mine. While I was waiting for something to happen with the poison, I got up and sat on the window ledge  —  the room was on the fifth floor. As I realized the poison wasn't working.”

Fortunately, the friend stopped things from going further. For its part, the Bureau counted this as a victory. As the noted in a memo detailing various COINTELPRO operations, “After Libson entered a guilty plea in February 1967, the fact was published in a newspaper, Daniel Rubin, National Organizational Secretary, stated Libson was dropped from the CP.”

While COINTELPRO officially came to an end after being exposed in the early 1970s, the surveillance and attention to the CP did not. In 1978 Congress established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which allowed for the legal wiretapping of those the US considered foreign agents, which included the pro-Soviet, CPUSA. The Bureau also kept in place its informant Morris Childs, who was acting as CP General Secretary Gus Hall's liaison with the Soviets — a paradoxical circumstance of the Bureau both facilitating the funding of the CP, something Child's was responsible for, while also garnering precious intelligence — and then there was the FBI's investigation of the Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES) because of perceived communist infiltration. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the extraordinary attention to the CPUSA ended, if not the legal and extralegal measures against other perceived enemies.

Were all this a matter of the past, it would be bad enough, but this history has thrust itself into the present. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used against communists and anarchists during the Palmer Raids of 1920, was leveled in 2025 against Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mahmoud Khalil. Trump has talked about stripping immigrant citizens of naturalization; meanwhile, the MAGA shock troops have set their sights on the political opposition. Elise Stefanik, the MAGA congresswoman from New York, has called New York City's mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a “raging antisemite communist.” The methodology behind this is hardly concealed. Trump, while running for president in the summer of 2024, made this clear: “All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country.”

While this effort has not been wholly successful, it is a significant problem that no small number of people are swayed by this. In that sense, knowing a little history can serve as a weapon.

When Israel targets Palestinian seed banks, it's not just destroying buildings. It's attacking the future itself.

When Israel targets Palestinian seed banks, it's not just destroying buildings. It's attacking the future itself.

This summer, Israeli bulldozers rolled through the West Bank city of Hebron with ruthless efficiency, targeting not soldiers or weapons caches, but something deeply vulnerable: Palestine's only surviving national seed bank.

Within hours of the bulldozers' arrival on July 31, 2025, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees' seed multiplication facility lay in ruins — its propagation materials scattered, its infrastructure demolished, and with it, generations of Palestinian agricultural heritage reduced to rubble.

What happened in Hebron fits the legal definition of ecocide — the deliberate destruction of ecosystems to undermine human survival. The Union of Agricultural Work Committees condemned this attack as “an act of erasure intended to sever the generational ties between farmers and their land.”

When ecocide operates within the context of genocide, as it does in Palestine, it functions as a temporal weapon that extends the logic of elimination far beyond the present moment, reaching into an indefinite future where recovery becomes systematically impossible.

The Union of Agricultural Work Committees' seed facility housed over 70 baladi (heirloom) seed varieties, many of which no longer exist elsewhere, that Palestinian farmers had cultivated and perfected over centuries. These seeds — for rare, indigenous, hardy strains of tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, zucchini, and others collected from local farms in the West Bank and Gaza — weren't just any seeds. They were living libraries of Palestinian agricultural knowledge, carrying genetic traits for drought resistance, soil adaptation, and nutritional density that commercial varieties lack.

Their destruction was no accident. It was strategic.

Contemporary legal definitions of ecocide describe it as “unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment.” But this clinical language fails to capture the temporal dimensions of environmental destruction when deployed as a weapon of colonial control.

These seeds … were living libraries of Palestinian agricultural knowledge, carrying genetic traits for drought resistance, soil adaptation, and nutritional density.

Unlike direct physical violence, which operates in the immediate present, ecocide functions across temporal scales. The destruction of seed banks eliminates not just current agricultural capacity, but future possibilities for food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, alongside the ability to define their own food and agriculture systems, centering community and resisting the demands and reliance on corporate food regimes. Indigenous seed varieties, once lost, cannot be recreated — they represent thousands of years of co-evolution between plants, soil, climate, and human knowledge systems. Their destruction constitutes a temporal amputation — the severing of a community's ability to reproduce itself across generations.

This temporal dimension transforms ecocide from an environmental crime into genocidal strategy. The 1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” Crucially, Article II(c) includes “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.” Ecocide operates precisely through this mechanism — creating conditions where the targeted group cannot sustain itself over time.

Palestinian agriculture has always been more than economic activity — it represents a form of cultural continuity and resistance. Traditional Palestinian farming practices integrated olive groves with wheat, barley, legumes, and tree crops in polycultures that maximized both biodiversity and resilience. This agricultural system sustained Palestinian communities for millennia while maintaining soil health and water conservation.

The destruction of seed banks severs this generational chain of knowledge transmission. Each heirloom variety carries within its genetic structure the accumulated wisdom of Palestinian farmers who selected, saved, and improved seeds over centuries. When these varieties are destroyed, the cultural knowledge embedded within them — when to plant, how to process, which varieties thrive in specific microclimates — becomes orphaned, disconnected from its material foundation.

The destruction of seed banks eliminates not just current agricultural capacity, but future possibilities for food sovereignty.

In August 2025 alone, Israeli Occupation Forces uprooted 3000 olive trees in al-Mughayyir, near the West Bank city of Ramallah — gutting a community whose survival and identity are inseparable from its groves. Since October 2023, Israeli forces and settlers have destroyed over 52,300 olive trees in West Bank alone and the record stretches back to over six decades, with estimates surpassing 3 million uprooted olive and fruit trees.

Each tree cut down represents more than lost income — it is the severing of ancestral ties and the deliberate dismantling of a self-sustaining agricultural system that has nourished Palestinian life. The systematic nature of this destruction is not incidental collateral of war but part of a sustained campaign of agricultural erasure, aimed at making cultural continuity impossible.

Young Palestinians growing up under occupation already face systematic barriers to accessing ancestral lands. The destruction of agricultural heritage adds another layer to this dispossession, ensuring that even if land access were restored, the specific varieties and knowledge systems that sustained Palestinian agriculture for generations would remain irretrievable.

The temporal logic of ecocide extends beyond Palestine's borders, connecting to global struggles over seed sovereignty and agricultural biodiversity. Industrial agriculture has already driven the extinction of an estimated 75 percent of agricultural biodiversity since the 1900s. This “genetic erosion” makes all human communities more vulnerable to climate change, plant diseases, and environmental disruptions.

Indigenous and traditional seed varieties often carry genetic traits for drought tolerance, disease resistance, and nutritional density that commercial varieties lack. The destruction of Palestine's seed bank eliminates these traits not just for Palestinians, but also for the global gene pool. In an era of climate crisis, such biodiversity represents irreplaceable adaptive potential for human survival.

The targeting of seed banks in conflict zones — from Palestine to Sudan to Ukraine — reveals how ecocide operates as a global strategy of domination. By destroying the biological foundation of food sovereignty, powerful actors ensure that displaced and oppressed populations remain permanently dependent on external food systems controlled by their oppressors.

Perhaps the most insidious aspect of ecocide is its indefinite temporal reach. While physical violence creates immediate trauma that communities can potentially heal from, the destruction of ecological foundations creates wounds that may never close. Seeds destroyed today cannot be replanted tomorrow — their genetic information is gone forever.

This creates what professor Rob Nixon has termed “slow violence” — harm that unfolds gradually across temporal scales that exceed individual human lifespans. Palestinian children born today will inherit an impoverished biological landscape, with fewer Indigenous food varieties, degraded soil ecosystems, and diminished agricultural knowledge systems. Their children will inherit even less.

The undeterminable nature of this future damage is precisely the point. Ecocide operates through the creation of permanent dependency and vulnerability. By destroying the biological foundation of Palestinian food sovereignty, occupying forces ensure that resistance cannot take root — literally — in future generations.

Recognition of ecocide as a crime against humanity represents a crucial step toward accountability. Several countries have already criminalized ecocide in their domestic legal systems, and there are growing calls for the International Criminal Court to recognize it as a crime under international law.

But legal frameworks alone cannot address the temporal dimensions of ecological destruction. We must pay attention to the ongoing genocide in the present and be woefully aware of the temporal extension of the harms that we are complicit in. We need new models of accountability that recognize harm across generational time scales — reparations that address not just immediate damage, but the ongoing impacts of biological impoverishment.

The destruction of Palestine's seed banks reveals ecocide as a weapon of temporal control — a strategy for extending genocide beyond the present moment into an undeterminable future. Understanding this temporal dimension is crucial for developing effective forms of resistance, solidarity, and accountability.

Despite these systematic attacks, Palestinian agricultural resistance continues, and seed savers persist. Every saved seed becomes an act of refusal — a rejection of the logic that says Palestinians have no future. Each act of preservation becomes a bridge across the wounds that ecocide seeks to create.

Vivien Sansour, founder of the Palestine Heirloom Seed Library, has spent years searching for traditional varieties to save and propagate. Sansour's vision for the library is “not just about Palestinian seeds, but about how Palestinian seeds can tell the story of tenderness of our people, and people around the world that have made it possible for us to have shade under a tree.” Based in the UNESCO World Heritage village of Battir, her project seeks to preserve heritage seed varieties and traditional farming practices. In this patient work of recovery and propagation lies the possibility of futures that oppressive forces cannot control — futures that remain, like well-saved seeds, full of unexpected potential for new growth.

The occupation's bulldozers destroyed buildings and scattered seeds. But they cannot destroy the deeper truth that Palestinian seed keepers like Sansour embody.

“I have seen seeds make their way out of concrete,” Sansour says. “I have seen people come out of rubble, and I have saved my own seeds in ashes, and I have seen life insisting on itself — not because of us but despite us.”

Joseph Ladapo, a long-time vaccine skeptic, says that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed

US politics live – latest updates

Children in Florida will no longer be required to receive vaccines against preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio and hepatitis, said Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, on Wednesday in a speech during which he likened vaccine mandates to “slavery”.

Ladapo, hand-picked for the role by Ron DeSantis, Florida's Republican governor, is a long-time skeptic of the benefit of vaccines, and has previously been accused of peddling “scientific nonsense” by public health advocates.

In his announcement on Wednesday, at a press conference in Tampa hosted by DeSantis, he said that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed, and that he expected the move would receive the blessing “of God”.

“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” said Ladapo, who altered data in a 2022 study about Covid-19 vaccines in an attempt to exaggerate the risk to young men who received one.

“People have a right to make their own decisions. Who am I, as a government or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Our body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”

Ladapo condemned lockdowns and vaccination requirements during the coronavirus pandemic as a time “when crazy things did happen”, and said that growing skepticism of vaccines were “reflections of God's light against the darkness of tyranny and oppression”.

Formerly affiliated with the controversial ultra-conservative America's Frontline Doctors group, Ladapo has long railed against Covid-19 vaccines. In 2023, he urged Florida residents to ignore public health advice and reject mRNA booster shots that he falsely claimed had not been tested on humans.

Several of his other positions on public health issues, such as promoting the removal of fluoride from drinking water and urging parents to reject measles vaccines for their children, have been called “dangerous” and a “disservice to Florida residents”.

His “slavery” comment, made with DeSantis at his side, was notable. The governor drew allegations of racism in 2023 when the state introduced a new education curriculum teaching that the “full truth” of America's history with slavery is that it was beneficial to those enslaved.

Florida's department of health currently has strict requirements for immunizations that must be given during childhood, which are posted to its website. No child can be enrolled in a Florida public school unless they have received a series of shots against a number of diseases.

Routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13m deaths among children born in the US between 1994 and 2023, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report published last year.

It estimated that the vaccine program nationally resulted in direct savings of $540bn and societal savings of $2.7tn.

Ladapo gave no details or timeline for the proposed repeal, but said his department would work with lawmakers and the DeSantis administration to make it happen.

“I love our lawmakers. They're going to have to make decisions … People are going to have to make a decision,” he said. “People are going to have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that the moral side is so simple.”

Ladapo also said that “it'll be wonderful for Florida to be the first state to do it”.

Florida's plan drew praise from Robert W Malone, a conservative physician and prominent anti-vaxxer appointed by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to his new advisory committee on immunization practices that replaced the independent panel he fired.

“Go Joe!” Malone said in a post to X, shortly after another tweet in which he said he spoke to Ladapo on Tuesday and called him “a measured scientist – who is on fire to change the system for the better”.

Others were not so convinced. Anna Eskamani, a Democratic Florida state representative, called the move “a public health disaster in the making”.

“Ending vaccine mandates is reckless and dangerous. It will drive down immunization rates and open the door to outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors and vulnerable Floridians at risk,” she said in a statement.

David Jolly, a former Republican congressman for Florida who is running as a Democrat to succeed DeSantis as governor when he is termed out in 2027, posted to X that he believed Ladapo's tenure could be limited.

“The next Governor gets to fire this guy. I know I would. Hopefully Byron Donalds or Paul Renner would do the same,” he wrote, referring to two high-profile Florida Republicans who have announced their candidacies.

“Since the 1980s, all states had school vaccines mandates. If Florida abolishes [its mandate], it would be the first in recent times to do so,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, who specializes in vaccines law and policy.

But she pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a law introduced yet, which is a big if. She noted that Idaho attempted to end school mandates in April, but ended up carving out exceptions for existing mandates – effectively rendering that part of the law moot – after pushback from advocates.

“I would also add that one reason all states adopted them is that evidence showed school mandates reduce and prevent outbreaks. If Florida does this, it's creating an unfortunate natural experiment with its children as guinea pigs,” Reiss said. “Children deserve better.”

The Florida department of health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the program should wind down, speaking at a press conference in Mississauga, Ont. on Wednesday morning.Sammy Kogan/The Canadian Press

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the federal government to shut down the Temporary Foreign Worker program and immediately end the issuance of new permits, linking it to the rising youth unemployment rate, and saying it is flooding the job market with cheap labour. 

“Why aren't employers offering jobs to Canadian kids first? Why are they shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage labour?” he told reporters at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Wednesday morning. 

The Conservatives are proposing the creation of a separate, standalone program for “legitimately difficult-to-fill agricultural labour,” and to wind down the program gradually in regions with low unemployment rates. 

“We know why a foreign-owned mega-chain wants to be greedy – it's good for their corporate profits – but our immigration system doesn't exist to pad their bottom line,” Mr. Poilievre said. “That's why the government should immediately stop issuing new TFW permits, and end this wage-suppressing, opportunity-stealing program.”

The TFW program has been dogged in controversy for decades, largely due to allegations of worker abuse by employers. But it is a key immigration stream in Canada, and heavily used by agricultural employers and large retail and restaurant chains to fill a shortage of domestic labour. The government determines if employers are eligible to hire foreign labour by evaluating Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) applications – a document employers fill in to justify why they are unable to find local workers for the job. 

During the pandemic, the government expanded access to the program, resulting in a soaring number of LMIA approvals between 2022 and 2024. Ottawa has since tightened eligibility criteria in line with a policy goal of reducing the overall number of temporary residents in the country. 

Temporary foreign workers may get more flexibility to move jobs as Ottawa eyes changes to program

Federal government data shows that in the first half of 2025, 105,195 work permits were issued to workers entering Canada through the TFW program. By contrast, in 2024, there were more than 191,000 permits issued, and in 2023 there were approximately 183,000 permits issued. The Liberal government had targeted capping the number of TFW entries at 82,000 in 2025. 

In a statement to the Globe, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said that of the 105,195 permits, 33,722 were for new workers entering Canada, roughly 40 per cent of the total volume expected. 

The Liberal government has targeted capping the number of new TFW entries at 82,000 in 2025. 

At the Liberal Party's cabinet retreat in Toronto, Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized that the TFW program had a role to play in the economy. He said the government remains committed to reducing the proportion of temporary residents relative to the population, but noted that businesses are keen to have access to temporary foreign workers. 

“When I talk to businesses around the country, particularly in Quebec but elsewhere in the country, their number one issue is tariffs, and their number two issue is access to temporary foreign workers,” Mr. Carney said.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby group, condemned Mr. Poilievre's proposal to scrap the program, saying that there were “zero” employers of entry-level workers who use the program for cheap labour. 

“We have many parts of Canada – particularly in rural and remote communities – with very few available entry-level workers for jobs on which local people depend,” said Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, in a post on X.

Mr. Poilievre's criticism of the program as exploitative has been voiced for years by international human rights organizations and migrants rights groups. In particular, these groups disapprove of the closed work permit aspect of the program, which ties a worker's ability to work in Canada to a single employer. This design, critics say, increases a worker's dependence on the employer because they are unable to move jobs easily in instances of exploitation. 

In November of 2024, a parliamentary committee on citizenship and immigration recommended that Ottawa get rid of the closed work permit system entirely, and introduce regional or sector-specific work permits that would define sectors broadly, and provide workers with access to a wide range of employers. 

Separately, Employment and Social Development Canada – the ministry in charge of the TFW program – is exploring changes to the program that will see the introduction of a new stream-specific work permit for workers in the agricultural and fish processing industries. The work permit, which would be issued for two years, would allow workers to move between employers in the same sector as long as they have a new job offer. 

Syed Hussan, executive director of Migrant Rights Network, told The Globe that shutting down the program and creating a standalone temporary immigration stream for agricultural workers would still leave many temporary foreign workers in the country, because a significant number of TFWs work in agriculture.

In 2024, for example, roughly 78,000 foreign workers worked in agriculture, according to data from Statistics Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the total number of TFWs. 

“The issue is not how many people are here, it is what their rights and conditions are. If Pierre Poilievre really wants to end exploitation, he would create a path to permanent residency for temporary foreign workers who are stuck in a cycle of exploitation,” Mr. Hussan said. 

Mr. Poilievre's attempt to link the youth unemployment rate specifically to the Temporary Foreign Worker program is also debatable. In a recent note, Bank of Montreal chief economist Doug Porter said the rising youth jobless rate is related to the “extreme growth” in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds who have come to Canada as international students. “Unsurprisingly, when the youth population swells, it tends to drive up the youth jobless rate relative to others,” he wrote. 

In a recent interview with The Globe, Mikal Skuterud, a labour economist at the University of Waterloo, said that immigration is not the main driver of higher youth unemployment. Instead, he pointed to weak economic conditions and a sharp reduction in job vacancies that are making it tougher for people to secure employment.

In an exclusive interview, Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson speaks with the Globe about leaving Marvel behind to direct the deeply personal drama, Eleanor the Great

Midway through the 2003 film Lost in Translation, Scarlett Johansson's character, a young newlywed accompanying her photographer husband to Tokyo as he works on a movie's international tour, wanders into a press conference for the film-within-a-film. As the airheaded lead actress of the faux blockbuster, a junky piece of Hollywood nothingness titled Midnight Velocity, yammers on about reincarnation and the joys of “working with Keanu,” Johansson's character lets loose a wry, sad smile, and quickly exits in the hopes of finding a more spiritually fulfilling environment. 

For a few years, it might have been tempting to view that scene as a cruelly prescient peek into the arc of Johansson's own career. No longer the emerging starlet of such small, art-minded fare as Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation or Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, Johansson has become the world's biggest name brand. 

With US$15-billion in box-office sales to her credit, the actress is now history's highest-grossing movie star – and all thanks to such empty-calorie spectacles (Jurassic World Rebirth, eight separate Marvel movies) that are not all that far removed from the likes of Midnight Velocity. Today, there is nothing stopping the 40-year-old Johansson from spending the rest of her life counting cash and reminiscing about working with Keanu.

Yet instead of playing it easy, the actress seems stubbornly determined to use her megawatt fame, and attendant paydays, to keep as much distance between herself and any Midnight Velocity-like fate. For every safe and easily franchisable tentpole that Johansson has headlined over the past decade and a half, the actress has also doubled down on her commitment to keeping more idiosyncratic, less comfortably profitable storytellers (Jonathan Glazer, the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson) in the good books of their bankrollers. 

But next week, at the Toronto International Film Festival, Johansson will showcase her most unexpected – and most thoroughly anti-Midnight Velocity – project yet. In her feature directorial debut, Eleanor the Great, the actress goes behind the camera to tell a tender and unpredictable story about the travails of a 94-year-old woman who very likely hasn't seen a Marvel movie in her entire gosh-darn life. Even more daring: Johansson didn't try to find a role in it for herself, instead choosing to focus entirely on the filmmaking. 

“Honestly, it probably would have made financing it so much easier to have my name and face on the poster, but it would have been very, very hard to do both,” the actress says in an interview a few weeks ahead of TIFF. “I look at other actors who also direct, like Bradley Cooper and Robert Redford, and I have so much more respect for that choice. Just the stamina of it. I don't think I can be inside and outside like that at the same time.”

It would have been especially tricky given the duelling inside and outside layers of Eleanor the Great. During its first 20 minutes, the film could be mistaken for a soft-hearted generational comedy as the story traces the move of the nonagenarian title character (Thelma star June Squibb) from South Florida to Manhattan following the death of her best friend and roommate, Bessie (Rita Zohar). 

But once Eleanor mistakenly attends a Holocaust survivors' group at her local Jewish community centre, she falls into a rabbit hole of well-intentioned but damning deception, ultimately misappropriating Bessie's history as a survivor as her own life story. 

The drama that follows is deliberately messy and complex, its characters wrestling with grief, loneliness and, most of all, the lingering stains of history. So, not exactly the kind of box-office-friendly material that Johansson is used to. But for the filmmaker, whose star power helped lift Tory Kamen's screenplay out of the development hell that it had been stuck in for years, Eleanor's story spoke not only to her artistic ambitions, but her own personal history. 

“I grew up with my grandmother, and her mother only spoke Yiddish to her, so then my grandmother understood more Yiddish than she spoke, but she did speak it to us. It was a part of her makeup, her character,” recalls Johansson, who grew up in Manhattan's predominantly Jewish Upper East Side neighbourhood of Yorkville, the same area where Eleanor takes place.

 “There's certainly in that area, there are some remnants of the Ashkenazi community there. It's like all of New York, it's become a melting pot, which is wonderful. But these neighbourhoods that had real specific cultural imprints on them are not there any more.” 

Indeed, Johansson's film has one eye trained on contemporary Manhattan, with the other possessing nostalgic glint for the city's Jewish cultural history, the resulting film at times feeling as if Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters was plunked down at the intersection of Joan Micklin Silver's Crossing Delancey. (The fact that both Delancey and Eleanor have scenes involving deep discussion regarding kosher dills is surely no coincidence.) 

“I watched Crossing Delancey about 100 times growing up, but I love so many New York movies – Moonstruck, Living out Loud – where the city is not quite a character but there's just such specificity to the neighbourhoods and the characters,” Johansson says. “This movie is very much like my version of New York.” 

More than any shared cultural geography, though, Johansson's family tree suggests deep roots in the heart of Kamen's screenplay. While Johansson's maternal great-grandfather, Saul Szlamberg, had moved to the United States before the start of the Second World War, his brother and two nieces had died in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. 

These losses seem to reverberate deeply for Johansson, who has noted that she rarely cries while reading scripts – with the exception of this project, and Taika Waititi's screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, which also pivoted around the persecution of Jews in the Second World War (a film that earned the star an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress).

Telling Eleanor's story, and what the world today looks like for actual Holocaust survivors, “was definitely some part of” the attraction to the story, says Johansson. “But I also found the theme of forgiveness to be incredibly touching. And certainly Bessie's survivor story is raw and shocking.”

To that end, Johansson and her creative partners sought collaboration with the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation, which Steven Spielberg founded following the production of 1993's Schindler's List to preserve and share Holocaust survivor stories. 

“They helped us craft Bessie's story so that it was plausible and in a respectful way, and they gave us so much information about all the movement of people in that horrible time, like just physically moving and separating families from one another,” Johansson says, noting that she also cast real-life Jewish survivors to play members of Eleanor's support group. 

“It was important to get their input and feel like we were honouring the survivor stories. They were an amazing resource.” 

Any and all support was needed given that – unlike the months, sometimes years of preparation that one Johansson's Marvel movies receives – the director had to get Eleanor the Great up and running in a narrow window of time. That might be a typical challenge for any lower-budget production, but it wasn't especially easy when the star of your film was on the cusp of turning 95 years old.

“June is incredible – she has so much energy and stamina. It never was an issue of her willingness to do the work. Even with some of her mobility issues, she was completely prepared, dedicated, passionate. I never thought to ask, ‘Is June up for making it?'” Johansson says. 

“One time I remarked to her that every single angle or shot, you always have one absolutely perfect take. Usually it's the third or fourth take for people. But for her, it's the first that's fantastic. The second, the third. And she said to me, ‘You know, I've been doing this for such a long time that if I hadn't figured this out by now, I'm in the wrong job.'” 

However Eleanor the Great's TIFF launch goes next week – its world premiere at Cannes this past spring was one of the film festival's most sought-after tickets, with a horde of hopeful, soggy moviegoers being turned away from the door during one rainy afternoon – it feels clear that Johansson won't be asking herself whether she's pursued the wrong line of work. 

Unless her next inevitable sequel is titled something like Jurassic World: Midnight Velocity. Keanu, don't get any smart ideas here. 

Eleanor the Great premieres at TIFF on Sept. 8, with additional screenings Sept. 9 and 12. It opens across Canada Sept. 26.

It's tempting to include Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, another film in which Johansson is more supporting than lead, but her haunting, auditory-only performance in Spike Jonze's eerie AI romantic drama is its own sort of spectral presence, lost in a world not of its making.

One of French filmmaker Luc Besson's last great gifts to cinema before he became semi-cancelled is this truly unpredictable riff on Johansson's Black Widow work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

3. Marriage Story (2019)

More than the millions of memes it inspired, Johansson's standout scene with Adam Driver in which their unhappy couple trade insults contains so many raw truths that it feels like the cinematic equivalent of an open scab. Given that she earned a best actress Oscar nomination for the role, this is of course a compliment.

2. Under the Skin (2013)

Only an outsider director such as Jonathan Glazer could fully grasp and then weaponize Johansson's magazine-cover-ready beauty in such a terrifying, entrancing manner.

We might never know what Bill Murray's movie star Bob whispers to Johansson's deeply unhappy college grad Charlotte in the final moments of Coppola's now-certified classic. But that won't stop us from thinking about just how the two got to such a poignant point, and why its emotional potency still lingers today.

Letter by senior Democrats asks state department to reveal details behind financing of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation

Senior Democratic senators have called on the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, to reveal details behind the financing and oversight of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) amid concerns over rising death tolls near aid sites, the group's apparent coordination with the Israeli army and its reported use of private military contractors linked to intelligence operations.

The letter, co-signed by senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Welch, accuses the state department of an “inability to answer basic questions about GHF in a timely manner” and said that the department's “overriding of internal protocol and staff warnings is particularly concerning given it is unlikely to be able to conduct basic oversight of the funds it provided to GHF”.

The letter, which was addressed to Rubio, Huckabee and Russell Vought, the powerful director of the office of management and budget and current administrator for the US Agency for International Development, was delivered to the state department over the weekend and shared exclusively with the Guardian.

“The state department should immediately cease funding GHF and transfer or restore funding to experienced aid organizations given the strong and growing evidence that GHF is failing to accomplish its humanitarian mission,” they wrote.

Trump has said that the US disbursed $60m in food aid to Gaza, while the state department has only publicly acknowledged approval for a $30m grant for the GHF in June. The state department has not published details of its grant to the GHF, an omission that the senators said violates US law. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have died near GHF sites since its operations began in May, the UN reported in mid-August.

The new concerns come as the agency was mentioned in a draft plan for a “Gaza riviera” that critics have said would provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory's population and was reportedly developed by those close to the GHF. The 38-page prospectus, which has not been formally adopted as US policy, nonetheless would be one way to fulfill Donald Trump's calls for a “takeover” of the Gaza Strip.

The plan, which was first revealed by the Washington Post, also relied on consultants from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG has said that work was not approved and that it had fired two senior partners who led the financial modeling for the plan).

In their letter, the Democratic senators also attacked the GHF for its connections to the Israeli government and the use of private military contractors that have reportedly conducted intelligence operations. “The provision of humanitarian aid to starving populations should not be a pretext for military intelligence operations,” they wrote.

In the letter, the senators also demanded copies of award documents, internal reviews, export licenses for military services and other vetting that is legally required for GHF operations but have not yet been made public.

The Guardian has approached the state department and the GHF for comment.

            We don't know why the Trump administration suddenly reversed itself this summer on its promises to release extensive new documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


            What we do know is that the administration has responded to a bipartisan outcry over its handling of the matter by repeatedly doing things that might seem on paper like significant steps toward transparency, but have proven to be far less than meets the eye. Many of them point to what a judge recently suggested was the “illusion” of transparency.
    


            The situation appears to be coming to a head. On Wednesday came an emotional press conference featuring Epstein victims pleading with Congress to agree to an effort led by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, which the Trump administration opposes, to force the Justice Department to release the documents.
    


            “To be clear: The only motive for opposing this bill would be to conceal wrongdoing,” Epstein accuser Anouska de Georgiou said.
    


            The scene followed yet more evidence of the administration's reluctance to cede to those demands.
    


            That began on Tuesday with the official launch of Massie's effort, called a discharge petition, to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, which Speaker Mike Johnson also opposes.
    


            As the administration faced the prospect that a small number of House Republicans could join with Democrats to force the issue, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee suddenly released an initial tranche of 33,000 pages of Epstein documents it had subpoenaed from the Justice Department. It seemed like an effort to mollify the Republicans who might support Massie's measure, which is being co-led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna.
    


            But like the binders of Epstein documents the White House gave right-wing influencers earlier this year, the documents were overwhelmingly old news. House Oversight Democrats and Massie estimated that 97% of the documents had already been released, while the rest were heavily redacted. No media outlet has found anything revealing in them.
    


            Massie claimed it amounted to about 1% of what the Justice Department has.
    


            “They've given us the sleeves off their vest,” the Kentucky Republican said.
    


            The White House adopted a threatening posture, distributing a statement to multiple media outlets labeling any Republican support for Massie's discharge petition a “hostile act.”
    


            “Helping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration,” a White House official said.
    


            But if the administration is okay with full disclosure on Epstein – as it has insisted it is – why would it oppose Massie's effort?
    


            The most oft-stated reason is the need to shield Epstein's victims. But Massie's measure includes a provision on that. It allows the DOJ to redact or withhold documents that “contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files and similar files,” if those files would violate their personal privacy. What's more, as of Wednesday morning, many Epstein victims have now publicly endorsed Massie's measure.
    


            You could be forgiven for thinking the Trump administration just doesn't want to give up control over this process. Better to filter the documents through a GOP-controlled committee than to have your hand forced by the discharge petition.
    


            (That discharge petition currently has the support of four House Republicans. If all Democrats support it, it would need six Republicans to get to the required 218 votes.)
    


            The other olive branch Johnson has offered critics is a vote this week essentially affirming the House Oversight Committee's investigation of the Epstein matter.
    


            But the effort is only symbolic. Massie dismissed it as an effort to “provide political cover” to Republicans who don't back his discharge petition but are still feeling pressure from their base.
    


            And there's been plenty other mirages of transparency.
    


            The administration's first two big moves to quell the Epstein furor in July were to interview Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and to push for the release of grand jury materials in the case.
    


            But its handling of Maxwell's interview with the deputy attorney general was a mess. The transcripts that were ultimately released told us next to nothing. And predictably, Maxwell seemed more interested in protecting her own interests – including in ongoing appeals – than blowing the whistle on anybody who might have been involved in her and Epstein's crimes. She wouldn't even admit to knowledge of Epstein's crimes, which she was convicted of participating in.
    


            The grand jury effort was even more telling.
    


            Even when the administration began this push, experts were skeptical it would lead to much. And they were right.
    


            We soon learned that the grand jury materials generally contained little new information. It was often law enforcement personnel recounting allegations secondhand – claims that were later aired publicly in court by the actual witnesses.
    


            By the end, multiple judges rejected these efforts. And two of them explicitly said the administration appeared to be pulling the wool over people's eyes.
    


            US District Judge Paul Engelmayer said the public “might conclude” the administration's real purpose “was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.”
    


            A week later, another judge also used the d-word.
    


            US District Judge Richard Berman said that the administration's move “appears to be a ‘diversion' from the breath and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession.”
    


            Crucially, Berman repeatedly noted that, to the extent the administration wanted to inform the public about such matters, it had much better and more fulsome information it could provide.
    


            “The Government's complete information trove would better inform the public about the Epstein case,” Berman wrote. He called the administration “a logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein files.”
    


            And that's the rub here. If the administration wants to get this stuff out, it can. But it has repeatedly had to be dragged into taking steps toward disclosure that have looked more like messaging exercises than anything else.
    


            The increasing question for House Republicans is whether they're mollified by all of these apparent diversions and symbolic moves – or if they see them as efforts by an administration to avoid full disclosure.
    


            The early indications Tuesday were that at least some Republicans who have flirted with signing Massie's discharge petition were at least temporarily satisfied, despite the lack of new disclosures.
    


            The pull of partisanship is strong, as are threats of blowback from Trump. But the administration's mishandling of all this makes it hard to believe its goal is the same as those Republicans and influencers who have pushed for years for more information on Epstein.

            New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker announced his engagement to girlfriend Alexis Lewis this week, telling reporters he'd surprised her with a proposal in Hawaii.
    


            Booker, 56, sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 — and his record-setting, 25-hour Senate speech warning that the “country is in crisis” earlier this year sparked talk of another potential presidential run in 2028.
    


            Booker told reporters Tuesday that he and Lewis were in Kauai, Hawaii, and that one of his friends told Lewis that they wanted to surprise Booker with a “traditional Hawaiian greeting.”
    


            “She thought we were going down just to have leis put over us. And we walked out and there was a hula dancer, a Hawaiian dancer, a Polynesian dancer, and a guy with a ukulele. And then after their second song, other performers came up and sang a song that's really meaningful to her, that she told me since one of our early dates, that she wants at her wedding,” he said.
    


            “And she was so overjoyed, dancing and singing along with the singers. And then she runs over to them and says, ‘Oh my god, this is the song that I wanted to be played at my wedding. Thank you so much.' And then I interrupt her and said, ‘Honey, this is actually the song being performed at your engagement.'”
    


            Booker added, “She said that that's when she blacked out. I had to show her pictures of me on my knees to tell her I got on a knee.”

            Lewis is a vice president of investments at Brasa Capital Management, a real estate investment firm, according to the company's website. She previously worked as an economic development aide in the Los Angeles mayor's office.
    


            Booker has never been married, and his personal life has long been the subject of scrutiny. During his first Senate run in 2013, the then-Newark mayor responded to his opponent's insinuations that he might be gay by saying he had affirmed his sexual orientation many times, but also arguing that it did not matter.
    


            “The question really should not be whether I'm gay or straight, the question should be why the heck are you asking the question in the first place? It doesn't make a whit of difference at what kind of senator I'm going to be or not,” Booker said in a 2013 interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes.
    


            During his run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Booker's relationship with actress Rosario Dawson was in the news. The two split several years later, and social media commenters responded to the news of his engagement Tuesday by comparing Lewis' looks with Dawson.
    


            “Love Love! Congratulations you two!” Dawson commented on Booker's engagement announcement on Instagram.
    


            Booker could soon be in the spotlight in Washington, where he vowed to “stand and fight” during this month's upcoming budget battle, as the clock ticks down toward a government shutdown.
    


            “I can't speak to other senators' consideration, but I'm going to say it as loud as I can, as often as I can, this is a time to stand and fight. This is a time to draw a line. We should — I am not giving my vote away to Donald Trump on a budget that's going to hurt people,” Booker said.
    


            “I'm telling folks, this is a crossroads,” he said. “I am standing and fighting against any kind of budget proposal that's going to hurt Americans or hurt people in New Jersey. I believe there comes a time when everyone should stand up and fight for what's right, and that's what I intend to do.”

Memorials for those who died in the mass shooting along the roadside by Schemengees Bar & Grille, Oct. 30, 2023.Matt York/The Associated Press

A group of 100 survivors and families of victims killed in the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine sued the U.S. government over claims it failed to respond to repeated warning signs that the shooter, an Army reservist, could become violent, according to a lawyer for the group. 

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, on Wednesday, claims the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Defense, and a New York Army hospital were negligent in their handling of Army Reserve Sergeant Robert Card, who had exhibited signs of severe mental illness for more than a year before the shooting and made explicit threats to carry out mass violence.

The Oct. 25, 2023, shooting killed 18 people and wounded 13 at a bowling alley and a restaurant. Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound two days later.

Maine mass shooter had numerous run-ins with authorities, showed warning signs long before shooting

Prompted by mass shooting, 72-hour wait period and other new gun laws go into effect in Maine

The lawsuit claims that by March, 2023, the U.S. Army knew that Card, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and a West Point firearm and grenade instructor, was paranoid, delusional, violent and had access to firearms. But the Army did not remove Card's guns, dissuaded law enforcement from taking the guns, and dismissed Card's threats to “shoot up” a Maine Army Reserve centre in the month before the massacre, the victims say in the lawsuit.

In a statement, Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro said the Army does not comment on pending litigation. A Department of Defense spokesperson also declined to comment on pending litigation, and representatives for Tricare, the military's health care agency, did not respond to a request for comment.

Cynthia Young, whose husband William and fourteen-year-old son, Aaron, were both killed at the bowling alley, is among those suing.

In a statement, she said “we trusted those in power to protect our loved ones, and their inaction cost us everything.”

The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for pain and suffering, medical and funeral expenses, emotional distress and more.

The lawsuit claims Army researchers have recognized a connection between service members exposed to repeated explosions, like Card, and increased rates of anxiety, paranoid thinking and aggressive behaviour.

Citing other mass shootings committed by veterans and service members, the lawsuit claims the U.S. Army has developed a detailed procedure for dealing with service members whose mental health may make them a threat to themselves or others, but did not follow it in Card's case.

In the months before the Lewiston shooting, members of his unit warned their leadership that Card was making threats about mass shootings and had a collection of firearms. Card was sent to Keller Army Community Hospital in West Point, New York for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, where providers found that he had homicidal ideation and was a threat to others.

Despite the findings, Card was discharged, and the U.S. Army did not follow up with him to ensure he was following a treatment plan and was receiving the help he needed, the lawsuit claims.

            Tens of millions of years ago, an apex predator resembling a giant crocodile stalked the humid freshwater floodplains of southern Patagonia. Measuring up to 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) long and weighing about 550 pounds (250 kilograms), it ate whatever it could catch. Including some dinosaurs.
    


            Near the southern tip of South America, in Argentina, scientists recently discovered a skeleton — including the skull and jaws — of this hypercarnivore, an animal whose diet is at least 70%      meat. They named it Kostensuchus atrox and described the reptile as a new species of peirosaurid crocodyliform, an ancient relative of modern alligators and crocodiles. This is the first crocodyliform found in Argentina's Chorrillo Formation, which dates to about 70 million years ago, toward the end of the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago); it is the most complete fossil ever found for this group.
    


            The second-biggest extinct predator found in the region to date, K. atrox is also one of the largest of this type of crocodyliform, researchers reported on August 27 in the journal PLOS One.
    


            “It is equivalent to a lion among felids,” the study's lead author, Dr. Fernando Novas, a paleontologist with the Félix de Azara Natural History Foundation at Maimónides University in Buenos Aires, said in an email.
    


An ancient ‘terror crocodile' became a dinosaur-eating giant. Scientists say they now know why



            Other fossils previously found in the Chorrillo Formation indicate that K. atrox lived in a diverse habitat, home to dinosaurs, other reptiles, amphibians and even a Cretaceous ancestor of the modern platypus. With its giant head, powerful jaws and large teeth, K. atrox could have easily hunted plant-eating dinosaurs and defended its kills against carnivorous theropod dinosaurs, making crocodyliforms an important part of terrestrial ecosystems, according to Novas.
    


            Discovering K. atrox so far to the south greatly expands the known range of this ancient and fearsome reptile group, suggesting that peirosaurid crocodyliforms were “not only restricted to warm and dry regions in Brazil and northern Patagonia, but also to temperate environments,” Novas said.
    


            Novas was among the team of paleontologists who found the K. atrox skeleton in March 2020 while excavating the fossil of a large plant-eating dinosaur, and they were immediately struck by its superb preservation. The skeleton was nearly complete, missing only the tail and some limb bones, and the skull was in such good condition that its teeth still bore a coating of enamel, Novas said.
    


            The teeth were pointed with serrated edges that would have been used for “puncturing and slicing through the flesh of sizable prey,” the study authors reported. Though the animal's posture was more upright than that of modern crocs, the position of the forelimbs suggest           it may have been semiaquatic.
    


            “It is a really interesting animal, partially in that it looks so similar to many other croc relatives,” said paleontologist Dr. Keegan Melstrom, an assistant professor at the University of Central Oklahoma who was not involved in the new research. Such similarities are examples of convergent evolution, when species that are not closely related evolve to have similar traits.
    


            “This may seem counterintuitive, but crocs from this time often look different and have different ecologies from modern crocs,” Melstrom told CNN in an email.
    


            “What this fossil shows is different groups of crocodile relatives repeatedly and independently evolving a modern croc-like look and lifestyle,” Melstrom said. “They (crocodyliforms) keep going from terrestrial carnivores to semiaquatic predators and evolving similar shapes while doing it. The authors do a lovely job of telling this story.”
    


I tried to find out if the dinosaur tooth I bought online was real. It didn't go as expected



            Still, K. atrox differs from modern crocodilians in some important ways. Its nostrils were forward-facing, and its eyes were positioned on the sides of the skull. By comparison, the eyes and nostrils in modern crocodiles sit higher on the skull, enabling them to lie in wait for prey while keeping most of the body underwater.
    


            “The anatomical evidence indicates that Kostensuchus searched for prey on land, where medium-sized herbivore dinosaurs were present,” Novas said.
    


            Being a massive meat eater helped K. atrox dominate its floodplain habitat, but it also may have been a factor in what doomed these ancient crocs. While K. atrox and other large crocodyliforms did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, other croc groups did, perhaps in part due to their smaller size and more varied diets, said Melstrom, who studies how crocodilians' eating habits shaped their evolution.
    


            “I hypothesized earlier this year that being a hypercarnivore made a group more likely to die off in a mass extinction than a smaller species,” he said, “and that appears to happen here.”
    


            Next, to learn more about the animal's diet, and where it lived and hunted, scientists want to recover isotope information from the fossil's teeth. Imaging the internal structure of its bone tissue could reveal more about its growth rate and age. And abnormalities in the vertebrae also “need to be investigated with participation of veterinary pathologists,” Novas said, adding that the “skeleton of Kostensuchus may reveal more secrets in the years to come!”

Letter says Kennedy installed ideologues, endangered US health and ignored pleas as resignations mounted at CDC

US politics live – latest updates

A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human Services department (HHS) has demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health secretary's attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans.

The hard-hitting letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of the agency's chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.

It comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote in a New York Times guest essay that Kennedy's leadership, and ousting of the CDC director, Susan Monarez, months after he appointed her, was “unacceptable” and “unlike anything we have ever seen”.

The letter posted on Wednesday by a group calling itself Save HHS assails Kennedy for “endangering the nation's health by spreading inaccurate health information”.

It cites the resignations of other leading health officials, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Daniel Jernigan, the agency's director for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; and Debra Houry, its chief medical officer.

It also offers sharp criticism of Kennedy's installation of “political ideologues who pose as scientific experts” in leading roles, including on a key vaccine advisory panel. Several members have touted discredited theories, such as the long-disproven link between vaccines and autism.

Earlier this week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) severely restricted who could get updated Covid-19 vaccines, with Kennedy posting to social media that coronavirus “mandates” from the Biden administration were rescinded and that vaccines would be available only to those at highest risk.

“Our oath requires us to speak out when the constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,” the letter, co-signed by six partner organizations in the medical field, said.

“We warn the president, Congress and the public that Secretary Kennedy's actions are compromising the health of this nation, and we demand Secretary Kennedy's resignation.”

It calls for Trump to appoint a new health secretary “whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science”.

Trump this week expressed his displeasure at the chaos engulfing the CDC, acknowledging in a social media post that the agency was being “ripped apart” by the vaccines controversy. But he claimed drug manufacturers were to blame for allegedly not revealing publicly “the success or failure” of Covid vaccines.

The Trump administration also previously sided with Kennedy over Monarez's firing, which prompted bipartisan pushback and a walkout of dozens of CDC staff last month. Monarez, a long-serving government expert on infectious diseases, was confirmed in July, but fired because she was “not aligned with the president's agenda”, a White House statement said.

The 1,040 former and current HHS employees who signed Wednesday's letter said they were writing again because Kennedy ignored their earlier communication. A statement issued by HHS accused the group of “an attempt to politicize a tragedy” by claiming Kennedy's vaccine rhetoric played a role in an attack on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on 8 August in which a police officer was killed.

In its new letter, the group said that the HHS workforce is non-partisan, “implementing science-based policies developed under both Republican and Democratic administrations”.

It said: “We believe health policy should be based on strong, evidence-based principles rather than partisan politics. But under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS policies are placing the health of all Americans at risk, regardless of their politics.”

In a statement, the HHS communications director, Andrew Nixon, said: “Secretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it as the world's most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes.

“From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door – and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same. That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

The HHS employees signed their letter “in our own personal capacities, on our personal time, and without the use of government equipment”. It said “countless others” across HHS shared their concerns but “chose not to sign out of well-founded fear of retaliation and threats to personal safety”.

Up to 30 workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were placed on leave last week after they publicly signed a letter of dissent over Trump's dismantling of the agency and fears it would lead to a disaster like Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

PARIS, September 3. /TASS/. French President Emmanuel Macron's approval rating has fallen to its lowest point since his election in 2017, according to the results of a poll by the sociological service Verian for Le Figaro Magazine.

The poll reveals that 15% of French respondents approve of the job Macron is doing in the capacity of the head of state. Eighty percent of the polled respondents do not trust him, and another 5% of those surveyed found it difficult to answer.

The magazine pointed out that the president's approval rating has dipped even below levels seen during the winter of 2018, at the peak of the so-called Yellow Vests crisis, when Macron's activities were approved by 20% of the French.

As for the level of confidence in French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, it has dropped to 14%, while 82% opposed his policies. Another 4% declined to express their opinion on this issue.

The survey was conducted via an online questionnaire involving 1,000 people over the age of 18.

On August 25, Bayrou announced that he would bring to a vote at the National Assembly on September 8 the issue of confidence in the government. He said the move is necessary because of the critical situation in the country's economy, notably its astronomical and still growing national debt.

According to him, "France's public debt is increasing by 12 million euros every hour" and has already reached 3.4 trillion euros. Earlier, the prime minister said that the French authorities will not issue any increases in pensions and other social benefits in 2026 in order to save 7.1 billion euros and curtail the growth of the national debt.

TOKYO, September 3. /TASS/. Japan suspects that Russia and China may establish a new world order as it views Beijing's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Victory over Japanese Aggression as a symbol of divisions deepening globally, senior Japanese diplomats told Kyodo.

"China and Russia are seeking to lead a new world order," the Japanese news agency quoted an official at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying. Another high-ranking Japanese diplomat called the parade that was held in Beijing earlier on Wednesday "a symbol of global divisions" amid world instability caused by the policy course pursued by the administration of US President Donald Trump and its trade tariffs.

However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry highlighted the absence of the South Korean president from festivities in Beijing, even though he attended similar events a decade ago. Meanwhile, Japan's MFA described as unexpected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to China, since Tokyo believed that a rift was widening between Beijing and Pyongyang over the latter's rapprochement with Moscow in recent years. Also, the Japanese MFA stressed it would monitor how the situation develops and how it may impact the international community.

A military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War was held today on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Alongside Xi Jinping, Putin and Kim Jong Un, the heads of state and government from 24 other countries attended the event.

“There won't be a war, but the struggle for peace will be so intense that not a stone will be left standing.”

This old Soviet joke, born in the 1980s, captured the absurdity of that final Cold War decade: endless ideological cannon fire, nuclear arsenals on hair-trigger alert, and proxy wars fought on the margins. Between détente in the early 1970s and perestroika in the late 1980s, the world lived in a state of permanent tension – half-theater, half-tragedy.

The Soviet leadership was old and exhausted, barely able to maintain the status quo. Across the ocean, the White House was run by a former actor, blunt and self-confident, with a taste for gallows humor. When Ronald Reagan quipped during a sound check in 1984 that he had “signed legislation outlawing Russia forever” and that “bombing begins in five minutes,” the off-air joke was truer to the spirit of the times than any prepared speech.

The official Soviet slogan was “the struggle for peace.” In Russian, it carried a deliberate ambiguity – both a promise to preserve peace and an assertion of global control. By the 1980s it had lost all meaning, becoming a cliché mouthed without conviction. Yet history has a way of circling back. Today, the “struggle for peace” has returned – and this time the stakes are even greater.

By the late 1980s, both superpowers were tired. The USSR was struggling to carry the burden; the US, shaken by the crises of the 1970s, was looking for renewal. Leadership changes in Moscow – above all, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise – triggered the most dramatic shift in world affairs since 1945.

Between Geneva in 1985 and Malta in 1989, Reagan and Gorbachev held summit after summit. Their aim was to end confrontation and build a “new world order.” In reality, Washington and Moscow understood that phrase very differently. The Soviet Union's growing internal weakness tilted the balance of power, leaving the United States and its allies to design the order in their own image. The result was the liberal international system that has dominated ever since. 

That struggle for peace was, in Western terms, a success: the military threat receded, the Cold War ended, and the United States emerged as global hegemon.



Four decades later, the cycle has turned. The Alaska meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in August 2025 carried faint echoes of Reagan and Gorbachev's first encounters. Then, as now, two leaders with little mutual understanding recognized the need to keep talking. Then, as now, the personal factor mattered – the chemistry between two men who respected each other's strength.

But the differences outweigh the parallels. Reagan and Gorbachev were unwitting midwives of the liberal order. Trump and Putin are its gravediggers. Where the earlier summits opened the Cold War's endgame, today's dialogue marks the close of the post-Cold War era.

The resemblance lies only in timing: both moments represent turns of the historical spiral. The 1980s saw exhaustion on both sides. Now it is the United States, not Russia, that shows fatigue with a world order it once dominated. The demand for change comes above all from within America itself, just as it came from Soviet society in the 1980s.



Trump consciously borrows Reagan's slogan of “peace through strength.” In English it is straightforward; in Russian the phrase can also mean “peace maintained reluctantly, against one's will.” Both shades of meaning suit Trump. He makes no secret of his obsession with winning the Nobel Peace Prize, a vanity project that nevertheless reflects a real instinct: his method of diplomacy is raw pressure, even threats, until a deal is struck.

Reagan's legacy was to put America on the neoliberal path and to preside over the Cold War's end, unintentionally becoming the father of globalization. Trump's ambition is to roll globalization back and replace it with what he sees as a stronger America – not isolationist, but a magnet pulling in advantage from all directions. To achieve that, he too needs a world order – different from Reagan's, but just as central to his sense of national interest.

Putin's outlook is the mirror opposite. Where Trump sees America first, Putin sees the necessity of reshaping the global order itself – of ending the period of US dominance and forcing a multipolar settlement. To him, the issue of world order is not cosmetic but existential.



What stands out in 2025 is the return of the Moscow-Washington axis as the world's nerve center. This was not supposed to happen. For years, analysts proclaimed that China would replace both as the defining rival. And Beijing is indeed central. Yet the dialogue between Trump and Putin, however fraught, once again is setting the tone of global politics.

The pace is quicker than 40 years ago. The war is not cold but hot, and there are no long pauses between meetings. The process begun in Alaska will move faster than the one that began in Geneva.

If it continues, the outcome will be the reverse. Reagan closed the Cold War on Washington's terms, crowning America as sole superpower. Trump and Putin are bringing that period to an end. The unipolar era is finished, even if its defenders in Brussels or Washington cannot yet admit it.



The irony is that both cycles – the 1980s and today – were framed as struggles for peace. In the first, peace meant ending confrontation and disarming rivalry. In the second, peace means preventing one power from dictating terms to all others.

The military threat today is at least as grave as in the 1980s, perhaps greater. But the real battle is for the shape of the order itself. The fight for peace, once again, risks leaving no stone standing.

The Cold War ended with Reagan's victory and Gorbachev's surrender. This time there will be no surrender, only a reshaping of the stage. The United States is still strong, but it is no longer willing or able to bear the costs of global hegemony. Other powers – Russia, China, and others – are strong enough to insist on their place.

The struggle for peace is back, and like its predecessor it will define an era. But this time the script is different: it will not end with one side dictating terms, but with a new balance hammered out by force and necessity.

Ukraine's parliament passed in the first reading on Sept. 3 a draft law to legalize the country's virtual assets market and set out rules for taxation, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said.

Ukraine has one of the world's highest rates of cryptocurrency ownership, with around 16% of the population holding crypto assets before Russia's full-scale invasion, comparable to the U.S.

Despite its popularity, the market remains largely unregulated, with billions of dollars in annual transactions going untaxed.

The bill defines virtual assets as digital property that exists through blockchain technology. The assets would not be recognized as money or used as legal tender in Ukraine, but instead treated as movable property under civil law.

The draft sets a general taxation rate of 18% income tax and 5% military tax on transactions involving virtual assets. In the first year after the law comes into effect, withdrawals converted into traditional currency would be taxed at a preferential 5% rate.

The legislation was passed with the support of 246 lawmakers. Zhelezniak said further amendments will be introduced before the bill's second reading.

As artillery and bombs pound around Gaza's largest city and Israel promises a punishing new offensive, Palestinians in the city are paralyzed with fear – unsure where to go, when to leave and if they will ever return.

Israel has declared Gaza City, in the north of the territory, to be a combat zone while the military moves forward with plans to overtake it in a campaign to push Hamas into submission. Parts of the city are already considered “red zones,” where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.

That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the Israel-Hamas war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighbourhoods and Israeli leaders supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, departing the city now could mean leaving for good. Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, they say, could be deadly.

“The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red colour and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,” said Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians.

“So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.”

Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction – some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly one million the U.N. estimates are in Gaza City – have left their homes in the city as of Monday, most to flee south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that co-ordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.

A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.

Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, said he can hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they “erase the area completely.”

Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighbourhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighbouring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by The Associated Press from early August and early September. The photos show that entire blocks that have been pummelled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.

“It's not something partial like before. It's 100 per cent,” he said. “The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.”

Palestinians say overcrowding in displacement camps across southern Gaza has worsened since the Israeli army last week declared northern Gaza and Gaza City a combat zone and ordered residents to evacuate.

Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.

Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network, left his home in the upscale Rimal neighbourhood in the early days of the war and also returned there with his family in January. He, like Al Kurdi, said his family would likely leave Gaza City if their area receives an evacuation order.

But leaving this time would be different, he said. “Gaza will be levelled and destroyed. Last time, I had my car. There was fuel. Everyone had his income, his money.”

Back then, the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis still stood in southern Gaza.

Now, after months of bombardment, “there is no Rafah. Almost no Khan Younis,” Shawa said.

For others – medical workers, older and sick people – leaving Gaza City is nearly impossible.

“The elders, they're saying we will die here,” Shawa said. “This has pushed the other members of the family to stay, not to leave.”

“My aunt is elderly and can't walk, and my mother also struggles with mobility. We have so many belongings and no way to manage them. It feels unthinkable,” said Norhan Almuzaini, medical program officer in northern Gaza for the group Medical Aid for Palestinians.

Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighbourhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's centre.

Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began – three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.

When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City, she said: “I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometres.”

She paused, her voice breaking into tears.

“Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.”

Those who have left Gaza City over the past few months have found dire conditions elsewhere in Gaza. Their arrival has crowded already overflowing tent camps and sent prices of basic goods up.

Iman El-Naya, from Khan Younis, fled Gaza City three months ago. “The beach is crowded. Everywhere is crowded. There's no hygiene. It's a struggle to get water and food.”

“I go and stand in line for water. Getting bread is a struggle. Everything is even more expensive after the people from the north came here.”

Shorouk Abu Eid, a pregnant woman from Gaza City, was displaced to Khan Younis four months ago. She said the arrival of more people from the north is creating an even more tragic situation.

“There is no privacy, no peace of mind. Places I used to walk to in five or 10 minutes are taking me around an hour now because of the congestion. There's barely 10 centimetres between tents.”

Jamal Abu Reily lamented that the bathrooms are overflowing and that there's so little room for new arrivals.

“How are we going to all fit here? he asked. “Where are they going to stay? In the sea?”

Donald Trump calls clamor over Jeffrey Epstein files a ‘Democrat hoax that never ends' as bipartisan group of lawmakers try to force vote on legislation

Trump can't use Alien Enemies Act, court rules

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna says the House will be compelled to vote on legislation to release the Epstein files if two more Republicans sign on to a petition he has introduced along with Republican congressman Thomas Massie.

“We need just two more signatures to force the release,” Khanna said. So far, they have received the signatures of 212 Democrats and four Republicans: Massie, Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.

Those lawmakers are some of the most conservative in their party, but Khanna praised their support of the discharge petition, which can force a vote on legislation in the House if it is signed by a majority of lawmakers.

“We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue. This is an issue where they both have shown real courage and leadership, and I appreciate them joining us today,” Khanna said of Greene and Massie.

Vice president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance have arrived in Minneapolis, where they will meet with the families of the victims of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting that killed two schoolchildren and injured nearly two dozen people last week.

“They will hold a series of private meetings to convey condolences to the families of those affected by the tragedy,” the White House said in a statement.

Trump's attorneys are asking the US Supreme Court to reverse a $5m sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against him in the civil lawsuit brought by E Jean Carroll, Bloomberg News has reported.

According to a new filing, the president's lawyers are asking the justices to extend the deadline for him to formally ask the court to toss out the verdict.

In 2023, a civil jury trial concluded that Trump had sexually abused Carroll, a former magazine columnist, in the 1990s, before he embarked on his political career, and then defamed her in 2022 when he denied the allegations as a hoax and said that she was “not my type”. Carroll was awarded $5m in damages.

The petition was due on 11 September 11, but Trump's legal team has asked for an extension, until 10 November, Bloomberg wrote.

Here's a look back at what's gone on today so far:

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna said only two more Republican signatures are needed for the success of a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation compelling the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Donald Trump slammed the push for the files' release as a “Democrat hoax that never ends” and mulled deploying federal agents into New Orleans to fight crime.

Republican congressman Thomas Massie criticized how House GOP leaders handled the Epstein issue.

At a separate press conference outside the US Capitol, Epstein survivors detailed abuse they suffered at the disgraced financier's hands.

The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said that the US would carry out more strikes like the one that targeted a suspected drug trafficking boat and killed 11 people on Tuesday off the coast of Venezuela.

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that Donald Trump unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans he alleged were part of a criminal gang.

Donald Trump teased the possibility of deploying federal resources into New Orleans to fight crime.

“We're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks. It'll take us two weeks,” the president said.

New Orleans has a homicide rate that is among the highest in the nation, but lies in a Republican-governed state – unlike Los Angeles and Washington DC, where Trump deployed federal troops earlier this year.

Trump also confirmed that he was still sending federal agents into Chicago, saying: “We could straighten out Chicago”.

Asked at the White House about the push in Congress to release the Epstein files, Donald Trump again accused Democrats of orchestrating the controversy, and attempted to change the subject to his own purported accomplishments.

“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said. Referring to the recent release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, he said: “Nobody's ever satisfied.”

“They're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been president,” Trump said. He went on to claim credit for making Washington DC a “totally safe zone” with “no crime, no murders, no nothing” – though crime, including murders and robberies, have continued since he deployed the national guard and took control of its police department.

Another boast from Trump: “I ended seven wars, nobody's going to talk about it because they're going to talk about the Epstein whatever.” It's unclear which seven he is referring to, though his claims of having quelled recent fighting between Pakistan and India played a part in souring the relationship with New Delhi. He also has notably not ended the war in Ukraine – something he boasted, on the campaign trail, that he could do right after taking office.

The White House has referred to signing the discharge petition to release the Epstein files as a “hostile act”, and discouraged Republicans from supporting it.

Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman who introduced the petition and is one of four lawmakers from his party who signed it, replied:

I don't know if that's precedented in this country to have a president call legislators to say that they're engaged in a hostile act, particularly when the so-called hostile act is trying to get justice for people who've been victims of sex crimes.

He also said that the fact that there was little new in the case documents released yesterday may spur more lawmakers to sign the petition:

What people are waking up and discovering right now is the folks who stayed up all night to go through the 34,000 individual pages have found that they're so redacted as to be useless and that many of them were already available.

A reality check on the discharge petition that could force a vote in the House on legislation to release the Epstein files.

The petition needs two more signatures – which will probably have to come from Republicans – to reach the majority threshold to compel the vote. But even if the petition receives that support and the bill passes the House, the legislation will still need to be approved by the Senate, where Republican majority leader John Thune has given no indication he will put it up for a vote.

Should it pass the Senate, it faces another obstacle: Donald Trump. He's condemned the furor over the Epstein files as a distraction created by the Democrats, and could veto the legislation. That would punt the issue back to Congress, where the bill would need two-thirds majority support to overcome his veto – a tall order.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is among the most outspoken conservatives in Congress, but has made a rare pact with the Democrats by signing the discharge petition that could force a vote on legislation to release the Epstein files.

“This is an issue that doesn't have political boundaries. It's an issue that Republicans and Democrats should never fight about. As a matter of fact, it's such an important issue that it should bring us all together,” she said at the press conference convened by the petition's sponsors outside the Capitol.

“The truth needs to come out, and the government holds the truth. The cases that are sealed hold the truth. Jeffrey Epstein's estate holds the truth. The FBI, the DoJ and the CIA holds the truth. And the truth we are demanding comes out on behalf of these women, but also as a strong message to every innocent child, teenager, woman and man that is being held captive in abuse. This should never happen in America, and it should never be a political issue that divides us.”

Republican congressman Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the Epstein files, criticized how speaker Mike Johnson has handled the issue.

Yesterday, Johnson backed a resolution that will direct the House oversight committee to continue its investigation of the government's handling of the investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“The speaker of the House just offered a fig leaf to my colleagues. They're going to vote on a non-binding resolution today that does absolutely nothing,” Massie said.

He also downplayed the effectiveness of the oversight committee's investigation, which is being led by Republican chair James Comer:

I appreciate the efforts of my colleague James Comer, who's leading the Oversight Committee. They may find some information, but they're allowing the [department of justice (DOJ)] to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them.

If you've looked at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted, and 97% of this is already in the public domain.

Massie said the best way to bring transparency to the case is for lawmakers to sign his discharge petition and allow a vote on his bill to release the files:

I'm calling on my colleagues to be one of the next two who sponsors this discharge petition. I think it's shameful that this has been called a hoax. Hopefully today we can clear that up. This is not a hoax. This is real.

Democratic congressman Ro Khanna says the House will be compelled to vote on legislation to release the Epstein files if two more Republicans sign on to a petition he has introduced along with Republican congressman Thomas Massie.

“We need just two more signatures to force the release,” Khanna said. So far, they have received the signatures of 212 Democrats and four Republicans: Massie, Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.

Those lawmakers are some of the most conservative in their party, but Khanna praised their support of the discharge petition, which can force a vote on legislation in the House if it is signed by a majority of lawmakers.

“We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue. This is an issue where they both have shown real courage and leadership, and I appreciate them joining us today,” Khanna said of Greene and Massie.

The bipartisan press conference from representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna just started.

They'll be providing an update about their petition to get a resolution, urging the release of the Epstein records, on the House floor for a vote.

The area outside the Capitol, known as the House Triangle, is packed with reporters and demonstrators. Signs calling Donald Trump “a pedophile” are raised alongside placards that accuse the Republican party of a cover-up.

The House oversight committee yesterday released about 30,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, but, as the Guardian's Dani Anguiano reports, most of the information in them was already public:

The US House of Representatives oversight committee on Tuesday released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from the department of justice.

The release comes as the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its decision not to release additional files in the case. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges and was alleged to have abused hundreds of girls.

The 33,000 pages included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as what appears to be bodycam footage from police searches and police interviews. The files appear to contain information that is already public knowledge.

The records were posted online as the Trump administration was facing renewed attention on the investigation into Epstein. With Congress back in session this week, Democratic and Republican representatives had planned to hold press conferences to demand greater transparency from the administration in the case.

Donald Trump, a longtime friend of Epstein and part of his rich and powerful social circle, has, in recent weeks, tried to avoid the subject. Earlier this year he sued the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on his relationship with Epstein on a birthday note Trump was alleged to have written to him. The president has called the recent Epstein controversy a hoax.

This “Stand with Survivors” outside the Capitol today rally aims to center those who suffered at the hands of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's separate from the bipartisan press conference by lawmakers calling for the complete release of the Epstein files that is scheduled to begin at 10.30am.

“We are here to say, we see you, we believe you and we will not stop until justice is served,” said Skye Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year after years of speaking out about the abuse she experienced at the hands of Maxwell and Epstein.

“Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her sentence. No leniency, no deals, no special treatment,” he added. “The Epstein documents must be unsealed. Every name, every detail, no more secrets, no more protection for those who preyed on the vulnerable.”

Signs at the rally are dotted among the crowd, many echoing messages of support for survivors: “We love you” and “we believe you”. While others are more pointed, reading “guardians of the pedophiles” under pictures of Donald Trump and Epstein together.

Teresa Helm, who was trafficked and groomed by Ghislaine Maxwell, told the crowd here that change was a foot. “Systems built with a root of corruption, violence and deceit always crumble,” she said. “Now is the time to sift through and get rid of the perpetrators and bad actors.”

Survivors of abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and their advocates are rallying outside the Capitol to push for the release of documents related to the government's investigation of the disgraced financier and alleged sex trafficker.

“Our call to action is crystal clear,” said Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, who called to “release the files” related to the case.

Liz Stein spoke at the rally to describe the abuse she faced by Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell:

I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved people and people genuinely enjoyed being around me, but after meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul. Instead of pursuing my dream of going to law school after graduation, overcoming the terror and the trauma that was inflicted on me by these sex traffickers, overcoming that, became my decades long, full-time career.

The rally came as a bipartisan group of House lawmakers attempt to force a vote on legislation to release files related to the case, over the objections of Donald Trump, who was once friendly with Epstein, and Republican speaker Mike Johnson:

Hundreds of current and former employees of the department of health and human services are calling on secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr to quit, the Guardian's Richard Luscombe reports. Here's why:

A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers of the health and human services department (HHS) has demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health secretary's attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans.

The hard-hitting letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of the agency's chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.

It comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote in a New York Times guest essay that Kennedy's leadership, and ousting of the CDC director, Susan Monarez, months after he appointed her, was “unacceptable” and “unlike anything we have ever seen”.

The letter posted on Wednesday by a group calling itself Save HHS assails Kennedy for “endangering the nation's health by spreading inaccurate health information”.

It cites the resignations of other leading health officials, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC's national center for immunization and respiratory diseases; Daniel Jernigan, the agency's director for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; and Debra Houry, its chief medical officer.

The Democratic vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee Mark Warner said the Trump administration cancelled his visit to a government facility after pressure from far-right activist Laura Loomer.

Warner said he was going to visit the headquarters of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in his home state of Virginia, but the administration disinvited him after Loomer launched “a campaign of baseless attacks” against him and the agency's director, Trey Whitworth.

“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security. Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe,” Warner said in a statement.

“This should concern Republicans as well as Democrats: if routine oversight can be obstructed for political reasons, no member of Congress is immune.”

The Trump administration's deployment of warships towards Venezuela prompted concerns in the country that the United States was planning an invasion. Here's more, from the Guardian's Tom Phillips and Patricia Torres:

As US warships carrying cruise missiles and marines powered towards Venezuela's coastline this week, supporters of the South American country's president, Nicolás Maduro, warned a dastardly imperialist plot for an Iraq-style invasion was afoot.

“No one will lay their hands on this land!” Maduro thundered, calling on patriots to help repel the supposed regime change operation by joining his “Bolivarian militia”.

Donald Trump's allies posted incendiary social media messages, warning the Venezuelan autocrat the end was nigh. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump's former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, proclaimed, urging Maduro to buy “a one-way ticket to Moscow”.

Another Trump supporter, Congressman Carlos Gimenez, celebrated “the largest military presence we have ever had off the coast of Venezuela” and told Maduro to accept “his time is up!”

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that the US will continue to use force against suspected drug traffickers, hours after the military destroyed a boat in the Caribbean that was thought to be carrying drugs from Venezuela.

In an interview with Fox News this morning, Hegseth said:

This is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated Narco terrorist will face the same fate.

The US military said the strike killed 11 drug traffickers, days after the US deployed several warships into the Caribbean on what it said was a mission to stem the flow of narcotics into the United States. Here's more:

 The Battle Against Corruption Is Essential to the War Against Russia

 Daria Kaleniuk and Olena Halushka

Ukrainians know how to make their voices heard—and to make their leaders listen. They will never accept capitulation to Russia, whether in the form of the surrender of Ukrainian land or the abandonment of Ukrainian citizens to Russian occupiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky knows this. It is why he avoided making unacceptable concessions to U.S. President Donald Trump in his latest visit to the White House.

Defending against Russia's unlawful aggression is not the only way that Ukrainians fight for their future. Lately, Ukraine's people have also had to pressure their government in matters of domestic politics. During two whirlwind weeks in July, Zelensky's administration moved to strip two of the country's key anticorruption institutions, the National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), of their independence. On July 21, security services and the office of the prosecutor general conducted searches, all without court warrants, of more than 50 sites linked to NABU investigators, claiming these raids were “an operation to neutralize Russian influence in the agency,” but they presented little evidence of such influence to the public afterward. The next day, parliament adopted a law, which Zelensky immediately signed, granting the country's politically appointed prosecutor general control over all NABU investigations—an authority that had been turned over to the independent SAPO in 2016. In effect, the moves set back Ukraine's anticorruption reforms by a decade.

Ukrainians responded by taking to the streets. They perceived Zelensky's swift attack on these institutions as an assault on the country's anticorruption project and on the EU accession process, in which the formation of NABU and SAPO are important steps. On the same day that legislators voted to empower the prosecutor general, a large crowd of protesters, most of them in their teens and early 20s, gathered near the president's office with handmade signs to demand that Zelensky veto the law. Their message was clear: Ukrainians would not allow backsliding on democratic, transparent governance, even—or especially—amid a brutal war.

Domestic and international pressure grew, and within days, Zelensky submitted a draft bill to parliament reversing the changes. Authority was restored to NABU and SAPO by the end of July. On August 6, after a month of dragging its feet, the government also appointed a director of the Bureau of Economic Security, an agency critical to ensuring a fair postwar reconstruction, and unblocked the selection process for the head of the customs service, which plays an essential role in bringing in government funds.

Protracted war makes Ukrainian democracy vulnerable, but the public's democratic instincts are deeply embedded. The Ukrainian people rally behind Zelensky on the international stage, united in the aim to preserve the country's sovereignty, but the same people are committed to holding his government to account at home. They understand that fighting off corruption is essential to ensuring Ukraine's independent future. In addition to weakening Ukrainian democracy from within, corruption drains the Ukrainian armed forces of resources and presents Russia with ways to meddle in the country's internal politics. Russia cannot conquer Ukraine militarily, so it is placing its hope in an eventual political victory in which a fragmented Ukrainian society cannot resist when future Moscow-aligned politicians attempt to gain power. The Kremlin wants to turn Ukraine into another Georgia, where pro-Russian political actors have largely captured the state and are pushing the country toward autocracy. Only by fortifying its own democratic institutions can Ukraine deny Russia the control it seeks.

Ukrainians have shown themselves capable of doing much of this work themselves, but they also need the help of international partners to strengthen the country's democratic governance. Such reforms block channels for Russian influence and keep Ukraine on the path to integration into the European Union and NATO—memberships that will be Ukraine's only credible security guarantee.

Since the Revolution of Dignity, the 2014 protest movement that forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country, Ukraine has pushed through a series of reforms to improve the rule of law and reduce corruption. The government has not done so for altruistic purposes; instead, it has been spurred on by public demand. Years of polling data show that the fight against corruption has consistently been among Ukrainians' top priorities, and Zelensky's anticorruption pledges played a large part in winning him the presidency in 2019.

The country succeeded in translating public opinion into policy thanks to a combination of internal and external pressures, known as the “sandwich approach.” On one side, Ukrainian civil society relentlessly advocated for reforms and monitored their implementation. On the other, international partners conditioned aid and support for the Ukrainian government on concrete steps toward reform. Together, they empowered reformers within the government to overcome bureaucratic inertia and resistance from entrenched interests to effect meaningful change.

Since 2014, Ukraine built a comprehensive anticorruption infrastructure that few other emerging democracies can match. This included NABU, established in 2015 to investigate high-profile corruption; SAPO, established in 2016 to oversee the work of NABU's investigators and defend its cases in court; and the High Anti-Corruption Court, which became operational in 2019 to hear grand corruption cases. The United States, the United Kingdom, the EU, and EU member states such as Denmark shared best practices, provided technical assistance and training for institutional capacity building, and sent rule-of-law experts to participate in panels that assessed candidates for top posts and submitted shortlists for government approval.

In 2016, the introduction of electronic asset declarations—a system for reporting the incomes and assets of all public officials—bolstered anticorruption efforts. Public procurement processes also moved online, ensuring transparency and access to records. Multiple corruption schemes were shut down in the banking and energy sectors and in state-owned enterprises.



These changes were tectonic. Before 2014, members of parliament, senior government officials, and presidential advisers were beyond the reach of law enforcement agencies. Those agencies were fully controlled by the president, and they used their authority primarily to charge local village council heads with corruption or to go after the president's political enemies. When Yanukovych was ousted, no existing institution had the capacity and will to investigate high-level corruption within his circle.

But after SAPO became fully operational in 2016, Ukraine's anticorruption machinery came to life. Between then and today, 71 members of parliament have been served with corruption-related criminal charges—including legislators belonging to the ruling parties during Zelensky's presidency and that of his predecessor, President Petro Poroshenko. More than 40 judges have been convicted of corruption. Many of them were caught red-handed accepting bribes and sentenced to prison. NABU and SAPO have launched joint investigations with foreign law enforcement, too, giving them new tools to use in the fight against corruption—including the ability to freeze international assets.

Proving their independence and resolve, NABU and SAPO have gone after some of the most powerful individuals in Ukraine, even after the full-scale Russian invasion began. The subjects of their investigations have included the former head of the Supreme Court, Vsevolod Kniazev, who was caught taking a bribe worth $2.7 million; the current head of Ukraine's antitrust agency, Pavlo Kyrylenko, who was charged with illicit enrichment and failure to declare his assets; and oligarchic networks connected to PrivatBank, whose former owners were found by a British court to have stolen nearly $2 billion before the bank was nationalized in 2016.

After the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine's external partners let up on their anticorruption demands, worried about weakening the country during wartime. But Ukrainians themselves never stopped. They successfully pushed for several notable changes over the past few years. The electronic asset declarations system, for example, was shut down for security reasons in the first days of the full-scale war; after a citizens' petition collected almost 84,000 signatures in 24 hours in late 2023, the parliament restored it. Earlier that year, a journalistic investigation that revealed the defense ministry was purchasing food for the army at inflated prices compelled the parliament to pass a law to ensure transparency in nonlethal defense procurements.

Yet the silence of Ukraine's international partners and the new U.S. administration's deprioritization of democracy-building efforts gave the Ukrainian government some cover to roll back reforms at the same time that NABU and SAPO were getting dangerously close to Zelensky's inner circle. Those efforts culminated in June and July, when the anticorruption agencies announced criminal charges against former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, searched the German home of former Deputy Head of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma, and started looking into Zelensky's former business partner and close associate Timur Mindich.



The government seized the opportunity to crack down. In late January, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov replaced the director of the Defense Procurement Agency, the body tasked with buying Ukraine's weapons, contrary to a supervisory board decision, thus undermining the independence of the agency. In the spring, the State Bureau of Investigations, a law enforcement agency, began putting pressure on the High Qualification Commission of Judges, the body that reviews judicial appointments, in an attempt to obstruct the commission's vetting of Ukrainian judges whose professional activities and acquisition of property through illegal means call their independence and integrity into question. And in early July, the government refused to approve the new head of the Bureau of Economic Security, whose mandate includes investigation of economic crimes.

The State Bureau of Investigations also targeted Vitaliy Shabunin, the director of the board of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a nongovernmental organization one of us (Kaleniuk) co-founded that has played an instrumental role in setting up and defending Ukraine's independent anticorruption bodies. On July 11, the bureau conducted abrupt searches—without a court warrant—of the place where Shabunin is currently serving in the military and of his family's home in Kyiv. Authorities seized his and his family's electronic devices, including his children's tablets. Shabunin was charged with allegedly evading military service, even though he had voluntarily enlisted in the military in the early days of the full-scale war and between September 2022 and February 2023 had carried out a commander's order assigning him to work at the National Agency for Corruption Prevention, a government institution. Not coincidentally, the persecution of Shabunin escalated the week before the government went after NABU, ensuring that Ukraine's most prominent watchdog organization would be distracted when authorities stepped in.

But Zelensky's inner circle failed to foresee that thousands of young Ukrainians, not just NGOs, deeply care about good governance, democratic procedures, and independent state institutions. They were willing to take to the streets to make their demands heard. Following the public outcry, EU leaders started issuing statements warning that the new law curtailing NABU's authority would jeopardize Ukraine's EU accession. As a result, the president had no choice but to retreat.

Yet the attacks on NABU and SAPO have not stopped entirely. Staff still face pressure and intimidation. The NABU investigator Ruslan Magamedrasulov, along with his father, was held in pretrial detention on unsubstantiated charges of conspiring to do business with Russia. Parliament is still attempting to curtail independent institutions' powers in less blatant ways, such as by trying to block anticorruption agencies from conducting searches to document the transfer of bribes.

During an August 1 press conference with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin disparaged Ukraine's anticorruption institutions as having “zero efficiency.” This wasn't the only time these agencies have been in Putin's sights; he first mentioned them publicly days before launching the full-scale invasion in 2022. He is fixated on these agencies for a reason. Strong, independent institutions are a serious obstacle to Russia's imperial ambition to subjugate Ukraine, because they close the channels through which Moscow has historically projected influence and attempted to weaken its neighbor from within. By ensuring accountability and transparency, Ukraine reduces the vulnerabilities that Russia could exploit.

Fighting corruption is thus a vital part of the wider war. Ukraine does not have the luxury to postpone this battle until peacetime, and the Ukrainian people will not accept any deviation from the path of democratization they chose in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. They know that corruption is a threat to national security. It imperils Ukraine's EU accession prospects. It leaves the country more exposed to Russian influence. And it siphons away badly needed funds while Ukraine faces a much larger and richer enemy.

Anticorruption efforts have already delivered hard cash for Ukraine's defense. Since the start of the full-scale war, NABU and SAPO have transferred to the armed forces more than $70 million collected through bail payments, recovered bribes, or plea bargains during corruption investigations. In total, NABU and SAPO activities have brought in around $100 million per year in both 2023 and 2024. The agencies' work to ensure accountability in weapons procurement has borne fruit, too. In early August, for example, NABU and SAPO exposed a criminal group of political, military, and business figures that had misappropriated funds allocated by local authorities for the purchase of drones and electronic warfare systems.



But Ukrainians cannot contain corruption on their own. To give the country's people the life they are fighting for, Western leaders must fully commit to Ukraine's victory both on the battlefield and in building a strong, democratic, and resilient polity that will join the EU and NATO. Kyiv, of course, primarily needs modern weapons, delivered in the quantities necessary to win; investment in the domestic defense industry, to ensure sustainable military capacity; and stronger sanctions to crush Russia's war machine, not just contain it. EU and G-7 leaders must finally seize the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held in their countries and use this money for Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.

The country also needs help in undertaking the domestic reforms that matter for its long-term security. European governments in particular have leverage. As part of the EU accession process, which links progress to specific reforms, they should push Ukraine to uphold and protect judicial reforms and anticorruption infrastructure. Further reform is needed to Ukraine's customs and tax administration, where inefficiencies and corruption still bleed public resources. And attacks in any form on institutions and their staff, on civil society, and on independent media must end. These bodies are essential to maintaining checks and balances, especially in wartime.

In the fourth year of the full-scale war, and the 12th year since Russia's initial invasion, Ukrainians consistently remind the world what civic courage really means. They have shown that even an enemy as large and menacing as Russia can be deterred, that governance reforms can move forward during wartime, and that a committed public can encourage leaders to stand their ground on the world stage while also keeping them accountable for malpractice at home. Defeating Russia and building a strong Ukrainian democracy go hand in hand. If Ukraine's partners want to see the country prevail, they must insist on the high standards of governance and accountability that Ukrainian society itself demands.

BEIJING, September 3. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are not plotting any conspiracy against the United States, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said, commenting on allegations from US President Donald Trump about the three leaders conspiring against Washington at Beijing's military parade.

"I'd like to say that nobody meant to conspire [against the United States] <…>. Moreover, I can say that everybody understands the role the United States, the Trump administration, and President Trump personally are playing in today's global narratives," Ushakov told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin.

Earlier, Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, addressing China's Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

The People's Liberation Army of China held a large-scale military parade on Tiananmen Square in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War on Wednesday.

U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey arrived in Ukraine on Sept. 3, Ukraine's Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Telegram. 

Healey's visit follows a wave of Russian drone and missile strikes overnight on Sept. 3, targeting cities across western and central Ukraine.

"We are preparing important bilateral decisions that will strengthen the defense capabilities of our countries," Shmyhal wrote. 

According to Ukraine's defense chief, Healey's trip is focused on coordinating priorities for the upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in the Ramstein format, scheduled for Sept. 9 in London, and on advancing joint defense projects.

The Ramstein summit will bring together Ukraine's allies to discuss further military support, though the agenda has not yet been disclosed. The format, previously chaired by the U.S., is now jointly led by the U.K. and Germany after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

London has been among Kyiv's staunchest backers since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, supplying weapons, training, and intelligence. 

The U.K. is expected to play a key role in shaping new security guarantees for Ukraine as Western leaders weigh frameworks for a potential ceasefire and longer-term defense commitments.

Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that tighter sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to shift toward a diplomatic solution to end the war.

Russian artillery fire between 10:30 a.m. and 11:50 a.m. killed five men and three women.

"If Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow," Vladimir Putin told journalists during his briefing in Beijing.

The offer may also be made available to those already serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said.

Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, assesses the state of Russia's war in Ukraine three and a half years into the full-scale invasion.

The statement came in apparent reaction to an investigation published by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who claimed that at least Hr 200 million (nearly $5 million) were embezzled in last year's fortification contracts.

Russia's male life expectancy is just 67 years, while most of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle is of similar age. 

The spill originated on Aug. 29 at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal near Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai.

Ukraine has one of the world's highest rates of cryptocurrency ownership, with around 16% of the population holding crypto assets before Russia's full-scale invasion, comparable to the U.S.

The new sanctions target figures and groups accused of organizing or facilitating the deportations, including the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation and its president, Aymani Kadyrova.

Russia launched a wave of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight on Sept. 3, killing at least one person and injuring five, officials reported.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 502 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with 16 Kalibr and eight Kh-101 cruise missiles overnight. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted 430 drones and 21 missiles.

The move does not mean the abolition of individual parishes, which can become independent or join another church, said Viktor Yelenskyi, head of Ukraine's State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience.

"I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen," Putin told Kim Jong Un during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Denmark on Sept. 3 to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and take part in the Nordic-Baltic Eight summit.

Editor's note: The article was updated with additional details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing on Sept. 3, thanking him for Pyongyang's assistance during the war against Ukraine.

North Korea has become a key ally to Russia during the full-scale invasion, providing artillery, missiles, and thousands of troops.

"It is well known that your special forces took part in the liberation of Kursk Oblast at your initiative, in full compliance with our new treaty," Putin told Kim during the meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in western Beijing.

"I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen."

Kim initially dispatched around 11,000-12,000 troops to Russia in late 2024 to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast. 

After Moscow retook much of the region in the spring of this year, both Putin and Kim publicly acknowledged the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war, marking an unprecedented escalation of the conflict.

Drawing parallels to the fight against the Axis Powers during World War II, Putin thanked Kim for "joining the fight against modern neo-Nazism," referring to the Kremlin's false narratives about an alleged Nazi-led regime in Ukraine.

During the meeting in Beijing — reportedly attended by Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong — the North Korean dictator thanked Putin for appreciating the role of his troops. He called providing assistance to Russia a "fraternal duty." 

According to Ukrainian and Western officials, North Korea is receiving nuclear and missile technology, cash, and other support in exchange for military assistance.

Putin also said the two would discuss bilateral relations in "all dimensions and directions," and invited Kim to visit Russia.

The talks followed a large-scale military parade hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

The parade marked the first time Putin, Kim, and Xi were seen together, highlighting deepening ties among the three countries and reducing the isolation of both the Russian and North Korean leaders.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, reacted by writing to Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, suggested that Trump's comment about a "conspiracy" against the United States was meant as irony.

"I think (Trump) did not say without irony that supposedly 'these three' are plotting against the United States," Ushakov said. "I mean, no conspiracy — nobody was plotting anything, nobody was weaving anything, no conspiracy."

Putin previously met Kim while he was visiting Pyongyang in June 2024 to sign the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement, a deal that stipulated mutual support if one country is attacked and preceded the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia.

"Since the signing of our interstate treaty last June, relations between our countries have been developing in all aspects," Kim told Putin during the meeting.

"Within the framework of this treaty and in accordance with our obligations under this treaty with the brotherly Russian people and army, we fought together."

According to South Korea's intelligence, Pyongyang plans to send an additional 6,000 troops to Russia as part of its third wave of deployment, while some 1,000 combat engineers have already arrived.

A senior Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that North Korea could have sent even more troops, with Ukrainian officials estimating Pyongyang's contribution to be between 20,000 and 30,000 soldiers.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service estimates that some 2,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed in the war.

Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that tighter sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to shift toward a diplomatic solution to end the war.

Russian artillery fire between 10:30 a.m. and 11:50 a.m. killed five men and three women.

"If Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow," Vladimir Putin told journalists during his briefing in Beijing.

The offer may also be made available to those already serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said.

Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, assesses the state of Russia's war in Ukraine three and a half years into the full-scale invasion.

The statement came in apparent reaction to an investigation published by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who claimed that at least Hr 200 million (nearly $5 million) were embezzled in last year's fortification contracts.

Russia's male life expectancy is just 67 years, while most of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle is of similar age. 

The spill originated on Aug. 29 at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal near Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai.

Ukraine has one of the world's highest rates of cryptocurrency ownership, with around 16% of the population holding crypto assets before Russia's full-scale invasion, comparable to the U.S.

The new sanctions target figures and groups accused of organizing or facilitating the deportations, including the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation and its president, Aymani Kadyrova.

Russia launched a wave of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight on Sept. 3, killing at least one person and injuring five, officials reported.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 502 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with 16 Kalibr and eight Kh-101 cruise missiles overnight. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted 430 drones and 21 missiles.

The move does not mean the abolition of individual parishes, which can become independent or join another church, said Viktor Yelenskyi, head of Ukraine's State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience.

"I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen," Putin told Kim Jong Un during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Denmark on Sept. 3 to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and take part in the Nordic-Baltic Eight summit.

13:42 JST, September 3, 2025

For many volunteers of the World Athletics Championships, which opens in Tokyo next week, the event will give them the chance to finally welcome spectators to a major international competition. A lot of them were scheduled to help out at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics but missed out because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Training sessions for registered volunteers have entered the final stretch, while municipalities hosting training camps for overseas teams are preparing to give incoming athletes a warm welcome.

Hosted by the World Athletics, the world's premier sporting event takes place every two years. This year is the first time since 1991 for Tokyo to host the event and Japan's third overall, including the 2007 Osaka event.

This year, over 2,000 athletes from about 200 countries and regions will compete across 49 events between Sept. 13 and 21 at the National Stadium.

“It's a long-awaited event and many spectators will be there,” said Nobuyuki Taguchi, a 46-year-old company employee from Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture. “I'm thrilled.”

Taguchi applied for the volunteer program as soon as recruitment began last November. He made the cut with a one-in-three chance of being accepted.

His job is to check tickets at the gates. He created his own list of potential questions and answers to be ready to cope with various inquiries from spectators and gathered information about participating athletes online.

Taguchi watches sports as a hobby. His first volunteer experience was at the Tokyo Olympics, where he was assigned to be a guide at the beach volleyball venue.

He was looking forward to interacting with visitors from Japan and abroad. However, the Games ended up being spectator-free due to the pandemic, and Taguchi's duty was changed to guide athletes. While he cherished the memories of being thanked by the athletes, Taguchi regretted not being able to connect with spectators.

Taguchi sees the upcoming championships, a major event with an expected worldwide audience of 1 billion, as the perfect opportunity to make up for the disappointment from four years ago.

“I want to hear lots of ‘thank yous,'” he said.

About 3,400 volunteers signed up for the volunteer program, according to a local organizing committee. The volunteers received training on basic things, such as the event schedule, and then moved on to specific duties from Aug. 25. Many had previously volunteered at the Tokyo Games, like Taguchi.

“The efforts of the volunteers are indispensable,” the committee's spokesperson said. “We want to work together to create the best event.”

Meanwhile, local governments hosting training camps for national teams are also looking forward to interacting with the athletes.

Training locations were decided through direct negotiations between national teams and local governments hosting them. Many municipalities that hosted pre-tournament camps for the Tokyo Games will host the same nations again.

One such case is Gifu Prefecture, which will host Canada's training camp. In the run-up to the Games, interactions between Canadian athletes and Gifu residents were limited to online events. The aim this time, however, is to “create many opportunities for direct interactions,” a prefectural government official said.

A welcoming reception for the Canadian team is scheduled for Sunday, and the team's coaches will instruct students from athletics clubs at local junior high and high schools on Tuesday.

Nine members of the music club at Gifu City's Miwa Junior High School will perform the Canadian national anthem at the reception. They are practicing under the instruction of a professional vocalist who has sung national anthems at international competitions.

“We want to directly convey our support to the athletes,” said Mitsuki Sakai, who leads the club.

Misato, Saitama Prefecture, will host the Greek team. The municipality launched a crowdfunding campaign in May to cover the costs of renting training equipment for the athletes and exchange events, raising about ¥4.8 million, close to its target, in three months.

“We hope it will be a good opportunity for children to discover their dreams or goals,” a city official said.

 The Chance for a Two-State Solution Still Exists—but Won't for Long

 Richard Haass

More than a half century after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 242—which established the principle by which Israel would give up territory it gained in the war in exchange for peace and security—the Israelis and the Palestinians have made no meaningful, much less lasting, progress on their core differences.

It is time for this to change. What little opportunity still exists for realizing progress toward a durable agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians—one that would serve both parties' interests—is fast fading. Political and physical barriers to compromise will soon pass a tipping point.

Israel, mostly owing to its own efforts, now finds itself in a favorable security environment, in which threats along its borders and in the region have been seriously weakened, if not eliminated. The country has never been in a better position to address the strategic challenge posed by Palestinian nationalism, which will require a response with political as well as military dimensions.

But such an environment cannot last forever. Although Israel has a friend in the White House who is prepared to back it in important ways, long-term U.S. and European support for Israel is not guaranteed, especially if even more Americans and Europeans come to view it as a pariah state denying rights to others.

Israel faces a stark choice. It will either need to make a sincere bid for compromise and peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians or risk losing the international support that its long-term well-being requires. Although the two-state solution has become anathema to many Israelis, it remains the best hope for their prosperity and security. That having a state of their own would be good for the Palestinians goes without saying. But it would also be good for Israel; indeed, helping to bring about a Palestinian state has the potential to serve Israel just as much as it would serve others.

The Israelis and the Palestinians have come close to reaching a land-for-peace agreement on more than one occasion. But over the course of the past three to four decades, diplomacy has failed, in large part because Palestinian leaders—Yasir Arafat, the former president of the Palestinian Authority, and also his successors—were unwilling or unable (owing to political weakness) to accept what Israel offered in terms of territory, the status of Jerusalem, and the ability of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. Hamas's opposition to peace was and is more fundamental, because it would require acceptance of the Jewish state as a permanent part of the region.

The costs of this Palestinian rejection of a compromise-based two-state solution have been high. More than five million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza continue to live under Israel's control rather their own. And it has become far more difficult to reach a diplomatic outcome comparable to what the Palestinian leadership rejected in the past.



This is in large part because the situation on the ground has changed. There are now many more obstacles to peace—in particular the some 140 Israeli government–authorized settlements in the West Bank (and another 200 unauthorized outposts) that are home to more than 500,000 Israelis. Each settlement and outpost makes implementing territory-for-peace and building a viable Palestinian state more difficult; every additional settler creates political resistance to such a trade and raises the economic costs of relocating people.

Israeli politics have also changed. Parties on the political left have waned, and those on the right have strengthened. This political shift has been underway for decades but has rapidly accelerated since Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, which relies on the support of what can be described as far-right religious nationalists, has both reflected and accelerated this shift.

Many Israelis and their supporters around the world—even those angry with Netanyahu's conduct in the war and with what many see as an assault on Israeli democracy—now strongly oppose a Palestinian state, fearing that it would become a base from which armed factions would mount operations. Some argue that a two-state solution would whet rather than satisfy Palestinian political ambitions. Others oppose a Palestinian state not just for these reasons but also because they eye Gaza and the West Bank for Jewish settlement. It turns out that radical Palestinians are not the only ones who covet all that lies between the river and the sea.

As a result of these and other developments, declaring the demise of the two-state solution has become something of a cottage industry. And for understandable reasons: at best, it is on life support.

Still, a two-state solution is not yet dead and buried. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians would be better off with a viable, independent, sovereign state inhabited by Palestinians and run by them—but one premised on conditions that would preclude it from posing a security threat to Israel.

A Palestinian state, rather than providing a base for terror, would be more likely to reduce it in ways that the Israel Defense Forces cannot. That is because terrorists can now act with near impunity, as they are not responsible for any territory or economy and have no citizens to answer to. Absent a Palestinian state, Israel likely faces a forever war. By contrast, the government of a Palestinian state would face the military and economic consequences of any attacks it authorized on Israel, which would be acts of war rather than terrorism, and of unauthorized attacks that occurred from within its borders, which a sovereign government is expected to prevent.

This reality should motivate a responsible government—one not run by Hamas—to act in constructive ways while providing Israel recourse if Palestinian leaders proved unable or unwilling to meet their international obligations. Israel enjoyed international support for such recourse in the immediate aftermath of October 7. But Israel has lost any such understanding and sympathy during the period of more than 22 months in which it has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and exposed many more to conditions of extreme hardship.



Resolving the Palestinian issue would also create a context in which the Abraham Accords, and normalization between Arab countries and Israel more generally, could continue and broaden. Arab states could comfortably sell normalized relations with Israel to their citizens if they could point to a path for Palestinian statehood. Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has made clear that it is Israel's unwillingness to restart diplomacy predicated on the prospect of a two-state outcome that holds him back from pursuing closer ties with Israel. Similarly, a Palestinian state would enhance the stability of Israel's neighbors, above all Jordan, because satisfying the call for such an entity would relieve pressure on the Jordanian monarchy, which has long been willing to live in peace with Israel but would face domestic instability were an influx of Palestinians to enter the country and upset its demographic and political balance. Reducing the salience of the Palestinian issue would also allow Israel's national security establishment to focus on other pressing threats, above all those posed by Iran.

A separate Palestinian state would also be good for Israel's identity and internal cohesion. There are some two million Arab citizens of Israel, some of whom could be radicalized if Israel continues to frustrate Palestinian political ambitions and treat Palestinians so harshly. Even more fundamentally, a Palestinian state would free Israel from having to choose between being a democracy and being a Jewish state: granting five million Palestinians equal rights would threaten the latter, while denying them such rights would threaten the former. Obviously, all signs point to Israel denying them such rights, a trend that would only increase Israel's international isolation.

Being seen as open to a Palestinian state would help Israel avoid pariah status around the world, a reality that is gaining momentum as a reaction to Israel's military operations in Gaza. It would reduce the threat of economic sanctions from Europe and stem the growing alienation of many Americans, including younger American Jews—a trend that over time could even jeopardize U.S. military support for Israel. Israeli openness on this matter might also reduce anti-Semitism globally.

Last but most pressing, support in principle for a Palestinian state would offer Israel a pathway out of Gaza and to getting the remaining hostages back. Articulating a path toward a two-state solution is a prerequisite for replacing Israeli security forces with an Arab stabilization force and for creating competition for Hamas, which would lose its near-monopoly on the claim that only it can deliver a state for the Palestinian masses. As the British learned in Northern Ireland, radical groups cannot be defeated with military force alone. They must also be marginalized politically, by making available a diplomatic path that offers more promise than continued violence.

The desirability of an outcome is one thing, but feasibility is something different altogether. The immediate diplomatic focus, therefore, should be modest, given political realities both in Israel and among Palestinians. For those who still favor a two-state solution, the objective for the immediate future should be to preserve the possibility of more ambitious diplomacy and create conditions that would give such diplomacy a chance of one day succeeding.

This policy should have two dimensions: one of avoidance and another of creation. Regarding the former, governments ought to eschew calling for Palestinian self-determination. To paraphrase the Camp David accords that Washington helped broker between Egypt and Israel in 1978, the Palestinians should have the right to participate in the determination of their own future but not to declare or decide it unilaterally. A Palestinian state must be created in tandem with Israel. There is too much history and not enough territory to do it any other way.

Another form of unilateralism to be avoided is the declaration from concerned outsiders—namely Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom—of their intention to recognize a Palestinian state this fall if there is no cease-fire in Gaza. Although these powers view their actions as helpful, in practice they are anything but. The Israelis and the Palestinians must reach an accommodation, and Palestinians must internalize that a state of their own, if Israel is to allow it, cannot be delivered by others without compromise on their part. Adding to the problem is that the choice to recognize a state of Palestine now appears to reward Hamas rather than a moderate alternative.

Israeli unilateralism must also be resisted. Here, the onus falls on the United States, because politics in Israel—born of governing coalitions, demographic changes, and reactions to events such as October 7—have developed in such a way that Israel, left to its own devices, will not exercise restraint. The Trump administration should make clear its opposition to new settlements, new outposts, and any annexation of Palestinian territory. It should also communicate its expectation that settlers and Israel Defense Forces units will respect Palestinian human rights and property rights. What would add teeth to such a stance (something this and previous U.S. administrations have largely resisted doing) would be a message from Washington that, going forward, Israel will not be able to count on the United States to use its veto in the UN Security Council to protect Israel from all economic and diplomatic sanctions if it ignores U.S. preferences. Washington could also impose higher tariffs on Israel if it continues to undermine what limited prospects remain for a Palestinian state. It is possible for the United States to distinguish between support for Israel's security and support for its open-ended occupation and expansion.

Meanwhile, the United States, European countries, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab governments should press not just for an end to the war in Gaza and for the replacement of Israeli occupation forces with an Arab and Palestinian stabilization force; those governments should also put forward a public vision for a larger diplomatic process. They should articulate what they expect of both the Israelis and the Palestinians, what those parties could expect in return, and what they are prepared to do to encourage the process and buttress the results. This would include providing Israel with security assurances and economic assistance to help relocate settlers, and providing a new Palestinian state with what it requires to meet its obligations to its citizens and to Israel. What would be required here is nothing less than a long-term commitment to nation building—or, more precisely, state building.



Ideally, this would encourage the emergence of a more moderate Palestinian leadership willing to speak and act in ways that reassured a majority of Israelis, which in turn might encourage the emergence of a more moderate Israeli leadership. What comes to mind is the impact of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's outreach to Israelis just four years after Egypt attacked Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, which persuaded Israelis that they had a partner whose cooperation would justify the evacuation of settlements and the return of territory that Israel had gained in 1967. The precise terms of a Palestinian state would be addressed and negotiated further down the road by a new generation of Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

It is impossible to describe a path such as the one outlined above with optimism, given where the parties involved are now and how they got there. But there is some reason for hope. One is U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees himself as a peacemaker and who finds himself in a position to be one here. Trump is popular in Israel, and he has the support of many American Jews who define themselves as staunchly pro-Israel. The same holds for evangelical Christians. In some respects, Trump's position calls to mind that of U.S. President Richard Nixon. Nixon was able to extend a hand to communist China in no small part because, unlike other American presidents who might have wanted to do so, he did not have Richard Nixon to worry about.

Much the same holds for Trump when it comes to Israel. His negotiation of the Abraham Accords, moving of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and, most recently, bombing of Iran's nuclear sites all insulate him from criticism and provide him with leverage available to few, if any, of his predecessors. And no Democrat is likely to make hay with the argument that Trump would be selling out Israel by pressuring it—because so many in the Democratic Party want him to do just that. In addition, an active American push for peace would enhance the standing of the United States around the world—and that of its president. The choice is his to make.

Another reason for some hope is that the Arab world is ready to make peace with Israel. Several governments have already done so, and Saudi Arabia is prepared to move forward. Then there is the New York Declaration—the result of a UN conference chaired by Saudi Arabia and France on the two-state solution in late July—which among other things includes a call for Hamas to end its rule in Gaza and to hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. The declaration underscores just how far the Arab world has evolved in its willingness to live alongside Israel.

Finally, there is the fluid political situation in Israel. The number of Israelis protesting the weakening of the country's courts and democracy, and more recently advocating for an end of the war in Gaza and the return of the hostages, suggests that the legacy of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who sought to make careful compromises for peace, remains a strong force in Israeli politics.

Bringing about a Palestinian state will require help from the United States, Europe, and the Arab states. Most important, it will require that the Palestinians demonstrate in word and action that they are prepared to live in peace with Israel. If they are willing to do this, then there is a chance that politics in Israel will evolve—not to mention that Israel will be on the hook to respond in good faith.

It is, of course, possible that Israel will not have a diplomatic partner in the Palestinians, who are deeply divided politically. If so—if Palestinians are not prepared to reject Hamas and embrace moderation and a willingness to compromise—then Israel would be much less likely to be viewed by many, as it is now, as the principal impediment to peace. It would avoid some of the domestic divisions as well as regional and international opprobrium being directed its way. To be sure, Israel would still have to contend with the many internal consequences associated with having more than five million Palestinians living under its control. It would also have to approach Palestinians in a far more humane and responsible way than it has recently in both Gaza and the West Bank. But it would be in an improved situation all the same.

A Palestinian state would not solve every problem. A variation of Winston Churchill's famous assertion about democracy comes to mind: it is “the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” A cynic might say the same thing about the two-state solution, that it is the worst form of diplomatic outcome except for all the others.



Whatever its risks and shortcomings, a two-state solution would leave Israel better off than the alternatives. The status quo of open-ended occupation risks pushing Israel further down the path toward becoming an international pariah. Israel would forever face terrorism from a people who felt they had nothing to lose. The forced transfer of millions of Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank would have the same effect, and possibly destabilize Jordan and other neighbors, jeopardizing the peace that Israel is enjoying with those Arab countries that have sought it. A one-state solution, in which Palestinians became Israeli citizens, would threaten Israel's Jewishness, democratic rule, or both.

Abba Eban, Israel's erudite foreign minister at the time of the country's 1967 and 1973 conflicts with its Arab neighbors, once famously said that when it comes to making peace, the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. He had a point. But today the dictum applies to Israel, as well. Never in the country's history has Israel been more secure from external threat. It is at peace with Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. It has significantly degraded Iran's proxies in the region, above all Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran, Iraq, and Syria are all relatively weak. Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest Arab country, and one that enjoys a unique status in the Islamic world, has signaled its readiness to normalize ties if Israel demonstrates a willingness to address Palestinian national demands under reasonable conditions. And Israel has a staunch friend in the White House.

The United States should make good on its legacy of being Israel's closest friend. Policymakers and American citizens should consider that what is deemed today to constitute a pro-Israel stance could well be judged differently by history. It is in the interests of Israel and the United States alike to try to bring about a Palestinian state before the possibility disappears forever. It is literally now or never.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Sept. 3 for a large-scale military parade marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

While no U.S. officials attended, U.S. President Donald Trump reacted on Truth Social, writing to Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

The event marked the first public appearance of Putin, Kim, and Xi together — highlighting deepening ties among the three countries and reduced isolation of both the Russian and North Korean leaders. 

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, suggested that Trump's comment about a "conspiracy" against the United States was meant as irony.

"I think (Trump) did not say without irony that supposedly 'these three' are plotting against the United States," Ushakov said. "I mean, no conspiracy — nobody was plotting anything, nobody was weaving anything, no conspiracy."

Putin and Kim then departed the parade for bilateral talks, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

As Russia faced geopolitical isolation following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Pyongyang emerged as one of Moscow's most important military allies, supporting its war effort with artillery shells, missiles, and even soldiers. 

Likewise, despite officially claiming neutrality, China has been indirectly supporting Moscow's war by purchasing Russian oil and providing dual-use technology.

Addressing a crowd of more than 50,000 people at Tiananmen Square, Xi said: "Today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum," adding that the Chinese people "stand on the right side of history."

While Xi lauded peace and dialogue in his speech, China used the parade to show off its military might. 

The event featured over 10,000 troops, more than 100 aircraft and vehicles, and the country's most advanced weaponry, like the nuclear-capable DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, and laser weapons.

The parade came just days after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which brought together Xi, Putin, Kim, and other world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Taken together, both the military parade and the SCO summit are seemingly meant to project China's power on the global stage and Xi's vision of a new world order — especially amid rising tensions with the United States over trade and security.

While Putin attended the military parade in Beijing, Russian forces launched a large-scale drone attack targeting cities across Ukraine. Despite Xi's rhetoric about peace, China has emerged as a key ally and economic lifeline for Russia during its war against Ukraine, with Kyiv growing more vocal in accusing Beijing of directly supporting Moscow's war effort.

Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that tighter sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to shift toward a diplomatic solution to end the war.

Russian artillery fire between 10:30 a.m. and 11:50 a.m. killed five men and three women.

"If Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow," Vladimir Putin told journalists during his briefing in Beijing.

The offer may also be made available to those already serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said.

Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, assesses the state of Russia's war in Ukraine three and a half years into the full-scale invasion.

The statement came in apparent reaction to an investigation published by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who claimed that at least Hr 200 million (nearly $5 million) were embezzled in last year's fortification contracts.

Russia's male life expectancy is just 67 years, while most of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle is of similar age. 

The spill originated on Aug. 29 at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal near Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai.

Ukraine has one of the world's highest rates of cryptocurrency ownership, with around 16% of the population holding crypto assets before Russia's full-scale invasion, comparable to the U.S.

The new sanctions target figures and groups accused of organizing or facilitating the deportations, including the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation and its president, Aymani Kadyrova.

Russia launched a wave of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight on Sept. 3, killing at least one person and injuring five, officials reported.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 502 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with 16 Kalibr and eight Kh-101 cruise missiles overnight. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted 430 drones and 21 missiles.

The move does not mean the abolition of individual parishes, which can become independent or join another church, said Viktor Yelenskyi, head of Ukraine's State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience.

"I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen," Putin told Kim Jong Un during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Denmark on Sept. 3 to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and take part in the Nordic-Baltic Eight summit.

Rubio vows more strikes on cartels smuggling arms and drugs from South America.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday defended President Donald Trump's strike on a drug cartel-operated vessel off of Venezuela and vowed the U.S. will no longer "sit back" when it comes to "nacro-terrorism."

In response to questions about the Marine strike Tuesday that hit a vessel in the southern Caribbean Sea while allegedly carrying members of Tren de Aragua smuggling narcotics headed for the U.S., Rubio said, "We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise."

The strike apparently killed 11 members of the group, which was designated a terrorist organization in February, and marked a significant shift from the U.S.'s previous seize-and-apprehend policy when countering international gang networks.

MADURO CLAIMS US SEEKS 'REGIME CHANGE THROUGH MILITARY THREAT' AMID CARIBBEAN BUILDUP

"The president of the United States has determined that narco-terrorist organizations pose a threat to the national security of the United States. I don't need to explain to you why," Rubio said, noting that the group is known to traffic not only drugs, but arms and people. 

"These are not stockbrokers. These are not real estate agents who, on the side, deal a few drugs. These are organized, corporate, structured organizations who specialize in the trafficking of deadly drugs into the United States of America," Rubio said. "They pose an immediate threat to the United States. Period."

In speaking to reporters from Mexico, where he was also hashing out counter arms and narcotics agreements, Rubio argued the previous policy of seize and apprehend was ineffective.

"Because these drug cartels, what they do is they know they're going to lose 2% of their cargo — they bake it into their economics," he said. "What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them."

The secretary further pointed out that the arms groups like Tren de Aragua are apparently getting a hold of unconventional weaponry, including drones, and continue to pose an increasingly serious threat to international security. 

"We are increasingly concerned that these cartels are now in possession, not just of landmines and grenades. We're now seeing the deployment of drone technology by narco-terrorist groups operating out of Venezuelan territory," he added, noting that they are being used to threaten security forces in neighboring states like Columbia.

Rubio confirmed the strategy employed on Tuesday is how the U.S. will continue to counter international narcotics and arms smuggling. 

"It'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know. But the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations," Rubio said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department arrested an Alabama man who deputies said showed up armed with brass knuckles, knives, high-capacity magazines and body armor after allegedly making threats against a Catholic monastery in California.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department said deputies detained Joshua Michael Richardson late last month following reports of threatening emails he sent to St. Michael's Abbey. Investigators said the emails, reported on August 28, contained language interpreted as threatening. 

The situation escalated when investigators said Richardson drove from Alabama to Southern California and showed up in person at the abbey, where deputies said he made additional threats. A priest who encountered Richardson notified the sheriff's department two days later, triggering a swift investigation.

Sergeant Gerard McCann told the Orange County Register that it is believed Richardson made the drive from Alabama and arrived in California on the same day he went to the abbey.

Deputies said they quickly located and detained Richardson. A search of his vehicle uncovered weapons and tactical gear, including large-capacity magazines, body armor, knives, and brass knuckles. He was taken into custody without incident and booked into the Orange County Jail.

On September 1, the Orange County District Attorney's Office formally charged Richardson with several offenses, including possession of brass knuckles, carrying a concealed dagger, possession of a large-capacity magazine and making criminal threats, according to KTLA.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Jarryd Gonzales, spokesperson for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, confirmed the incident and thanked local law enforcement for their prompt action.

"The Diocese of Orange has been made aware of a threat directed toward St. Michael's Abbey. Local law enforcement responded swiftly, and a suspect has been apprehended," Gonzales said. "We are grateful to the authorities for their quick action in ensuring the safety of our parish community."

Gonzales noted that the diocese is taking the incident seriously in light of rising threats against churches nationwide, pointing to the recent shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, where a gunman opened fire during Mass.

"In today's environment of increased threats against churches, and particularly mindful of recent events in Minnesota, our parishes and schools continue to strengthen security efforts and remain vigilant to help protect our parishioners, students and staff," 

The sheriff's department has increased patrols near the monastery, which sits on a 320-acre former ranch, while the abbey itself has enhanced its private security.

Sheriff's officials stressed the importance of community vigilance.

"While incidents like this can feel unsettling, they also highlight the power of community," officials said. "If something seems off, say something. Trust your instincts and report suspicious activity, whether it is a strange message, unusual behavior, or something that does not sit right. Your call could stop a crime before it happens."

President Donald Trump says he could deploy the National Guard to fight crime in New Orleans after previously saying troops might be going into Chicago and Baltimore amid his ongoing federal crackdown in the nation's capital.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard to fight crime, potentially expanding the number of cities around the nation where he may send federal law enforcement.

Trump has already said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore following his administration deploying troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month. 

“So we're making a determination now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

Trump now frequently boasts about turning Washington into a “safe zone.” The White House reports more than 1,760 arrests citywide since the president first announced he was mobilizing federal forces on Aug. 7. 

But Washington is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to attempt to quell crime in other Democratic-controlled cities around the country would represent an important escalation. 

Trump's latest comments came a day after he declared “We're going in” and suggested that the National Guard might soon be headed for Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and Baltimore. That's despite state and local officials, as well as many residents, both places staunchly opposing the idea. 




New Orleans, however, is a Democrat-controlled in a red state run by Landry. 

“So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks,” Trump said. “It'll take us two weeks, easier than D.C.”

Shortly after Trump's comments, Landry said on social media, “We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” 

But city leaders immediately balked at the idea. 

“Crime is down in New Orleans,” City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, who is also a mayoral candidate, said via text message. “That would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!”

Councilmember Jean-Paul Morrell said it is “ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it.”

“Guardsmen are not trained law enforcement. They can't solve crimes, they can't interview witnesses and they aren't trained to constitutionally police,” Morrell said in a statement. “NOPD is doing a great job with the existing resources they have. Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.”

The City of New Orleans issued its own more conciliatory statement, saying “our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events” and that local officials “remain committed to sustaining this momentum.” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted last month on federal fraud charges and is set to be arraigned in the coming weeks.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly railed against Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for not requesting that the National Guard be deployed. 

“We could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago. If we don't have the support of some of these politicians, but I'll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago,” Trump said Wednesday. 

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have been adamant in saying Chicago doesn't need or want military intervention. In Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore have remained similarly opposed. 

In Washington, Mayor Muriel Bowser has said Trump's decision to take over her city's police force and flood streets with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in reducing violent crime — but she's also argued that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more city police officers in service.

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse made their voices heard Tuesday on Capitol Hill, pressuring lawmakers to force the release of the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier and pushing back President Donald Trump's effort to dismiss the issue as a “hoax.”

Four Republicans — three of them women — have defied House GOP leadership and the White House in an effort to force a vote on a bill that would require the Justice Department to release the contents of the so-called Epstein files, with the exception of the victims' personal information. Two more Republicans will need to defect from party leadership and join every House Democrat to force the vote.

Survivors and accusers of Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, gathered on the Capitol lawn along with hundreds of supporters to demand the Trump administration provide transparency and accountability for what they endured as teenagers.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to quash the effort by putting forward his own resolution and arguing that a concurrent investigation by the House Oversight Committee is the best way for Congress to deliver transparency. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the matter as a “Democrat hoax.”

Other news we're following today:








The head of the FBI was in Cincinnati on Wednesday to help prosecutors and investigators announce a recent grand jury indictment targeting 22 Chinese suspects and four Chinese companies for allegedly shipping to the U.S. chemicals used to prepare fentanyl for sale.

FBI Director Kash Patel said he was in southern Ohio “to break the wheel of fentanyl trafficking in the United States of America.”

Authorities allege three people in Ohio were involved in obtaining several pounds of illegal cutting agents, which are used to increase the weight and potency of fentanyl. Indictments in the drug and money laundering case were handed up Tuesday.

It is unusual for an FBI director to travel outside of Washington to announce criminal charges, but Patel's presence was meant to underscore how the fight against drug trafficking has emerged as a top law enforcement priority for the Trump administration.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said he supports President Trump's suggestion to send federal troops to the state.

“We will take President @realDonaldTrump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” Landry said in an X post.

Landry has not responded to questions from The Associated Press about whether he requested that Trump send in federal troops.

New Orleans city council leaders and several mayoral candidates have rejected the need for federal troops, pointing to the city's plummeting crime rate this year.

But the office of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city's police released a joint statement thanking the federal government for its support.

“Our federal and state partnerships have played a significant role in ensuring public safety, particularly during special events for a world-class city,” the statement said. “The City of New Orleans and NOPD remain committed to sustaining this momentum, ensuring that every neighborhood continues to feel the impact of these combined efforts.”

Cantrell, a Democrat, was federally indicted last month for allegedly lying about a relationship with her bodyguard

The president's political team sent out a fundraising email on Wednesday that said, “Chicago will be liberated” and “We're going into Chicago.”

The email pitch repeats some of Trump's remarks on Tuesday about his plans to order federal authorities to Chicago and then suggests people make a $15 donation “to join MAGA blitz.”

Federal officials have agreed to restore health- and science-related webpages and data following a lawsuit settlement with doctors' groups and other organizations.

The settlement was announced this week by the Washington State Medical Association, the lead plaintiffs in the case.

Soon after President Donald Trump's inauguration, federal health officials deleted information on topics like pregnancy risks and opioid-use disorder. This was in response to a Trump executive order to stop using the term “gender” in federal policies.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to restore more than 100 websites and resource.

Rubio dodged questions about if the people in the boat were warned before they were bombed, or if the government is concerned about raising the hackles of Latin American governments, some who perceive the strike as a shift back to the U.S. forcefully intervening in affairs in the region.

“We're not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. “It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen anymore.”

Rubio added that Trump as commander-in-chief has the authority “under exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.”

The House has rejected a Republican resolution to censure Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey and remove her from the House Homeland Security Committee.

The House voted 215-207 to set aside the censure resolution, with a handful of Republicans joining with Democrats in rejecting the effort.

The vote came after Republicans sought to punish McIver for a confrontation with federal law enforcement during a congressional visit to a new immigration detention facility in her home state.

McIver has pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside the facility in Newark in May.

Asked about details of the extraordinary strike that took place Tuesday, Rubio once again deflected operational details about how the U.S. confirmed it was a drug cartel in the boat or that they were heading toward the U.S. to the Pentagon.

But, Rubio went on to defend the operation, saying that previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Rubio said, adding that it is just the beginning of a larger U.S. operation in the region.

“We have seen those numbers drop historically, and that would not have been possible without the close cooperation between our two governments,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday. 

The positive tone and complimentary language toward Mexico reflects a shift for the Trump administration as it escalates its efforts to target drug cartels.

Eleanor Holmes Norton, 88, has made very few public appearances during the surge of federal law enforcement authorities and the National Guard although her office has been active in introducing legislation to end the use of military personnel and surge.

At a time when the city's authority to govern itself has been threatened, public pushback by its officials has been one of the few recourses to challenge Trump's move.

Norton, who has been the representative for the district since 1991, made the rare appearance Wednesday to slam Trump's takeover. She said the move has turned residents into “props in a political play to showcase his own power.”

Norton, long a champion of D.C. statehood and self-governance, was at the 1963 March on Washington as a 26-year-old Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker. She has been visibly slower in her public appearances this year.

As delegate, she is a non-voting member of Congress and requires close ties with allies in Congress.

House Republicans are standing up a select committee to re-investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, as they continue to contest what happened after Trump sent a mob of supporters to fight the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

The new panel, with eight members to be chosen by the House speaker, will have subpoena power to compel witness testimony. It is expected to produce a report of its investigation by Dec. 31, 2026.

Trump was impeached for inciting the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, but later acquitted.

While in Mexico City, Rubio said he was happy to see “the level of commitment” between U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime after meeting with President Sheinbaum.

“There are no other governments cooperating more” than the U.S. and Mexico in combatting crime,” Rubio said during a press conference Wednesday. “It's the closest cooperation we've ever had, maybe between any country, but definitely between the U.S. and Mexico.”

The U.S. and Mexican governments announced Wednesday that they were reaffirming their commitment to work together to strengthen security, combat cartels and stop trafficking along the border and fuel theft.

It comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was visiting Mexico City, meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and holding a news conference with Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente.

The leaders stopped short of initially announcing a formal agreement, which Sheinbaum has spent weeks pushing for. The governments said they established a “high-level implementation” to make sure new commitments were fulfilled. Mexico and the U.S. were already working together closely to combat cartels and fentanyl trafficking.

They said their relationship is “based on the principles of reciprocity, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, shared and differentiated responsibility, as well as mutual trust.”

A White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump was referring to Zelenskyy earlier. 

Trump in the Oval Office told reporters, “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly,” regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, but it wasn't clear if he meant Zelenskyy or Putin.

New Orleans city leaders recoiled at the notion of sending federal troops into the Big Easy, as President Trump suggested on Wednesday.

“It's ridiculous to consider sending the National Guard into another American city that hasn't asked for it,” said City Council President J.P. Morrell. “Marching troops into New Orleans is an unnecessary show of force in effort to create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.”

While Trump said New Orleans has a “crime problem,” city leaders point out that crime rates have dropped considerably this year. Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, according to the New Orleans Police Department.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last year, Landry established a state police force to operate in New Orleans. He also convened a special legislative session focused on combating crime, leading to harsher penalties.

New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch says she was “very direct” with the attorney general about her opposition to an enhanced federal law enforcement presence in the city.

“My message was we got this. We don't want or need the help of the National Guard in New York City,” Tisch said in an interview on a local ABC station Wednesday.

Tisch added that a federal deployment “creates real safety problems for us at the NYPD” and that “our National Guard are not trained to handle street crime in New York City.”

President Donald Trump this week said he's ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago and Baltimore, following similar actions in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles.

While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year.

Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. And murders had been reduced by a third, even when including the 14 victims of a Jan. 1 truck attack.

New Orleans City Council Vice President Helena Moreno condemned any notion of sending federal troops to New Orleans.

“This is about scare tactics and politicizing public safety,” said Moreno, the frontrunner in the mayor's race. “Ultimately leading to the misuse of public funds and resources to attempt to score political points. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.”

Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement.

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the strike on a boat carrying drugs from Venezuela shows that the U.S. will not tolerate drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.

He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.”

“And it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said.

Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser's announcement comes as the nation's capital looks to emerge from President Trump's federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Bowser's deal with the city's police officers includes a 13% pay increase as well as other incentives such as cost-of-living increases and an expanded take-home car program. Bowser has sought to add at least 500 officers for years, often publicly struggling with the D.C. Council over the issue. The department currently contains 3,188 sworn officers, with Bowser looking to boost that number up to around 4,000.

Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service.

“We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. “We don't need a presidential emergency.”

Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, along with Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, traveled to Houston to announce the seizure.

Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. After their seizure, the chemicals were brought to the Port of Houston.

The Trump administration has designated eight Latin American crime organizations, including the Sinaloa drug cartel, as “foreign terrorist organizations.” This gave Pirro's office the authority to execute the seizure under the terrorism forfeiture provision.

Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case.

“I'm having a conversation with him very shortly, and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said. He did not clarify if he was talking about Putin or Zelenskyy.

The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be.

Still, he said that the bloodshed in eastern Europe has to end, and expressed confidence that he'll be able to bring the conflict to a close.

“Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. He added, “They not soldiers from my country. This is my country. But I have a power to end things.”

After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans.

“So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

State and local officials, many of whom are top Democrats, have sharply opposed troop presence in Chicago and Baltimore. Landry, though, is a Republican.

The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”

Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans.

“They're bringing us together as a country,” Khanna said, of the stories of accusers, gesturing toward Greene with a smile. “I've never done a press conference with Marjorie before.”

Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment.

Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.

Their meeting Wednesday in Mexico City comes a day after Trump dramatically stepped up his administration's military role in the Caribbean with what he called a deadly strike on a Venezuelan drug cartel.

Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power.

“We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said.

Speaking to reporters before the Rubio meeting, she said what her administration planned to agree to with the United States is a “cooperation program about border security and the application of the law within the framework of our (respective) sovereignties.”

The president pushed back when asked why the U.S. carried out a lethal strike on a Venezuelan drug-carrying vessel on Tuesday instead of interdicting it and capturing the alleged smugglers. 

Trump said the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

The president said that “thousands and thousands of documents” had been released but that the “Democratic hoax” would continue.

“No matter what you do it's going to keep going,” Trump said. He added, “Really, I think it's enough.”

Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. And, while numerous documents have been released as part of the Epstein investigations, the majority contained information that was already public.

Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. One accuser asked Trump to come meet her at the Capitol so she could explain while the issue wasn't a hoax.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.”

Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.”

He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. China held a parade to recognize the 80th anniversary of the war ending.

The U.S. sanctioned a Chinese firm and its representatives on Wednesday, accusing them of involvement in making and selling synthetic opioids to Americans.

The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. 

“Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.”

China-based chemical companies are the primary source of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids entering the United States, regularly through Mexico.

People identifying themselves as Epstein accusers are calling on Trump for his help in making public remaining documents in the case.

Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.”

The political clash over calls for releasing the files has flummoxed House Republican leadership and been a sticking point for the Trump administration.

Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department, but they mostly contain information already publicly known.

The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison.

Lee Gelernt, who argued for the ACLU, said the use of “a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. This ruling will not be the final say on this matter. We are confident in our position, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”

The U.S. leader greeted his Polish counterpart at the South Portico of the White House with a hearty shoulder slap and exchange of big smiles.

The two stood side-by-side as four F-35 fighter jets flew over the White House, followed by another formation of four F-16s.

Trump and Nawrocki then went inside together.

The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. IT WILL END!”

He did not offer any additional comment.

Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Ukrainian officials will “try to connect” with President Trump to hear about new ways to increase pressure on Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.”

“When we speak about pressure, we mean air defense, we mean weapon deals, we mean drone production, and of course, of course, sanctions,” the Ukrainian leader said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

“Such signals we gave (the) president of the United States. He said ‘couple of weeks', and he will answer on this,” Zelenskyy said of Trump. “'Couple of weeks', in my understanding, it's two weeks or maximum three weeks. This Monday, two weeks ended.”

Attorneys for some alleged victims of Epstein and Maxwell also appeared alongside the lawmakers, in support of the discharge petition.

The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly.

Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke.

Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition.

A bipartisan set of House lawmakers has appealed to their colleagues to support a discharge petition that could force a House vote requiring the Department of Justice to release its Epstein files.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage.

“There is something that is rotten in Washington,” Khanna said. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”

The lawmakers spoke a day after the House Oversight Committee publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department on the sex trafficking investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. The files mostly contained information that was already publicly known or available, but the release showed lawmakers' eagerness to act on the issue, quickly reviving a political clash that has flummoxed House Republican leadership and roiled the Trump administration.

Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, another proponent of the petition, along with Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says when Trump called him recently to discuss the novel idea he thought: “That's genius.”

The idea is to give Republicans a chance to make their case to voters, who tend to reject the party in power during midterm cycles. Republicans are struggling to hold onto their majority in Congress.

Besides, the speaker added, Trump “loves a big show.”

They're working with Senate Republican Leader John Thune to make it happen.

“I think that's a done deal now,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a social media post by Trump on Wednesday that said he was conspiring with the leaders of North Korea and China against the United States.

Asked about the post at a news conference in Beijing, the Russian leader told journalists “the President of the United States is not without a sense of humor.”

“Over these four days, during negotiations of all kinds, both in formal and informal settings, no one has ever expressed any negative judgments on the current American administration,” Putin said.

Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a four-day visit. He took part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, held extensive talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with other leaders, and attended a military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also present at the parade. Kim and Putin held talks after the event.

The Russian leader also said everyone with whom he had spoken during his visit to China had “supported our meeting in Anchorage,” and expressed their hope that negotiations would end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

House Republicans emerged from a private meeting with White House officials rebranding Trump's signature bill: The Working Families Tax Cuts Act.

“We're so excited about that,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting.

Polling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.

The gathering comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers calls for the House to take up their bill that would force the Department of Justice to release its investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

It's an unusual grouping of lawmakers, including Republicans Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Democrat Ro Khanna. They're trying to use a rarely-used legislative maneuver to force a vote on their bill against the wishes of House Republican leadership.

“A nation that allows rich and powerful men to traffic and abuse young girls without consequence is a nation that has lost its moral and spiritual core,” Khanna said.

Around the news conference, a large crowd gathered with signs that said, “Believe the survivors,” and “Unlock the Epstein files.”

White House officials headed to Capitol Hill to huddle privately with House Republicans, sharing polling from Trump's political team as they frame their public messaging ahead of a busy fall session.

Attendance was mandatory at the basement session, a sign of Trump's grip on the GOP.

Despite their legislative success in passing Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts bill into law, Republicans held few town hall meetings this summer as they retool their pitch to voters.

The images from China offer a striking, maybe even sinister, message that there could be a new reconfiguration of rising power in Eurasia, an “Axis of Upheaval,” as one U.S. analyst has called it.

But there's also evidence that the events in Beijing are simply more of the self-interested, high-level jockeying that has marked regional power politics for decades:

Two days earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping huddled together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

The gatherings in China could be read as a defiant message to the United States and its allies. At the very least, they offered yet more evidence of a burgeoning shift away from a U.S.-dominated, Western-led world order, as Trump withdraws America from many of its historic roles and roils economic relationships with tariffs.

“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump posted in a social media message to Xi.

U.S. employers posted 7.2 million job vacancies in July, down from 7.4 million in June, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that layoffs rose slightly, and that the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was almost unchanged from June at 3.2 million.

The U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly due to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve and partly because Trump's trade wars have created uncertainty that is paralyzing managers making hiring decisions. The economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023.

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and their families are rallying in front of the Capitol as they press Congress to force more disclosure in the criminal investigation into the late financier.

A political clash is unfolding in the House over how Congress should proceed in a matter that has rattled both House Republican leadership and the Trump administration. On Wednesday, speakers at the rally often grew emotional as they recounted how they were lured into Epstein's abuse, and they demanded government accountability for the actions of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

“Our demands are clear,” said Sky Roberts, whose late sister Virginia Giuffre was an outspoken survivor. “Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her life. No leniency. No deals. No special treatment.”

Survivors also demanded that the Epstein files be released publicly and that anyone complicit be held accountable.

The special session agenda set by Kehoe also includes proposed changes to Missouri's ballot measure process.

One key change would make it harder for ballot initiatives to succeed. If approved by voters, Missouri's constitution would be amended so that all future ballot measures would need not only a majority of the statewide vote but also a majority of the votes in each congressional district in order to pass.

If such a standard had been in place last year, an abortion-rights amendment to the state constitution would have failed. That measure narrowly passed statewide on the strength of “yes” votes in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas but failed in rural congressional districts.

Missouri lawmakers are meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional map in ways that could improve the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress next year. The session was called by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and should run at least a week.

Missouri is the third state to pursue mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican lawmakers in Texas, prodded by Trump, was the first, approving a new map that increases the Republicans advantage in five more districts.

Democratic-led California fought back, asking voters to approve in November a plan to give Democrats a chance at winning five more seats.

Tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Florida's tuition waiver law was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling one of her signature achievements shows how much politics have shifted.

More than 6,500 students qualified for the waiver in Florida before DeSantis signed the bill revoking it as of July 1. At the University of Florida, a state resident pays about $6,380 in tuition, compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Now some of these students have switched to online programs to finish their degrees, and staying at home to avoid being detained.

Rubio is in Mexico City as President Claudia Sheinbaum was convening a security forum of all 32 Mexican governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor's office and security commanders. “Under no circumstance will we accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is detrimental to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the country,” she said Monday in her State of the Nation address.

Sheinbaum had been talking up a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that would protect Mexican sovereignty while combatting the flow of fentanyl north and weapons south. Sheinbaum sought to lower expectations Tuesday, saying it would be more like a memorandum of understanding to share intelligence.

“It is a relationship of respect and at the same time collaboration,” Sheinbaum said.

Trump suggested otherwise last month, saying: “Mexico does what we tell them to do.” 

All these hot-button issues for the Trump administration and its neighbors will top the secretary of state's agenda this week on his third trip to Latin America since becoming chief U.S. diplomat.

The trip comes as the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, including military deployments and what it said was a lethal strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel.

In talks with leaders in Mexico and Ecuador on Wednesday and Thursday, Rubio will make the case that broader, deeper cooperation with the U.S. is key to improving health, safety and security. But Trump has alienated allies in the region with persistent demands, threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions.

President Donald Trump defended the lethal U.S. strike on a Venezuelan vessel Tuesday, saying the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States. “Obviously, they won't be doing it again,” Trump said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday justified the lethal military strike that his administration said was carried out a day earlier against a Venezuelan gang as a necessary effort by the United States to send an unmistakable message to Latin American cartels.

Asked why the military did not instead interdict the vessel and capture those on board, Trump said the operation would cause drug smugglers to think twice about trying to move drugs into the U.S.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said while hosting Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

Tuesday's strike was an astonishing departure from typical U.S. drug interdiction efforts at a time when Trump has ordered a major Navy buildup in the waters near Venezuela.

Later Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that such operations “will happen again.”

Rubio said previous U.S. interdiction efforts in Latin America have not worked in stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and beyond.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Rubio said on a visit to Mexico.




Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on “Fox & Friends” that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was running his country “as a kingpin of a drug narco-state.”

Hegseth said officials “knew exactly who was in that boat” and “exactly what they were doing.” But the Republican administration has not presented any evidence supporting Trump's claim that operators of the vessel were from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were trying to smuggle in drugs.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not seen,” said Hegseth, who declined to detail how the strike was carried out. 

Trump and administration officials have repeatedly blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some American cities.

The president on Tuesday repeated his claim — contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment — that Tren de Aragua is operating under Maduro's control.

In announcing the strike, Trump said the operation, which he said killed 11, was carried out in international waters. He also noted that the gang is designated by the U.S. government as a foreign terrorist organization.

Unlike its counterparts from Colombia, Brazil and Central America, Tren de Aragua has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, which last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.

“We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,” said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime, referring to the Venezuelan gang by its initials.

Still, with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for Tren de Aragua to one day delve deeper into the drug trade, he said. Meanwhile, the rhetoric from officials in Washington who would blame TdA as a proxy for all Venezuelan drug traffickers assures it will remain a target of intense U.S. government focus.

“It is almost impossible today to determine who is TdA and who is not,” said McDermott. “Deportations and statements from the United States suggest that TdA is now being used as a catch-all description for Venezuelan criminals acting abroad.”

Some international warfare experts are questioning the legality of the strike.

“Intentional killing outside armed conflict hostilities is unlawful unless it is to save a life immediately,” said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an expert on international law and the use of force at the University of Notre Dame Law School. “No hostilities were occurring in the Caribbean.”

Hegseth was opaque in his comments on Fox about whether Trump was looking to press for “regime change” in Venezuela.

“Well, that's a presidential decision,” Hegseth said. He added that “anyone would prefer that” Maduro “would just give himself up. But that's a presidential-level decision.”

The U.S. announced plans last month to boost its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels.

Maduro's government has responded by deploying troops along Venezuela's coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.

Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Tuesday's strike clearly shows governments in the region, not only Maduro, the paradigm shift brought on by the U.S. decision to declare Tren de Aragua and Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

“This is a United States that sees security differently,” Berg said. “They've just demonstrated the ability to use deadly force in the Western Hemisphere, and they've already told Mexico that they're going to do the same thing on Mexican territory if they don't get the level of cooperation that they want.”

A man has been arrested after police said he placed incendiary devices near a local fire station in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.

Slater Chaia of District Heights, Maryland, has been charged with possession of a destructive device and possession of incendiary material with intent to create a destructive device, both felonies, stemming from incidents of littering Capitol Heights Fire Station 805 with what a criminal complaint called "makeshift Molotov cocktails." He also faces a reckless endangerment charge. 

Surveillance video shows him walking up to the fire station's property with two plastic bottles, and putting both on the ground next to a flagpole. He then moves one of the bottles to the pavement a few feet away from the mailbox, according to the video. He then allegedly retreats back to the flagpole, grabs the second bottle and walks to the mailbox and places it inside.

He was caught on surveillance footage on Aug. 13 at around 8 a.m., but according to WUSA9, there were two more instances of Chaia placing devices near the station, one on June 1, and another on July 15. Neither of those were caught on video. 

Police posted photos of the distinctive Tom and Jerry cartoon-themed Members Only jacket Chaia was wearing in the footage. 

The bottles reportedly contained an incendiary liquid and a wick.

According to NBC 4 Washington, police believe that the fire station was specifically targeted, but they do not know why. 

"God forbid one of our young people get ahold of one of these devices and become harmed," Prince George's County Bureau of Homeland Security Deputy Chief James McCreary said.

McCreary said the first devices were ineffective, but they were becoming more dangerous.

"The initial devices were inert, but, again, they seem to be progressing," McCreary said. "The last device we had at this location could have been something, potentially, that would have harmed someone if it was able to be activated."

Watch live as Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, visits the White House to strengthen ties with President Donald Trump and make the case for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in his country.

Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, arrived at the White House on Wednesday, looking to strengthen his relationship with President Donald Trump and make the case that the United States needs to maintain its robust military presence in his country.

The visit to Washington is Nawrocki's first overseas trip since taking office last month. It comes after Trump took the unusual step of involving himself in the elections of longtime ally Poland, endorsing Nawrocki, who was backed by the conservative Law and Justice party.

Other news we're following today:








While President Trump referred to New Orleans as having a “crime problem,” city leaders swiftly pointed out that crime rates have dropped significantly so far this year.

Violent crime is down 20% compared to last year, the New Orleans Police Department reported in May. And murders had been reduced by a third, even when including the 14 victims of a Jan. 1 truck attack.

New Orleans City Council Vice President Helena Moreno condemned any notion of sending federal troops to New Orleans.

“This is about scare tactics and politicizing public safety,” said Moreno, the frontrunner in the mayor's race. “Ultimately leading to the misuse of public funds and resources to attempt to score political points. We cannot allow this and I will fight to prevent any federal takeover of New Orleans.”

Councilmember Oliver Thomas, another mayoral candidate, told The Associated Press via text message that he had not heard anything about federal troops coming to the city and this would be a “major overreaction!”City Councilmember Joe Giarrusso said any suggestion of bringing federal troops into New Orleans would be a “slap in the face” to local and state law enforcement.

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the strike on a boat carrying drugs from Venezuela shows that the U.S. will not tolerate drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.

He would not say when asked Wednesday on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” if the operation was a drone strike or how it was conducted.

“President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been,” Hegseth said, calling it “a new day.”

“And it won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,” he said.

Asked about regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said “that's a presidential decision.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser's announcement comes as the nation's capital looks to emerge from President Trump's federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Bowser's deal with the city's police officers includes a 13% pay increase as well as other incentives such as cost-of-living increases and an expanded take-home car program. Bowser has sought to add at least 500 officers for years, often publicly struggling with the D.C. Council over the issue. The department currently contains 3,188 sworn officers, with Bowser looking to boost that number up to around 4,000.

Last week, Bowser publicly acknowledged that Trump's decision to take over the MPD and flood the city with hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and National Guard troops has succeeded in driving down violent crime numbers. But she has also stated a belief that similar results could have been achieved simply by having more MPD officers in service.

“We've always believed that getting back to 4,000 officers was our goal,” she said Wednesday. “We don't need a presidential emergency.”

Federal authorities on Wednesday announced they had seized more than 661,000 pounds (300,000 kilograms) of chemicals used to produce methamphetamine and intended for labs run by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, along with Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, traveled to Houston to announce the seizure.

Standing in a federal warehouse in suburban Houston containing 1,300 barrels filled with the chemicals, Pirro told reporters the material had been seized last week from two vessels on international waters. Pirro declined to say specifically where the chemicals were intercepted but they had originated from China. After their seizure, the chemicals were brought to the Port of Houston.

The Trump administration has designated eight Latin American crime organizations, including the Sinaloa drug cartel, as “foreign terrorist organizations.” This gave Pirro's office the authority to execute the seizure under the terrorism forfeiture provision.

Pirro said authorities were still working on making arrests in the case.

“I'm having a conversation with him very shortly, and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said. He did not clarify if he was talking about Putin or Zelenskyy.

The president again reiterated that he thought bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would be “much easier” than it has proven to be.

Still, he said that the bloodshed in eastern Europe has to end, and expressed confidence that he'll be able to bring the conflict to a close.

“Not since the second World War has there been anything even close to this,” Trump said. He added, “They not soldiers from my country. This is my country. But I have a power to end things.”

After saying he was prepared to send the National Guard into New Orleans and Baltimore to help fight crime, Trump is now saying he's mulling doing similar in New Orleans.

“So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.”

State and local officials, many of whom are top Democrats, have sharply opposed troop presence in Chicago and Baltimore. Landry, though, is a Republican.

The president added “you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”

Wrapping up Wednesday's news conference, Khanna said a silver lining of the Epstein case might be its ability to bring together Democrats and Republicans.

“They're bringing us together as a country,” Khanna said, of the stories of accusers, gesturing toward Greene with a smile. “I've never done a press conference with Marjorie before.”

Speaking next, Greene echoed Khanna's comments denouncing what both portrayed as a widespread effort to protect Epstein's crimes from detection, to the accusers' detriment.

Massie ended with a plea for Americans to call their representatives and demand support for legislative efforts to release the files.Earlier Wednesday, the lawmakers said four Republicans had signed onto a bill on the files' release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has started his meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.

Their meeting Wednesday in Mexico City comes a day after Trump dramatically stepped up his administration's military role in the Caribbean with what he called a deadly strike on a Venezuelan drug cartel.

Earlier Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected Trump's suggestion that she is afraid of confronting Mexico's cartels because they have so much power.

“We respect a lot the Mexico-United States relationship, President Trump, and no, it's not true this affirmation that he makes,” she said.

Speaking to reporters before the Rubio meeting, she said what her administration planned to agree to with the United States is a “cooperation program about border security and the application of the law within the framework of our (respective) sovereignties.”

The president pushed back when asked why the U.S. carried out a lethal strike on a Venezuelan drug-carrying vessel on Tuesday instead of interdicting it and capturing the alleged smugglers. 

Trump said the strike would lead to drug smugglers thinking twice about trying to move drugs into the United States.

“There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that,” Trump said. He added, “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again. When they watch that tape, they're going to say, ‘Let's not do this.'”

The president said that “thousands and thousands of documents” had been released but that the “Democratic hoax” would continue.

“No matter what you do it's going to keep going,” Trump said. He added, “Really, I think it's enough.”

Democrats, but also some Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. And, while numerous documents have been released as part of the Epstein investigations, the majority contained information that was already public.

Trump's comments came after Epstein accusers held news conferences on Capitol Hill. One accuser asked Trump to come meet her at the Capitol so she could explain while the issue wasn't a hoax.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said his relationship with the heads of China, India and Russia are “very good” but “We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.”

Trump called the ceremony at the summit hosted by China “very, very impressive” and “beautiful,” and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin “were hoping I was watching.”

He said he felt the United States was slighted by China by not getting more of an acknowledgment for its role in winning World War II. China held a parade to recognize the 80th anniversary of the war ending.

The U.S. sanctioned a Chinese firm and its representatives on Wednesday, accusing them of involvement in making and selling synthetic opioids to Americans.

The firm Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which coordinated with the DEA and FBI in an investigation. 

“Illicit opioids coming from China are destroying American lives, families, and communities,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley. “We will use all of the tools at our disposal — including sanctions and prosecutions by our law enforcement partners — to stop this epidemic.”

China-based chemical companies are the primary source of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids entering the United States, regularly through Mexico.

People identifying themselves as Epstein accusers are calling on Trump for his help in making public remaining documents in the case.

Taking the microphone one by one following the lawmakers in Washington, several women referenced Trump's “power” and “influence,” calling on him to “help us, and let our voices be heard.”

The political clash over calls for releasing the files has flummoxed House Republican leadership and been a sticking point for the Trump administration.

Tensions boiled over in July when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a “client list,” even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department, but they mostly contain information already publicly known.

The appellate court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who said the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua, which Trump cited as justifying the deportation of Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison.

Lee Gelernt, who argued for the ACLU, said the use of “a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court. This is a critically important decision reining in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

To Trump's Department of Homeland Security, it was another decision in which “unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. This ruling will not be the final say on this matter. We are confident in our position, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”

The U.S. leader greeted his Polish counterpart at the South Portico of the White House with a hearty shoulder slap and exchange of big smiles.

The two stood side-by-side as four F-35 fighter jets flew over the White House, followed by another formation of four F-16s.

Trump and Nawrocki then went inside together.

The president said in a post on his social media network that if Hamas gives back all 20 hostages the group is holding, “things will change rapidly. IT WILL END!”

He did not offer any additional comment.

Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Ukrainian officials will “try to connect” with President Trump to hear about new ways to increase pressure on Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, speaking at a news conference in Denmark, recalled how he and Trump had previously discussed ways the United States could put pressure on Russia to lead President Vladimir Putin to engage in political negotiations over the war in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy recalled that he'd asked Trump to put “sanctions, tariffs, any pressure” he could on Russia if Putin didn't agree to a “diplomatic format of dialogue, not the dialogue by weapon.”

“When we speak about pressure, we mean air defense, we mean weapon deals, we mean drone production, and of course, of course, sanctions,” the Ukrainian leader said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

“Such signals we gave (the) president of the United States. He said ‘couple of weeks', and he will answer on this,” Zelenskyy said of Trump. “'Couple of weeks', in my understanding, it's two weeks or maximum three weeks. This Monday, two weeks ended.”

Attorneys for some alleged victims of Epstein and Maxwell also appeared alongside the lawmakers, in support of the discharge petition.

The lawyers, along with the lawmakers, stressed their view that pursuit of the release “is a nonpartisan issue.” Attorney Brittany Henderson implored authorities charged with redacting accusers' names from anything that is ultimately released to protect identities of women who don't want to be known publicly.

Just ahead of the news conference, women who identified themselves as victims in the case held their own news conference, calling for release of remaining documents. Some stood behind the attorneys and lawmakers as they spoke.

Along with Massie and Greene, fellow House Republicans Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have also signed the discharge petition.

A bipartisan set of House lawmakers has appealed to their colleagues to support a discharge petition that could force a House vote requiring the Department of Justice to release its Epstein files.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Wednesday during a Washington news conference that four Republican representatives have joined the effort, and that just two more GOP signatures are needed to cross the threshold for likely passage.

“There is something that is rotten in Washington,” Khanna said. “We've got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”

The lawmakers spoke a day after the House Oversight Committee publicly posted the files it has received from the Justice Department on the sex trafficking investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. The files mostly contained information that was already publicly known or available, but the release showed lawmakers' eagerness to act on the issue, quickly reviving a political clash that has flummoxed House Republican leadership and roiled the Trump administration.

Khanna was joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, another proponent of the petition, along with Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says when Trump called him recently to discuss the novel idea he thought: “That's genius.”

The idea is to give Republicans a chance to make their case to voters, who tend to reject the party in power during midterm cycles. Republicans are struggling to hold onto their majority in Congress.

Besides, the speaker added, Trump “loves a big show.”

They're working with Senate Republican Leader John Thune to make it happen.

“I think that's a done deal now,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a social media post by Trump on Wednesday that said he was conspiring with the leaders of North Korea and China against the United States.

Asked about the post at a news conference in Beijing, the Russian leader told journalists “the President of the United States is not without a sense of humor.”

“Over these four days, during negotiations of all kinds, both in formal and informal settings, no one has ever expressed any negative judgments on the current American administration,” Putin said.

Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a four-day visit. He took part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, held extensive talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with other leaders, and attended a military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also present at the parade. Kim and Putin held talks after the event.

The Russian leader also said everyone with whom he had spoken during his visit to China had “supported our meeting in Anchorage,” and expressed their hope that negotiations would end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

House Republicans emerged from a private meeting with White House officials rebranding Trump's signature bill: The Working Families Tax Cuts Act.

“We're so excited about that,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting.

Polling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.

The gathering comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers calls for the House to take up their bill that would force the Department of Justice to release its investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

It's an unusual grouping of lawmakers, including Republicans Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Democrat Ro Khanna. They're trying to use a rarely-used legislative maneuver to force a vote on their bill against the wishes of House Republican leadership.

“A nation that allows rich and powerful men to traffic and abuse young girls without consequence is a nation that has lost its moral and spiritual core,” Khanna said.

Around the news conference, a large crowd gathered with signs that said, “Believe the survivors,” and “Unlock the Epstein files.”

Attendance was mandatory at the basement session, a sign of Trump's grip on the GOP.

Despite their legislative success in passing Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts bill into law, Republicans held few town hall meetings this summer as they retool their pitch to voters.

The images from China offer a striking, maybe even sinister, message that there could be a new reconfiguration of rising power in Eurasia, an “Axis of Upheaval,” as one U.S. analyst has called it.

But there's also evidence that the events in Beijing are simply more of the self-interested, high-level jockeying that has marked regional power politics for decades:

Two days earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping huddled together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

The gatherings in China could be read as a defiant message to the United States and its allies. At the very least, they offered yet more evidence of a burgeoning shift away from a U.S.-dominated, Western-led world order, as Trump withdraws America from many of its historic roles and roils economic relationships with tariffs.

“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump posted in a social media message to Xi.

U.S. employers posted 7.2 million job vacancies in July, down from 7.4 million in June, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that layoffs rose slightly, and that the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was almost unchanged from June at 3.2 million.

The U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly due to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve and partly because Trump's trade wars have created uncertainty that is paralyzing managers making hiring decisions. The economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023.

Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and their families are rallying in front of the Capitol as they press Congress to force more disclosure in the criminal investigation into the late financier.

A political clash is unfolding in the House over how Congress should proceed in a matter that has rattled both House Republican leadership and the Trump administration. On Wednesday, speakers at the rally often grew emotional as they recounted how they were lured into Epstein's abuse, and they demanded government accountability for the actions of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

“Our demands are clear,” said Sky Roberts, whose late sister Virginia Giuffre was an outspoken survivor. “Ghislaine Maxwell must remain in a maximum security prison for the rest of her life. No leniency. No deals. No special treatment.”

Survivors also demanded that the Epstein files be released publicly and that anyone complicit be held accountable.

The special session agenda set by Kehoe also includes proposed changes to Missouri's ballot measure process.

One key change would make it harder for ballot initiatives to succeed. If approved by voters, Missouri's constitution would be amended so that all future ballot measures would need not only a majority of the statewide vote but also a majority of the votes in each congressional district in order to pass.

If such a standard had been in place last year, an abortion-rights amendment to the state constitution would have failed. That measure narrowly passed statewide on the strength of “yes” votes in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas but failed in rural congressional districts.

Missouri lawmakers are meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional map in ways that could improve the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress next year. The session was called by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and should run at least a week.

Missouri is the third state to pursue mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican lawmakers in Texas, prodded by Trump, was the first, approving a new map that increases the Republicans advantage in five more districts.

Democratic-led California fought back, asking voters to approve in November a plan to give Democrats a chance at winning five more seats.

Tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Florida's tuition waiver law was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling one of her signature achievements shows how much politics have shifted.

More than 6,500 students qualified for the waiver in Florida before DeSantis signed the bill revoking it as of July 1. At the University of Florida, a state resident pays about $6,380 in tuition, compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Now some of these students have switched to online programs to finish their degrees, and staying at home to avoid being detained.

Rubio is in Mexico City as President Claudia Sheinbaum was convening a security forum of all 32 Mexican governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor's office and security commanders. “Under no circumstance will we accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is detrimental to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the country,” she said Monday in her State of the Nation address.

Sheinbaum had been talking up a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that would protect Mexican sovereignty while combatting the flow of fentanyl north and weapons south. Sheinbaum sought to lower expectations Tuesday, saying it would be more like a memorandum of understanding to share intelligence.

“It is a relationship of respect and at the same time collaboration,” Sheinbaum said.

Trump suggested otherwise last month, saying: “Mexico does what we tell them to do.” 

All these hot-button issues for the Trump administration and its neighbors will top the secretary of state's agenda this week on his third trip to Latin America since becoming chief U.S. diplomat.

The trip comes as the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, including military deployments and what it said was a lethal strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel.

In talks with leaders in Mexico and Ecuador on Wednesday and Thursday, Rubio will make the case that broader, deeper cooperation with the U.S. is key to improving health, safety and security. But Trump has alienated allies in the region with persistent demands, threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions.

Trump will greet Polish president Karol Nawrocki at 11 a.m. for a bilateral meeting and lunch. No other events are listed on his public schedule.

At President Trump's news conference Tuesday, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked something that surely baffled those who avoided social media over Labor Day: “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” 

Doocy referred to questions about Trump's health that swirled through social media over the weekend. With a 50-minute appearance, Trump certainly put to rest rumors that he was dead or seriously ill. But for the news media, it quickly renewed questions about whether they were being diligent enough in investigating questions over a president's health, a year after they dealt with the same issues with his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president. Pictures showing him with bruises on his hands and apparent swelling in his legs circulated online recently, as did clips of misstatements in public, such as mistakenly referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month as “Kristi.” None of these is evidence of serious illness.

The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. It's a fairly common condition for older adults.

Friends, 

As a member in good standing of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, I am simply appalled by our beloved organization's resolution declaring the conflict in Gaza a “genocide.” Our elite association of academics, researchers, and randos, which costs upward of $125 to join yearly, has allowed its once-sterling reputation to be forever tainted. 

Why do I speak up? Need it be said that as a member of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, I am one of the “world's top scholars” on the matter of genocide. It's not me saying this. It's the BBC, as well as virtually every major news organization in the world. Apparently, an impressive-sounding organizational name is all one needs to get into the papers. None of the reporters bothered to investigate who the “scholars” voting on the resolution were. Not even the names of the draftees were shared — a lack of transparency that undermines our credibility. 

Take the Jew-baiting “human rights” activist Agnes Callamard, of Amnesty International, who contends that an “overwhelming majority of members of the world's leading genocide scholars” backed a resolution that finds what is happening in Gaza “meet[s] the legal definition of the crime.” That is not true. A week ago, I could have voted on the genocide resolution, and my expertise is predominantly in '80s and '90s indie rock. 

Indeed, according to our dear former two-term IAGS advisory board member Sara Brown, only 128 of the association's approximately 500 members participated. There was no “consensus” on the resolution despite our communications officer Emily Sample falsely claiming so to the Washington Post. We should really have a meeting about her future at our organization.

While we typically debate controversial resolutions in “a virtual town hall” (or so I hear), leadership declined to hold any discussions on this matter, according to Brown. As a member in good standing, I have access to the organization's LISTSERV, which shows there were zero comments on the resolution before its passage. 

The resolution itself is an embarrassing collection of half-truths and lies. It reads like the work of an earnest college freshman who believes hyperlinking a bunch of biased sources is tantamount to research. We repeat a litany of uncorroborated accusations made by Hamas and others. Remarkably, our resolution goes beyond the accusation of the terrorist organization. Hamas, for instance, has said that 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including 17,000 children. We contend that Israelis murdered 50,000 children alone, a completely concocted number. But, like Hamas, we don't bother making any distinction between combatants and innocents. As highly respected scholars, we should be better than the Gaza Health Ministry.

We then cite organizations that have altered their definition of “genocide” for this conflict to place the burden of proof on Israel rather than those making the accusation. Is this how world-renowned scholars do their work? Because it seems like a shoddy shortcut. We don't even link to the work of a single one of our members. 

The war, which started when Hamas sent an army into Israel to murder, rape, torture, and kidnap civilians, including children, is tragic. But our organization has now created a precedent that makes virtually every conflict a “genocide.” If Israel wanted to commit genocide, it would not be sending hundreds of thousands of metric tons of food and supplies to Palestinians in Gaza. It would not provide clean water and move the population away from war zones. Israel has gone out of its way to avoid civilian casualties while fighting combatants who hide behind noncombatants (something that we never mention). 

THE GOP'S OVERCONFIDENCE PROBLEM

If a handful of unnamed members of our organization are willing to distort reality, not to mention decency, to spread the propaganda of a terrorist state, what is our scholarship really worth? The genocide accusation is a hoax. I think they know it. I think that's why there was no debate, why the authors of the resolution aren't named, and why barely anyone voted. 

We can do better.

Sincerely, 

David Harsanyi (member in good standing of the International Association of Genocide Scholars since September 2025)

Live Updates


• Epstein files: On Capitol Hill, some Jeffrey Epstein survivors spoke publicly for the first time at a news conference, urging lawmakers to protect abuse victims. It comes as GOP leadership faces pressure for more transparency on the late convicted sex offender's case without going against the wishes of President Donald Trump, who has attempted to tamp down the political firestorm over Epstein.
    


            • Trump teases talk with Putin: During a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin “over the next few days.” Putin joined the leaders of China and North Korea in a show of force at China's military parade today.
    


• Crime crackdown: Trump floated the possibility of a federal crime crackdown in New Orleans — in addition to the previously stated Baltimore and Chicago — as the next cities his administration could target.
    


            Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she's encouraged President Donald Trump to meet at the White House with victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “I look forward to talking with President Trump about these women that I've met. I also encouraged him, already this morning, that he should have these women in the Oval Office. They deserve to be there,” Greene told CNN after today's bipartisan press conference with 10 survivors.
    


            Greene said she told Trump that she would be happy to put him in touch with the victims' attorneys to set up a meeting, but hasn't gotten an answer back.
    


                    “I am continuing to encourage him that these are the people that deserve to be in the Oval Office, not any of Jeffrey Epstein's rich, powerful friends that allowed this to happen to them, or anyone that may have been a part of it,” Greene said.
                





            Greene said it was an act of “cowardice” for a White House official to say it would be a “hostile act” to the administration for GOP lawmakers to support Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna's effort to force a House floor vote on their bill to release the full Epstein files, while the Justice Department is already cooperating with the House Oversight Committee.
    


                    “Everyone knows I've fought harder for President Trump for years now, and that person has their job because I fought so hard to help him get elected. And this isn't a hostile act towards the administration. The hostile act has been against these women for so many years now,” she said, adding that those who covered for Epstein committed the “real hostile act.”
                





            The Georgia Republican emphasized that no matter which party controls the White House or Congress, she “serves the American people.” Americans, she said, want the Epstein files released in full.
    


            President Donald Trump is looking to expand his federal crime crackdown, floating the idea of sending National Guard Troops to New Orleans next, in addition to Chicago and Baltimore.
    


            Meantime, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser is defending her move to extend the district's collaboration with federal law enforcement.
    


Here's the latest:



            Teresa Helm, a Jeffrey Epstein abuse survivor, slammed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Asked by a reporter about the Department of Justice interview Helm said:
    


                    “Her voice was elevated way before our voices were elevated here, today. And that same calm, manipulative voice that she had, so polite there that day with Todd Blanche was the same, polite, coercive, manipulative voice that I heard as she was grooming me to then send me off to home of Jeffrey Epstein where he would assault me.”
                





            Helm went on to say that nothing that Maxwell says can be believed because “she's been charged with perjury. I, myself, could sit there and listen and as I did. I sat there and listened to this woman's voice lie.”
    


            Helm criticized the lack of pushback from Blanche during the interview.
    


            “Does he even have the facts to be able to push back on her? We could sit there and push back. Why didn't we get to attend that? Why weren't we there that day? Or why wasn't even one of us consulted prior to that day in that meeting?” she asked.
    


            Helm said that she still finds Maxwell's voice “repulsive” and that it is still triggering.
    


            “I'm very angry to sit there and listen. The feelings that come up listening to this woman's voice is repulsive. Yes, I would say it's triggering. We all work very hard on healing and it's still gets to us after two decades,” she said.
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Maxwell.
    


            President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended a US military strike on what he described as a drug-laden boat off Venezuela's coast, addressing the operation a day after US officials confirmed that 11 people were killed aboard the vessel.
    


            The president emphasized the threat posed by the boat and claimed it was carrying “massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people, and everybody fully understands that.”
    


            “Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again,” Trump added, issuing what appeared to be a broader warning to other trafficking groups.
    


            “We have to protect our country, and we're going to. Venezuela has been a very bad actor. They've been, as you know, they they've been sending millions of people into our country, many of them Tren de Aragua, some of the worst gangs, some of the worst people anywhere in the world in terms of gangs,” Trump said in defense of his administration's decision.
    


            “But Venezuela has been very bad, both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country,” Trump continued.
    


            Trump said earlier this week that the United States had conducted a deadly military strike against an alleged drug boat tied to the cartel Tren de Aragua.
    


            The use of military force against Latin American drug cartels represents a significant escalation by the Trump administration and could have serious implications for the region.
    


            The Trump administration has declared that the Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro “is one of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world and a threat to the national security” of the United States. Caracas has always denied these accusations.
    


            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie warned that blocking his efforts to circumvent party leaders and force a vote on his bill to release all Jeffrey Epstein-related files would be “really bad for Republicans.”
    


            “I care most about the policy here, not the politics of it, but politically it's really bad for Republicans,” he told CNN's Manu Raju.
    


            “They should just have this vote and put it behind them. Eighty percent of Republicans. It's not just Independents and Democrats who want these files released. Eighty percent of Republicans support releasing these files. So they're at odds with our base right now, and particularly the MAGA base,” he said.
    


            Massie confirmed that House Speaker Mike Johnson, in a closed-door meeting, urged House Republicans not to support his discharge petition, to instead support a resolution backing the House Oversight Committee, “and he assured them he would give them political cover, that they would have it by voting for the rule.”
    


            Massie had pushed back in the room against the speaker, CNN previously reported.
    


            He later told CNN that his “message was to my colleagues. And my message to my colleagues was, don't set yourself up.”
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday appeared supportive of Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer subpoenaing other government agencies for Epstein-related records.
    


            “I expect they will. I think the Oversight probe is going to be wide and expansive, and they're going to follow the truth wherever it leads,” he told reporters Wednesday.
    


            He, again, argued that GOP Rep. Thomas Massie's discharge petition “has been made moot and unnecessary” because of the Oversight Committee's work and last night's release of DOJ documents.
    


            “What we're going to do is effectively deputize the Oversight Committee, which is the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, to go do a deep dive on this. And I think they're going to uncover things that have never been uncovered before,” he said.
    


            On a congressional stock ban, he said that he's “generally favorable of the policy.”
    


            “There's a couple of different ideas on the table and we have to build consensus on that, ‘cause you got to do it responsibily. So some of the ideas that have been put forward, I'm not in love with the details of. But I mean it's generally a policy I've always favored. But we have lots of different opinions on that in the conference and in Congress, so we got to work through it,” he told reporters.
    


            He also denied that calling the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” the “Working Families Tax Plan” was a rebranding.
    


            “It's not a rebranding. And what we have to do to sell it is tell the truth, and that's the beauty of it,” he said.
    


            US President Donald Trump welcomed Polish President Karol Nawrocki, a former historian and populist firebrand, to the Oval Office on Wednesday, after he endorsed the conservative politician earlier this year.
    


                    “Polish-American relations are very important, very strong,” Nawrocki said from the Oval Office, adding that relations are stronger than ever.
                





            Nawrocki, a champion of Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election in June and was sworn in last month. The conservative politician is an independent but is closely aligned with the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost its majority in the 2023 parliamentary elections.
    


            Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse PiS's illiberal reforms have become challenging since Nawrocki's election, in part because the Polish president enjoys far-reaching veto powers over bills passed by parliament. Last week, Nawrocki blocked a bill that would extend social welfare payments to Ukrainian refugees living in the country.
    


            On Wednesday, after Trump affirmed that American soldiers would remain in Poland, Nawrocki said: “This is the first time in Polish history, in (the) 20th century and the 21st century, that the Poles are happy that we have foreign soldiers in Poland.”
    


                    We have almost 10,000 soldiers, and this is the signal (to) the whole world, and also to the Russian Federation, that we are together,” he said, also touting Poland's NATO contributions.
                





            Nawrocki also gave a shoutout to the large Polish diaspora in the United States, claiming that most of them voted for Trump.
    


            Brad Edwards, a lawyer for numerous victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Wednesday that Donald Trump helped him with his investigation of the case back in 2009 as he implored the president to back survivors' current-day push for transparency.
    


            For his part, Trump called the latest push from lawmakers and victims of the disgraced financier a “Democrat hoax.” But Edwards said that was not Trump's posture more than a decade ago.
    


            At the time, Trump was not in public office and Epstein had just been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison for his crimes as part of a plea deal that has since faced criticism for being too lenient.
    


            “Back in 2009 and several times after that, he didn't think that it was a hoax then. In fact, he helped me. He got on the phone, he told me things that were helping our investigation. Our investigation wasn't looking into him, but he was helping us then,” Edwards said. “So at this point in time, I would hope that he would revert back to what he was saying to get elected, which is, ‘I want transparency.'”
    


            Both active in the Palm Beach social scene, Trump and Epstein flew together on a private jet and partied side by side at Mar-a-Lago. But Trump has since called Epstein a “creep” and said that before Epstein's death, they hadn't spoken in years. On Wednesday, one of Epstein's victims, Chauntae Davies, said that Epstein “bragged” about his close friendship with Trump.
    


            “His biggest brag forever was that he was very good friends with Donald Trump. He had an 8 by 10 framed picture of him on his desk with the two of them,” Davies said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Edwards assertion.
    


            President Donald Trump issued a warning Wednesday when asked about his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
    


            “I have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other,” Trump said from the Oval office.
    


            “Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it or unhappy, and if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen,” the president added in what appeared to be a veiled threat.
    


            Trump grew visibly agitated when questioned about the administration's actions – or lack there of – so far against Russia.
    


            “How do you know there's no action? Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside of China, they're almost equal. Would you say there was no action that cost hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia?” Trump said.
    


            “You call that no action,” he added. “And I haven't done phase two yet or phase three,” he said, hinting at further punitive steps.
    


            “If you remember two weeks ago, I did, I said, if India buys, India's got big problems, and that's what happens. So don't tell me about that,” Trump added.
    


            Despite repeated threats, the Trump administration has so far been reluctant to slap further sanctions on Russia in its continued efforts to reach a peace deal.
    


            President Donald Trump insisted Wednesday that he would avert a government shutdown later this month, even as he predicted no Democrats would back the GOP's funding measure.
    


            “We won't have any Democrat votes,” he said, adding that even if he devised the “greatest budget ever,” Republicans “wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats, because they've lost their mind.”
    


            Trump offered no explanation of how he plans to pass a funding bill along partisan lines, since the GOP doesn't hold the necessary 60 Senate votes to approve legislation on its own.
    


            Democrats have said that they plan to demand concessions from the White House in exchange for supporting a bipartisan measure before government funding expires at the end of September. Trump officials, however, have signaled little willingness to negotiate.
    


            Trump did appear to acknowledge his remarks could make those talks more difficult, attacking Democrats even as he acknowledged that “I don't want to burn the Republican Party with it.”
    


            “No matter what we did, no matter how good, you could give them everything that they've ever dreamed of and you wouldn't get one vote,” Trump said of Democrats.
    


            President Donald Trump said he would talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “over the next few days” when a reporter asked about the US leader's two-week deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.
    


            “I'm having a conversation with him very shortly and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing,” Trump said without specifying which leader he meant while taking questions in the Oval Office.
    


            A White House official later clarified that Trump was referring to Zelensky.
    


            “I'll be speaking with him over the next few days and we're going to see,” Trump added.
    


            Trump said on August 22 that he would give Putin “a couple of weeks” before enacting potential consequences against Moscow, after urging Putin and Zelensky to meet directly in hopes of ending the war. Trump said at the time, “I'll know in two weeks what I'm going to do.”
    


            Friday will mark two weeks since those remarks.
    


            Meanwhile, momentum around peace talks has stalled, with no sign that the Putin-Zelensky meeting the White House has pushed is happening. Putin this week floated a meeting in Moscow, which Kyiv has dismissed as an unserious proposal.
    


            The US president added today that he's “not happy with all the people,” lamenting how many have died in the war.
    


CLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to clarify that Trump was referring to an upcoming conversation with Zelensky and not Putin, according to a White House official. 



CNN's Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post.



            President Donald Trump floated the possibility of a federal crime crackdown in New Orleans, pointing to support from the state's Republican governor.
    


            “We're making a determination now: do we go to Chicago, or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland.
    


            He continued, “So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks.”
    


            Trump has repeatedly floated Baltimore and Chicago as the next cities his administration could target following his deployment of the National Guard to Washington, DC, and a federal takeover of the DC police department.
    


            But Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, both Democrats, have strongly pushed back against such intervention. DC is also significantly different from other cities because the federal government has more authority.
    


            Trump later again pointed to Baltimore as a city the federal government could “straighten out.”
    


            “Gov. Moore wanted me to go and walk through Baltimore with him. And I said, you know, ‘I think I'm a brave guy, but there's no reason to be stupid.' … We'd go into Baltimore, straighten that out very quickly, too,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump dismissed renewed calls for the full release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling the transparency push from lawmakers and victims of the disgraced financier a “Democrat hoax.”
    


            “This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday. “We've given thousands of pages of files, and I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going and going.”
    


            The president's remarks came as a group of Epstein abuse survivors gathered on Capitol Hill to speak out publicly in favor of releasing all the documents related to the investigation with appropriate redactions for privacy.
    


            One of them, Haley Robson, took direct aim at Trump's assertion, saying “there is no hoax. The abuse was real.”
    


            But Trump bristled at the fresh effort to get the files released, which has been spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, arguing that it's distracting from his administration's successes.
    


            “What they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is get people to talk about that,” he said. “We're having the most successful eight months of any president ever, and that's what I want to talk about. That's what we should be talking about, not the Epstein hoax.
    


            An attorney for numerous Jeffrey Epstein survivors said they will hold Speaker Mike Johnson and lawmakers accountable related to the Epstein case.
    


            “I can tell you that in the Oversight Committee meeting yesterday, they indicated that they were all for transparency, releasing the files, and asked us to hold them accountable. … So we intend to hold them accountable,” Brad Edwards said at the news conference today.
    


            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie called on his GOP colleagues to sign onto the push to force the full House to vote on a resolution that would require all documents related to Epstein to be turned over.
    


            “I'm not going to give up,” he said.
    


            Under the maneuver, known as a discharge petition, Massie would need just five more Republicans to force the bill to the floor since every Democrat is expected to sign on.
    


            Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna called the survivors who spoke at the news conference “American heroes,” underscoring the bipartisan effort to release more documents related to the Epstein case by adding, “I've never done a press conference with (GOP Rep.) Marjorie Taylor Greene before.”
    


            President Donald Trump suggested China's military parade was designed in part for him to watch – and he was.
    


            “I understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching – and I was watching,” Trump said of the event, where Chinese President Xi Jinping stood with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
    


            “My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Poland.
    


            Trump hosted Putin in Alaska last month to discuss an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, followed by a meeting with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. But frustrated with the pace of peace talks since, Trump has weighed how involved he should personally be.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin has been embraced on the world stage this week. The show of force in China caught the attention of Trump, who posted on social media Tuesday telling Xi to give his “warmest regards” to Putin and Kim as they “conspire against” the US.
    


            Trump said he thought it was a “beautiful ceremony” and “very impressive.”
    


            Lisa Phillips said that fellow victims of Jeffrey Epstein would work together to compile their own list of abusers if all of the information related to Epstein's case is not released.
    


            “Us Epstein survivors have been discussing creating our own list. We know the names. Many of us were abused by them,” Phillips said at today's news conference on Capitol Hill.
    


            “Now together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know who were regularly in the Epstein world. And it will be done by survivors and for survivors. No one else is involved,” she added.
    


            Phillips told reporters at the news conference to “stay tuned for more details.”
    


            Haley Robson, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse, pushed back against President Donald Trump's previous comments calling the firestorm around the Epstein case a “Democrat hoax.”



            Asked by reporter about the president's past comments, Robson said:
    


                    “Mr. President, Donald J. Trump. I am a registered Republican. Not that that matters, because this is not political. However, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax. We are real human beings. This is real trauma.”
                





            She asked Trump and the rest of the world to humanize survivors.
    


            “These women are real. … I would like Donald J. Trump and every person in America and around the world to humanize us, to see us for who we are and to hear us for what we have to say. There is no hoax. The abuse was real,” she said.
    


            Sky Roberts, Virginia Giuffre's brother, made an emotional plea to lawmakers to make the right choice and seek justice for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse.
    


                    “But here's my one ask: Look these survivors in the eye and tell them why. Then look, the people of the United States in the eye and tell them why. And then when you're alone, look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself why?” Roberts urged.
                





            Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Epstein's sex crimes, who also alleged Britain's Prince Andrew abused her when she was a teenager, died by suicide in April at age 41, her family said.
    


            Roberts said that the issue is not a political one. “This is not about left or right. This is about humanity. This is about doing what's right. And this is about ensuring that the future we leave behind isn't one where the powerful can hide behind their wealth, their influence and their money to evade justice,” he said.
    


            He asked lawmakers to not make the vote about money or power, but justice, appealing to their conscience.
    


            “Whether you're a dad, a mom, a brother or a sister, look your young ones in the face, look them in the eye and tell them you didn't stand against the very people who raped, molested and preyed upon children and young women. Tell them you were willing to negotiate a deal. Money should never be what makes something right or wrong. If you vote no, your stance will be clear,” he said.

            At the White House, President Donald Trump is greeting the Polish President Karol Nawrocki. They will hold a bilateral meeting and lunch soon.
    


            Fighter jets performed a flyover upon Nawrocki's arrival.
    


            We'll bring you updates as we get them.
    


            Marina Lacerda spoke out today for the first time about the abuse she suffered from Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “I never thought that I would find myself here. The only reason that I am here is because it feels like the people who matter in this country finally care about what we have to say,” Lacerda said, speaking from Capitol Hill alongside other victims and members of Congress.
    


            Lacerda said she was a 14-year-old immigrant from Brazil working three jobs to support her mother and sister when she was introduced to Epstein and told that she could make $300 to give massages. Lacerda said she had to be at Epstein's New York City apartment so often that she dropped out of high school before ninth grade.
    


            “It went from a dream job to the worst nightmare,” she recounted.
    


            Lacerda said the release of files related to the case could help remember the traumatic experiences she experienced that she has been unable to remember.
    


            “The worst part is that the government is still in possession right now of the documents and information about … that could help me remember and get over all of this maybe, and help me heal. They have documents with my name on them,” Lacerda said.
    


            Lacerda said she was never given an opportunity to testify about her experience and that she has feared for her life and her family's lives.
    


            “We could have saved so many women,” Lacerda said. “Why didn't they let me testify to help stop him?”

Novak Djokovic, a fan favorite at the U.S. Open, blew kisses to an unusually hostile crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium late Tuesday night after he defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets to advance to the semifinals. 

Fritz, the final American man left in the tournament, had home-court advantage and by the halfway point of the match, it appeared that the fans had successfully gotten under Djokovic's skin.

Fritz supporters continued to cheer for faults by Djokovic, and in the third set, when the match had surpassed 10:30 p.m., the Serbian tennis star had had enough.

"What are you going to do?" he repeated as he approached chair umpire Damion Dumusois. 

The crowd booed as Djokovic mocked Dumusois' attempts to silence the crowd: "Thank you. Please. Thank you. Please."

Dumusois appealed to Djokovic that, regardless of his interjection, "It's not going to help, Novak."

Fritz would eventually take the set but lose the match, 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.

"I was just trying to survive," Djokovic said after the match. "It's one of those days where you just have to grind."

Djokovic won 25 of the 42 points that lasted at least nine strokes. He saved 11 of the 13 break chances he faced and won 10 of the 11 points when he served and volleyed.

The 38-year-old moved on to the semifinals, where he will face world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. 

For Fritz, his loss meant another year without an American men's singles champion at any Grand Slam. The drought dates back to 2003, when Andy Roddick last won at the U.S. Open.

There's a Sununu in New Hampshire who is considering a run for the Senate in next year's midterm elections.

But it isn't former Gov. Chris Sununu, who earlier this year considered but decided against launching a bid in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in the key New England swing state.

It's former Sen. John E. Sununu, one of Chris Sununu's older brothers.

Top national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have held conversations with the former senator regarding a 2026 Senate campaign, a source told Fox News on Wednesday. 

RISING REPUBLICAN STAR ASHLEY HINSON LAUNCHES SENATE BID TO SUCCEED IOWA'S ERNST

A source familiar with the conversations confirmed to Fox News that Thune and former Sen. Cory Gardner, chair of the Senate Leadership Fund, which is the top super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, recently spoke with Sununu.

The source added that Thune and Gardner are cautiously optimistic that Sununu will launch a campaign, in a race that's expected to be competitive and expensive.

Sununu, a former three-term representative, defeated then-Gov. Shaheen in New Hampshire's 2002 Senate election. But the senator lost to Shaheen in their 2008 rematch. 

Shaheen announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek re-election in next year's midterms, and Republicans are hoping to flip the seat as they aim to not only defend but expand their Senate majority.

TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT FRONT-AND-CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS

Word that Sununu, who turns 61 this month, was mulling a Senate bid was first reported by NOTUS.

There are currently two major Republicans in New Hampshire's Senate race.

Former Sen. Scott Brown, who served as ambassador to New Zealand during President Donald Trump's first term in the White House, announced his candidacy in June. 

Ahead of his campaign launch, Brown had been crisscrossing New Hampshire since late last year, meeting with Republican and conservative groups.

A month later, in July, three-term GOP state Sen. Dan Innis launched a U.S. Senate campaign.

Trump, whose endorsement in Republican primaries is extremely influential, has remained neutral to date. 

Veteran Republican strategist John Ashbrook, a co-host of the popular "Ruthless" podcast, told Fox News Digital that "the more candidates getting into these races is an indicator that Republicans are on offense heading into an all-important midterm and that Trump's great success in the White House is actually wind in their sails as they pursue an effort to maintain the majority, that they should be able to maintain with good candidates on the field."

FOUR KEY SENATE SEATS THE GOP AIMS TO FLIP IN NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Four-term Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the state's First Congressional District, is the clear frontrunner for the Democratic Party's Senate nomination.

But progressive organizer and biomedical scientist Karishma Manzur is also running for the Democratic nomination.

Pappas took to social media on Wednesday to emphasize that "NH wants leaders who'll stand up to Trump and special interests to build an economy that works for all."

"Instead the GOP is scraping the bottom of the failed candidate barrel. Whether it's corporate sellout John E. Sununu or MAGA puppet Scott Brown, NH voters won't buy it," Pappas argued.

Senate Republicans enjoyed a favorable map in the 2024 cycle as they flipped four seats from blue to red to win back the majority.

But the party in power – the Republicans – traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections. Nevertheless, a current read of the 2026 map indicates the GOP may be able to go on offense in some key states.

In battleground Georgia, which Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.

SENATE DEMOCRATS RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES IN PUSH TO WIN BACK MAJORITY

They're also targeting battleground Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring at the end of next year, as well as New Hampshire.

Also on the National Republican Senatorial Committee's target list is blue-leaning Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith isn't running for re-election.

But the GOP is defending an open seat in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tills decided against seeking re-election.

Republicans are also defending an open seat in red-leaning Iowa, after Sen. Joni Ernst's announcement on Tuesday that she won't seek re-election next year.

And Republicans will likely be forced to spend resources to defend Sen. Jon Husted of Ohio – who was appointed to succeed former senator and now-Vice President JD Vance – as he faces off next year against former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.

Meanwhile, Democrats are also targeting moderate Sen. Susan Collins – who has yet to announce her expected 2026 re-election – in blue-leaning Maine.

            • Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un stood together publicly for the first time at a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II.
    


            • The event represents a defiant challenge to the US-led world order. In reaction, President Donald Trump accused China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the US.
    


            • The parade showcased hundreds of advanced weapons and featured more than 10,000 troops, revealing China's growing military power under Xi's push to modernize the world's largest standing army.
    


            Our live coverage has now ended. See the post below for a catch-up on the day's events and scroll further back for a look at the developments as they happened.
    


            You can also read our analysis of today's events here and see pictures from the parade, here.
    


            After a busy few days hosting foreign leaders from around the world, China rounded out events on Wednesday with an enormous military parade, followed by an elaborate musical gala.
    


            For the first time, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood side-by-side publicly, watching the military parade roll by in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
    


            As we end our coverage, take a look below what we've been following today:
    


            After a full day of events in Beijing, China's World War II commemorations have ended with a musical gala that lasted around an hour and a half.
    


            Actors danced and sang songs related to the war, performing on an elaborately designed stage with props and costumes. Dozens of actors took part in the performance.
    


            The gala, named “Justice Will Prevail,” was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
    


            The performance was watched by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, alongside high-ranking officials in the Chinese government.
    


            Xi greeted a number of World War II veterans who were also in attendance before the spectacle began.
    


            The performance was divided into five chapters, and featured some of China's most famous actors and performers. It showed pictures of the signing of the “Declaration by United Nations” in 1942, which affirmed the basic principles of universal human rights, as well as Japan's surrender in 1945.
    


            Towards the end of the performance, a voiceover called upon the people of China to lead the country forward.
    


            “Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, working tirelessly to comprehensively advance China's development and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization,” it said.
    


            A total of 26 foreign leaders have traveled to China in the last few days, with some attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Sunday and Monday, and others arriving for the country's military parade in Beijing that took place on Wednesday.
    


            Though Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were indisputably the guests that gained the most global attention, several other heads of state also took part in the events.
    


            Here's some of the other officials who were in attendance:
    


            Retired Navy Admiral and CNN military analyst, James Stavridis, weighed in on the united front presented by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at today's parade.
    


            “If I were advising Vladimir Putin I would say, be careful what you wish for with China,” Stavridis told John Berman on CNN News Central. “Because you are ultimately going to end up as a very junior partner in that relationship.”
    


            The former naval officer believes the display of solidarity between China's President and Putin is an orchestrated move, part of Xi's wider effort to establish an alternative world order that can challenge the US and its Western allies.
    


            “Xi is smart,” Stavridis said. “He's manipulating Putin. But yes, Putin is feeling pretty good.”
    


            Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said that Donald Trump claiming there is a “conspiracy” against the United States shows that the US president has a “sense of humor.”
    


            After the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea met in China, Trump wrote Tuesday on Truth Social to Chinese leader Xi Jinping: “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
    


            Speaking Wednesday in Beijing, Putin said “the US president does not lack a sense of humor.”
    


            Putin said that he and Trump have developed “good relations,” and that none of the world leaders who joined the summit in China “expressed negative judgments about the current US administration.”
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is willing to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Moscow.
    


            Speaking to the media in Beijing, Putin said US President Donald Trump had asked him to hold talks with Zelensky.
    


                    “Donald asked me if it was possible to hold such a meeting. I said yes, it is possible. In the end, if Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow. Such a meeting will take place,” Putin said.
                





            Earlier in his speech, the Russian leader stressed that he “never ruled out” meeting Zelensky, but questioned whether there is “any point” in such a meeting.
    


For context: Putin's proposal is almost certain to be a non-starter for Kyiv. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukrainian authorities say they have foiled multiple alleged Russian plots to assassinate Zelensky.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that every country has the right to choose how it ensures its own security, including Ukraine.
    


            But the Russian president stressed, while speaking to the media in Beijing, that “the security of one country cannot be achieved at the expense of another country,” reiterating that Moscow opposes Kyiv joining NATO.
    


            Putin's comments come a day before Ukraine's Western allies are set to meet to discuss plans to guarantee the country's future security in the event of a halt to Russia's invasion.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking to the media in Beijing now after attending China's military parade, where he appeared alongside leader Xi Jinping and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
    


            We'll bring you updates when we have them, stay with us.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin is enjoying another moment in the international spotlight on his visit to China, using the occasion to showcase his partnership with a key military ally: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            The massive military parade in Beijing Wednesday was Chinese leader Xi Jinping's show, but Putin also met on the sidelines with Kim, who has sent both soldiers and ammunition to support Russia's war on Ukraine.
    


            Putin praised Pyongyang on Wednesday for sending troops, saying North Korean soldiers “fought courageously and heroically” on the front lines against Ukrainian forces.
    


            After a two-and-a-half hour meeting with Kim following the parade, the two leaders shared a hug, and Putin was heard extending an invitation to his North Korean counterpart to visit Russia.
    


            Western officials estimate around 4,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting on Russia's side from a contingent of around 12,000, deployed primarily to Russia's Kursk border region to help repel a Ukrainian incursion.
    


            The military alliance is now in the open after months of initial secrecy. Kim recently publicly mourned his country's casualties and North Korea has released a propaganda video glorifying the soldiers fighting on Russia's side.
    


            It's a not-so-subtle display of military resolve by Putin just weeks after meeting US President Donald Trump in Alaska to talk about a possible end to the war.
    


            In remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit meeting ahead of the parade, Putin seemed to indicate that he had not budged one inch from the position he held when he launched the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, blaming the West for what he described as the root cause of the conflict: the 2014 Maidan revolution that ended with pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country after a violent crackdown.
    


            And if Putin's resolve to continue the war on Ukraine was in question, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine as Russia rained more than 500 drones and two dozen cruise missiles overnight as the Kremlin leader attended the military parade in Beijing.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin talked with Luong Cuong, the president of Vietnam, on Wednesday evening, in the last scheduled meeting of Putin's trip to Beijing, according to the Kremlin.
    


            Images posted to social media by the Kremlin show the pair smiling and shaking hands in front of their countries' flags, as well as sitting down for the event in the Chinese capital's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
    


            According to a Kremlin translation of Cuong's remarks, the Vietnamese leader told Putin that “every Vietnamese citizen values ​​the great and kind assistance that the Soviet Union and Russia provided us before, when we fought for our freedom, and now, when we are building our country.”
    


            Cuong congratulated Russia on “the great achievements” it “has made over the past time,” the Kremlin added.
    


            “You have overcome many difficulties. We believe that Russia under your leadership will become great, will become a pillar protecting peace, justice and stability. We believe (in it) and wish you success,” he continued, according to the Kremlin.
    


            More than 50,000 people gathered at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Wednesday to witness Xi Jinping's staggering show of military might.
    


            The spectacle also served as a gathering of world leaders, many of whom are part of a growing bloc of illiberal allies seeking to challenge American leadership.
    


            For many people in the West, the defining images of the parade will not be the goose-stepping troops or the nuclear-capable missiles – but rather the sight of Xi standing side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – which is being seen as an unprecedented show of solidarity against the US and its allies.
    


            Moscow hopes US President Donald Trump's claim that Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping are conspiring against America was meant “figuratively,” the Kremlin has said.
    


            As China's military parade got underway in Beijing, Trump posted on Truth Social: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
    


            Speaking to journalists on the sidelines following the Putin-Kim summit Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “no one is plotting any conspiracies” and expressed hope Trump's statement was meant “figuratively, not literally.”
    


            Peskov also added Russia's relations with partners in the East, especially with China and North Korea, as well as meetings within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and other summits, are carried out for the good of their nations, and not against anyone.
    


            “The principle is for the benefit of the peoples of our countries, and not against third countries,” he said.
    


            Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said earlier Wednesday: “I want to say that no conspiracies have been arranged, no one has been conspiring, no conspiracies at all, and moreover, none of these three leaders have even entertained such thoughts.”
    


            Turning our attention back to China's military parade for a moment and let's take a look now at some of the most standout images of the weapons showcased on Wednesday.
    


            More than 50,000 spectators gathered to watch military vehicles, missiles, drones and other weapons roll through Beijing, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
    


            China introduced its newest intercontinental ballistic missiles in years, wheeling the massive DF-61 weapons around on mobile platforms. The DF-61 designation was last seen in the 1970s, according to the Germany-based Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy.
    


            Air-defense lasers were displayed, including one large laser that state-run TV said would be mounted on warships. A land version of the weapon was also shown to spectators.
    


            Two extra-large undersea drones also debuted at the parade, with images showing them dwarfing nearby soldiers.
    


            Scroll down to see a selection:
    


            Chinese leader Xi Jinping's unveiling of advanced weapons at Wednesday's military parade, which included an intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs, was a way of sending a message to the West, a leading military analyst told CNN today.
    


            “China is moving much more rapidly in this critical military technology area than the United States is.” Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in an interview with Rosemary Church earlier.
    


            “They're gaining an advantage that will give them the ability to make it much more difficult for the US and its allies to be able to project power into the Western Pacific in a crisis.”
    


            The leaders' comradery offers a challenge to the West, and an insight into Xi's vision of a new world order, Davis believes.
    


            “It's about intimidation. It's about asserting China's reality, or China's perception, that China's rise is unstoppable.” he added.
    


            Davis sees Xi's showcase of weaponry and display of solidarity with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a warning to the West, particularly regarding Taiwan.
    


            “China is saying to Taiwan, we will impose unification on Taiwan, against the wishes of the Taiwanese people, through military force at a time of our choosing and we're building up the military capabilities to do that.” Davis added.
    


For context: At Wednesday's parade, Xi presented a united front alongside Putin and Kim. The leaders were pictured publicly together for the first time as they walked through Tiananmen Square.
    


            Xi Jinping staged a staggering show of China's military power today, rallying some of the world's most powerful authoritarian leaders behind his vision for a new world order as US President Donald Trump wages a global trade war and reshapes American alliances.
    


Here are some talking points from the day:



Military spectacle: The parade showcased a mix of conventional weaponry and advanced technologies, including air-defense lasers, stealth fighter jets, anti-ship missiles, its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, undersea drones, and robot dogs – highlighting China's significant investment in modern warfare capabilities.
    


            Rows of soldiers goose-stepped in perfect unison — long a hallmark of authoritarian regimes' militaries.
    


Autocratic trio: One of the most striking images of the day was Xi walking toward the Tiananmen rostrum, flanked on either side by Putin and Kim, with the other world leaders following behind. It was a clear statement of unity between the strongman leaders, who share a vision for an alternative world order that can counter the US and its Western partners.
    


Putin invites Kim to Russia: After the parade, the two leaders held closed-door talks for more than two hours, and Putin invited Kim to visit Russia. Before those talks, Putin thanked North Korean troops for fighting for Moscow against Ukraine, and Kim said his country would support Russia “as brothers.”



Family affair: Kim also brought two members of his family to Beijing, photos show – his sister Kim Yo Jong, believed to be one of his closest confidantes and advisors, and a young girl believed to be his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who has sparked speculation about being his potential successor.
    


Trump weighs in: US President Donald Trump wrote a sarcastic social media post as the parade got underway, saying: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” A Russian presidential aide responded by saying: “No one has been conspiring.”
    


            A Kremlin pool reporter captured some behind-the-scenes color from the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after attending China's massive military parade Wednesday morning.
    


            In a post on his Telegram channel, pool reporter Alexander Yunashev shared video of what appeared to be Kim's staff cleaning up the room after the two-and-a-half hour meeting between the two leaders.
    


            In a caption accompanying the post, Yunashev speculated that the North Korean staffers were wiping out any traces of Kim's presence in the room, noting that the staffers “took away the glass from which he drank, wiped the upholstery of the chair and those parts of the furniture that the Korean leader touched.”
    


            After the meeting, Yunashev added, “Putin and Kim left the office very satisfied and went to drink tea in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
    


            Yunashev is a reporter for the pro-Kremlin tabloid Life News; his Telegram bio describes him as a 15-year veteran of the Kremlin pool.
    


            It is not immediately clear why the staff would clean the meeting room, but some genetics experts have suggested that DNA can be used to collect information on the health of world leaders.
    


            Let's take a look back at some of the most striking images from the parade - those featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            The three leaders stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing on Wednesday, in what marked the first time they have been pictured publicly together.
    


            The trio appeared to be in good spirits, and were seen smiling and talking animatedly to each other throughout the day.
    


            The speaker of South Korea's parliament, Woo Won-shik, shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before the two watched a Chinese military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, marking the first known contact between Kim and a South Korean official since June 2019.
    


            In that year, Kim met with then-US president Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in at the Panmunjom, located within the Demilitarized Zone.

A roundtable discussion among leading MAGA intellectuals suggests they might be suffering from success.

What happens when you put four of the Trump right's leading intellectuals together in a room? You see what it looks like when a political movement gets high on its own supply.

The conversation in question is a recently published two-hour video roundtable hosted by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an organization dedicated to educating and connecting young conservatives. The panelists are tech monarchist Curtis Yarvin, “postliberal” political theorist Patrick Deneen, the culture war activist Chris Rufo, and globetrotting journalist Christopher Caldwell.

Prior to Trump, Caldwell was the only member of the panel with a claim to real influence. Since, however, each has become a defining figure in the pro-Trump coalition. Yarvin's ideas helped inspire DOGE. Deneen is a major influence on Vice President JD Vance. Rufo shaped Trump's war on higher ed, and Caldwell's ideas influenced its attack on civil rights law.

On a casual watch, their conversation seems like a debate over the American experiment. Yarvin is opposed, repeatedly suggesting that the US take lessons from French autocrats like Louis XIV and Napoleon. The other panelists disagree, arguing that it's possible to build a better America by making the current system more right-wing.

But what's actually important is how much all four of them agree about what a “more right-wing” America should look like.

“We all have strong opinions — agreements, disagreements — but it all seems like we're moving in the same direction,” Rufo says near the roundtable's end. “We can hash out the ideas among ourselves [because] we had the big debate with the left between 2020 and 2024. I think we've effectively won that debate.”

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

That overall direction, it is clear, is giving more and more power over our lives to Donald J. Trump. Over and over again, the speakers praise Trump's consolidation of power over the executive branch and urge him to go further, ignoring or mocking concerns about legality and democracy. Yarvin's authoritarian provocations aren't immediately dismissed or scorned by his co-panelists, but serve as a conversational focal point that permits the others to indulge their own radicalism. Their shared ambition is explicitly revolutionary, aiming not merely to transform the government but also to remake the very souls of American citizens.

“I think the aim should be not simply to dismantle, but to replace,” Deneen says. “And not just replace the government, but replace the America that — in some ways — fostered and brought it into being.”

But that's abstract. To understand not just how radical, but how weird the pro-Trump right has become, take these three moments from the conversation:

About 20 minutes into the discussion, Yarvin proposes a distinction between two types of Americans that the other panelists rather like (they return to it repeatedly throughout the two hours).

On the one hand, Yarvin says, you have “modern” Americans who flourish in a society that gives them control over the direction of their own lives. On the other hand, you have “pre-modern” Americans who “cannot take care of themselves in a civilized society.” He picks, as an example of the latter, “a gangbanger in Baltimore” — and proceeds to propose a flagrantly illegal scheme for putting their entire life under control of a local church:

You are going to get your welfare check from your minister. And you are part of that community. You don't pay taxes — basically, your relationship with the state is intermediated through your church. Your minister can drug test you, he can assign you work, he can put an AirTag on you, he can tell you where to go [and] where not to go.

Yarvin never says the word “Black,” but we all know who “gangbanger in Baltimore” is supposed to refer to. What he's describing, in short, is the government turning Black men who it labels “gangbangers” into serfs whose lives are fully managed by state-blessed churches. This isn't a call to reinstitute slavery, but it's pretty damn close.

And nobody objects to this in principle! Not one person says, “Hey, what you're talking about is both a gross violation of human rights and quite a bit racist.” In fact, the rest of the panel takes Yarvin's ideas and runs with them.

The first response, from Caldwell, is that Yarvin's scheme would be unconstitutional under the First and 14th Amendments. The First Amendment prohibits the federal government from establishing a religion, and the 14th “incorporates” the First, a legal term for applying the protections in the Bill of Rights to state governments. The state of Maryland cannot legally turn the population of Baltimore into church property because that would effectively establish a religion.

After pointing this out, Caldwell then suggests repealing the 14th Amendment. It's not exactly clear if he thinks that's a good idea, or suggesting it's a big problem for Yarvin that his plan would require something as big as repealing an amendment.

Before Caldwell can fully clarify, Deneen interjects with a different proposal: for the Supreme Court to un-incorporate the First Amendment. He wants, quite explicitly, for the Court to allow states to make certain religions official and privileged — describing this as a way that people can live together in a divided country.

“Religion, in the original Constitution, was officially established,” Deneen declares (dubiously). “The First Amendment was written to allow for the establishment of religion in the states.”

The point here is not merely that these ideas are wild and illiberal (imagine, say, an Alabama where the dictates of the Southern Baptist Church enjoy force of law). It is that Yarvin's bizarre ramblings about Baltimore, which should be dismissed by any sensible person, were instead used as a jumping-off point for various other radical schemes designed to transform the American social compact.

Around the 40-minute mark, the conversation turns to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — whose tenure, nearly everyone agreed, prefigured the aggressive use of political power Trump is currently deploying. Rufo worked closely with DeSantis, particularly his attempt to impose state controls on higher ed, and spent much of his conversation singing the governor's praises.

His biggest critique, in fact, was that DeSantis erred strategically by running against Trump.

“He would have been better off saying, ‘Hey, I'm very popular, Florida should repeal term limits and I will rule Florida for 25 years,'” Rufo moots.

Not to be outdone, Yarvin proposes that DeSantis should have ramped up his “heresies” against American liberalism “by 10x” or even “100x.” He suggests DeSantis should have established “a branch of the Boy Scouts, where they're the Florida Scouts, where they wear Florida uniforms.”

Deneen immediately replies that “that's a good idea” — prompting a bit of nervous laughter given that, as Rufo notes, “it's been tried before.” I took that as a reference to the Hitler Youth, though Yarvin swiftly clarified that he was thinking of the Young Pioneer groups in the Soviet Union and Communist China.

As with the Baltimore discussion, nobody is willing to directly attack Yarvin on the obvious grounds: In this case, that totalitarian youth indoctrination shouldn't be a model for policy in 21st-century America. Remarkably, Rufo tries to defend DeSantis by arguing that he actually did something like what Yarvin wanted — specifically by reviving the Florida State Guard, a state militia that had been inactive since 1947.

Caldwell did challenge Yarvin somewhat, arguing that “not every reform benefits from being deptupled.” But note that his objection was not the direction of change — authoritarian — but rather the size and speed of the change.

Nearly an hour and a half into the video, the panelists get into an argument about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. There was consensus that its true purpose was not efficiency, but rather conducting an ideological purge. Their debate was about the wisdom of using “efficiency” as window dressing.

Caldwell argues that Musk's talk of efficiency was a “necessary smoke screen” to hide its true purpose from the public. Had the Trump administration been honest about DOGE's true purpose, which is firing anyone who disagreed with it, they would have faced significant mass resistance.

“It's a much less acceptable story to present to the public than ‘we're saving money,” he argues.

Rufo, largely backed by Deneen and Yarvin, takes exception. He claims that Trump and Musk should have openly claimed that they had a mandate to remove liberals from the state, to conduct a “systematic extirpation” of anyone in the federal government who might have qualms about their agenda.

“President Trump won. So he gets to determine who is in his administration,” Rufo says. This efficiency talk was “a mistake that Elon made, because he thought that DOGE was a clever meme…and that he is a libertarian.”

Once again, the shared premise here is more important than the surface disagreement. There is, for the most part, a general sense that an ideological purge is basically a good idea. Much like the Florida youth cadres discussion, the kind of behavior that's widely seen as a mark of democratic backsliding and authoritarian mismanagement in other countries is seen by the panelists as a masterstroke in the war on liberalism.

There are moments, in the conversation, where it appears as if Caldwell is willing to question this premise. “It's a corrosive thing to say that you can't work in the federal government if you believe this-or-that,” he says.

But challenged by Rufo, who explicitly endorses such a political test for public employment, he reverts back to the public relations argument — saying the problem with Rufo's position is that “it doesn't command majority support.”

Caldwell is no moderate. He has repeatedly written favorably about foreign right-wing authoritarians, like Viktor Orbán and Narendra Modi. In his book on civil rights, he writes that white people “fell asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.”

Yet in this conversation, he is clearly the voice of restraint relative to the other three panelists. His willingness to give on the DOGE question reflects the fact that he is, in fact, no moderate — he is a radically aggressive culture warrior, just one who is somewhat less open about his authoritarian means than Yarvin or Rufo (who explicitly describes himself in the conversation as producing “propaganda” professionally).

I would call it a mask-off moment for the right's intellectual cadres. But I think the mask has been off for quite some time.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Carlie was hoping to spend her senior year savoring her final moments on the palm tree-lined campus of the University of Central Florida. Instead, she sits at home alone, logging on to online courses, afraid to leave her apartment and run the risk of being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

A few months ago, Carlie was studying public relations in Orlando, envisioning one day working for nonprofits that help students like her. Thanks to in-state tuition and private scholarships, Carlie had been living a life she had only dreamed of in Haiti, a country she left behind at 13 years old.

Now, she's one of thousands of Florida students whose education is being delayed or derailed after state lawmakers revoked a 2014 law that let residents who are in the country illegally qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. 

Across the country, tens of thousands of college students without legal status are losing access to in-state tuition as part of an immigration crackdown carried out by President Donald Trump and his allies.

“It feels like all my hard work means nothing. Like, one day I can just lose it,” said Carlie, who spoke on condition of being identified by only her first name because she fears being deported.




When Florida lawmakers passed the tuition waiver law more than a decade ago, it was a bipartisan effort championed by then-state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, a Miami Republican who went on to become Gov. Ron DeSantis' lieutenant governor. That a decade later Nuñez would support dismantling what had been one of her signature achievements is a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have shifted toward Trump's priorities.

According to state data, more than 6,500 students qualified for what's known as the out-of-state tuition waiver during the 2023-2024 school year. That waiver was revoked as of July 1, after DeSantis signed the bill repealing the tuition cuts.

The cost difference is substantial. At the flagship University of Florida, a state resident is estimated to pay about $6,380 in tuition for the 2025-2026 academic year compared with about $30,900 for a nonresident student. Housing, transportation and other expenses can add another $17,000 or more.

Florida's state colleges and universities don't specifically track the enrollment of students without legal status, but some immigrant advocates say they expect fewer students to attend in-person classes, and many to give up on college altogether.

Diego Dulanto Falcon earned a bachelor's in psychology thanks to the tuition waiver. Now he's pursuing his master's in public health at the University of South Florida. 

In losing access to in-state tuition, Dulanto Falcon said students without legal status are being cut off from a range of opportunities.

“Fully undocumented students, they have absolutely no options,” Dulanto Falcon said. “They either work under the table or they just don't work at all.”

Going to high school in Miami, David stacked his schedule with dual enrollment and Advanced Placement classes. He hoped to attend college and become a radiologist or physical therapist. David, who was born in Honduras, said that now feels impossible for students like him without legal status. While his friends went off to universities like Duke and Florida State, David went to work at McDonald's. 

He spoke on condition of being identified only by his middle name because he fears deportation.

“When you come into this country and your parents make the sacrifice and you're a kid, all they tell you is focus on school,” David said. “I did just that.”

But now, without the tuition waver, he said he can't afford college.

Around the country, programs offering in-state tuition rates to immigrants that once had wide bipartisan support increasingly have come under criticism from Republicans. In legal challenges, the Trump administration has argued the benefits are unconstitutional.

The Justice Department has been suing states to end tuition breaks, starting with Texas in June, followed by Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Meantime, the U.S. Department of Education is investigating colleges that offer scholarships to students without legal status.

Rosie Curts, a high school math teacher in the Dallas Independent School District, worries she won't be able to motivate her students to learn algebra if they feel college is out of reach. A Texas law gave college students without legal residency access to in-state tuition for decades before a federal judge blocked it in June.

“The idea that that can all be snatched away from them in such a cruel fashion is demotivating to the whole educators' mindset,” Curts said in a call with reporters.

In Orlando, Carlie had a private scholarship to attend Central Florida, but it only covered the in-state tuition rate. 

She was able to enroll as an online student at Purdue Global University, but she said some of her credits didn't transfer and she had to change her major, delaying her graduation.

Going to school in-person in Florida was no longer an option after more than a dozen colleges and universities, including UCF, signed agreements with ICE allowing them to carry out immigration enforcement on campus, she said. 

“I chose online school because I simply don't feel safe,” Carlie said.

Living hours away from family in Miami, Carlie worries that if she was detained, it could be days before someone noticed she was missing. It's much safer to stay inside, she said, living on food she gets delivered to her apartment as she tries to finish her education.

“I'm trying to get my life back on track,” Carlie said. “I can't stay home forever.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The head of the European Parliament's trade committee said Wednesday he has “doubts” about aspects of the EU's trade deal with the Trump administration and predicted the deal could be amended during the legislative approval process. 

“A lot of questions are there, and I guess there will be some amendments,” said committee chairman Bernd Lange, adding that “myself and also some colleagues of mine have doubts about the deal.”

Lange stopped short of outright opposing the agreement struck July 27 between the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on European goods while lowering EU tariffs on U.S. cars and industrial goods to zero; some EU goods including aircraft, cork and generic pharmaceuticals, were exempted from the 15% rates. 

The deal has had a mixed reception in Europe, with business associations saying it imposes high costs that will impede exports to the U.S. Von der Leyen says that it will lower a painful 27.5% tariff on autos and bring stability and predictability for businesses.

Lange however said “there is no security or predictability,” citing a U.S. decision two weeks after the deal was struck to include some 400 different goods containing steel such as pumps and motorcycle under a 50% steel and aluminum tariff instead of the 15% tariff. 

A top EU trade official urged the committee to approve the deal, saying the rate was low enough to keep trade flowing and maintain EU companies access to the U.S. market while avoiding a worse trade conflict. “You need to look at the alternative,” said Sabine Weyand, director general for trade. 




The agreement has been set down only in a 3 1/2 joint statement that left room for further talks on key issues. 

Trump faces questions about whether he exceeded his legal authorities by declaring a national emergency under a 1977 law to impose the broad tariffs. A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a previous lower court ruling that the president lacked the power to exact tariffs of that magnitude without going through Congress or using other legal mechanisms, a decision that Trump said Tuesday will in turn be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump aroused concern Aug. 26 by threatening tariffs in response to EU digital regulation, which EU officials said were not part of the deal. 

“Where will it end - we are just getting more and more demands from Trump,” said deputy Saskia Bricmont, a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance group.

Parliamentary action would be needed to implement the EU side of the tariffs deal. Lange did not say what the amendments might contain. The leader of one group in parliament, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, has come out against the deal but the group has only 136 seats in the 720-seat parliament and cannot stop the deal by itself. Lange is a member of the group.

The European Commission underlined its determination to expand cooperative trade to other partners beyond the US, on Wednesday sending free trade deals with Mexico and the Mercosur trading bloc in Latin America for ratification by member states. 

The Mercosur deal would create what EU officials call the world's largest free trade zone with 700 million people and lower high tariffs on EU farm exports in Latin America. It also would protect some politically sensitive EU farm products, particularly beef, in an attempt to mollify objections from EU farm lobbies in France and Poland. 

A limited amount of Mercosur beef - equal to around 1.5% of the European market - would face a moderate 7.5% tariff, but quantities above that would be hit with prohibitively high rates. There is also 6.3 billion euros in support for farmers in case of unexpected market disruptions.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem moved on Tuesday to fire multiple employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, accusing them of consuming pornographic content on their government-issued devices during work hours.

“These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography,” Noem said in a statement, noting at least one FEMA official consumed “racially charged” pornography that “involved bestiality.”

The Department of Homeland Security's statement cites two instances of inappropriate conduct.

The Washington Examiner contacted DHS for confirmation on how many workers were fired for consuming pornography on the job.

The workers were employed at the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Bluemont, Virginia.

“Under President [Donald] Trump's leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” Noem added. “For decades some of these bureaucrats engaged in every act imaginable instead of safeguarding the American people from natural disasters. That ends now.”

In July, the DHS Insider Threat Operations Center first identified an employee who used sexually charged language on a chatbot website that read the comments back in an accent.

One month later, the DHS center determined a government contractor stationed at the FEMA location accessed Reddit nearly 600 times over the course of a month and engaged in sexually explicit conversations online. Some of the content accessed included sexually graphic photos and videos, according to DHS.

Following its investigation, the department also noted that nearly half of FEMA employees frequently log into social media platforms while working.

Since taking office, Noem has been winding down operations at FEMA as Trump threatened to dismantle the agency.

Just last week, DHS announced that she had fired two dozen employees in FEMA's IT department who “brazenly neglected basic security protocols.” Their ineptitude was said to have caused “massive cyber failures,” including an agency-wide lack of multi-factor authentication when logging in.

A new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found roughly 2,500 FEMA employees have left the agency between January and June, a 10% decrease in its workforce.

'The Five' co-hosts discuss 'Squad' member Rashida Tlaib refusing to say whether she condemns 'children's heads being chopped off' by Hamas terrorists. 

FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is facing a GOP-led censure resolution on Wednesday after her fiery remarks at a pro-Palestinian conference.

Tlaib spoke at the People's Conference for Palestine in Detroit over the weekend, when she condemned both Democrats and Republicans for supporting Israel as its military campaign in Gaza continues.

Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., who introduced the measure, accused Tlaib of "vilifying her colleagues, endangering the lives of Jewish people, and celebrating terrorism."

"Her conduct is beneath that of a civilized person, let alone a member of Congress. I am calling on the House of Representatives to censure her remarks and put Democrats on notice for enabling and cheering on antisemitism in their own party," Carter told Fox News Digital.

DNC SUMMER MEETING DERAILED AFTER TENSIONS FLARE OVER DUELING RESOLUTIONS: ‘LOSING OUR FUTURE'

The Detroit-area progressive, the first Palestinian American elected to Congress, targeted the institution itself in her remarks. "Outside of the decaying halls of the empire in Washington, D.C., we are winning. They are scared."

She also brushed off colleagues' concerns about anti-Israel protests near their offices.

"They are scared. They send me videos and messages of people protesting in front of their district offices, people showing up at their town halls, and I was like, we're not all related. Those are fellow Americans," Tlaib said. "Maybe you should meet with them and listen."

Carter's resolution referenced other speakers at the event, tying their rhetoric to Tlaib's participation.

He pointed to remarks by Aisha Nizar, an activist with the Palestinian Youth Movement, who discussed disrupting the U.S. supply chain for F-35 combat aircraft.

"If one specific node of the F-35 supply chain is intervened in, it has a huge impact for our people back home," Nizar said. "We need to be surgical. We need to be strategic. And we need to be bold in our actions. Because there are many different points of these supply chains of death that we can intervene in."

Another participant, Nidal Jboor, founder of Doctors Against Genocide, reportedly said of leaders in the U.S., Europe and Israel, "They must be locked up, taken out, neutralized to save children and humanity," according to a report by the Middle East Media Research Institute.

It remains unclear how closely Tlaib is tied to those figures, but Carter's resolution links her speech to past controversies over her criticism of Israel.

"Representative Rashida Tlaib has repeatedly displayed conduct entirely unbecoming of a member of the House of Representatives by calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and by dangerously promoting terrorism and extremism, while Israeli and American hostages remain in terrorist captivity," the resolution states.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza — which international organizations warn has created famine conditions — was launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,000 people in southern Israel, many of them civilians in their homes.

The conflict has split lawmakers in both parties, with a growing number of Democrats and even some Republicans criticizing the magnitude of Israel's response.

The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry claims tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7.

 'America Reports' has the latest on the incident that is under investigation.

Two United Airlines planes were involved in a minor collision at San Francisco International Airport on Labor Day, the airline confirmed. 

"Monday night, a United aircraft being pushed back from the gate at San Francisco International Airport made contact with the tail of a parked United aircraft," a United spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

No injuries were reported, and passengers on both planes were able to board other planes to reach their destinations. 

The collision between UA796 — which was headed to Boston — and UA1871 — which was headed to Denver — garnered social media attention.

"Last night a collision at San Francisco United Airlines between two 737 aircraft," aviation community X account @Airline_Secret said in a post. "Failure of tow bar of a tug is rumored to blame."

"UA796 was boarding passengers at the gate, the tug broke away on UA1871 and the aircraft rolled back," the post concluded. It included a photo that newsgathering website Storyful said was originally posted to Reddit.

"Currently waiting to see if they get another plane for us... A small bump and the plane shook for a bit and pilot made the announcement a few minutes later," someone claiming to be a passenger posted to Reddit. 

Passengers told local TV news station KGO the hit felt like an earthquake. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating the incident, KGO reported.

Board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, based in Savannah, Georgia, explains why VO2 max and muscle mass are the main indicators of longevity.

There are numerous paths to living a longer, healthier life, mostly through physical activity, diet and other lifestyle factors.

But according to board-certified cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, the key to longevity could come down to two main metrics.

In a video posted to his more than 1 million followers on social media, London broke down how two factors – VO2 max and muscle mass – can help increase health span and lifespan.

WHAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE TO 100 YEARS OLD HAVE IN COMMON, ACCORDING TO SCIENCE

VO2 max is an indicator of how efficiently the body utilizes oxygen with intense exercise, said London, who is based in Savannah, Georgia.

"In other words, the health of your cardiovascular system," he said. "Not surprising that it increases health span and lifespan."

A post shared by Jeremy London, MD (@drjeremylondon)

In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital, London added that VO2 max is "statistically" the No. 1 indicator of longevity. (See the video at the top of this article.)

In comparing individuals with a low VO2 max to those with a higher VO2 max, scientists have identified "magnitudes of improvement" in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing longevity.

"Even if you've never exercised, or if you haven't exercised for a long time, you can still get benefits."

A recent Harvard Medical School publication confirmed that a high VO2 correlates with better physical fitness and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

"If you know your VO2 max, you can use it as a tool to help you exercise more efficiently," the Harvard experts wrote.

"If you have a higher VO2 max, that means your heart and lungs are more effectively supplying blood to your muscles, and that your muscles are efficiently extracting and using oxygen from your blood. That's why a high VO2 max is a good indicator of a high fitness level."

"Muscle is so important for your functional capacity, being able to do the things you want to do in later years," the expert said. (iStock)

Muscle mass is the next element that can impact longevity, London noted.

"It's a close second, and plays a significant role in the ability to continue daily life activities as we age," he told Fox News Digital. "The combination of the two is the magic sauce."

AGING BRAINS COULD ‘BECOME' YOUNGER WHEN KEY PROTEIN IS DECREASED

One reason is that muscle is a "glucose sink," meaning it decreases the risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

When the body is ill, muscle mass can also secrete "myocines," which are anti-inflammatory proteins that can decrease the severity of illnesses.

"Muscle is so important for your functional capacity, being able to do the things you want to do in later years," London said. "The deadlifts you do at 30 enable you to pick up the suitcase at 80."

Starting a simple walking program can help increase muscle mass, the expert said. (iStock)

Building muscle mass doesn't always require heavyweight training or strenuous exercise. In fact, London said he's sometimes hesitant to use the word "exercise" at all.

"Just move," he said. "It could be dancing for some people, it could be swimming, it could be just going for a walk … It may just be body weight or yoga, or Pilates or whatever."

The key is consistency, he emphasized, and finding a balance between what you need and what you enjoy doing for fitness and movement.

"Just moving," even if it's dancing, can help increase muscle mass in older individuals, the expert said. (iStock)

"There's no one answer for everybody, but you just want to put your muscles under stress and strain so they can grow," London went on. 

"The deadlifts you do at 30 enable you to pick up the suitcase at 80."

"And you want to be moving on a regular basis during the week so that you're getting your heart rate up to keep your VO2 max as high as it possibly can be, based on your age."

A simple walking program or body weight resistance training, he said, is "free, accessible and always available."

London added, "The cool thing is, even if you've never exercised, or if you haven't exercised for a long time, you can still get benefits."

California lawmakers are racing to push through dozens of new bills over the next two weeks aimed at stopping President Donald Trump's agenda, including efforts he has made to restrict abortion access, limit LGBT rights, and carry out mass deportations. 

Most of the measures have already cleared legislative hurdles but lack the final votes needed and Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) signature to become law. Democrats have the supermajority in the state legislature, meaning they will have little to no pushback on key bills. Their only problem now is getting as many through the state Assembly and state Senate as possible before Sept. 12. 

One bill that Democratic lawmakers are eager to get over the finish line would allow pharmacists to dispense abortion drugs without the names and addresses of the patient, pharmacy, or doctor on the label. The bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D-CA), is in direct response to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication. 

“[Assembly Bill] 260 is about ensuring Californians have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from political agendas,” Majority Leader Aguiar-Curry said. “It safeguards providers, strengthens access through telehealth, and ensures Mifepristone—a safe, [Food and Drug Administration]-approved medication for over 20 years—remains legal and available throughout California, especially for those in rural and underserved areas.”

Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have enacted strict abortion bans. California has done the opposite.

“AB 260 positions California as a bulwark against these changes, ensuring state-level protections remain intact amid federal uncertainty,” Aguiar-Curry said, adding that the bill would also shield abortion medication providers from civil penalties, criminal prosecution, and professional discipline. 

Newsom called Kennedy's plan to reevaluate federal approvals of abortion medication “another attack on women's reproductive freedom and scientifically-reviewed health care.”

“California will continue to protect every person's right to make their own medical decisions and help ensure that Mifepristone is available to those who need it,” Newsom said in a statement.

AB54 builds on AB260 by protecting healthcare providers from criminal prosecution by other states for prescribing or dispensing abortion drugs, including through the mail. AB54, called the Access to Safe Abortion Care Act, would reaffirm that it is lawful to mail, ship, take, receive, or otherwise transport any drug, medicine, or instrument that can be designed or adapted to produce an abortion that is lawful in California. 

California Democrats are also taking aim at Trump's immigration policies and his plan to carry out mass deportations.

Trump and Newsom have gone head-to-head over the president's decision to send in federalized soldiers and Marines to fight crime in California over the objections of state and local leaders. Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled Trump had broken federal law when he turned nearly 5,000 soldiers into a national police force. 

Many of the bills making their way through the legislature are seeking to counter Trump's crackdown on immigration and would limit federal officers' movements and anonymity in the state. 

Senate Bill 627, for example, would prohibit law enforcement agents from covering their faces to obscure their identity, carving out exceptions for SWAT teams and undercover officers. Another bill, SB805, would require officers to display their IDs with their name and badge numbers and limit the instances in which bounty hunters can get involved with immigration enforcement. 

“In a normal world, this legislation would be unnecessary and unheard of,” state Sen. Sasha Renée Péres (D-CA), the bill's author, said in a statement. “With the rise in impersonation claims and the ensuing fear and confusion being created, there is a clear need for strong, more consistent standards for law enforcement identification. This legislation is not just raising the issue; it aims to directly address it by reaffirming the state's role under its policing powers.” 

Other bills, such as AB1303, SB635, and SB81, would shield the public's information from being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Others, such as SB580 and SB294, would provide guidance to local agencies on protecting sensitive data and database management and, separately, would require employers to notify their workers of their rights related to immigration raids. 

JUDGE RULES TRUMP DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TO LOS ANGELES VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW

There is also a heavy emphasis in the state legislature to protect schools from handing over information to federal immigration authorities unless they have a court order or warrant. Other bills require schools to inform parents that their children are entitled to free public education regardless of immigration status and that the schools must notify them when immigration officers are on site. 

While Republicans in the state legislature have sponsored a number of bills, most of their recent efforts were funneled into unsuccessfully stopping their Democratic counterparts from passing two bills that would redraw the congressional district maps and another that would give the governor the ability to call a Nov. 4 special election.

President Donald Trump announces the National Guard will be deployed to Chicago and touts the success of his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown.

President Donald Trump and his administration have launched a crusade against Illinois lawmakers who've refused offers to send in National Guard troops to Chicago following a violent Labor Day weekend in the city. 

While Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and other state leaders remain adamant that National Guard troops are not welcome in Chicago, the Trump administration has turned up the heat on Pritzker to accept them amid Trump's crime crackdown in Washington. 

"At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed... Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet," Trump said in a Tuesday social media post. "I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, & soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Trump issued another post on social media Tuesday morning, labeling Chicago the "murder capital." 

Trump doubled down on his sentiments later in the Oval Office, and said that places like Afghanistan "don't even come close" to the crime in Chicago. Additionally, he said he had decided he would send National Guard troops to Chicago, despite Pritzker's opposition. 

"If the governor of Illinois would call me up, I would love to do it," Trump told reporters later on Tuesday. "Now, we're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country." 

Other members of the administration also weighed in on Chicago's violence over Labor Day weekend. For example, JD Vance shared a post quoting Pritzker claiming that Trump was "manufacturing a crisis," while depicting Chicago Labor Day crime statistics. 

Additionally, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that Democrats would rather let their constituents suffer than accept Trump's offer.

"Local Democrat leaders would rather knowingly put their residents in harms way than let President Trump help," Jackson said in a Tuesday post on X. "These people are sick!"

Pritzker's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. However, Pritzker remained staunch in his opposition to National Guard troops in Chicago following Trump's social media posts. 

"Just a lovely day here," Pritzker said in a video posted to social media Tuesday. "No emergency, so Donald Trump understands, no emergency in the city of Chicago to send troops in."

Separately, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in an August statement that crime is down in Chicago. He said the city in the past year has reduced homicides by more than 30%, robberies by 35% and shootings by almost 40%.

Even so, the White House has pointed to local reports that Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city for the past 13 years. 

However, 2024 FBI data shows that Chicago does not have the most murders per capita and isn't listed in the top five cities for murder per capita. 

Pritzker previously has called Trump's push to bring National Guard troops to Chicago "unconstitutional" and "un-American."

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are activated to handle state and federal operations, like natural disasters. State governments typically oversee their respective National Guard forces. However, the federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard. 

In June, Trump deployed California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration riots there — controversially circumventing the authority of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

Newsom, a Democrat, ultimately filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for federalizing the National Guard to respond to those riots. A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that Trump's decision to deploy the troops to Los Angeles violated federal law.

Panelists Katie Zacharia and Roxanne Hoge discuss how the Democrats are struggling to find a central leader for their party on ‘Fox News @ Night.'

For decades, Democrats have clung to James Carville's mantra: "It's the economy, stupid." It became the default excuse for every campaign message, every strategy and every setback.  

We need to retire that phrase from our political lexicon. 

My fellow Democrats forget that Carville's first rule on his whiteboard in Little Rock wasn't the economy, stupid. It was "Change vs. more of the same." Voters still want change — not numbers, not excuses. And if President Donald Trump offers change while Democrats defend the system as it is, Democrats will lose. 

JAMES CARVILLE WARNS DEMOCRATS NOT TO GET BAITED INTO DISCUSSING WOKE ISSUES: 'YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK SILLY'

Today, my party is jumping onto a shiny substitute considered to be the winning message that unites all — "affordability" — as if the idea that lower prices are better than higher ones is a revelation. Has a candidate ever campaigned on the reverse? 

Democratic strategist James Carville is famous for his economic advice, but that no longer applies if the party wants to win. (PBS)

During the Biden administration, consumer costs inflated on our watch, but now we are asking midterm voters to give us the keys back to the car anyway.  

When is my party going to learn that politics is about culture and connection, not charts and spreadsheets? It's about being relevant to the lives of ordinary people, not proving to them that we are right. 

DEMOCRATS ARE STILL LOST BUT ONE YEAR AFTER BIDEN'S EXIT, THEY'RE STARTING TO FOLLOW A RIVAL'S ROADMAP

Voters aren't sitting in some academic economics lecture. They don't care about GDP growth, labor-force participation rates, or the Bureau of Labor Statistics when they feel prices are too high. They don't want to hear that homicides, robberies and carjackings have decreased according to the latest stats, when they feel unsafe. Sending in the National Guard won't be a solution to ending crime in our inner cities, but it does make communities feel protected.  

Are Democrats so disconnected from reality that we've unlearned the most basic political principle of all, that perception and politics go hand-in-glove?  

Voters are not looking to be informed by candidates, especially when they sound like human calculators, vomiting out numbers. Being informed isn't the same as feeling informed and telling voters that how they feel isn't real, because numbers say otherwise, isn't a winning message. Shaming Trump voters for their choice last year or lecturing them that this isn't what they voted for, offends them rather than persuades them. Patronizing voters is not a strategy. 

What voters in this midterm election want is some cultural common sense, and to borrow a bullet from the Democratic talking points, Democrats have not been meeting voters where they are — yet.  

CARVILLE PANS DEMOCRATS FOR CONTINUING TO ALIENATE MEN WITH 'FUTURE IS FEMALE' TALK

Voters want to hear us acknowledge that crime is bad and say we need more cops on the street, but not necessarily troops. They want our candidates to give a straight answer and plainly state that boys shouldn't compete in girls' sports as a matter of fairness. It's okay for Democrats to say they believe in merit-based hiring instead of DEI and box-checking quotas.  

Most Americans feel this way — and Democrats lose credibility when they dodge these conversations or give evasive answers.

Democrats avoid going where the news and conversations are happening. Our leaders and candidates too often duck and cover. When issues turn culturally sensitive, they play hide and seek. We need to run straight into the culture war fires, not away from them. Those are the conversations voters are having and we need to join them.  

My old boss, President Joe Biden, learned this lesson the hard way. Biden's presidency illustrates this danger for Democrats on the ballot everywhere in 2026. At the very moments when Americans were craving leadership — like a national debate over college campus unrest and violent antisemitism — Biden was absent. Scranton Joe, who built his career on a chip-on-the-shoulder authenticity that connected with ordinary people, became the first non-Ivy League president in decades. Yet, he was silent when he could have drawn the sharpest contrast from the elites.

DEMOCRAT-ALIGNED GROUP REPORTEDLY PAID SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS FOR CONTENT

Biden told Americans the economy was the envy of the world, and then his Baghdad Bobs in the White House told us he was as sharp as ever. Polls said Americans felt otherwise, still his instinct was to retreat further.  Voters saw fewer unscripted moments, such as interviews or news conferences, smaller steps off Air Force One and a greater reliance on teleprompters. In a political age where imagery shapes public opinion, Biden looked feeble, distant and disconnected. He followed an outdated media strategy that led him into a political death spiral.

Trump, by contrast, dives headfirst into every news cycle and runs into every cultural fire — from campus protests to celebrity dust-ups like Sydney Sweeney's jeans or Cracker Barrel's new logo. He doesn't hesitate, he doesn't duck, he doesn't wait for the perfect poll-tested phrase. Love him or hate him, voters can't miss that he shows up with an opinion and a position. He doesn't keep them guessing.  

Democrats don't need to copy Trump's style. But they do need his guts. If voters are talking about trans athletes, immigration, DEI or crime — and they stay silent or pivot — then they're absent from the conversations Americans outside the Beltway are having with friends, family and their neighbors. It's these social conversations that are shaping political identity, not stats and charts.

Voters will tune out any type of hell Democrats try to raise about prices, tariffs or cuts to Medicare if they think we don't "get" them on culture. 

The way out of the wilderness isn't another slogan about affordability. It's courage and common sense. Stop hiding behind statistics. Start running into the fire. Only then will Democrats earn back voters' trust.

﻿Protecting astronauts in space — and maybe even Mars — will help transform health on Earth.

One day, Mars might become a home to humans. But first, there's the cinematic, sci-fi challenge of making the Red Planet suitable for life. There's a problem, though: The typical person can't get to space safely. That throws a wrench into the whole “let's move to Mars” plan in the face of extreme climate change and other existential risks on Earth.

Today, the path to becoming an astronaut is “littered with the hopes and dreams of medically disqualified candidates,” said Shawna Pandya, a research astronaut with the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS) and the director of its Space Medicine Group. “Once upon a time, kids being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the doctor's office would be told, ‘Well, you could still be anything, except an astronaut.'”

Here are some of the common reasons why you might be medically disqualified from becoming an astronaut:

Astronauts inherently aren't representative of the broader population — they're selected for being in very good health. The stress of existing in essentially weightless microgravity conditions, like those on the International Space Station (ISS), can be incredibly tough on the human body. Astronauts face heightened risks of early-onset osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and significant muscle mass loss. Naturally, government space agencies want people whose bodies are more resilient to such pressures, and who can perform necessary duties without a ton of medical intervention.

According to Haig Aintablian, director of the UCLA Space Medicine Program, “just as pregnancy causes the body to undergo complex and unique changes, spaceflight also produces distinct and significant physiological changes.” It also requires its own medical specialty to manage (aptly called space medicine).

There's a lot scientists don't know, from the physical to the psychological. That's a problem — for the future of science, space travel, and maybe even human existence at large.

NASA wants to go to Mars for research, and aims to send humans there as early as the 2030s. As the most similar planet to Earth in our solar system, Mars may have once harbored life, or may even currently. And in the future, we may even need it to support us.

Decades ago, seriously engaging with the idea of moving to Mars was extremely fringe for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a lack of technical feasibility to the desire to put scientific resources toward solving problems on Earth. Elon Musk — founder of the spaceflight company SpaceX — became a famed advocate for colonizing Mars in the early 2000s. He still is. Musk, who is currently worth around $410 billion, claims that he is only accumulating assets for the purpose of Martian space settlement. Last year, he said that he wants 1 million human settlers on the Red Planet in a self-sustaining city by 2050.

Now Musk isn't alone. NASA experts, biologists, academics, futurists, disaster resilience researchers, and physicians are seriously considering the possibility of making humanity an interplanetary species.

“The biggest problem for humanity to solve is the guaranteed survival of our species — which the logical answer is to become multiplanetary,” Aintablian said. “I don't think there's a better solution than Mars.”

While we know some of the health effects of being on the ISS, we can't really replicate the effects of Martian radiation exposure. Kelly Weinersmith — a biologist and co-author of A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through? — thinks that settling Mars on Musk's timescale will be catastrophic. She argues that we shouldn't rush to set up shop before understanding — and mitigating — the risks, even if this takes centuries rather than decades.

But many advocates for settling Mars are much more impatient. The only way to get there safely would be to unlock significant advances in space medicine, a nascent field that has just barely scratched the surface in its approximately 75-year history.

“Nothing that humanity has done that has been worthwhile has been easy,” Aintablian told me. “So much in our development as a civilization has been difficult, and the reason why we're able to live such comfortable lives now is because of the extremely difficult challenges that humans have had to solve in the past.”

Since extremely few people end up in space right now, the researchers trying to understand how to improve human health there have a limited sample size to work with. Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space in 1961, and more than 600 astronauts have followed him. Only about a sixth of them are women.

NASA researchers have identified some key ways that time in space can impact human health — radiation exposures, isolation, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and environmental consequences like an altered immune system. But we're still lacking many specific examples of how these different dynamics play out in real life.

One of the best studies we have is NASA's famous 2019 twins study. Twin studies allow researchers to separate the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental influences on health outcomes. NASA compared the health of identical twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly over the course of a year. Scott went into orbit on the ISS while Mark remained on Earth. Both underwent the same battery of physiological tests, and the results indicated some surprising new differences between the two men.

Scott's telomeres — the bits of DNA at the end of our chromosomes — lengthened while he was in space and (mostly) reverted to normal once he returned to Earth, possibly indicating radiation-induced DNA damage and potential increased cancer risk. Scott also lost body mass, developed signs of cardiovascular damage that were not present in Mark, and experienced some short-term cognitive changes after returning to Earth.

While survivable with the right training, equipment, and precautions, the twin study demonstrated how space's unique environment can have significant consequences for gene expression and overall health while in orbit.

If the best of the best struggle, what about the rest of us? We're getting some insights here now, too.

Since space tourism has literally taken off, astronauts aren't the only ones going to space now: Wealthy non-astronauts, like Jeff Bezos, Gayle King, and Katy Perry, have recently taken short, recreational jaunts into outer space through Bezos's space tech company, Blue Origin.

Aintablian is very excited about the prospect of civilian access to space increasing, which will inherently mean people with medical issues are also flying. This represents a huge opportunity for scientists to study the medical management of a much wider range of conditions.

That said, 10 or 15 minutes in space is hardly comparable to the conditions on the ISS. And Mars poses even worse consequences in terms of hostile environments and time spent away from Earth. Mars has toxic dust, lacks plant life and a breathable atmosphere, and only has about 40 percent of Earth's gravity. Earth's global magnetic field protects our planet from harmful radiation, and the Martian counterparts are localized, not planet-wide.

The longest time someone has been in space consecutively is 438 days aboard a space station. But crewed missions to Mars would probably take at least nine months just to get there, let alone stay or travel back (which could take up to three years). Mars is usually around 140 million miles from Earth based on its orbital path around the sun, with up to a 20-minute communication delay one way. If they experienced a medical emergency, astronauts likely wouldn't be able to access telemedicine instructions in time, and they couldn't turn back around for treatment.

A crewed mission to Mars would have to take all of their supplies with them before they left our planet. And when the first people heading to Mars set foot on the planet, they won't have access to the intense support astronauts receive when landing back on Earth.

Getting to Mars is only part of the challenge. We've been to space, but so far, humans have only ever sent robots to the Red Planet. We are making educated guesses at what Mars is like for living things. Earth analogues aren't able to truly replicate the closed, hostile conditions of the space environment, which can wreak havoc on astronauts' mental health. Desert research stations have an atmosphere, while the moon barely has one — and setting up that modest base was a huge mission in its own right. Weinersmith told me that scientists at polar research stations are isolated in remote, inhospitable environments, but they can “still open the door, take a deep breath, and not die.”

We're still pretty far from being able to breathe in Mars' atmosphere — but it would be nice to get there one day and simply not die.

Enter: space medicine.

Programs dedicated to figuring out how to get humans safely into space for long periods of time are popping up, and non-physician health care providers are getting in on the action too. UCLA is planning to launch a space nursing program and possibly space paramedic training. SpaceMed is a European master's program focused on human health in spaceflight and other extreme conditions.

Today, astronauts receive most of their care from Earth-based aerospace medicine physicians called flight surgeons through telemedicine. Aintablian envisions a future where health care providers directly accompany astronauts on their expedition-class missions, like to the moon or Mars. Artificial intelligence can act as a resource for the on-board flight surgeon, he predicted, and aid in the development of other technologies that will bring us closer to Mars.

Such technology is already in the works. Google recently collaborated with NASA to develop an AI system that could guide astronauts in diagnosing and treating medical conditions that arise in-flight when they lack access to telemedicine.

But the devil is in the details, Pandya told me. AI can help with just-in-time training for medical emergencies and diagnostics, but the data requirements would be massive. Since extremely few people end up in space — and the ones who do are overwhelmingly male — models might be trained on an unrepresentative dataset that could lead to inaccurate predictions of physiological changes in space. These kinks need to be worked out first.

Right now, there's a gendered gap in the research — so much so that Weinersmith told me there's never a line to the women's restroom at space settlement conferences. Human reproduction and development in space, as a result, is wildly understudied.

As far as we know, no human being has ever been to space while pregnant, and we don't know of any humans who have been conceived in space. We're going to learn a lot about reproduction on Earth from the first human space pregnancy and space birth, a prerequisite for a self-sustaining settlement on Mars. (Plus, space tourism companies are talking about hotels in space, and we know what people do in hotels.) Ideally, you want to have an idea of what will happen to someone giving birth in space before they actually go through it.

“What we're arguing is that we should do the research to understand those risks before we go out there because if there are massive risks, there usually are technological solutions for some of these,” Weinersmith said.

NASA will begin its second Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog this October, a year-long “mission” to Mars in a 3D-printed habitat at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it will collect behavioral health data on the effects of isolation and confinement. Scientists are conducting bed rest studies, which simulate the physiological effects of altered gravity and weightlessness. And as funding cuts transform the future of scientific research on Earth and beyond, space medicine researchers are among those advocating for continued investment in space and biomedical science.

Maedeh Mozneb, a biomedical engineer and project scientist in the Sharma Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told me that the ultimate goal is to send “avatars” of astronauts to space by taking their stem cells and creating 3D tissue cultures called organoids that represent different parts of their body — yes, miniature hearts, kidneys, and even brains made from Earth-dwelling humans. From there, scientists can determine personalized countermeasures such as workout plans or supplements tailored to each astronaut's needs, before they actually end up in space.

The hope, for those space medicine physicians like Pandya, is that in a spacefaring future, all medical disciplines — from neurology to radiology — will be represented in space medicine.

Space medicine research and practice isn't cheap. “I often get asked,” said Pandya, “‘Why are you spending money on space health when we have all of these problems on Earth?'” But that's the wrong way to think about it, she said.

Research conducted in space has already improved health on this planet. Advances in digital imaging for moon photography during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission later played a crucial role in CT scans and MRIs. Remote health monitoring tools designed for astronauts in space are now widely used in hospitals.

Space medicine research will also allow more people to go to space. In 2023, Pandya's team demonstrated the safety and functionality of a continuous glucose monitor in the spaceflight environment. This could eventually allow diabetics to check their blood sugar in space. It has implications for current astronauts, who can develop insulin resistance and pre-diabetes symptoms in longer-duration spaceflights. The child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes who wants to be an astronaut may actually have the chance to live out their dream now, and studying how the body metabolizes glucose in space helps us better understand health on Earth.

Then there are the diseases that take decades to unfold. Muscle loss in space can help scientists better understand how to treat conditions like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. On Earth, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's often aren't apparent until a person is in their late 60s.

In microgravity, said Shelby Giza, the director of business development at Space Tango, a company that facilitates automated research and development in microgravity conditions, “you can see that kind of disease output in a matter of weeks.” Research on these conditions can be conducted much faster — and hopefully accelerate the pace of medical breakthroughs.

The same can be said for cancer. Not all radiation exposures are made equal, and susceptibility to the harmful effects of radiation varies between individuals. Since the ISS is within the protection of Earth's magnetosphere, it's not the best comparison to the elevated radiation levels astronauts would face on Mars.

According to former NASA astronaut and biologist Kate Rubins, most astronauts are healthy people in their 30s and 40s, an age when cancer typically doesn't develop. Scientists must track astronauts for decades after their last spaceflight to see if cancer or other adverse health conditions occur. NASA's Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health program, which is voluntary for former astronauts and not specific to cancer alone, monitors the health status of people like Kelly and Rubins for the rest of their lives.

Exposure to space radiation is linked to developing cancer and degenerative diseases. To mitigate the risk of developing fatal cancers, NASA currently limits astronauts' spaceflight radiation exposure to 600 millisieverts (mSv) — roughly the equivalent of 60 CT scans of the torso and pelvis — over the course of their entire career. A 2023 NASA white paper estimates that a healthy astronaut will have a 33 percent increased risk of dying from cancer in their lifetime after a 1,000-day mission to Mars.

One of the next big things in space medicine “is probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,” Aintablian told me. “I do believe that with the amount of emphasis being placed on radiation protection, we're going to figure out ways to actually protect against significant amounts of radiation for the general public for multiple uses.”

While it's still relatively early days for the space pharma industry, life science companies are taking note, seeing microgravity as a platform for better drug discovery.

Like fiber optic cables used for telecommunications, some pharmaceuticals are better synthesized in microgravity conditions. Scientists can produce more uniform protein crystals in microgravity, which can improve drug injectability and reduce the need for refrigeration.

Raphael Roettgen, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of space biotech startup Prometheus Life Technologies, told me that organoids — those 3D cell models replicating human organs — grow more cleanly in space without Earth's gravity weighing them down. Derived from non-embryonic stem cells, these miniature organ models have tremendous potential for personalized medicine.

Roettgen hopes that human space organoids could reduce the need for animal testing in the near term. Eventually, he hopes that new organs could be regenerated for patients needing transplants. Since the new tissue would be derived from the patient's own stem cells, there would not be a risk of immune rejection, saving transplant patients astronomical costs and immense suffering. He estimates that liver regeneration and transplants from these organoids could become a reality in patients within the next 20 years.

Microgravity is an “expensive tool,” but an important one nonetheless, said Mozneb, who studies the effects of low earth orbit on stem cell differentiation. She hopes increasing commercialization and new technologies will significantly decrease the cost of launching experiments into orbit over the next 10 years.

What we already know about space medicine is a drop in the ocean of what we will discover as more people — astronauts and otherwise — venture into space.

“It's like if you were studying genetics back in the '90s,” Mozneb said. “Everything is a discovery.”

President Donald Trump is escalating his tough-on-crime campaign against Democrats, particularly those considering 2028 presidential bids, ahead of an expected illegal immigration crackdown in Chicago on Friday.

Trump's pressure campaign comes as his federalization of the California National Guard this summer was deemed illegal by a federal court judge on Tuesday.

Trump increased his criticism of Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson last weekend for their inability to decrease crime, as Pritzker complained about the lack of communication between his office and the federal government amid reports of the prospective illegal immigration raids and Johnson signing an executive order directing the Chicago Police Department not to help its federal counterparts.

“At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed,” Trump wrote on social media Tuesday morning. “The last two weekends were similar. Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far. Pritzker needs help badly; he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Two days earlier, Pritzker told CBS he would be open to support from federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, but not from the National Guard, describing that as “an invasion.”

“I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities,” he said on Sunday. “That's un-American, and frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.”

During his first public appearance in days, Trump on Tuesday confirmed plans to surge federal law enforcement to Chicago but downplayed when.

“Chicago is a hellhole right now. Baltimore is a hellhole right now,” he told reporters after announcing he was moving the headquarters of U.S. Space Force to Alabama.

To that end, Trump has implored Pritzker to welcome the National Guard, in part because of legal restraints underscored by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's decision on Tuesday finding that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law, the Posse Comitatus Act, by federalizing the California National Guard and deploying U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in June to respond to anti-illegal immigration raid protests. 

The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits presidents from using the military for domestic law enforcement, with Trump aides emphasizing that any federal law enforcement operations in Chicago would be immigration-centric.

When asked for the White House's response, spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Examiner that  “once again, a rogue judge is trying to usurp the authority of the commander in chief to protect American cities from violence and destruction.” 

“President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in,” Kelly said. “While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the president is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.” 

Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump's appeals based on high crime rates in Democratic-led cities. FBI data demonstrates that 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates and at least 100,000 residents in 2024 had Democratic mayors.

“The perception in America is that these cities are lost, and that the mayors, and the city council, and the leadership in these cities lack the will to do what's necessary to fix them,” said Brian Seitchick, a national Republican strategist. 

Trump's focus on crime is similar to his crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border when he first came into office, according to Matt Dole, a GOP strategist in Ohio. 

“He did not come in and say: here's the 10-year road map to fix illegal immigration. He came in, he said: Start arresting and deporting people today, and take whatever resources you need to do it,” Dole said. “But I think that's what we're seeing in D.C. There is a path to making D.C. safer, and that same path can be used in other cities where crime is a problem, from Chicago to Los Angeles to New York, to Austin, Texas, wherever it is.” 

Simultaneously, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) has distinguished herself by deploying the New Mexico Guard in Albuquerque and Española in April to counter crime emergencies, including regarding fentanyl and juvenile offenses, by providing non-law enforcement assistance. Regardless, she has criticized Trump's federalization of the National Guard in California and Washington, D.C. by arguing her troops are unarmed, dressed in plain clothes, and do not undertake police-like responsibilities, such as riot control. 

Trump's tough-on-crime campaign started last month after former Department of Government Efficiency engineer Big Balls was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Dupont Circle, a wealthy Washington neighborhood. The following week, Trump relied on the Home Rule Act to declare a 30-day public safety emergency in Washington last month, permitting him to federalize the Washington National Guard and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.

That 30-day public safety emergency is poised to expire next week, and Trump has previewed the prospect of extending it, though that would require congressional approval, which he is unlikely to obtain because it will need 60 votes in the Senate. The president has also indicated his willingness to extend the emergency without Congress.

The White House on Tuesday promoted how federalized law enforcement in Washington has so far resulted in 1,669 arrests, including 16 accused members of gangs such as MS-13 and TDA. The White House added that five missing children had been found and 50 homeless encampments had been removed, with as many as 3,200 federal employees deployed across 22 agencies.

“President Trump's efforts to crack down on crime in DC have yielded tremendous results in such a short time – violent crime has plummeted and dangerous criminals are being removed from the streets every single night,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. “The Trump administration is grateful to continue partnering with [Washington] Mayor [Muriel] Bowser to make D.C. the safest city in the country. The mayor's fellow Democrats should take note, working with President Trump means safer communities and less crime – no one in their right mind could seriously oppose that.” 

In a weekend pitch to Democratic governors concerning the National Guard, Trump cited Bowser's approval ratings, asserting they have improved because she endorsed his federalization of Washington's law enforcement. Bowser, however, has been scrutinized for not being more adversarial with Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll published last week found that 56% of registered voters opposed Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington. 

“The left's opposition to these efforts are driven purely by Trump Derangement Syndrome, because anyone who cared about the safety of American communities would look at the outstanding results in DC and want to replicate it nationwide,” a third White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, told the Washington Examiner. 

Trump signaled last month that Chicago, another city led by a Democratic mayor, would be the next federal target after the success in Washington.

“When we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C. Chicago is very dangerous,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.

But he has not ruled out taking his crackdown on crime to other blue cities, including Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco, and New York City, following through on his yearslong attacks on urban enclaves.

            The potential for a showdown over crime in Chicago – not just between law enforcement and crooks but between the federal government and city leaders – is escalating.
    


            With US troops patrolling Washington, DC, after a similar National Guard deployment in June to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump is ramping up his rhetoric against predominantly Democratic cities, with a direct target on the nation's third-most populous.
    


            “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,” Trump said with typical hyperbole Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “(Gov. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC.”
    


            “We're going,” the president hours later told a reporter about sending in the National Guard. “I didn't say when. We're going in.”
    


            Still, the White House refuses to coordinate with local law enforcement, Pritzker said this week, saying cooperation is a necessary step for fighting crime. And the state is ready to fight a troop deployment: “We will do everything possible to ensure that agents operating inside the confines of this state do so in a legal and ethical manner.”
    


Pritzker's clash with Trump offers political test for Illinois governor



            Meanwhile, some residents – and at least one Democrat on the Chicago City Council – argue the National Guard could ease stress on police after a violent Labor Day weekend and say public safety “shouldn't be this partisan.”
    


             “Chicago is not the murder capital of the world; we all know that,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told CNN's Laura Coates. “But we are a city that needs help.”
    


            With no specific plans announced to send the US military to Chicago, here's what we know about violent crime there and what Trump could do soon:
    


            Trump administration officials have been working for weeks to draw up plans for a federal troop deployment to Chicago the moment the president gives the green light, they told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            “We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,” Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson said Saturday.
    


            For now, a ramped-up immigration operation is the one thing the feds have confirmed: “ICE has informed our Illinois State Police Department that they are going to begin operations sometime later this week,” Democratic Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday.
    


            Illinois State Police got a phone call Saturday from Customs and Border Protection indicating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would deploy to Chicago – the first communication Illinois got from the Trump administration on the issue, the governor said.
    


            “First, Donald Trump is positioning federal agents and staging military vehicles on federal property, such as the Great Lakes naval base,” Pritzker said Tuesday. It's also likely federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and CBP will be stationed in the city, he added, citing “unauthorized patriotic officials inside the government and from well-sourced reporters.”
    


            Residents should expect “unidentifiable” agents in unmarked vehicles with masks planning to raid Latino communities in the name of targeting “violent criminals,” despite a very small percentage of those targeted fitting that bill, Pritzker said.
    


            “Instead, you're to see videos of them hauling away mothers and fathers traveling to work or picking up their kids from school. Sometimes they will detain, handcuff and haul away children,” he said.
    


            Any National Guard troop deployment in Illinois to fight crime is “not sustainable,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday.
    


            “National Guard troops are not trained to do local law enforcement,” Raoul said. “FBI agents, DEA agents, ATF agents are trained to fight crime, and they have collaborated with local law enforcement. I would prefer more resources on that end than sending the military illegally into the streets of American cities against American citizens.”
    


            The back-and-forth followed a Labor Day weekend of deadly violence in Chicago worse than in the previous two years, with seven people shot to death, according to preliminary Chicago Police Department reports. In all, 56 victims were hit by gunfire, according to police reports.
    


            A 14-year-old boy wounded in the arm and hand was the youngest victim, while seven people were wounded in a drive-by attack only a block from Chicago Police headquarters. An eighth homicide victim recovered over the weekend from Lake Michigan died by drowning, the Cook County Coroner's Office told CNN; police have not said when they believe he was killed or why the case was classified as a homicide.
    


These Chicago residents welcome extra help fighting crime but don't want Trump to send the National Guard



            Over the same holiday period a year ago, six people were killed by gunfire in Chicago, CNN affiliate WTTW reported, though the figure did not count four people killed on a Chicago “L” train that was outside the city limits at the time of the shooting.
    


            Before the holiday surge, city leaders had been pointing to a broader drop in violent crime in 2025.
    


            “In the first six months of this year, Chicago has seen a 33% reduction in homicides and a 38% reduction in shootings,” said a news release last week from Johnson's office. Overall, violent crime is down 21.4% this year, city figures show.
    


            Trump has been floating the idea of deploying troops inside Chicago for more than a week: “Chicago's a mess. You have an incompetent mayor – grossly incompetent – and we'll straighten that out probably next,” he said in the Oval Office in late August.
    


            But if the president were to federalize the National Guard in Chicago, it is not clear what authority he would cite or what troops would do in the Windy City.
    


            While the president has direct power over the DC National Guard and some authority over that capital city's police department because they are in a federally controlled district, he does not have the same power in states.
    


            “There's very little stopping this president from doing what he wants to do,” said Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and CNN senior law enforcement analyst.
    


            “But he'll find the legal environment and trying to replicate the same sort of surge of federal agents and the presence of National Guard troops very, very different in every city in this country that is not Washington, DC.”
    


            Trump last called up the National Guard against a governor's will in June, sending 2,000 members of the California National Guard into the streets of Los Angeles to push back against protests opposing aggressive immigration raids in the area.
    


            The National Guard played a limited security role, providing security to federal buildings and agents in a square-mile section of downtown where protests had become unruly. Local police, not guard members, responded when people violated a curfew declared by the mayor.
    


Judge says Trump administration's use of US military in Los Angeles violated federal law



            Still, California Gov. Gavin Newsom mounted a challenge in court, and a federal judge agreed Tuesday the situation in Los Angeles did not rise to the sort of emergency that would give Trump power to federalize the National Guard. The administration announced Wednesday it is appealing Breyer's decision.
    


            “President Trump and (Defense) Secretary (Pete) Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into service in other cities across the country … thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” wrote US District Judge Charles Breyer, a nominee of then-President Bill Clinton.
    


            “In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,” he added, a 19th-century law that generally prohibits the use of troops for domestic law enforcement purposes.
    


            Although Breyer issued a court order preventing that sort of National Guard action from being repeated in California, it does not apply to other states, so there's nothing in the decision that directly stops the president from activating it in Illinois.
    


            The last time active-duty military was sent to Chicago against the wishes of local officials was on July 4, 1894, according to the archives of the Chicago Tribune, when a labor dispute at a Pullman factory crippled the nation's rail industry and resulted in days of rioting.
    


            “I protest against this, and ask the immediate withdrawal of the Federal troops from active duty in this State,” then-Gov. John Peter Altgeld wrote to President Grover Cleveland, according to the Tribune.
    


            Since then, military deployments in Chicago have come at the direction of Illinois governors, including during the notoriously violent response to protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and a precautionary call-up in preparation for the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer found guilty in the murder of George Floyd.
    


            “Let us be clear: there is no emergency in Chicago that warrants the President of the United States deploying the military,” 13 Democratic members of Illinois' congressional delegation said in a Labor Day statement.
    


            Despite the general drop in crime this year in Chicago, many residents still feel terrorized.
    


            “My grandkids can't sit outside. They can't sit in the living room or at the kitchen table because a bullet may come through,” said Rochelle Sykes, who lives in a neighborhood with the city's highest number of shooting victims per capita this year.
    


            Sykes is not convinced the city's crime stats are telling the whole story, she told CNN's Omar Jimenez. Indeed, Chicago last year ended its contract with ShotSpotter, whose sound equipment is designed to detect shots fired even if police are never called.
    


            “There's a lot of things that go unreported,” Sykes said, “and these are things that us living in the neighborhood see every day.”
    


            The city can “absolutely use federal resources from the National Guard,” Lopez, the alderman, said, raising the possibility of stationing troops in busy parts of the city, like on Michigan Avenue and at public bus and train stations.
    


            “We are currently allowing officers to spend their eight-hour shift babysitting these locations when they could actually be in the neighborhoods, answering 911 calls,” Lopez told CNN.
    


            Others, however, say calling in the National Guard could make things worse.
    


            “The presence of military, for me, would put our communities in a situation where they feel like they are incarcerated,” said Cedric Hawkins, a resident of the southside Pullman neighborhood who has had nine relatives killed by gun violence.
    


            And many state and local officials are warning that the idea of using the military to deal with crime in US cities is not a precedent they want to set.
    


            “This president … wants to, quite frankly, make the military presence on American soil something that people normalize,” said Stratton, the lieutenant governor. “This is not normal. We cannot normalize it.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day of Gov. JB Pritzker's comments. He spoke Tuesday.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson blamed the city's crime problem on “red states” on Tuesday, claiming it was their supposedly loose gun laws that were contributing to violence. 

“Chicago will continue to have a ‘violence problem' as long as Red states continue to have a gun problem,” Johnson posted on X on Tuesday evening. “The endless flow of illegal guns into Chicago can be traced to Red states like Mississippi, Indiana, and Louisiana. It is up to the federal government to step up and stop interstate gun trafficking networks.”

Johnson has rejected the Trump administration's offer to deploy the National Guard to his city to help with Chicago‘s crime problem. He has criticized such overtures, likening them to an authoritarian takeover.

He requested the federal government's assistance, but not for additional law enforcement officers or the National Guard.

CRIME IN US CITIES AS TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND CRACKDOWN: LATEST COVERAGE

“We need the federal government to stop the endless flow of guns into our state and into our city,” Johnson said. “Chicago police officers have taken more than 24,000 guns, illegal guns, off the streets of Chicago since I've taken office.

“They have worked hard every single day to make our city safer, and they've made historic progress,” he said. “However, we will never be able to end gun violence in Chicago as long as the president continues to allow tens of thousands of guns to be trafficked into our state and our city. The vast majority of guns do not come from Chicago. They are not made in Cook County. They are not bought in the state of Illinois.

“These guns come from red states,” Johnson said. “They are coming from Indiana. They are coming from Mississippi. They are coming from Louisiana. And that is the harsh reality, whether Republicans like it or not.”

PRITZKER SAYS NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS STAGING FOR DEPLOYMENT TO CHICAGO

Chicago is the third-largest city in the United States and is regularly listed among the cities with the most homicides each year. Johnson has been mayor since May 15, 2023. Over the last two years, Chicago has had more homicides than any other city in the nation, with 617 in 2023 and 573 in 2024, Johnson's first full year in office. Last year was the first time Chicago had fewer than 600 reported homicides since 2019, according to reports.

            As North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stepped off his armored green train in Beijing on Tuesday, greeted by Chinese officials shaking his hand and leading him down a red carpet, many observers noticed a young girl walking behind him, smiling politely, dressed in black with her hair tied in a bow.
    


            This is believed to be Kim Ju Ae, the leader's mysterious daughter. She's has made various public appearances over the years, mostly at military-related events, prompting speculation about why she's in Beijing and whether Kim could be preparing his future successor.
    


            The young girl's first public trip abroad is one of massive significance, at a parade where Chinese leader Xi Jinping will flaunt his military forces, and where her father will stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow autocrats including Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin – partnerships she may very well need to navigate one day.
    


            The child was nowhere to be seen on Wednesday as her father strode down the red carpet at Tiananmen Square ahead of Xi's military parade.
    


            Little is known about Kim's daughter, whose first public appearance in 2022 confirmed her existence, after years of speculation.
    


            American basketball star Dennis Rodman revealed Kim had a baby called Ju Ae when he visited Pyongyang in 2013, telling The Guardian afterward, “I held their baby Ju Ae and spoke with (Kim's wife) as well.”
    


            There are varying reports about her exact age and birth year; it's widely estimated she's now a preteen or early teen, though that's largely based on Rodman's testimony, and it's not clear how many months old she was when he met the family.
    


            Kim's daughter was introduced to the world in true Kim style in 2022, accompanying her father as he oversaw the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Several more public appearances came in 2023 – mostly at military events, such as a military parade where she gazed out at rows of ICBMs in the capital Pyongyang.
    


            At the time, experts said her appearance at these events sent a clear message: that North Korea would hold tight to its weapons, including its nuclear program, and that the Kim clan remained at the center of the country's military power.
    


            “By ostentatiously including his wife and daughter, Kim wants observers at home and abroad to see his family dynasty and the North Korean military as irrevocably linked,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, after the 2023 parade.

            North Korea has been ruled as a hereditary dictatorship since its founding in 1948 by Kim Il Sung. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after his father's death in 1994, and Kim Jong Un took power 17 years later when Kim Jong Il died.
    


            Given the significance of the family dynasty, the public debut of Kim's daughter sparked debate about whether she could be groomed as a successor – with mixed opinions among experts.
    


            Some have pointed to the way she's covered in North Korean state media – described as “beloved” and “respected” – as a sign that she may have special status. Bringing her to military events from an early age could be a way to prepare her for the realities of leading 1.3 million armed forces personnel, as well as cultivating trust and respect from those troops, experts have said.
    


            But others are skeptical – saying they've long believed that Kim's two other children would be chosen as successors instead.
    


            Her public appearances could also be a PR move to cultivate an image of Kim as a “family man” or “fatherly” figure, said Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of the center's Korea Program, in a 2024 interview with CNN.
    


            She pointed out that it would make sense for Kim to use his daughter for that purpose instead of his sons, because Rodman had already revealed her existence to the world – whereas even less is known about her siblings, who can still grow up out of the limelight.
    


            For instance, Kim himself studied in Switzerland in the 1990s – but his daughter is “too well-known now, she'll never be able to study overseas,” Town said.

A federal appeals court decided on Tuesday to reinstate Biden-appointed Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, months after President Donald Trump fired her.

In a 2-1 majority decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a federal judge's ruling that determined it was illegal to fire Slaughter.

“The government is not likely to succeed on appeal because any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved Supreme Court precedent,” the court wrote in the 29-page order. “Bucking such precedent is not within this court's job description.

The order cited federal law stating FTC commissioners can only be removed “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, another Biden appointee on the commission, in March without giving an explanation. However, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson maintained at the time that Trump “had the authority” to fire them. Bedoya formally resigned from the FTC in June, but Slaughter is expected to return to work this week following the appeals court's order.

“Amid the efforts by the Trump administration to illegally abolish independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve, I'm heartened the court has recognized that he is not above the law,” she said.

“I'm very eager to get back first thing tomorrow to the work I was entrusted to do on behalf of the American people,” she added.

The Trump administration will likely appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

TRUMP FACES CONTINUED LEGAL FIGHTS OVER FIRING INDEPENDENT AGENCY HEADS

In recent months, Trump has been firing multiple members of independent federal agencies, with the terminations then challenged in court. The latest officials to have been ousted in high-profile shake-ups include former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, and Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Cook filed a lawsuit last week challenging her “illegal” termination, a possibility that Monarez and McEntarfer may also consider. Slaughter and Bedoya previously sued Trump for the same reason.

Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) faces mounting criticism and intensifying 2028 presidential speculation after being photographed shirtless aboard Hollywood megastar George Clooney's luxury yacht on Italy's Lake Como over Labor Day weekend.

The Daily Mail published images on Monday showing Moore lounging on the rear deck of Clooney's yacht, alongside his wife, Maryland first lady Dawn Moore. The pair appeared relaxed as they soaked up the sun near Clooney's villa in Laglio, where they are reportedly staying.

While Clooney was not seen on the yacht at the time, the sighting has sparked political controversy in the United States, where critics say Moore's high-profile foreign vacation is tone-deaf amid rising crime in Maryland, particularly in Baltimore.

In a statement to local news outlets, Moore's senior adviser and communications director, David Turner, said: “The Governor paid for a trip to celebrate his wife's 50th birthday.”

The statement confirmed the Moores were staying at Clooney's Italian estate and were accompanied by Maryland State Police officers, who provide security on all official and personal trips.

A White House spokeswoman slammed the trip in a pointed statement to Spotlight on Maryland, saying: “While Maryland residents try to escape dangerous criminals in their communities, Gov. Wes Moore is attempting to escape accountability for the out-of-control crime in his state by fleeing to Italy for a luxury getaway with Democrat elites.”

“Gov. Moore needs to get his priorities straight — instead of taking yacht vacations or fantasizing about his 2028 presidential bid, he needs to make Maryland safe again,” the statement continued.

The release of the vacation photos sparked immediate outrage on social media, with critics slamming Moore for indulging in a luxury getaway while Maryland, and particularly Baltimore, grapples with rampant crime and economic struggles.

One viral post read: “HANGING OUT WITH GEORGE ON VACAY: @GovWesMoore traded Annapolis for Lake Como, sipping wine with Clooney while his tax and fee hikes crush Marylanders. Who needs being governor when you've got George!”

Maryland Delegate Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) also weighed in on X: “‘The Other Wes Moore' — While Baltimoreans are terrified to leave their homes due to unsafe streets, @GovWesMoore is living the high life on Lake Como, Italy with George Clooney.”

Another user posted: “Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and his wife are seeking refuge in the comforts of a Hollywood actor's famous Lake Como villa. Catching rays on George Clooney's yacht…while Baltimore is a hell hole riddled with crime.”

The backlash comes as Moore continues a very public feud with President Donald Trump over crime in Baltimore. Just last month, Trump criticized Moore for inviting him to “walk the streets of Maryland,” calling it a “provocative” move and labeling Baltimore “crime-ridden.”

Over the past few months, Trump has repeatedly threatened to send the National Guard into Baltimore, calling the city “out of control” and accusing Moore of ignoring public safety concerns.

In a July post on Truth Social, Trump blasted the governor, saying: “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland' with him. I assume he is talking about out-of-control, crime-ridden Baltimore?”

Trump's comments came after Moore publicly rejected the idea of federal intervention, calling the president's rhetoric divisive and counterproductive. Moore has argued that local leaders, not Washington, should be trusted to fix Baltimore's deep-rooted issues.

“The idea that the solution to Baltimore's challenges is military occupation is as offensive as it is unserious,” Moore said during a press conference in August. “We need investment, not intimidation.”

Clooney, a prominent Democratic megadonor, has been vocal in his praise of Moore as a rising political star. In an interview with CNN earlier this year, the Oscar-winning actor said Moore was “levitating above” other potential Democratic presidential contenders and called him a “proper leader.”

The Hollywood icon's political influence is well established — and recent. In 2024, Clooney made national headlines when he penned a bombshell New York Times op-ed calling President Joe Biden to step aside from the presidential race. The public plea sent shockwaves through the Democratic establishment and was widely credited with pressuring Biden to withdraw from his reelection campaign.

Clooney's intervention helped pave the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic front-runner, a shift that dramatically reshaped the party's strategy just months before the Democratic National Convention.

Clooney's Lake Como estate — purchased in 2002 — has long served as a private gathering space for celebrities, diplomats, and political influencers.

Moore has repeatedly denied having any intention of running for president in 2028, but his high-profile appearances — including attendance at the Sun Valley Conference in Idaho, often dubbed “billionaire summer camp” — have only fueled speculation.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Moore's office for comment.

American Eagle said Wednesday its partnership with Sydney Sweeney has been its "best" advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. 

The company's splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the "Euphoria" star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift's new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

"The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales," CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. "We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value." 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here's how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It's expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter. 

So far this year, American Eagle's performance has been marred by merchandising missteps, tariffs and an uncertain consumer that's being more selective when spending money on products like clothes and shoes. 

To turn things around, American Eagle launched its campaign with Sweeney ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season, but in some ways, that also backfired when it incited outrage from some customers. 

The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans" — led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre and a nod to eugenics. Meanwhile, those on the right celebrated the campaign, leading President Donald Trump to weigh in and call it the "hottest" ad around.

More widely, the campaign also faced pushback from some who said the ads were overly sexualized and out of touch, leading them to wonder what type of consumer the company was targeting. 

The campaign launched on July 23 at the tail end of American Eagle's fiscal second quarter, but the company said it's so far been a success, despite the pushback it received. The Sweeney campaign, along with the partnership it launched with Kelce, has led to "meaningful improvement in the business" with comps so far this quarter up in the mid-single digits. American Eagle said it's gained 700,000 new customers and that traffic across channels has been "consistently positive" throughout August, despite some news reports indicating the contrary. 

The Sweeney campaign has led to denim sellouts, double-digit traffic growth and increased awareness and engagement, the company said. The Sydney Jacket sold out in one day and The Sydney Jean, a custom style that donated 100% of proceeds to the Crisis Text Line, which provides mental health support, sold out in one day. 

Meanwhile, American Eagle's launch with Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, the day after he announced his engagement to the pop star, drove three times more sales in one day than past collaborations did in a week, the company said. Many of the items, specifically ones worn by Kelce and his fellow athletes, sold out.

American Eagle's partnerships with Sweeney and Kelce highlight the work the retailer is doing to stay relevant with consumers and cut through the noise as spending remains soft. 

It's also facing stiff competition from peers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap and Levi's. Recently, Gap launched its "Better in Denim" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit "Milkshake." Meanwhile, Levi's has had an ongoing campaign featuring Beyoncé while Abercrombie has taken a sports focus and partnered with the NFL. 

Compounding American Eagle's challenges is the uncertain tariff environment. American Eagle has been working to reduce its reliance on China to under 10% this year but it also has a heavy manufacturing presence in Vietnam and India, which have been the subject of reciprocal tariffs.

Florida plans to end all state vaccine mandates, including for children to attend schools, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, a prominent immunization critic, announced Wednesday.

The move would make Florida the first-ever state in the U.S. to withdraw from the requirements that are credited with increasing vaccination rates in communities and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. The rollback could result in fewer school children getting immunized against deadly viruses such as polio and measles, and comes as Florida leads the Southeast in nonmedical vaccine exemptions among kindergartners.

"The Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law, all of them. All of them. Every last one of them," Ladapo said during a news conference, adding that the state has "maybe half a dozen" shots mandated in the state.

All states currently have vaccine requirements to attend public schools, though exceptions vary by state. Florida is among the states that already allow parents to object to vaccines on religious grounds.

Ladapo said vaccine mandates "drips with disdain and slavery," even though they are intended to protect public health. Vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans $540 billion in direct health-care costs over the past three decades, according to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in August.

Ladapo has long stoked fears about vaccines, and his stances on shots and other measures have drawn criticism from the public health community. Last year, he called for a halt to using mRNA Covid-19 shots, citing false claims that the jabs could contaminate a person's DNA.

The move comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S., gutting a key government immunization panel, canceling funding for mRNA shot development and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.

Dollar Tree is seeing benefits from branching out into products that cost over $1.25 each.

The dollar store chain has spent the last couple of years adding items that cost more than its standard $1.25 price point. Dollar Tree has added items that cost $3 and $5 each, for instance, and experimented with items that cost as much as $7.

The strategy is paying off, executives said on Dollar Tree's latest earnings call on Wednesday, especially when it comes to serving new customers at its stores.

"Expanding our assortment to include items at a variety of price points is fast becoming the standard Dollar Tree model," CEO Michael Creedon said on the call.

He said the chain's wider range of prices lets it sell larger packs of some consumable goods and higher-quality items.

That wider range of products particularly appeals to shoppers from households with incomes of at least $100,000 annually. Such customers drove a "meaningful portion" of Dollar Tree's second-quarter sales growth, Creedon said. Dollar Tree largely beat analysts' expectations for the period, including with 6.5% growth in same-store net sales.

More affluent customers are coming to Dollar Tree stores for the "thrill of the hunt," Creedon said.

"You come into Dollar Tree, you're not exactly sure what you needed, and by the end of the first aisle, there's a basket there because you got more than you thought you would," the CEO said. "That's the Dollar Tree magic."

One example comes from Dollar Tree's hardware department. Dollar Tree used to offer hammers for $1.25 each, but they sold poorly, CFO Stewart Glendinning said on Wednesday's call.

Then, Dollar Tree started selling a more expensive version of the tool. "We've got $5 hammers now," he said. "We can't keep those in stock."

Those kinds of items are "creating more interest for consumers in a way that is very positive to the shopping experience and also to our revenue line," Glendinning said.

The chain still has lots of items for the lower-income consumers who have traditionally formed its shopper base, Creedon said. For instance, shoppers have been buying $5 backpacks, which can cost more at other stores, as their kids head back to school, he said.

However, dollar stores have benefited over the last few years as more customers — especially high-income consumers — have turned to chains like Dollar General and Dollar Tree to save money.

Last year, Dollar Tree saw many customers turn to its stores to shop around the holidays, CEO Creedon said on Wednesday's call.

While Dollar Tree hopes to repeat that performance during this year's holiday season, it's facing more hurdles than last year. Earlier this year, the chain took a hit from tariffs. It's still unclear how much duties on imports from some countries, especially China, will be in the long-run, Creedon said.

Then, there's the lingering effect of inflation on Dollar Tree shoppers' budgets.

"If you look over the last four or five years, prices have increased significantly across the entire retail landscape," Creedon said. "Things cost more for families."

"As a result of that, we're cautious" about the future, he said.

In this article

Newsmax filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing conservative media giant Fox News of acting as a monopoly and suppressing its right-leaning competitors.

"Fox has sought to protect and expand its monopoly power in the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market by engaging in a suite of anticompetitive behaviors," attorneys for the outlet wrote in the federal suit in southern Florida.

The lawyers allege that Fox News coerces distributors into "exclusionary and restrictive agreements," and that it has used "intimidation tactics" to hurt Newsmax — including hiring "private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives."

"But for Fox's anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier 'critical mass' for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property," they wrote in the suit.

A Fox News spokesperson curtly replied, "Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers."

Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy is a former reporter for the New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who created Fox News.

"Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over," Ruddy said in a statement.

Newsmax wants a judge to issue a permanent injunction barring Fox's allegedly exclusionary agreements. 

It also seeks a judgment for three times the amount of damages that it has allegedly sustained by Fox, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest "at the highest legal rate."

The suit alleges that Fox, which has long been the most-watched cable news network on television, uses multiple strategies to "coerce distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels."

Fox either explicitly or tacitly makes access to its content conditional on distributors agreeing not to carry those channels, the suit alleges.

If they do, Fox imposes financial penalties on those distributors, by requiring them "to carry and pay high fees for Fox's little-watched channels like Fox Business," according to Newsmax.

Fox also allegedly "inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing." 

"These tactics constitute unlawful restraints of trade and flow directly from Fox's unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market," the suit alleges.

"Fox's longstanding and ongoing practices have harmed and will further harm, competition and consumers in the United States."

The antitrust complaint is the latest legal headache for Fox News, which has been the target of multiple high-profile and pricey lawsuits in recent years. 

In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to settle a defamation suit over false claims said on its air about Dominion Voting Systems rigging the 2020 presidential election.

A similar suit filed by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, is currently headed for trial. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion.

A federal judge just ruled that Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser, and Googlers seem pretty happy about it.

On Tuesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down penalties to Google after ruling its search business a monopoly. The US Justice Department, which filed the suit against Google in 2020, had proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. The judge ruled against this—one of several decisions made in the landmark antitrust case.

Google employees have been lighting up the company's central internal message board, filling it with jokes about the soaring stock and how Google no longer has to part with its beloved browser, per messages and memes reviewed by Business Insider.

One employee edited a caption of a scene from "The Lord of the Rings" to read "Looks like Chrome is back on the menu, boys!" Another played on an iconic scene from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street," with Chrome — rather than Leonardo DiCaprio — announcing, "I'm not ******* leaving."

Several other posts celebrated Chrome's remaining part of Google. One employee took a photo of a sign from one of the offices that read, "You belong here," adding the word "Chrome."

A Chrome sell-off could have been very painful for Google. The browser has become a huge distribution channel for the company's search advertising business, sucking up vast amounts of useful data.

Google's stock popped more than 6% in after-hours trading — something that Googlers also joked about inside the company.

"Sending support to Googlers who sold $GOOG recently," read one caption on a picture of a candle.

Several employees who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said they didn't think the outcome would affect them much and that it would be business as usual for most Googlers.

"I think people are mostly happy about the stock," said one of them.

The list of remedies handed down to Google on Tuesday included a ban on any exclusive deals to make its search engine the default, though it stopped short of banning payments to partners completely. Google was also ordered to share some of its search data with rivals.

A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday called demands that his administration release the Jeffrey Epstein files a distraction from his successes, as a group of victims of the notorious sex offender called for those documents to be publicly disclosed.

"This is a Democratic hoax that never ends," Trump told reporters at the White House when he was asked about the Epstein files.

Despite Trump's claim, his fellow Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has been leading a renewed charge in Congress to force the release of documents about Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Massie has filed a so-called discharge petition in the House of Representatives, which, if passed, would order the Department of Justice to release all documents related to Epstein.

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., held a press conference on Wednesday on Capitol Hill with a group of victims of Epstein and Maxwell.

Ukraine's special operations forces and other front-line troops are using an unconventional ride for slipping past Russian lines, ferrying supplies, and dodging drones, a Baltic scooter maker says.

The Mosphera military e-scooters used by Ukrainian operators are made by Latvian firm Global Wolf Motors, are about twice the size of a regular scooter, and have motorcycle tires, Klāvs Ašmanis, the founder and CEO, told Business Insider.

These nimble, off-road e-scooters can hit 62 mph, cover up to 186 miles on a single battery charge, and weigh just 163 pounds, making them easier to handle than heavier bikes.

Ašmanis said they can make deliveries to the front lines, do reconnaissance in Russia-held territory, and quickly evacuate lightly wounded troops, among other missions, and Ukraine is putting them to work.

These atypical combat vehicles offer quiet mobility across varied terrain, but there aren't many of them in Ukraine, at least for the time being. Latvia, a NATO ally that borders Russia and a key Ukrainian partner nation, donated four scooters in 2023 alongside other equipment. Ašmanis said Ukraine now has 11 of the scooters and that units have asked for more. It's unclear if it will receive additional scooters.

Business Insider reached out to the Latvian defense ministry but did not receive a response on plans for future deliveries.

The scooters were initially designed for use on military bases, border patrol, and reconnaissance, but their use in Ukraine showed the company they had even more uses in real war. "We were surprised by what they were truly capable of," the CEO said.

Ukrainian soldiers brought them to the front lines and inside occupied territory held by Russia.

Ašmanis said the scooters offer advantages over other vehicles being used in this war. For instance, they are smaller and lighter than traditional vehicles, they don't drown out the buzzing sound of drones, they're easier to quickly bail out of in an emergency, and the scooters don't require risking a car, truck, or other vehicle that could be packed with gear for other missions on quick, daring dashes.

He said they excel in forested areas. "Its e-scooter-style wheelbase makes it easy to weave between trees" and trails, while its 163-pound weight "means that if it does get stuck, it's far easier to pull out compared to a motorcycle."

They're also far easier to hide when not in use, in bushes or under branches.

The combat scooters aren't unique to Ukrainian forces. The Russians have employed e-scooters in fast-moving, dispersed "scooter assaults." Ukrainian officers have said these tactics make it harder to take out large numbers of troops at once with drones or artillery, though they're far from unstoppable.

Ašmanis said his vehicles are better suited to conflict than typical e-scooters, describing them as "in the middle between scooter and motorcycle" because it has much larger wheels, like motorcycles do, than regular scooters.

Scooter use reflects a broader shift in the war: both sides are scrambling for small, fast, flexible vehicles to supplement traditional combat machines. Troops have been turning to alternatives to systems like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, though those are still used, and heading into battle in civilian pickup trucks, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, scooters, and more.

Troops have even ridden bicycles in this war.

Rides like scooters are useful because they're relatively cheap, replaceable, and easy to hide, which is important in a conflict where larger, more expensive, and classically louder vehicles may be spotted and destroyed.

But scooters also come with limitations. Riders are exposed, offering little to no protection beyond their personal kit from shrapnel, small-arms fire, or harsh weather. Electric scooters are also highly dependent on batteries, which may not perform as well under certain conditions.

Most vehicles come with drawbacks, though. Motorcycles are fast but noisy. Ukraine's Lt. Col. Pavlo Shamshyn, the spokesperson for the Kharkiv Group of Forces, said earlier this year that Russia's motorcycles proved advantageous for Ukraine because the loud noise drowned out the sound of incoming drones. Armored vehicles are protected and often feature heavy firepower, but these are also higher-priority targets. These multi-million-dollar systems have been wrecked by cheap drones throughout the war.

Ukraine has been using whatever vehicles it can, from Western tanks like the American-made M1 Abrams to civilian pickup trucks equipped with .50 caliber machine guns. One Ukrainian unit created a motorcycle attack company earlier this year that is designed to quickly break through Russian positions.

There's a constant demand for vehicles, both military and civilian, on both sides of the war, which is chewing through weaponry.

Ukrainian military units and volunteer groups hold crowdfunding campaigns to get cars and other vehicles to soldiers, with some supporters buying them in other European countries and driving them into Ukraine.

Scooters are just one of the options in the mix. Like small drones, militarized pickups, and other improvised gear, they underscore how Ukraine and Russia are adapting anything they can to survive this grinding fight.

As a financial planner in the early 90s, William "Bill" Bengen confronted a question that still puzzles aspiring retirees today — "When I get to retirement, how much can I spend?"

For Bengen's baby boomer clients at the time, there was little expert guidance on the subject.

Bengen decided to investigate himself by running numbers with a spreadsheet and a data book.

In October 1994, he published his findings in the Journal of Financial Planning, and what is now known as the 4% withdrawal rule for retirement was born.

Today's investors still confront the same retirement withdrawal dilemma, with the added risk of inflation, which Bengen calls the "greatest enemy of retirees." Bengen created the 4% rule during a stretch of relatively low, stable inflation.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

With his new book, "A Richer Retirement: Supercharging the 4% Rule to Spend More and Enjoy More," Bengen is urging retirees to consider their entire financial circumstances when identifying their withdrawal strategy.

For some retirees, the good news is they may be able to withdraw more than 4%, according to Bengen.

Despite the 4% rule's popularity, some investors get it wrong, Bengen said.

The strategy does not call for a 4% withdrawal rate for every year in retirement.

Instead, the 4% withdrawal rate applies only to the first year. That rate is then adjusted for subsequent years to account for inflation, much like Social Security benefits get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, according to Bengen.

That COLA withdrawal approach is not the only strategy. Some people may choose to withdraw a fixed percentage or withdrawal amount. Others may prefer to take more money out early in retirement and cut back later, Bengen said.

"There's so many ways you can do it," Bengen said.

However, all retirees would benefit from keeping all of their financial circumstances in mind when identifying their personal strategy, he said.

Those factors include the length of their planning horizon, whether they have taxable or non-taxable assets, whether they want to leave money to heirs, how their assets are allocated, how often they plan to rebalance their portfolios, the size of their returns and when they plan to make their withdrawals, according to Bengen.

In the 90s, Bengen's research pointed to a maximum safe withdrawal rate of 4.15% for the first year of retirement.

That rate was based on several portfolio assumptions:

Today, the maximum safe withdrawal rate is 4.7%, according to Bengen's calculations.

Bengen calls that 4.7% rate "Universal Safemax" — the historical maximum safe withdrawal rate for all retirees.

Consequently, retirees who use a 4.7% withdrawal rate may be sacrificing on average about 35% per year in withdrawals, a "considerable reduction in lifestyle," Bengen writes in his book.

Notably, Bengen's historical data shows some retirees may be able to take those withdrawals even higher, with the average Safemax rate at about 7.1%.

To be sure, because that 4.7% maximum safe withdrawal rate is based on past performance, it is not guaranteed that it will hold true for future retirees. Whether new retirees should rethink that withdrawal rate has been a subject of debate among experts.

Moreover, if retirees expect to leave money to heirs, they will have to cut their withdrawal rates accordingly, Bengen said.

In his book, Bengen provides tables to help prospective retirees roughly gauge their own personal maximum safe withdrawal rate.

To gauge their "Safemax," retirees need to estimate their average inflation rate for their early retirement years as well as the expected Shiller CAPE (or cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings) ratio, a measure of stock market valuation that takes inflation-adjusted earnings into account.

A bear market — where stocks fall more than 20% — or high inflation early in retirement can affect the longevity of retirement portfolios, according to Bengen.

Higher inflation during retirement can be "scary," Bengen said. While the record 8.7% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment that went into effect for 2023 may have seemed nice, the extra money was mostly claimed by higher prices, he said.

Retirees should be prepared to deal with inflation "immediately and strongly if it occurs," Bengen said. For most people, that comes down to reducing their expenditures, he said.

Nearly two-thirds of retirees — 63% — worry that tariffs will push inflation higher than what Social Security cost-of-living adjustments may cover, according to a June Nationwide Retirement Institute survey.

While the latest government data shows there has been an uptick in inflation, with the Consumer Price Index at 2.7% on a 12-month basis as of July, that is still lower than the 9% rate that inflation gauge posted in June 2022.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Wednesday criticized the Trump administration's decision to take a 10% stake in embattled chipmaker Intel, calling the investment "a step towards socialism."

Intel announced last month that the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, purchasing 433.3 million shares at a price of $20.47 per share, giving it a 10% stake in the company. Intel noted that the price the government paid was a discount to the current market price.

Paul said government ownership is "a bad idea."

"It's always a mistake to say, 'Well we have this one bad policy, all right, we'll tolerate a little socialism, but we don't want anymore," Paul told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. "I think it's a bad idea."

President Donald Trump said on Truth Social last month that the government's stake in the chipmaker is a "great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL."

Trump has taken an increasingly heavy hand in the private sector, raising concern among conservative lawmakers like Paul, who have long opposed big government. In August, the Trump administration said the government would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials. It also took a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant.

Among the most vocal supporters in Congress of Trump's Intel deal has been Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont. Sanders, a longtime and vocal Trump critic, told news outlets last month that, "Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return."

But Paul said it's not smart to involve the government in the free market.

"I worry that the free market movement, the movement that was a big part of the Republican Party, is being diminished over time," Rand said.

German startup DeepL on Wednesday said it was expanding beyond artificial intelligence-powered translation into general AI agents focused on businesses.

The term "agent" refers to an AI tool that can carry out tasks in the background in response to user prompts.

DeepL Agent is designed to complete "repetitive, time-intensive tasks across a wide variety of functions" according to the company. It can responds to natural langauge commands from a users. DeepL Agent can be used in various teams from human resources to marketing, the company added.

Agents or agentic AI have become buzzwords in the technology industry, underscoring how companies see how these digital assistants automating more mundane tasks. Companies such as Microsoft with Co-Pilot and Anthropic's Claude are products focused on the enterprise customer.

The move is a step beyond what DeepL, which is valued at $2 billion, has focused on since it was founded in 2017. It potentially pits the company against major AI players like Anthropic, OpenAI and Microsoft, which are targeting enterprise customers.

DeepL CEO Jarek Kutylowski told CNBC on Wednesday that the company's agent was a natural extension of its translation product.

"We found out that the technology is as capable of helping you whenever you're doing research or whatever you're doing," Kutylowski said.

"All of those tedious tasks in your office when you have to switch between different systems and take some data from one system, put it into another one, AI, and those autonomous agents, and the DeepL Agent in particular, can help solve so much better."

DeepL's translation product is based on its self-developed large language models. Kutylowski said DeepL Agent is based on its own models, as well as on those available "externally" from other providers.

While there are a large number of companies advertising AI agents, the market is still in a very early stage. Overall investor interest in AI companies is meanwhile still high. Amazon-backed Anthropic on Tuesday announced a funding round that put the firm at a $183-billion post-money valuation.

Technology listings appear to be gathering steam, with both fintech firm Klarna and crypto exchange Gemini this week unveiling details of their upcoming initial public offerings.

Against this backdrop, CNBC asked Kutylowski if DeepL was considering an IPO, to which he responded: "That's not a short term plan that we would be considering right now."

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Google seems to have escaped its antitrust case better than some feared.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the technology giant can keep its Chrome browser, but Google cannot have exclusive contracts and must share some search data. The ruling comes nearly a year after Mehta ruled that Google had a monopoly on internet search.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet popped after the ruling and were still up more than 5% before the bell this morning. Shares of Apple, to whom Google pays billions of dollars a year to be the default search engine on iPhones, also surged in extended trading.

Stocks kicked off the new trading month with a sharp slide yesterday. Investors appeared jolted by a pang of uncertainty following a federal appeals court's ruling that many of President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.

Here's what else to know:

Speaking of those tariffs, Trump said yesterday that he would ask the Supreme Court for an "expedited ruling" to overturn the appeals court's Friday decision.

Trump told reporters that his team's appeal to the Supreme Court could come today. He said the "financial fabric of our country" is at risk and that the U.S. could "end up being a third-world country" without his tariffs.

Elsewhere on the judicial front, a federal judged yesterday also blocked the Trump administration from using the National Guard and military to enforce laws in California.

Two major chains announced refreshed menus yesterday. (No, they weren't just new pumpkin spice-flavored items.)

McDonald's said it would bring back its Extra Value Meal, which offers a 15% discount compared to buying individual menu items separately. The deal was last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Starbucks also said it will launch protein-packed lattes and cold foam later this month. As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, the additions come as many Americans are increasingly focused on their protein intake.

Macy's shares surged more 12% before the bell this morning after the retailer struck a more positive note with investors this quarter.

The department store operator blew past earnings expectations from Wall Street for its second quarter, also raising its full-year outlook. That marks a turn from last quarter, when Macy's cut its full-year guidance and cited sales uncertainty tied to Trump's tariffs.

Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic's valuation just keeps climbing. Here are the big numbers from the buzzy AI company's latest funding round:

Quantum computing firm IQM says it's raised $320 million of fresh funding to ramp up investments in technology and commercial growth.

The startup, which is headquartered in Espoo, Finland, was founded in 2018 by a team of scientists with the aim of building powerful quantum computers in Europe like the machines companies such as Google and IBM are building in the U.S.

Quantum computers are machines that use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers, which store information in bits (ones and zeroes). Quantum computers use quantum bits, or "qubits," which can be zero, one or something in between — the aim being to process much larger volumes of data to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance.

IQM's funding round was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. cybersecurity-focused investment firm, while Finnish venture capital firm Tesi also invested. It gives the seven-year-old company "unicorn" status, meaning it's valued at $1 billion or more, according to co-CEO and co-founder Jan Goetz.

The investment underscores heightened investor buzz around the quantum computing space. Shares of publicly-listed quantum firms like IonQ and D-Wave Quantum have seen huge rallies in the past year. IonQ stock is up nearly 480% in the last 12 months, while D-Wave Quantum's shares have spiked over 1,400%.

"If you compare us directly to the companies which are Nasdaq-listed and take KPIs like people, revenue, patents, things like this, actually we are not behind. We can actually compete on this level," Goetz told CNBC in an interview.

Goetz said that IQM has come a long way since the early days of building the company. The company has 350 employees globally and has built out finance and sales operations as well as a factory in Espoo where it builds its machines.

There are now a number of European companies working on quantum computers, including IQM, Pasqual and Quandela. However, they are yet to achieve the scale of their U.S. counterparts.

In a speech earlier this year, the European Commission's tech chief Henna Virkkunen said that European quantum computing startups often struggle to scale due to a lack of private capital, noting that the European Union receives only 5% of global private funding compared to 50% for the U.S.

"If you just look at what is happening in Europe in these deep tech fields which come out of universities, naturally we have quite a lot of startups because we have so many good universities in Europe. But then it's really hard to make them grow," IQM's Goetz said.

"Now I think there is a risk of, if you have very high valuations in companies in the U.S., that they just drive M&A consolidation using their high share price." Indeed, IonQ in June announced it would buy U.K. quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics for nearly $1.1 billion in a deal consisting primarily of stock.

IQM has now sold a total of 15 quantum computers to date. The company sells two main products: its flagship machine, Radiance, and a more affordable quantum computer called Spark, which the company sells to universities.

Going forward, IQM is planning to move beyond just hardware. Goetz said the firm will use part of the cash it's raised to develop a software platform aimed at making quantum computing accessible to developers who aren't experts in the field.

The other main goal for IQM is global expansion, with plans to scale up commercial and sales operations in the U.S. and Asia. Goetz said IQM has sold two systems in Asia so far — one in Taiwan and the other in South Korea — and recently sold its first machine in the U.S.

While an initial public offering may be an option for IQM further down the line, Goetz insisted the company has no IPO plans for the moment, adding there are still "attractive routes" in the private markets for raising capital.

The ultimate goal, he said, is to "build a sustainable, profitable business and really make it a kind of company that's there to stay and to shape the future of compute over a long time."

"We will do whatever is necessary to make that happen," Goetz added.

Klarna has paid more than $16 million to nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO.

The Swedish fintech has distributed $16.55 million to nonprofits founded by its chief executive officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski's wife over the last five years, according to the company's F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

Klarna has paid Nina Siemiatkowski's nonprofit Milkywire $2.75 million for its services since 2022, and a further $1 million to purchase carbon credits, which are permits to offset a portion of its greenhouse gas emissions through supporting projects that remove the equivalent amount of emissions.

It has also contributed $12.8 million to date to the WRLD Foundation, another nonprofit founded by the Klarna chief's wife, which channels donations to organizations identified and vetted by Milkywire on Klarna's behalf, the filing shows.

According to the WRLD Foundation's website, the climate impact-focused nonprofit was established in 2021 to raise awareness around sustainability, run educational programs, and support other nonprofits. Klarna's F-1 filing also notes that it allows customers to choose to make donations to the WRLD Foundation through its app and website as part of its environmental, social, and governance initiative.

Founded by Nina Siemiatkowski in 2018, Milkywire's website says it delivers climate impact solutions in areas including carbon removal, nature restoration, and protection. Klarna's F-1 filing also states that Milkywire provides it with other services and tools, including "product development, digital integrations, websites, campaigns, content creation and other digital solutions."

Klarna said in the filing that it underwent a thorough screening process before engaging Milkywire for its services and that it believes the fees paid to it are competitive. It added that the partnership was approved by its board of directors, but that Siemiatkowski recused himself from the process, in line with its conflict of interest policy.

Klarna declined to comment.

Klarna isn't the only company to engage with organizations linked to its executives' families. Google has previously invested in genetics firm 23andMe, which was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, who was married to Google cofounder Sergey Brin at the time.

Klarna's disclosure comes as it readies for its IPO next week, seeking to raise up to $1.72 billion in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

In this article

Alphabet shares rose 9% on Wednesday as investors viewed the result of Google's antitrust case as broadly favorable to the tech giant.

The U.S. Department of Justice had proposed a sort of breakup of Google, which included divesting its Chrome browser, in an antitrust case that began in September 2023.

While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the DOJ.

Google will not have to divest Chrome. The company can also still make payments to companies to preload products, but it cannot have exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing.

That means Google will still be able to pay Apple the billions of dollars it does to be the default search engine on iPhones. 

Apple shares were also higher.

"This is a monster win for Cupertino and for Google its a home run ruling that removes a huge overhang on the stock," Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Tuesday referring to Apple's headquarters in California.

Google has been facing rising competition to its core search business from the likes of Perplexity and OpenAI. But the company has so far fended off challenges with its advertising business still growing.

Google has pinned its hopes of becoming a major artificial intelligence player on Gemini, its suite of AI models and the chatbot that goes by the same name.

"Following today's announcement, we are increasingly constructive in the longer-term durability of Google's Search business and are raising our estimates accordingly," Ives said, adding that he now has a new price target of $245 for Alphabet's stock.

The ruling also means Google will not have to divest the Android operating system that it develops.

Android is seen as a key tool for Google to increase the number of users for Gemini given that around 70% of smartphones globally run the operating system, giving the U.S. technology giant an existing base of users.

With bitcoin BTC$112,205.65 stuck just above $110,000 and ether (ETH) consolidating after hitting fresh records, Solana SOL$209.69 has emerged as a standout performer in the crypto market recently.

The token traded around $211 on Monday, up 33% from early August lows, making it one of the best performers in the CoinDesk 20 Index in the past month. Against bitcoin, SOL has gained 34% over the past month, and it has strengthened 14% versus ETH since mid-August.

The rally reflects a broader rotation into altcoins, analysts said.

"The season of profit redistribution among holders of cryptocurrencies continues,” Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, said in a market note shared with CoinDesk. He said liquidity has been moving out of BTC into second-tier tokens, with "a noticeable increase in the positive dynamics in capital flows to SOL."

Such flows could be long-term as corporate investors look for large, liquid projects to hold, Gorev added, naming SOL alongside with XRP XRP$2.8584 as the "next interesting market ideas."

Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, tipped SOL to replicate ether's turnaround earlier this year. He pointed to Ethereum's resurgence after stablecoin adoption, strong ETF inflows and the relentless bid from digital asset treasuries, or DATs, helped ETH rally nearly 200% since April.

 "SOL appears poised to repeat the exact same playbook that ETH just executed in the coming months," Dorman wrote in a fresh report.

The first U.S.-listed Solana ETF launched in July, but it was futures-based. Several asset managers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have filed for spot products with decisions due later this year, Dorman said.

Meanwhile, at least three Solana-focused DATs are raising funds that could channel up to $2.65 billion into SOL over the next month, he added.

At only one-fifth of ETH's market capitalization, SOL's price could be even more reactive to the flows if they materialize.

"SOL might be the most obvious long right now," Dorman said. "If the price of ETH rose almost 200% on roughly $20 billion of new demand, what do you think happens to SOL on $2.5 billion or more of new demand?"

Recent news could also add to the momentum. Nasdaq-listed digital asset conglomerate Galaxy Digital tokenized its shares on Solana, while the approval of the Alpenglow upgrade promises to improve transaction speed and finality.

Oops, something went wrong

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Trimont LLC, a heavyweight in commercial real estate servicing with $730 billion in managed loans, has started using JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) Kinexys blockchain network to process payments in minutesrather than the typical two-day turnaround. The milestone came in August, marking Trimont's first use of Kinexys, and CEO Bill Sexton says broader rollout is already underway. The system automatically identifies incoming payments, checks for sufficiency, and disburses funds to lendersno more manual chasing, no more delays. There's significant financial benefit to our clients being able to receive the payments two days earlier, Sexton told reporters.

Is JPM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

That may sound like operational plumbing, but in fixed-income and real estate finance, time is cash. Kinexyswhich launched in 2019 and currently handles $3 billion in daily volumesis still tiny compared to JPMorgan's $10 trillion payments footprint, but it's gaining traction as programmable money becomes more than just whiteboard theory. JPMorgan enabled smart-condition payments in 2023, allowing real-world transactions to execute even outside banking hours. The tech underpinning stablecoins is now being weaponized not for retail speculation, but for institutional-grade capital movement.

Programmable payments are one of the innovations that blockchain and digital currencies bring to the digitization of money, said Kinexys co-head Naveen Mallela. Trimont's move may be the early innings of something bigger: large-scale money flows shifting to blockchain rails, not because of crypto hype, but because the infrastructure finally works. For investors watching the intersection of real estate, enterprise software, and digital financethis could be a tipping point worth circling.

 Bitcoin bulls are trying to get back into the driver's seat by pushing the price above $112,500. Will altcoins follow? 

Key points:

Bitcoin made a strong comeback, confirming that dip buyers were present at lower levels; higher levels could continue to attract sellers.

Select altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, indicating a positive sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $112,500 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls are trying to extend the recovery. The relief rally attracted buying in spot BTC exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, which recorded $332.7 million in net inflows, according to SoSoValue data.

A positive sign for the crypto bulls is that gold (XAU) made a new high above $3,500 (per ounce) on Tuesday. History shows that BTC follows gold with a lag. BTC's median rise following gold's new all-time high is 30% at three months, and 225% at 12 months. If history repeats, BTC could rally to the $135,000 to $145,000 zone by early December.

However, September's weak seasonality is a risk for the bulls in the near term. Network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that BTC plunges 100% of the time between Sept. 16 and Sept. 23, with a typical decline of 5%.

What are the critical resistance levels to watch out for in BTC and the major altcoins? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

BTC rose back above the breakdown level of $110,530 on Tuesday, indicating solid demand at lower levels.

There is stiff resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($112,438), but if the bulls overcome it, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($115,640). Such a move suggests that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may then attempt a rally toward $124,474.

If bears want to retain the advantage, they will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA and swiftly pull the Bitcoin price below $107,255. If they manage to do that, the pair could plummet to $105,000 and eventually to the vital support at $100,000. 

ETH (ETH) closed below the 20-day EMA ($4,379) on Monday, but the bears could not pull the price to the $4,094 support.

The bulls are trying to make a comeback by maintaining the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,500 and, after that, to $4,664. Sellers will try to defend the zone between $4,664 and $4,956 because a break above it could resume the uptrend toward the next target objective of $5,662.

The 50-day SMA ($4,072) is the critical level to watch out for on the downside. If this support cracks, the Ether price could tumble to $3,745 and then to $3,354.

XRP (XRP) bounced off the $2.73 level on Monday, indicating that the bulls are aggressively defending the level.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($2.93), which is sloping down. The XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a break and close below $2.73. That could start a downward move to $2.20.

Buyers will have to thrust the price above the downtrend line to negate the bearish pattern. The XRP price may then rally toward $3.40, signaling that the pair may remain stuck between $2.73 and $3.66 for a while.

Buyers are trying to sustain BNB (BNB) above the 20-day EMA ($849), but the bears have kept up the pressure.

If the 20-day EMA gives way, the BNB/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($811). Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and $794.

If the price turns up and breaks above $869, it suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The bulls will then try to push the price above $881, challenging the overhead resistance at $900. A break and close above $900 signals the start of the next leg of the uptrend to the psychological level of $1,000.

Solana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($197) on Tuesday, signaling that the positive sentiment remains intact.

Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $218 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. That clears the path for a rally to $240 and then to $260.

The uptrend line is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. Sellers will have to drag the price below the uptrend line to invalidate the bullish setup. The Solana price may sink to $175 and thereafter to $155. 

Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.21 support but are struggling to push the price above the moving averages.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.22) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could slump to $0.19 and then to $0.16.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.22). That suggests the Dogecoin price may oscillate inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days.

Cardano (ADA) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern for a few days, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.

If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.84), the ADA/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to mount a vigorous defense at the downtrend line, but if the bulls prevail, the Cardano price could rise to $0.96 and later to $1.02.

Instead, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to pull the pair to the support line. That is a critical level for the bulls to defend because a break below the channel may sink the price to $0.68.

Chainlink (LINK) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day EMA ($23.45).

The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns down from the current level, the LINK/USDT pair could find support at the 50-day SMA ($20.99).

Contrarily, buyers will gain the edge in the near term if they push and maintain the Chainlink price above $24.06. If they manage to do that, the pair could march toward $26 and then $27.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned up from the uptrend line on Tuesday, but the bears are likely to sell at higher levels.  

A break and close below the uptrend line invalidates the bullish ascending triangle pattern. That may pull the Hyperliquid price to $40 and subsequently to the solid support at $35.51.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price maintains above $45.50, it suggests that the bulls are buying on dips. The HYPE/USDT pair could then ascend to the overhead resistance at $49.88. This is a crucial level to watch out for because a close above $49.88 opens the gates for a rally to the pattern target of $64.25.

Sui (SUI) closed below the $3.26 support on Monday, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.

The bulls pushed the Sui price back above $3.26 on Tuesday but are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears at the 20-day EMA ($3.45). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the risk of a break below $3.11 increases. The SUI/USDT pair could then plummet to $2.80.

Alternatively, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($3.67).

Kevin O'Leary is turning away from NFTs and putting millions into rare, physical collectibles, specifically high-end sports cards.

The "Shark Tank" star and O'Leary Ventures chairman recently co-purchased a $13 million dual Logoman card featuring Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan, he said during an interview with CoinDesk TV's Jennifer Sanasie. The card is one-of-a-kind, and O'Leary—often called "Mr. Wonderful"—sees it as a cornerstone of his growing “index” of unique collectibles.

"The majority of the returns over 20 years have accrued to the collectors who bought the piece uniques," O'Leary said, comparing the strategy to his long-standing investments in Andy Warhol art and luxury watches. Rather than outbidding others, O'Leary partnered with two investors to acquire the card. "I'd rather own 33 and a third of it than zero," he said.

Pouring millions into rare sports cards isn't a passion project—it's a calculated bet. "It once traded for $75,000 years and years ago, but it shows you the price appreciation," O'Leary said.

"Grown men are going to weep when they see this," he added.

Despite the overlap with tokenization, O'Leary made it clear that he has no interest in NFTs. 

"NFTs turned out to be a fad," he said. "I'm only buying assets that are physical assets... That [NFT] fad came and went. I'm very fortunate I didn't get involved in that because I never understood it."

O'Leary's sharp dismissal of NFTs comes just a few years after the market exploded in popularity. In 2021, trading volume on NFT marketplaces surged to $25 billion, up from just $95 million the year before, according to data from DappRadar and Chainalysis. Celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Steph Curry rushed to launch collections, while major brands including Nike, Adidas and Coca-Cola entered the space. 

But the hype was short-lived. NFT sales volumes fell more than 80% by mid-2022 amid the broader crypto downturn, and prices for high-profile collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks plunged from their peaks, according to the data.

O'Leary's issue with NFTS is the lack of physical existence of the assets. "Where is the asset? Where can I put my white glove on and go touch it? That's what you can't do with an NFT."

However, he said his collectibles "will one day be tokenized," because "it would be much easier to deal with and manage them in an index that way."

O'Leary frames this shift as part of a larger mission: "Wall Street on chain." 

He believes blockchain infrastructure can modernize how assets are managed—improving transparency, liquidity and trust in markets that still rely heavily on intermediaries.

He remains bullish on foundational cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, and infrastructure plays like mining operators and exchanges.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin dominance has retreated from its 62% peak to 55%, marking one of our favorite metrics for gauging market rotation dynamics and suggesting early signs of capital flowing into alts.

Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin's market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap, serving as a key indicator of whether investors are favoring Bitcoin's "safe haven" status or seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins.

This 700 basis point decline from the cycle peak is an encouraging setup for altcoins heading into the fourth quarter, with Ethereum and Solana showing early signs of renewed interest as institutional and retail capital begin to rotate into alternative assets.



Digital asset treasures (DATs) are headlining this push for Solana and Ethereum with multiple teams working to raise capital and buy up assets through a publicly traded entity. From the 2021/2022 cycle, Bitcoin dominance fell below 40%, suggesting there is significant runway for altcoin rallies if market conditions continue to favor risk assets.

The current 55% level positions the market in a transitional phase where altcoins can begin establishing momentum without requiring extreme speculative fervor.

However, a critical factor to monitor will be whether altcoins can capture genuine spot market demand, rather than primarily benefiting from derivatives-driven momentum. With substantial institutional capital potentially flowing into digital asset treasuries and ETF products, the question remains whether this buying power will translate into direct token purchases that drive sustainable price appreciation.

Oops, something went wrong

The U.S. economy is staring down a debt-fueled heart attack within the next few years, but that will likely buoy cryptocurrency prices, according to veteran asset manager Ray Dalio.

In an interview with the Financial Times, the Bridgewater Associates founder linked a rise in the price of digital assets and gold to America's overwhelming debt burden, which isn't improving, according to a transcript of the conversation that he posted to X on Wednesday.

The U.S. government is spending more money than it's taking in, while servicing enormous amounts of debt. And as the government borrows more to cover budget shortfalls, while managing its existing burden, creditors could eventually cause trouble, Dalio said.

Creditors will sell U.S. debt as they grow worried about its ability to function as a store of value, he said. That will likely put the Federal Reserve in a tough position, Dalio added, where it has to decide between rising interest rates and a debt default crisis or printing money to buy debt and “try to hold real interest rates down, which will lower the value of money.”

The billionaire, who foresaw the 2008 financial meltdown, described it as the "traumatic last phase” of a “big debt cycle,” where over the course of history, excessive debt has culminated in an economic contraction and systematic crisis.

To that point, Dalio said that deregulation isn't a threat to governments' use of fiat currencies in stabilizing economies or facilitating international trade. It is rather unhealthy debt levels, he said, that are eroding the status of currencies like the greenback across several sovereigns.

“I do see the dollar and the other reserve currency governments' bad debt situations as threatening to their appeals as reserve currencies and storeholds of wealth, which is what has been contributing to the rises in gold and cryptocurrency prices,” he said.

Bitcoin and gold have surged this year. The precious metal's price has increased 38% year-to-date, hitting an all-time high of $3,530 per ounce Wednesday, according to Trading Economics. Bitcoin's price has increased 20% to $112,000 over the same period, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Dalio's latest assessment of the U.S. economy follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, a federal framework for stablecoins. Dalio said that a decline in the purchasing power of U.S. Treasuries “shouldn't produce any systematic risk” for them, if they are well regulated.

Dalio said cryptocurrencies resemble hard currencies, partly due to their so-called tokenomics. Bitcoin's total supply, for example, is capped at 21 million, while the government can theoretically print an unlimited amount of money.

“Crypto is now an alternative currency that has its supply limited, so, all things being equal, if the supply of dollar money rises and/or the demand for it falls, that would likely make crypto an attractive alternative currency,” he said.

Trump Bros' American Bitcoin Mining Stock Soars, Then Plunges During Public Debut

In late July, Dalio urged investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin and gold. It's a macroeconomic hedge amid increasing risks in bond and equity markets, he said.

Dalio expressed a preference for gold, arguing that a central bank is unlikely to adopt the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization as a reserve currency. Still, the outlook for some fiat currencies is bleak, he said in the interview with the Financial Times.

“I think that most fiat currencies, especially those with large debts, will have problems being effective storeholds of wealth and will go down in value relative to hard currencies,” he said, pointing to parallels between the coming years and two periods in the 20th century.

The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (“GENIUS”) Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. The GENIUS Act is part of a broader push to accelerate the development of emerging technologies in the U.S., from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. That same push is showing up in the patent world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles.

Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain patents. In Ex Parte David L. Newman, the PTAB reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. § 101 and provided some useful discussion of how the USPTO (and patent applicants) should approach blockchain-related patents. The claims at issue relate to “securely storing data across a network in a multi-dimensional distributed database” in order to “process[] license contracts, including computing proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian addresses.”

The Examiner had rejected the claims as directed to the abstract idea of “payment, distribution, and pricing for two users bound by a contractual relationship,” concluding that the additional elements in the claims do not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application. In the Examiner's view, the invention simply used “a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea.” The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging that the claims involved an abstract idea because “[i]t is well settled that commercial interactions involving payment transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human activity.”

However, the Board drew the line at step 2 of the Alice analysis. Unlike the Examiner, the Board determined that the claims integrate the abstract idea into a practical application “by improving the technical functioning of the recited blockchain by transforming it into a multi-dimensional database slidechain that allows for the execution and simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain.” In other words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself operates. As the Board explained, the claims “recite[] steps that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain… [and] uses the recited abstract idea in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a particular technological environment.”

Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based on 35 U.S.C. § 101. Specifically, applicants should use their specification to clearly articulate how their invention improves “the performance of a computer” and/or “the functionality of the blockchain and the processing thereof.”

The Proskauer Intellectual Property Team is continuing to monitor the evolving guidance on patent eligibility of emerging technologies. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader emerging technology space.

Turkey's central bank has issued a ‘call for participation' for companies in the finance and technology sectors to ‘enrich' its ongoing explorations into the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (TCMB)'s directorate-general for payment systems and financial technologies announced the move today (3 September) via a seven-page ‘call for participation in the digital Turkish lira project ecosystem' document (Turkish-language only), accompanied by a short press release (in English).

The Ankara-headquartered authority is conducting studies to evaluate the feasibility of a CBDC and specifically wants to ‘demonstrate the potential features, test different technological infrastructures and system designs, and implement pilot applications.'

The central bank is welcoming project applications across five areas of interest: tokenisation, programmable payments, user-sovereign identity (also known as self-sovereign identity), interoperability with existing systems, and ‘machine-to-machine payment scenarios.'

Project applications can be submitted under one or more of the categories. Organisations can apply with a maximum of three projects. The deadline for applications for ‘first stage' involvement is 15 October 2025.

RELATED ARTICLE Turkish central bank progresses ‘digital lira' tests – a news story (10 January 2023) on a previous milestone on the central bank's CBDC journey – see below

The TCMB is already relatively well progressed in its CBDC explorations – which it refers to as the ‘Digital Turkish Lira Project'.

A ‘Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform' was established in 2021 via the signing memorandums of understanding with two companies – Aselsan and Havelsan – and TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey), an institution affiliated with Turkey's Ministry of Industry and Technology. Aselsan and Havelsan are best known as defence companies though they also operate in sectors including IT and software.

The Digital Turkish Lira Project's first phase focused on retail payments. By 2022, the necessary infrastructure had been developed, and the first successful payment transactions were completed in pilot tests at the end of the year. Pilot tests continued in 2023 and a 63-page ‘Digital Turkish Lira First Phase Evaluation Report' was published (Turkish language – a 64-page English-language version was subsequently published).

The second phase is now ongoing is focused on ‘develop[ing] projects encompassing new use cases, in addition to ongoing studies in technology, economics and law, and to enrich the Digital Turkish Lira Project ecosystem with additional participation.'

The central bank says it wants companies ‘to develop exemplary scenarios based on the categories and criteria outlined in the Call document, develop innovative projects based on these scenarios, and collaborate on them.'

‘This will diversify the use of the Digital Turkish Lira, aiming to make it a key component of Turkey's rapidly developing financial technology ecosystem,' the central bank states.

At a global level, CBDCs increasingly seem to be in the shadow of an alternative, and increasingly popular, type of digital currency – stablecoins, which are issued by private companies (that said, the US state of Wyoming last month made government fintech history by issuing the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US).

A Bank for International Settlements (BIS)'s survey about central banks' CBDC activities during 2024 (published last month – August 2025) found that, of 93 central banks surveyed, 85 were exploring either a retail CBDC (for general population use), a wholesale CBDC (for interbank use) or both. But none of the few CBDCs currently ‘live' globally are proving popular.

In Turkey, plans to launch a ‘blockchain-based' digital currency within four years were published in 2019 although CBDC research in the country pre-dates that.

The central bank stated in December 2022 that ‘studies on the legal dimension show that digital identification is of critical importance' to the CBDC project. A 2023 Presidential Annual Programme (Turkish language), published by the Presidency Strategy and Budget directorate in October 2022, included mention of CBDC. It stated that integration of a CBDC with ‘identity' and central bank-operated instant payment system FAST ‘within the scope of research and development studies will be completed'. The 391-page document's brief CBDC section also stated that research with banks would take place focused on wholesale CBDC.

Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world, according to the World Bank. The country has a population of about 85.5 million people.

Turkey's central bank has issued a ‘call for participation' for companies in the finance and technology sectors to ‘enrich' its ongoing explorations into the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (TCMB)'s directorate-general for payment systems and financial technologies announced the move today (3 September) via a seven-page ‘call for participation in the digital Turkish lira project ecosystem' document (Turkish-language only), accompanied by a short press release (in English).

The Ankara-headquartered authority is conducting studies to evaluate the feasibility of a CBDC and specifically wants to ‘demonstrate the potential features, test different technological infrastructures and system designs, and implement pilot applications.'

The central bank is welcoming project applications across five areas of interest: tokenisation, programmable payments, user-sovereign identity (also known as self-sovereign identity), interoperability with existing systems, and ‘machine-to-machine payment scenarios.'

Project applications can be submitted under one or more of the categories. Organisations can apply with a maximum of three projects. The deadline for applications for ‘first stage' involvement is 15 October 2025.

The TCMB is already relatively well progressed in its CBDC explorations – which it refers to as the ‘Digital Turkish Lira Project'.

A ‘Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform' was established in 2021 via the signing memorandums of understanding with two companies – Aselsan and Havelsan – and TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey), an institution affiliated with Turkey's Ministry of Industry and Technology. Aselsan and Havelsan are best known as defence companies though they also operate in sectors including IT and software.

The Digital Turkish Lira Project's first phase focused on retail payments. By 2022, the necessary infrastructure had been developed, and the first successful payment transactions were completed in pilot tests at the end of the year. Pilot tests continued in 2023 and a 63-page ‘Digital Turkish Lira First Phase Evaluation Report' was published (Turkish language – a 64-page English-language version was subsequently published).

Vaycaychella (OTC:VAYK) has announced the revival of its cryptocurrency strategy to monetize historic landmarks valued at $10-20 million through NFTs and crypto treasury management. The company plans to renovate historic properties for short-term rentals while tokenizing their cultural value.

The first project will feature the Rufus Rose House in Atlanta, valued at $2.5 million. VAYK's NFT strategy includes offering tokens backed by unique renovation visuals and complimentary one-night stays. The company aims to generate additional revenue through crypto treasury management, with profits shared between shareholders and NFT holders.

첫 번째 프로젝트는 애틀랜타에 있는 Rufus Rose House로, 감정가가 $250만입니다. VAYK의 NFT 전략은 리노베이션의 독점 시각 자료로 뒷받침되는 토큰과 1박 무료 숙박을 제공하는 것을 포함합니다. 또한 암호화폐 자금 관리로 추가 수익을 창출하고, 수익을 주주와 NFT 보유자 간에 분배할 예정입니다.

ATLANTA, Sept. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vaycaychella, Inc. (OTC Pink: VAYK) ("VAYK") today announced the revival of its cryptocurrency strategy, amid the growing trend among investors and public companies to apply "crypto treasury" to the assets controlled by public companies. This initiative aims to monetize intangible assets of historic landmarks valued at up to $10 to $20 million.

This strategy is part of the company's comprehensive business plan to offer a one-stop service solution for the $64 billion short-term rental industry. The business plan consists of three integrated services: property renovation, particularly of historic landmark properties; short-term rental management, enhanced with AI tools; and an innovative financing model involving the application of a crypto treasury strategy.

"We have always been pioneers in exploring the potential of applying cryptocurrency strategies to daily business operations," stated Jason Armstrong, CEO of Vaycaychella. "In March 2022, the previous management acquired Definancial, Inc., a technology firm developing cryptocurrency exchange solutions. After the new management team took over in 2024, we planned to release crypto-based Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on our newly acquired rights to a $2.5 million property, which is a nationally registered historic landmark. However, the NFT market was at a low point, and we had to postpone our cryptocurrency business."

"Now is the time to launch it," declared Armstrong.

The concept is to leverage the unique and fungible cultural value of historic landmark buildings while renovating these buildings into boutique short-term rentals (such as Airbnb). The company will sell NFT tokens, each minted using unique visual records of the renovation process of the historic landmarks, with a bonus feature of a one-night free stay at these buildings after they are renovated into Airbnb properties. Furthermore, the proceeds from selling these NFTs will be managed under a cryptocurrency treasury account, from which the potential gains will be split between the company and the NFT holders.

"One of the great features of utilizing NFTs and a crypto treasury is that they will not dilute the value of current shareholders, but will add an extra source of profit for them," added Armstrong. "These NFTs and cryptocurrencies will monetize intangible historic and cultural value, which is not reflected in our current balance sheet and therefore has not been used to increase our current shareholders' equity value. Once monetized, they will not only benefit the NFT holders but also may generate significant revenue for current shareholders."

Armstrong projected that the NFT and its linked crypto treasury account would become operational in a few months. The first group of NFTs will be released on basis of the historic landmark Rufus Rose House in downtown Atlanta.  Meanwhile, the company is in discussions with potential partners to add more historic landmark buildings to its NFT and crypto treasury strategy, aiming to bring the total portfolio value to between $10 and $20 million.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Etherealize, the advocacy group for the second-largest blockchain formed of heavy hitters like former Ethereum Foundation lead developer Danny Ryan and former Wall Street trader Vivek Raman, has raised $40 million, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

The funding round was led by Electric Capital and Paradigm. The round appears to be the firm's first cash injection since receiving grants from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation in 2024 to kickstart its operations.

Etherealize is part of a growing trend within the Ethereum community to formalize operations and fully make the case for the blockchain as "the settlement layer for the world." Other changes include shakeups at the Ethereum Foundation, which hired two new co-directors and is attempting to right what had been a confusing development schedule.

"Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world's most battle-tested, open financial network. This raise kicks off the 'Institutional Merge' — upgrading institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails," Etherealize President Danny Ryan, who led development of Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake called the Merge, said in the release. 

Raman previously told The Block that Etherealize is specifically aiming to pitch institutions on the decentralized blockchain and ETH as an asset. One of the first official moves from the group was to publish a price report that suggested ETH could reach $8,000-$80,000 in the "short-term" as a monetary reserve and commodity asset.

Additionally, Etherealize builds institutional-grade, zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure. It is also working on a "settlement engine optimized for institutional tokenization workflows" and a "suite of applications designed to bring utility and liquidity to tokenized fixed income markets," according to the announcement. 

Since officially launching in January, Etherealize says it has made inroads with Wall Street, including "top banks, asset managers, and payment networks" to influence their product development as well as regulators. Notably, Raman testified before the House Financial Services Committee during deliberations on the Clarity Act.

Hong Kong, China, September 3rd, 2025, Chainwire

Moca Network, the flagship project by Animoca Brands that is building the world's largest chain-agnostic decentralized digital identity network, today announced the upcoming launch of MocaPortfolio, a new approach offering the Moca Network community exposure to Animoca Brands' ecosystem.

Participants of MocaPortfolio will be eligible to receive token allocations at a combined valuation of US$20 million from projects in Animoca Brands' investment and partnership portfolio, subject to vesting terms. MocaPortfolio is the conduit through which the MOCA Coin (MOCA) and Mocaverse NFT communities can engage with and support Animoca Brands' portfolio companies via access to vested token allocations, which represents a departure from traditional one-off airdrops.

Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said: “MocaPortfolio represents an evolution in how we reward and involve our community.

Home - Companies - Coinbase Just Launched a Groundbreaking Futures Product Mixing Big Tech and Crypto ETFs

TL;DR

Coinbase has unveiled a first-of-its-kind derivatives product that merges the performance of leading U.S. technology stocks with cryptocurrency ETFs into a single tradable instrument. The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures, set to debut on September 22, aims to give investors diversified exposure across two historically separate markets while offering capital efficiency and strategic risk management.

The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index consists of 10 equally weighted components, combining the “Magnificent 7” U.S. tech giants with Coinbase's stock and two crypto ETFs associated with BlackRock. The stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla, while the crypto portion includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) rounds out the list. Each asset represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weighting.

These futures contracts are monthly and cash-settled, with each unit representing $1 multiplied by the index price. For example, if the index is valued at $3000, a single contract would have a notional value of $3000. This structure is designed to be straightforward for traders while enabling efficient capital deployment. MarketVector serves as the official index provider, overseeing composition and rebalancing.











Coinbase positions the product as a tool for thematic exposure to innovation and growth, combining transformative technology companies with blockchain-native assets. The built-in diversification helps mitigate overexposure to any single stock or ETF, while the multi-asset nature allows for more nuanced risk management. The company describes this launch as the beginning of a “new era of multi-asset derivatives” that broadens access to different asset classes in one package.

At first, the Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures will be offered via partner trading platforms. Coinbase has announced intentions to provide access to retail investors soon, indicating a wider rollout plan. By integrating both traditional equities and crypto ETFs, Coinbase is targeting a growing demand for products that straddle the line between conventional finance and digital assets.

 Bitcoin's march toward $150,000 could gain momentum as soaring G7 bond yields push investors toward hard assets like BTC and gold. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin thrives when yields rise on debt and inflation fears, but struggles when central banks tighten aggressively.

Today's bond market stress looks inflation- and debt-driven, suggesting BTC could follow gold's record run with higher-beta gains.

Long-term government bond yields are ripping across the US, Europe, Japan and the UK, even as central banks slash policy rates. 

The 30-year US Treasury is back near 5%, France's long bond trades above 4% for the first time since 2011, and UK gilts are testing 27-year highs. Japan's 30-year yield has reached record levels, prompting analysts to call it the “collapse of global G7 bond markets.”

But what happens to Bitcoin amid this concerning macroeconomic outlook? Let's examine.

History shows that Bitcoin's reaction to rising government bond yields depends on why yields are climbing. Sometimes it rallies like “digital gold,” other times it struggles like a risk asset.

Take the 2013 taper tantrum. 

When the Federal Reserve hinted it would slow its money-printing program, the US 10-year yield shot toward 3%. Investors grew anxious about inflation and debt, a sentiment that aligned with Bitcoin's price explosion from under $100 to over $1,000.

A similar story played out in early 2021. 

Yields climbed as markets priced in higher inflation during the post-COVID recovery. Bitcoin moved in step with gold, surging to around $65,000 by April.

However, in 2018, the outcome was the opposite. 

Yields rose above 3% not because of inflation or debt fears, but because the Fed was hiking aggressively. Real returns on bonds looked attractive, and Bitcoin plunged by about 85% during the same period.

It shows that Bitcoin behaves like a hedging asset with more upside when yields rise due to inflation, deficits or excess debt supply. Bitcoin usually struggles when yields rise because central banks are tightening into growth.

Bitcoin has risen by 4.2% in the past three days, moving in lockstep with a surge in long-term Treasury debt in the US and other G7 nations. 

At the same time, its holder retention rate is climbing, showing that more traders are choosing to hold onto BTC as a hedge instead of selling. 

The backdrop is hard to ignore. US government debt jumped from $36.2 trillion in July to $37.3 trillion by September, up by over $1 trillion in just two months. 

Across the Atlantic, Europe and the UK are facing similar borrowing waves. 

The result has been record-sized bond auctions that only clear at higher yields. This is a sign that demand for government bonds is weakening. UK's 30-year bond yield, for instance, reached its highest level since 1998 on Wednesday.

Gold has already confirmed the shift in investor behavior, away from trusting government bonds and toward hard assets. 

The metal's surge to record highs above $3,500 this week shows that markets are actively hedging against runaway debt and inflation. 

Historically, Bitcoin benefits from such capital rotations a little later than gold. But once it does, it moves faster and further than the precious metal, acting as the higher-beta refuge from monetary and fiscal excess.

“The central banks are losing control of the long end of the curve,” noted Mark Moss, chief of Bitcoin Strategist at UK-based DeFi firm Satsuma Technology, adding: 

Many analysts see Bitcoin reaching a record high of $150,000-200,000 by 2026.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The crypto markets are booming, but the most recent wave of enthusiasm isn't just from small-time traders or dabblers curious about memecoins. Big financial institutions are leaning in. Etherealize, a startup launched in January, hopes to convince Wall Street to dive even further into crypto, and it's raised $40 million to build out products and infrastructure on Ethereum for financial institutions. 

Longtime crypto venture capitalists Electric Capital and Paradigm led the fundraising round. Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of Ethereum, and the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to developing the protocol, also helped fund Etherealize with an initial grant. The raise was for equity and token warrants, Vivek Raman, cofounder and CEO of Etherealize, told Fortune.





“Now's the time to really, really mobilize,” Raman said. “I think that we have the best window of first possible adoption that I've ever seen.” 





As the Trump administration ushers in a new era of pro-crypto regulation, traditional financial institutions have started to more publicly explore blockchain technology. Big banks are considering launching their own stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. And asset managers are putting financial products on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.





“The window is now,” Raman said.




The Etherealize CEO isn't speaking just as a crypto booster—but as a veteran of traditional finance who's spent years at Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. “There aren't institutional builders that are willing to go through and walk through all of their processes and pain points,” he said. “I want to do that. I actually think that stuff is fun.”





In August 2024, Raman received a grant from Ethereum cofounder Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation to talk with a swath of Wall Street executives about if and how financial institutions wanted to use Ethereum.





“It was market discovery,” he said. “We were going in, making sure the market wanted Ethereum.”





The market spoke, and in early 2025, Raman launched Etherealize, a portmanteau of “Ethereum” and “realize,” along with Danny Ryan, a longtime Ethereum developer and researcher; Grant Hummer, another traditional finance veteran and Ethereum booster; and Zach Obront, an Ethereum security engineer.





“The regulatory pendulum can only swing so far,” Ryan said. In other words, he anticipates that the permissive regulatory regime under Trump will eventually subside.




That's why he, Raman, and their 14 employees are focused on onboarding as many Wall Street institutions as possible. Instead of just advocating for Ethereum, they're building out products and infrastructure that financial institutions can use to streamline what Raman calls “Stone Age technology.”





While the Etherealize CEO declined to give specifics, he said they were focused on tokenizing, or putting in blockchain wrappers for, financial assets like mortgages, credit, and other fixed-income products—among other projects.





“They trade over the phone, and they settle using fax machines, and they use wire transfers,” said Raman, in reference Wall Street traders. “If you digitize and put [assets] on a blockchain, it's a step function of improvement.”

Galaxy Digital has started offering investors the option to tokenize their stock.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) stockholders now have the option to turn their shares into digital tokens on the blockchain. The crypto-finance and data center company said investors can tokenize their shares through Superstate, a fintech startup in its venture portfolio. This process allows shares to be legally represented on-chain while still carrying the same rights and protections as traditional stock.





So far, 21 investors have used the system, with a total of 32,374 Galaxy shares tokenized on the Solana blockchain. The project is mainly designed for institutional investors and professional traders, who are more familiar with navigating registration requirements and digital asset platforms.

The company's leadership said they want to do more than just talk about blockchain's potential. Instead, they are actively moving stock trading onto blockchain rails. Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research, said the company wants to push things forward rather than wait for regulators to give them a green light.

By linking real stock to blockchain tokens, Galaxy is offering investors the chance to trade shares with the benefits of digital assets. These benefits include 24-hour trading, faster settlement, and the ability to use peer-to-peer transactions.

Tokenization has been discussed for years, but many firms held back due to unclear rules. Galaxy and Superstate are taking a different approach. They said their initiative works within current laws and that they are engaging directly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The biggest roadblock is Automated Market Makers, which are blockchain-based trading engines. Regulators have not yet set rules for how these can operate with securities. As a result, Galaxy's tokenized shares can be traded directly between investors but cannot yet be bought and sold on demand in a fully open market.

Other companies have experimented with tokenized assets, but most used synthetic derivatives rather than real shares. Robinhood (HOOD) introduced U.S. stock tokens in Europe, and Kraken added tokenized trading on Ethereum. However, Galaxy's method is different. It gives holders direct ownership rights, making the tokens legally equal to their regular stock.

Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said this step is a milestone that the entire industry can learn from. He added that while this does not create a full tokenization revolution today, it opens the door to one in the near future.

Galaxy Digital stock (TSE:GLXY) carries a Strong Buy consensus, based on 11 Wall Street analyst ratings over the past three months. Out of those, 10 analysts call it a Buy, one rates it a Hold, and none suggest a Sell.

The average 12-month GLXY price target stands at C$49.65, which implies nearly a 49% upside from the last price.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- XRP solidifies its role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance in 2025, driven by Ripple's infrastructure dominance and regulatory breakthroughs.

- Ripple's $1.3 trillion ODL network and SEC victory paved the way for the first XRP ETF, unlocking $8 billion in institutional capital and CBDC partnerships.

- XRP's $2.77 price and DeepSeek AI's $5 target highlight its speculative appeal, while ETF adoption and October 2025 seasonal trends suggest growth potential.

- Experts recommend dollar-cost averaging and legal safeguards for XRP investors, emphasizing its dual utility as a stable infrastructure asset and high-risk/high-reward play.

 

In 2025, XRP has emerged as a linchpin in the evolution of global digital finance, driven by Ripple's infrastructure dominance, regulatory breakthroughs, and strategic CBDC partnerships. As central banks and institutions accelerate their transition to tokenized assets, XRP's role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance is becoming increasingly critical. This analysis explores how XRP's unique positioning—coupled with expert investment strategies—positions it as a cornerstone for long-term wealth creation in the next phase of digital finance.  

Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service has processed $1.3 trillion in cross-border payments through 300+ institutional partners in 2025, leveraging XRP's 3–5 second settlement times and near-zero fees to outperform legacy systems like SWIFT [1]. This infrastructure dominance is underpinned by Ripple's legal victory over the SEC in August 2025, which not only removed regulatory uncertainty but also paved the way for the first SEC-approved XRP ETF [1]. The ETF's anticipated launch is projected to unlock $8 billion in institutional capital inflows, further solidifying XRP's role in global financial infrastructure.  

Ripple's adaptability is also evident in its CBDC-related initiatives. SWIFT's Q3 2025 interoperability tests with the XRP Ledger demonstrated its potential as a complementary layer for tokenized assets, including U.S. Treasuries and gold [1]. Meanwhile, partnerships with the Republic of Palau and Bhutan to pilot digital currency projects highlight XRP's growing appeal as a scalable, energy-efficient solution for cross-border interoperability [3]. With over 100 countries exploring CBDCs, Ripple's technology is uniquely positioned to address the scalability and efficiency challenges of the next-generation financial system.  

While competitors like Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL) focus on permissioned enterprise integration, XRP's decentralized model and established network of partnerships offer broader institutional appeal [1]. GCUL's closed architecture, though tailored for corporate clients, lacks the open protocol flexibility that enables XRP to serve as a universal bridge for both fiat and tokenized assets. This distinction is critical as macroeconomic tailwinds—such as the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs)—gain momentum. Ripple's expansion into stablecoins, tokenized securities, and RWA platforms further cements its role in the evolving digital finance ecosystem [1].  

Retail investor sentiment for XRP in 2025 is cautiously optimistic, with the token trading around $2.77 as of September 2025. Technical analysts highlight key support levels at $2.50–$2.60 and resistance at $2.80–$2.90, with a breakdown below $2.80 potentially exposing further downside [2]. Conversely, a reclamation of this level could trigger a rally toward $3.40–$3.45. DeepSeek AI's projection of a $5 target by late 2025 adds to the bullish narrative, driven by XRP's breakout from a five-month consolidation pattern [3].  

The anticipated XRP ETF is a major catalyst for both institutional and retail adoption, mirroring the inflows seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Historical market cycles also suggest a potential rally in October 2025, aligning with seasonal trends and regulatory momentum [4]. For investors, this creates a window of opportunity to capitalize on XRP's dual role as a utility asset and speculative play.  

Experts emphasize proactive wealth protection and strategic planning for XRP investors. Jake Claver, a crypto adviser for ultra-wealthy clients, recommends establishing legal, tax, and security structures before profits materialize. Tools like digital asset trusts, LLCs, and custody solutions can safeguard holdings against volatility and generational wealth transfer challenges [1].  

For retail investors, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) remains a core strategy to mitigate XRP's price swings. Diversifying portfolios with Bitcoin and Ethereum while monitoring whale activity and technical indicators can identify optimal entry points [5]. Additionally, low-cap altcoins like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) may offer high-growth opportunities, though they come with elevated risks [3].  

XRP's strategic positioning in the global CBDC ecosystem—bolstered by regulatory clarity, infrastructure dominance, and institutional adoption—makes it a compelling asset for long-term wealth creation. As Ripple continues to expand its partnerships and integrate with real-world assets, XRP is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the transition to a tokenized global economy. For investors, a balanced approach that combines technical analysis, regulatory foresight, and proactive wealth management will be key to navigating this dynamic landscape.

Roblox Lawsuit Reveals Wider Pattern of Digital Predators Grooming Kids and the Urgent Need for a Multi-Front Strategy to End It

In an era where children are increasingly connected to technology, the need to protect their online safety has never been more urgent. The internet offers incredible educational opportunities and social connections, but it also exposes children to significant risks, from cyberbullying to exploitation. In North Carolina, a 10-year-old girl became the victim of online exploitation through Roblox, one of the world's most popular gaming platforms. The case, now in Guilford County Superior Court, reveals a chilling reality: predators are leveraging gaming platforms, virtual currencies, and sophisticated grooming techniques to exploit children in ways that can escalate to human trafficking.

What You Need to Know

The Case and the Pattern Behind It
In the North Carolina lawsuit, an adult allegedly masqueraded as a child, built rapport in-game, then offered Robux in exchange for explicit images before escalating to coercion. This is not an outlier. It mirrors how modern offenders operate on youth-heavy platforms: establish trust, isolate by moving channels, and exploit, often with digital currency as the hook.

Roblox counters that it invests heavily in safety (AI and 24/7 human moderation), restricts the sharing of links and personal information, and collaborates with law enforcement and child-safety partners. Roblox designed its own AI-warning system, “Sentinel,” which submitted approximately 1,200 reports of potential child exploitation attempts to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the first half of 2025. Those steps matter, but at the family and school level, waiting for platforms to solve this alone leaves children exposed during the most vulnerable window: first contact to first image.

How Digital Grooming Works (and Why Robux Matters)
The grooming pipeline typically looks like this:

Robux (or any platform currency) is potent with preteens: it feels legitimate and exciting, disguising the interaction as “play” or “trading.” That's why transaction-aware safety – flagging suspicious currency flows tied to minors and sudden new “friends” – should be a core platform signal.

Scale Raises the Stakes
With the enormous scale of daily users and engagement hours (111.8 million daily active users and 27.4 billion hours of engagement in the second quarter of 2025 alone, according to Roblox), even a tiny failure rate creates a staggering number of victims. Litigation and Attorney General actions in multiple states underscore a broader reckoning: Another lawsuit alleging child sexploitation involving a 15-year-old boy was filed against Roblox in Clay County, Missouri. In this instance, a male predator posted as a young girl to cultivate trust, transitioning messaging to text where he eventually coerced the child to send sexually explicit images of himself. Youth-oriented platforms must be safe by default, not merely configurable with the right toggles because, too often, those toggles aren't set.

What Parents and Caregivers Can Do Today:

Set the defaults to “safe” and keep them there

What Schools Can Do:

Visibility + curriculum = prevention

What Platforms Must Change:

Design for children's realities, not ideal users

What Law Enforcement Should Prioritize:

Victim care first, evidence second—both fast

We Can't Outsource Our Children's Safety
School IT teams, tech companies, and legislators all matter, but none can cover the moment-to-moment interactions where most harm begins. Parents and local communities remain the first line of defense. The North Carolina case and others serve as a warning: If we wait for someone else to fix this, children will pay the price.

Bottom Line
This isn't about panic; it's about precision. A predictable grooming pipeline, a known leverage point (virtual currency), and identifiable signals provide us with the blueprint to prevent first contact, detect early, and respond quickly. Platforms must make default-safe design non-negotiable. Schools must build visibility and teach the realities. And families must engage daily. That's how we close the window between the first chat and the first harm, and keep our kids safe wherever they play.

Binance explained that it decided to delist them after a review showed the projects no longer meet the exchange's high standards and industry requirements.

“Based on our most recent reviews, we have decided to delist and cease trading on all spot trading pairs for the following token(s) at 2025-09-17 03:00 (UTC): BakeryToken (BAKE). Hifi Finance (HIFI), Self Chain (SLF),” Binance revealed. 

Following the delisting news, BAKE's price plunged 25%, SLF tumbled 23%, and HIFI shed 17% in the past 24 hours. These declines highlight how quickly markets react when Binance pulls support for a token.

But what's next for the altcoins after this unfortunate development? Let's find out.

For those unfamiliar, BAKE is the native token of the decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) BakeryToken. Built as a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain, BAKE enjoyed a strong run during the 2021 bull market, climbing to an all-time high of $8.48.

Fast forward to today, and BAKE has lost 99% of its value amid fading demand. Technically, the daily chart shows a persistent downtrend since February, with the token posting lower highs and lower lows before forming a falling wedge.

Normally, a falling wedge can hint at a bullish reversal. But in this case, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) has slipped into negative territory, pointing to stronger selling pressure.

This makes it more likely that BAKE continues to crash, potentially dropping to $0.049.

Still, if sentiment shifts and a turnaround occurs, BAKE's price could attempt to break above resistance and rally toward $0.15.

SLF is another token hit hard by Binance's delisting news. One year ago, the Self Chain token traded at an all-time high of $0.83. Today, it has collapsed by 95%, slipping to $0.040, a slight bounce from the new all-time low it touched earlier in the day.

On the daily chart, SLF trades below a key resistance line. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has plunged to -0.52, signaling strong capital outflows and weak demand.

At the same time, the Bollinger Bands (BB) have tightened, a sign that volatility is compressing and a big move could be imminent.

Currently, the token sits in oversold territory. The BB contraction suggests a breakout is looming.

If buying pressure returns, SLF could slowly recover toward $0.19. But if selling pressure intensifies, the decline may deepen, pushing the altcoin to fresh lows.

Last on the list of altcoins caught in Binance's delisting sweep is HIFI. Since the news broke, the token's price has dropped 20%, while trading volume has spiked over 330%.

This surge in activity alongside falling prices shows that the downtrend remains strong, with sellers firmly in control.

From a technical perspective, HIFI's price is trapped in a descending triangle.

The MACD has slipped into negative territory, but the 12 EMA (blue) and 26 EMA (orange) converge, suggesting that the correction could be nearing exhaustion.

That doesn't necessarily mean a breakout is next. Instead, HIFI will likely consolidate between $0.074 and $0.10 in the near term.

However, if buyers step in and treat the current levels as a dip-buying opportunity, the token could rally toward $0.26.

Introduction 

The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. What started as a way to prove ownership of digital art has grown into a foundation for real-world applications across industries. From collectibles to real estate, NFT smart contract development is now pushing boundaries and opening doors to a tokenized economy.

Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent.

The Birth of NFT Smart Contracts

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. The real magic happens through smart contract development, which encodes the rules of ownership and transfer.

Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today.

NFTs in Digital Art

Digital artists were the first to feel the power of NFT smart contracts. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. Every sale, every royalty, and every ownership transfer was automated through blockchain smart contract development.

The brilliance was not just in ownership—it was in ensuring authenticity. No one could copy and claim the artwork as theirs because the blockchain recorded every detail of ownership. For artists, this meant empowerment; for buyers, it meant trust. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention.

NFT Smart Contracts Beyond Art and Gaming

While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Industries are finding creative uses for NFTs:

Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds.

Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs.

Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey.

Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access.

This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. As a result, companies see NFTs not just as collectibles, but as defi smart contract development tools for finance, business agreements, and beyond.

Technological Advancements in NFT Smart Contracts 

The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. For example:

Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells.

Fractionalization: High-value assets are split into smaller, affordable shares.

Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development.

Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools.

This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. It's not just about ownership anymore—it's about trust, automation, and innovation.

Future of NFT Smart Contracts 

The future of NFTs looks beyond art and gaming. Imagine a world where:

These are not distant dreams. With blockchain smart contract development, industries are preparing for decentralized systems where human trust is replaced with coded transparency. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution.

The Role of NFT Marketplace Development Companies

Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. These companies design and audit NFT smart contracts, ensuring smooth transactions and secure ownership transfers.

For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. From defi to niche NFT solutions, these firms bring vision to reality.

In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development.

Conclusion 

NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Their future will shape how we own, trade, and trust both digital and physical assets.

Choosing the right partner makes all the difference. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that helps businesses navigate this revolution. With expertise in smart contract development, they provide reliable, scalable, and creative solutions for enterprises that want to lead in the digital era.

The evolution of NFT smart contracts shows us one thing: innovation thrives when technology meets trust. And the right company ensures that the journey is both secure and successful.

Introduction

Imagine a world where business agreements execute themselves the moment conditions are met—no middlemen, no delays, no hidden risks. That's the promise of smart contracts. At their simplest, smart contracts are digital agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute once certain conditions are fulfilled, ensuring transparency and trust.

Cryptocurrencies have evolved into more than just digital assets; they now represent innovation, decentralization, and global financial inclusion. Behind every thriving crypto business lies a structured lifecycle that transforms abstract ideas into functional, secure, and widely adopted platforms. From initial concepts to live market deployment, this lifecycle determines the credibility and success of a project.

In the realm of cryptocurrency fundraising, successful projects require clear, transparent communication and a professional presentation of the project's goals, technical architecture, and value proposition. A white paper serves as the cornerstone for establishing credibility, building investor trust, and guiding decision-making. As crypto markets grow increasingly competitive, investors seek projects that showcase innovation while demonstrating meticulous planning and market understanding. White Paper Development services play a crucial role in crafting documents with precision, clarity, and persuasive impact, positioning projects for successful fundraising campaigns.

Introduction 

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is consulting on draft changes to how we handle data protection complaints. It sets out our proposed framework to assess and determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint. This will allow us to focus on cases where we can have the most impact and improve data protection compliance. 

People have a statutory right to lodge a data protection complaint with the ICO if they think there has been an infringement of their data protection rights under the UK GDPR. 

In recent years we have seen a significant increase in data protection complaints. In 2023/24, we received 39,721 complaints. In 2024/25 this rose to 42,881 and current forecasts indicate that this could increase to somewhere between 45,000 and 55,000 if the current trend continues. 

The ever-increasing demand for our services is impacting our ability to respond quickly and effectively. We want to consider new ways of handling data protection complaints. 

The Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) places new requirements on organisations to have a complaints process specifically for data protection related issues. Once the provision comes into force, we would expect that more complaints will be resolved by organisations without the involvement of the ICO. 

If people do bring their complaint to the ICO, we want to provide the most effective service given the finite resources we have. That means looking at our own approach to handling complaints. 

We are proposing changes to our processes to better support people who have experienced harm and focus our resources on those cases where we can have the biggest impact. Organisations will also benefit from reduced routine engagement on lower-risk cases, enabling them to focus on the most significant concerns. Our goal is not just to manage demand, but to raise standards around customer experience and regulatory effectiveness. 

We have developed a draft framework that we propose to use to determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint. We are also proposing new reporting mechanisms to enable us to monitor complaint volumes across specific organisations and sectors. This will allow us to identify trends or themes which may benefit from other types of regulatory action. 

The approach outlined in this consultation would ensure that every complaint contributes towards our understanding of an organisation's information rights practices, while allowing us to focus our resources on the most significant risks. It also strengthens our ability to identify systemic issues earlier. 

It reflects our ambition to be a strategic regulator – one that considers every complaint, responds proportionately and uses the insight gained to drive improvements in data protection practices. 

We need to do things differently and transforming our processes will enable us to target our resources to support people's information rights in a way that has a positive impact and addresses the areas that cause the greatest harm. 

Please respond to the ideas in our consultation to help shape the process. You can respond to the consultation via our survey on Citizen Space. 

The questions are split into the following sections: 

Section 1: About you. 

Section 2: Your views on our approach. 

Section 3: Questions to assess the impact of our proposed approach.   

Section 4: Any additional comments about the framework.  

The consultation will remain open until 23:59 on Friday 31 October 2025. We may not consider responses received after this deadline.

An investigator for the police complaints watchdog has pleaded guilty to unlawfully obtaining sensitive personal data. 

We have today published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely.

We have fined Scottish charity Birthlink £18,000 after it destroyed approximately 4,800 personal records, up to ten percent of which may be irreplaceable.

This year marks a significant milestone - 20 years since the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act came into force. For two decades, this legislation has empowered people to ask questions, seek transparency, and hold public bodies to account on the issues that matter most to them.

The ICO welcomes the First-tier Tribunal decision on the preliminary issue raised by TikTok in its appeal against the £12.7m monetary penalty notice (MPN) issued in April 2023. The decision follows a hearing that took place from 19 to 21 May 2025. 

We are calling for views on a new enforcement approach that could unlock privacy-preserving alternatives to the dominant adtech business model.

On 17 August 2023 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) put the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on broad notice about the devastating failure of data protection that is now generally known as the Afghan data breach (although sadly there have been many others). This involved the illegal release of some 33,000 lines of gravely sensitive personal spreadsheet data which put almost 100,000 people – up to 25,000 Afghans applying for relocation to the UK as well as their family members, many of whom were also identified in the data – at grave risk of harm and may even have resulted in some of their deaths. However, despite details of this egregious and illegal exposure of data subjects being immediately required by law and subsequently coming into view, the ICO decided not to carry out any investigation and therefore not to take any enforcement action, such as issuing a fine, enforcement notice or even a mere reprimand. Astonishingly, the ICO also made no contemporaneous record whatsoever of the rationale for these critical decisions or even the bare fact that they had been made. Given the exacting supervisory requirements set down in the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), these subsequent (in)actions expose further serious failings in UK data protection. These failings point to the need for an in-depth independent investigation of UK data protection regulation, which should also explore the serious gap between the UK GDPR's promises and the ICO's hyper-discretionary and hyper-selective track-record and approach and what might be done to address this. What follows merely provides a partial indication of some of the particular issues which arise in relation to Afghan spreadsheet data breach itself. It is based on the (still very limited) information which has come into public view so far and builds on a previous blog post on the same subject posted last month.

Lack of Contemporaneous Record Keeping

This post draws primarily on an ICO memorandum which seeks to summarise the ICO's involvement with the Afghan spreadsheet data breach and to provide a justification for the various decisions made between 17 August 2023 and 15 July 2025. However, it is vital to emphasise that the memorandum in question is completely post-hoc. It was entirely written after 15 July 2025 and was not able to draw on any “internal record of the ICO's actions and decision making regarding this data breach” as there is none. Ab initio, this complete lack of contemporaneous documentation constitutes a significant failure of demonstrable compliance with the data protection framework (in this case, the duties of the regulator as opposed to those of controllers and processors) and is particularly problematic given both the seriousness of the breaches requiring attention and the legally aberrant decision not to take any regulatory action. Moreover, no reasonable justification is provided for it even post-hoc. Thus, although the memorandum invokes the super-injunction which the MoD obtained on 1 September 2023, this is contradicted by its acknowledgment that the super-injunction expressly made clear that it “did not prevent the ICO from taking any steps in private that the ICO consider[ed] appropriate”. Similarly, although it is argued that any “written notes” would have “likely necessitated the inclusion of information which was classified as Secret or Top Secret”, its statement that this rendered the ICO “unable” to take such notes is again contradicted by its express acknowledgment that this would merely have created “additional handling difficulties”. Any such difficulties must be considered part of the ICO's normal terrain given its legal mandate to ensure independent supervision even in highly sensitive contexts, such as those involving national security, which are also precisely the contexts that often raise the most serious data protection concerns. It is also striking that the memorandum clearly reveals that these sorts of concerns did not prevent the MoD responding to enquiries on this matter to ICO email addresses.

Failure to Notify within 72 Hours and Effect of Super-Injunction

At least parts of the memorandum's analysis of the substance of the matter are unfortunately also misleading. Thus, although it states that the MoD did tell the ICO on 17 August 2023 that it had experienced a “serious data breach”, which was two days after it itself became aware of the February 2022 loss of the Afghan spreadsheet data, the memorandum goes on to incorrectly claim that the ICO was therefore “notified within 72 hours”, “as required by Article 33(1) of the UKGDPR”.  The same claim was made by the ICO in its initial statement on the data breach released on 15 July 2025. Although breach notification is certainly mandated under Article 33(1), Article 33(3) explicitly states that such notification must “at least”:

(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

In contrast, the memorandum is clear that on 17 August 2023 the MoD merely communicated the fact that a serious breach had occurred, made clear that “sensitivity” prevented any further information being provided at this time and stated that a face-to-face meeting was necessary. Three weeks passed until an (unnamed) ICO official attended an 8 September 2023 meeting where he was served with the 1 September 2023 super-injunction and, according to the memorandum, provided with “an overview of what was known by MoD at that time”.  However, even this failed to constitute an (albeit delayed) Article 33 breach notification as it is also explicitly stated that the “rationale” for “obtaining the injunction was not shared” and yet we now know that the MoD had already offered express justification to the court that the super-injunction was a critical measure to mitigate the breach's adverse effects on the data subjects. Unfortunately, it remains unclear when a full Article 33(1) notification was carried out, if at all.

The super-injunction itself prevented discharge of the default obligation to notify the breach to any affected individual data subject (under Article 34) and was cited by the ICO as a central reason for it holding itself unable to investigate the incident or to keep internal records. This stark reality, alongside the clarity of the Article 33 requirements (as well as the fact that the proceedings did include two representatives of media organisations), renders it hugely problematic that the MoD did not inform the ICO in advance of its intention to seek the super-injunction (or explain its rationale even well after it had been granted), that the ICO did not object to this and, assuming the super-injunction really was an impediment to the demonstrable performance of its regulatory functions, that the ICO did not seek any variation of it from the court.

Lack of any ICO Investigation 

The ICO's lack of forensic engagement must be related to a decision made on 5 December 2023 – apparently after just one further meeting with the MoD – that it was not “in a position to independently investigate the incident”. This decision was by made by Stephen Bonner, Deputy Commissioner (Regulatory Supervision), and was briefed “at a high level” to the Information Commissioner John Edwards who apparently did not demur or seek further information. The twin justifications proffered, namely the super-injunction and the Secret or Top Secret information classification, mirror those for failing to keep any internal records and are similarly problematic. As regards the security classification, the memorandum is clear that it merely created “additional handling difficulties”. Meanwhile, the super-injunction explicitly stated that the ICO remained free to take “any steps in private” that it considered “appropriate” and this fact is clearly integral to the justification of the ICO not seeking any alternation of its terms. If the ICO understood the super-injunction differently, then it was manifestly incumbent on it to approach the court for an amendment.

As has been clear at least since C-311/18 Schrems (2020), the ICO's “primary responsibility is to monitor the application of the [UK] GDPR and to ensure its enforcement” (at [108]). The ICO is not permitted to delegate this twin responsibility or tasks to the very controller under scrutiny as it is statutorily obliged to ensure that it “act with complete independence in performing [its] tasks” (UK GDPR, art 52). It is also “required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]) and it therefore follows that it must intervene when put on notice about a prima facie “clear breach” of data protection of a serious nature. Alongside other enforcement action, the ICO is explicitly required under Article 83 of the UK GDPR to “ensure that the imposition of administrative fines” is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” and Recital 148 authoritatively specifies that it should impose a fine on organisations (whether public or private) for any data protection breach which is not “minor”. Given the overarching requirement for “strong enforcement” (UK GDPR, Recital 7), Recital 148's interpretation is particularly imperative when other measures such as an enforcement notice is not forthcoming. Moreover, in December 2023 when handing down a £350k fine for a worryingly similar (although considerably less far-reaching) MoD data breach in 2021 (also involving Afghan relocations data), the Commissioner himself acknowledged that in relation to “breaches of data protection that are so egregious that they put people's lives at risk” it was “necessary for us at the ICO to apply the full sanctions of the law”. It is manifest, however, that the application of any, let alone full, legal sanctions is impossible if prima facie serious breaches of the law are not even subject to ICO investigation.

The ICO's 5 December 2023 decision not to investigate resulted in it only taking part in meetings (including reviewing documentation) coordinated by the data controller itself and giving input at and around these. However, no evidence is provided of any such meeting taking place between 5 December 2023 and 26 June 2024. Moreover, following that latter meeting, Stephen Bonner made (but did not record) another critical decision which was that “no further action (‘NFA') was required at this time”.  John Edwards was subsequently informed (although not until 19 September 2024) “at a high level” and “had no objection with the approach”. It is difficult to see how sufficient lines of inquiry could possibly have been pursued by this point to justify such an outcome and the memorandum anyway presents no evidence to suggest that this was anything other than a very serious breach which positively required action on the part of ICO. Nevertheless, approximately a third of the memorandum (pp. 11-15) seeks post-hoc to set out such a justification. 

Some of this merely repeat claims relating to the super-injunction and the information classification which have been considered and rejected above. Other parts are both counter-intuitive and contradictory. Thus, it claims as an argument against regulatory action that the ICO was “already investigating and taking regulatory action against the MoD for a separate data breach” which resulted in the December 2023 £350k fine. However, as explicitly specified in Article 83(2)(e) of the UKGDPR and in the ICO's own guidance, “relevant previous infringements by the controller” (or, in the Information Commissioner's words “a similar breach”) are peremptorily established as an aggravating rather than a mitigating factor for regulatory action. The memorandum also seeks to assert that the ICO had formed an understanding that the spreadsheet failure was “a one-off occurrence following a failure to following [sic] usual checks, rather than reflecting a wider culture of non-compliance”. However, this patently clashes with positive knowledge of the other egregious data breach (also involving Afghan relocation application data) and information which has subsequently become available through a freedom of information request showing there have been 49 separate data breaches at this MoD unit over the past four years including seven which were serious enough to be notified to ICO.

The memorandum briefly summarises four further meetings at the MoD after 26 June 2024 involving ICO as well as related MoD-ICO interactions. It is clear from this that a range of relevant matters concerning both the breach itself and changes to data practices were discussed and explored. Nevertheless, none of this appears to have involved a forensic investigation by the ICO itself of the actual breach (including whether even the intended release – which involved the unencrypted permanent disclosure of highly sensitive personal data about 150 individuals to a number of third parties – was itself lawful). There was also no suggestion of any potential regulatory sanction for the manifest serious failures (which is unsurprising given the No Further Action decision already made) and it is clear that the MoD itself were far from always being promptly forthcoming. For example, enquiries made at the 26 June 2024 meeting remained unanswered until an email on 8 October 2024 and certain queries raised at the 6 May 2025 meeting remained unanswered until 10 July 2025 (just 5 days before the super-injunction was lifted). It is also clear that following the 26 June 2024 No Further Action decision, the focus increasingly turned to plans for joint MoD-ICO management of public relations communications once the super-injunction was lifted. Thus, as early as 3 July 2024 the MoD sent the ICO “an initial comms and engagement pack” and such joint work continued (including at, and after, meetings) over the subsequent months.

Conclusions 

As a result of both its scale and acute sensitivity (which involved risks to life and perhaps even death), the MoD's Afghan spreadsheet data breach was one of the most egregious in UK history. The lifting of the 1 September 2023 super-injunction which took place on 15 June 2025 exposed this to the world. This event also exposed acute failings in UK data protection supervision. The ICO's failure to engage in any enforcement action in response to such an egregious breach is impossible to square with its duty (which has been acknowledged by the Information Commissioner himself) “to apply the full sanctions of the law” in such cases.  However, beyond even this, it is now clear that the ICO did not mount any independent investigation into this matter and that it did not maintain any contemporaneous record of its decisions. Whilst undoubtedly posing weighty challenges, neither the high classification of the information at issue nor the super-injunction itself provides a good justification for this. The absence of an ICO investigation and contemporaneous record-keeping is at even greater variance with its obligation to demonstrably discharge its “responsibility for ensuring that the [UK] GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]). 

Although aberrant from the perspective of UK GDPR standards, this outcome is sadly consonant with the accelerating trends towards hyper-discretion and hyper-selection in UK data protection regulation. Other major data breaches, such as the 2023 one which continues to impact the British Library (much less serious but also raising far few complexities in terms of investigation), have also not been fully investigated or sanctioned. Moreover, the ICO's Annual Report 2024/25 revealed that the ICO carried out only 43 UK GDPR investigations in the past year (an 85% reduction on 2023-24), issued just 2 UK GDPR fines (compared to >250 in both Germany and Spain) and served no UK GDPR enforcement notices at all. These facts expose the need for an in-depth, thorough and independent investigation into the state of UK data protection regulation, including an examination of what might be done to reverse its current lack of consistent and robust results for data subjects and the public at large.

Press Release

September 1, 2025Asteria Corporation (Japan)Lib Work Co., Ltd.(Japan)

Tokyo — September 1, 2025 — Asteria Corporation (Headquarters: Shibuya-ku, Tokyo; President & Representative Director: Yoichiro Hirano; Securities Code: 3853) and Lib Work Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Yamaga, Kumamoto Prefecture; President & Representative Director: Chikara Seguchi; Securities Code: 1431) announce a business partnership to develop NFT infrastructure and begin construction of a Housing Asset Digital Platform to prevent tampering with 3D-Printed house design data and other information.

Additionally, by adopting Asteria's “Asteria Warp” platform, Lib Work plans to accept payments with JPYC, a Japanese yen-backed stablecoin, for their 3D-Printed houses and other construction projects.

The global 3D-Printed housing market is rapidly expanding because of its ability to reduce the use of costly building materials and address labor shortages in the construction industry. According to Lib Work's research, the market is expected to grow to approximately ¥221 trillion by 2034—roughly 100 times its current size. However, 3D-Printed housing design data faces the following digital-specific challenges:

Challenges with Design Documents and Data for 3D-Printed Housing(Digital-Specific Risks)

•High risk of unauthorized copying and tampering, requiring advanced management to ensure legitimacy and authenticity

•Repair histories directly impact asset valuations during sales and investments, yet they are not properly recorded and shared

To address these challenges, Lib Work began exploring a digital platform that records, certifies, and distributes design documents, construction data, and repair histories as NFTs. They have also partnered with Asteria, a company that possesses blockchain technology for tamper-proof certification used in shareholder meetings and municipal documents, to begin building a Housing Asset Digital Platform.

By combining Asteria's Web3 and NFT technology and expertise with Lib Work's 3D-Printed housing development know-how, they aim to build the world's first* platform that ensures housing asset reliability from both architectural and digital perspectives.

*Based on Lib Work research

The Housing Asset Digital Platform aims to ensure the authenticity and reliability of housing assets and maintain and enhance their long-term value by recording and certifying 3D-Printed housing design, construction, and repair data as NFTs on the blockchain.

NFTs utilize blockchain technology to guarantee the uniqueness and tamper-proof nature of digital data. Applying this to housing provides the following new ownership benefits and added values:

1.Prevention of unauthorized copying of design documents (tampering is prevented by storing design document data on the blockchain)

2.Proof of authenticity (issuing digital certificates via NFT)

3.Keeping track of repair histories (transparent housing lifecycle management)

4.Asset value creation through serial numbering

5.Creating new value circulation for housing assets by centrally managing and distributing previously fragmented housing data

6.Metaverse expansion (utilizing design and construction data in digital spaces)

Lib Work also plans to accept payments using JPYC, a Japanese yen-backed stablecoin, by leveraging blockchain infrastructure and Asteria Warp.

Asteria and Lib Work aim to expand the use of NFTs to general housing and create new value circulation for housing assets through the development of the Housing Asset Digital Platform.

Lib Work will also franchise and license its 3D-Printed home technologies, establishing a new model of scale in the housing industry. As a group, they are targeting a total of 10,000 3D-Printed houses by 2040, with this project serving as crucial infrastructure development toward achieving that goal.

Furthermore, Lib Work plans to expand its housing assets globally in the future by accepting USDT and USDC, two USD-backed stablecoins, to allow for international transactions.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- XRP and Google Cloud's GCUL compete in cross-border payments, with XRP leveraging 3–5 second transactions and 300+ bank partnerships for liquidity optimization.

- XRP's 2025 SEC legal victory and CBDC interoperability tests with SWIFT strengthen its institutional adoption and regulatory credibility.

- GCUL's permissioned blockchain targets enterprise integration but faces scalability challenges compared to XRP's open protocol and existing global infrastructure.

- Analysts project XRP could reach $5.25 by 2030, driven by its role in tokenized assets and defensible cost-efficiency against GCUL's institutional-centric approach.



The cross-border payment landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain-based solutions redefine liquidity and settlement efficiency. At the heart of this transformation lies XRP, Ripple's native token, which has carved a niche in liquidity optimization and institutional adoption. Yet, its dominance faces a new challenger: Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL), a permissioned blockchain designed for enterprise integration. To assess XRP's competitive resilience, we must dissect its strategic advantages, regulatory tailwinds, and evolving role in CBDC ecosystems, while contrasting it with GCUL's institutional-centric approach.  

XRP's core strength lies in its dual role as a bridge asset and a settlement layer. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) processes transactions in 3–5 seconds at a cost of less than $0.01, making it an attractive solution for banks seeking to reduce friction in cross-border flows [1]. Ripple's 300+ bank partnerships, spanning 90+ markets and 55+ currencies, underscore its entrenched position in global finance [2]. This infrastructure has been further bolstered by Ripple's recent legal victory over the SEC in August 2025, which cleared the path for institutional adoption and renewed investor confidence [2].  

XRP's integration with CBDC initiatives is another critical differentiator. In Q3 2025, SWIFT began testing XRP Ledger for interoperability with CBDCs, positioning it as a complementary layer for tokenized assets like U.S. Treasuries and gold [1]. Ripple's collaboration with SBI Group in Japan to distribute Ripple USD (RLUSD)—a stablecoin backed by BNY Mellon—further highlights its adaptability in regulatory environments [3]. These developments suggest XRP is evolving from a payment token to a foundational asset in a broader digital financial ecosystem.  

Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL), currently in private testing, represents a direct challenge to XRP's dominance. Built as a permissioned blockchain using Python, GCUL prioritizes controlled enterprise adoption and compliance, with a pilot program already underway at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for asset tokenization [1]. Unlike XRP, which relies on a native token, GCUL has no plans for an initial coin offering (ICO), focusing instead on institutional integration through pre-vetted partnerships [2]. This approach aligns with Alphabet's $2.5 trillion market capitalization and its ability to leverage existing enterprise infrastructure.  

However, GCUL's success hinges on its ability to scale beyond asset tokenization. While XRP Ledger already supports 300+ banks and offers open protocol design, GCUL's private nature may limit its appeal to institutions seeking decentralized, permissionless solutions [2]. Additionally, GCUL's 2026 commercial launch timeline gives XRP a head start in capturing market share, particularly in regions where regulatory clarity is still emerging.  

Despite GCUL's institutional focus, XRP's resilience stems from its established use cases and regulatory momentum. The XRP Ledger's role in FX settlements—tested by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley—demonstrates its utility in real-world applications [1]. Meanwhile, Ripple's Liquidity Hub expansion aims to use XRP as a bridge for tokenized assets, a strategy that could outpace GCUL's narrower focus on asset tokenization [3].  

Moreover, XRP's recent legal victory has catalyzed institutional interest, with CME futures open interest surpassing $1 billion [2]. This liquidity, combined with XRP's low-cost, high-speed transactions, positions it as a defensible asset in a market where speed and cost efficiency remain paramount. Analysts project XRP could reach $5.25 by 2030, contingent on regulatory developments and adoption trends [1].  

XRP's competitive resilience lies in its dual strengths: a proven track record in cross-border payments and a forward-looking integration with CBDCs and tokenized assets. While GCUL's institutional focus and Alphabet's resources pose a long-term threat, XRP's decentralized architecture, regulatory clarity, and existing partnerships provide a formidable moat. For investors, the key question is not whether GCUL will disrupt the market, but whether XRP can maintain its first-mover advantage in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL (nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos. This study highlights a striking example of genetic suppression of a monogenic disease revealing a canonical enzyme in the CL biosynthesis pathway.

Queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) can give birth to ants of their own species (left) and, using a cloning trick, offspring of a different one (Messor structor, right). Credit: Jonathan Romiguier, Yannick Juvé, Laurent Soldati

A common type of ant in Europe breaks a fundamental rule in biology: its queens can produce male offspring that are a whole different species. These queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) are sexual parasites that rely on the sperm of males of the ant species Messor structor. They use this sperm to breed an army of robust worker ants, which are hybrids of the two species.

Data now show that, in the absence of nearby M. structor colonies, M. ibericus queens can clone male M. structor ants by laying eggs that contain only M. structor DNA in their nuclei. The findings were published in Nature on 3 September1.

“It's an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says Jacobus Boomsma, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.

Iberian harvester ants co-exist with M. structor in some parts of Europe, which has historically given M. ibericus queens an abundant supply of M. structor males to mate with.

Pupating ants make milk — and scientists only just noticed

But evolutionary biologist Jonathan Romiguier at the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier in France and his colleagues noticed something strange on the Italian island of Sicily: they found Iberian harvester ants everywhere but not a single colony of M. structor.

When the researchers peered inside colonies of the Iberian harvester ant, they found two types of ant that looked very different. Genetic analyses confirmed that the colonies contained both M. ibericus and M. structor, despite the lack of M. structor populations on the island.

Further analyses solved the mystery: Iberian harvester queens clone M. structor ants to maintain a supply of their sperm. They then mate with those M. structor ants to produce hybrid workers that take care of the colony, including by building the nest and foraging for food. In effect, M. ibericus has domesticated M. structor and its genome, Romiguier says.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems1,2,3,4,5,6,7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.

Computing today is digital, but analog has a future. Exponential advances in digital hardware have both driven and benefited from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), but its escalating energy and latency demands push digital specialization to its limits8. Analog approaches—leveraging optics1,2,3,4,9, analog electronic crossbars5,6 and quantum annealers7—promise orders-of-magnitude gains in efficiency and speed. Existing hardware demonstrations focus either on AI inference1,2,3,10,11,12,13, which accounts for 90% of energy in commercial deployments14, or combinatorial optimization7,15, but none efficiently accelerate both on the same analog hardware.

Here we introduce the analog optical computer (AOC), a non-traditional computing platform designed for both AI inference and combinatorial optimization. By combining optical and analog electronic components within a feedback loop, the AOC rapidly performs a fixed-point search without digital conversions. In each loop iteration of approximately 20 ns, optics handle matrix–vector multiplications, whereas analog electronics perform nonlinear operations, subtraction and annealing (Fig. 1a–c). Over multiple iterations, the fixed-point nature of the AOC enhances noise robustness, which is essential for analog hardware.

The microLED array (1) is the light source and represents neural network activations or optimization variables.

The AOC hardware performs inference for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST classification tasks and nonlinear regression, and also solves industrial optimization problems, including medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement between financial institutions.

The AOC's fully analog architecture and fixed-point abstraction address two key challenges in unconventional computing. First, hybrid architectures typically accelerate linear operations but rely on digital nonlinearities, resulting in energy-intensive conversions2,13, which are eliminated in the AOC. Second, they often face an application-hardware gap: memory-bound AI models are hard to accelerate14, and prevalent binary optimization formulations limit practical applicability16. With its unifying fixed-point abstraction, the AOC closes this gap (Fig. 1d,e).

For inference, the AOC accelerates emerging iterative models, including fixed-point models such as deep-equilibrium networks17, which are compute-bound and costly on digital chips but naturally suited for the AOC. These models enable iterative reasoning with dynamic inference time computation18,19. For optimization, the AOC supports quadratic unconstrained mixed optimization (QUMO), a flexible formulation with binary and continuous variables that captures real-world problems20.

The current small-scale AOC accelerates equilibrium models with up to 4,096 weights at 9-bit precision, performing image classification and nonlinear regression tasks (Fig. 1f). To enable these inference tasks, we design a differentiable digital twin (AOC-DT) that achieves over 99% correspondence with the physical hardware. For optimization, the AOC solves QUMO problems with up to 64 variables, tackling real-world applications such as medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. The AOC-DT is used to demonstrate scalable solutions for industrial problems, such as reconstruction of a brain scan with over 200,000 problem variables. Compared with well-known heuristics21 and commercial solvers22, we set state-of-the-art results on several instances from a standard quadratic optimization benchmark23.

Designed with consumer-grade optical and electronic components, the AOC leverages mature manufacturing processes, with future scalability relying on tighter coupling of integrated analog electronics with integrated three-dimensional (3D) optics. By eliminating digital–analog conversions and merging compute and memory to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck, the AOC can achieve substantial efficiency gains albeit specialized. With projected performance around 500 tera-operations per second (TOPS) per watt at 8-bit precision—over 100-times more efficient than leading graphics processing units (GPUs)24—the AOC represents a promising step towards sustainable computing.

The AOC hardware unifies machine learning (ML) inference and optimization paradigms through an iterative fixed-point search. In ML, the inference of equilibrium17 and energy-based25 models entails finding their fixed points, whereas in optimization, objective minima represent fixed points of gradient-descent-based methods. The core AOC abstraction realizes the following iterative update rule:

At each iteration t, the continuous real-valued state vector \({{\bf{s}}}_{t}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) is updated to st+1, with each iteration corresponding to a signal round-trip time in hardware. Although equation (1) is discrete, the AOC operates in a continuous clock-free manner. The annealing schedule \(\alpha (t):[0,T]\to {\mathbb{R}}\) controls the state magnitude reduction per iteration, similar to residual connections in neural networks26, where T is the number of timesteps in the annealing schedule. The factor β determines the matrix–vector product scale, where the matrix W encodes neural network weights or an optimization problem, and \(f:{{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\to {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) is an element-wise nonlinear function. The coefficient γ ∈ (0, 1) introduces momentum which, in continuous time, corresponds to the second-order differential equation dynamics (Supplementary Information section G.10), generalizing the AOC abstraction beyond first-order models such as Hopfield networks. The bias vector \({\bf{b}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) represents additional problem-specific information.

The introduced fixed-point abstraction is ideally suited for analog feedback devices, such as the AOC, as it is compute-bound, requires no intermediate memory and is noise-tolerant: the attracting fixed point pulls the trajectory closer at every iteration, counteracting analog noise.

The AOC hardware combines 3D optical and analog electronic technologies to accelerate all the compute operations in the fixed-point abstraction described by equation (1): matrix–vector multiplication, nonlinearity, annealing, addition and subtraction. In each fixed-point iteration, the analog signal alternates between optical and electrical domains, giving the system state st a dual opto-electronic nature.

Matrix–vector multiplication occurs in the optical domain, where the state vector st is encoded in the light intensity of arrays of micro light-emitting diodes (microLEDs), whereas the weight matrix W is represented by spatial light modulator (SLM) pixels (Fig. 1a). Light from each microLED fans out across an SLM row for element-wise multiplication, and the resulting light signals are summed column-wise by a photodetector array27. In contrast to planar optical architectures, the AOC leverages 3D optics with its efficient fan-in and fan-out of light in the third dimension through the use of spherical and cylindrical optics, thus enabling inherently parallel and scalable multiplication operations of larger matrices28.

The result of the optical matrix–vector multiplication is measured in the electrical domain using a photodetector array, where the state vector st is represented as a voltage per detector. The remaining operations in equation (1) are implemented via analog electronics: a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function for the element-wise nonlinearity, summing and difference amplifiers for addition and subtraction of analog signals, and variable gain amplifiers for the annealing schedule α(t) and the β factor. The circuit layout, with highlighted voltage readout position, is detailed in Extended Data Fig. 3.

The AOC hardware executes the iterative update rule from several to thousands of iterations until convergence to a fixed point, when the signal amplitudes are read out digitally. This all-analog operation minimizes the overhead of analog-to-digital conversions. The current hardware includes 16 microLEDs and 16 photodetectors, supporting a 16-variable state vector st, along with two SLMs to handle positive and negative entries of the matrix W (Fig. 1b,c). This configuration is sufficient to support inference for ML models and optimization tasks with up to 256 weights and can extend to 4,096 weights via problem decomposition, maintaining fully analog fixed-point iterations.

The AOC fixed-point abstraction targets a balance between generality and efficient hardware implementation. To illustrate its versatility, the remainder of the paper presents four case studies highlighting how equilibrium ML models can be applied to classification and regression tasks, and how the QUMO paradigm can represent real-world applications in finance and healthcare, while utilizing the same AOC hardware.

The AOC supports neural equilibrium models, which have been widely applied across various domains from language17 to vision29. Equilibrium models typically follow a fixed-point iterative update rule, st+1 = Network(st), with examples including classic Hopfield networks30 and their modern variants31, as well as deep-equilibrium models17. These models operate as self-recurrent neural networks with constant input, driving the hidden state to a fixed point that represents the network output (Fig. 1d). Their dynamic depth enables recursive reasoning, leads to improved scaling laws32 and enhances out-of-distribution generalization compared with feedforward models18,33. Recent self-recurrent language models with billions of parameters show impressive reasoning capabilities, surpassing fixed-depth models in representation power34,35. We demonstrate that the AOC supports models with such recurrent nature and achieves greater out-of-distribution generalization (Extended Data Fig. 6).

As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the complete neural network architecture includes an input projection (IP) layer, the equilibrium model and an output projection (OP) layer. The network training is performed digitally using the AOC-DT, whereas the equilibrium model is deployed on the AOC hardware for inference.

a, Top: the neural network architecture used for training and inference. During training, input data are projected into the latent space via an IP layer, processed by the AOC hardware's digital twin (AOC-DT) and passed through the OP layer. Bottom: the inference process on the AOC hardware: the IP and OP layers interface with the hardware, which updates its initial state s0 until reaching the fixed-point state s*. b, During inference, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images are passed through the IP layer and are fed into the AOC hardware. Intermediate states may be projected out to monitor progress, schematically showing evolution from a higher to a lower entropy distribution. Once converged, a softmax nonlinearity in the OP layer selects the highest-probability class, whereas in regression, the OP layer outputs a continuous value y, with the MSE evaluated against ground truth (GNDTH) to assess performance. GNDTH is the true curve we want to regress against. c, The nonlinear regression results are demonstrated for the AOC hardware over a Gaussian curve (left) and sinusoidal curve (right) with MSE losses of 3.75 × 10−3 and 1.21 × 10−2, respectively. The shaded area around the AOC predictions represents the observed variability, that is, the standard deviation across the sampling window and repeated AOC runs with the same input (Methods). d, For the full test datasets of MNIST (left) and Fashion-MNIST (right), the AOC classification accuracy is compared with the performance of the AOC-DT and the feedforward model (FFM). Higher accuracies are achieved for larger models (4,096 weights), which are realized with a time-multiplexing technique. Hardware results align with AOC-DT simulations; the 4,096-weight hardware result slightly exceeds the AOC-DT, as it reflects the best of 2 seeds, whereas the AOC-DT accuracy is averaged. The dashed lines show the linear classifier performance; the error bars reflect the random-seed variability for the AOC-DT and experimental repeats for hardware (Methods).

Source Data

For equilibrium models, the fixed-point iterative update follows from equation (1) by setting α(t) → α, γ(t) → 0, b → b + xproj, and using the element-wise tanh nonlinearity:

Here b is the trained bias and xproj encodes the equilibrium model input. The trained weight matrix W is quantized to 9-bit integers (Methods), separated into positive and negative components, and loaded into the corresponding SLMs. The initial state is set to s0 = b + xproj.

During inference, the original data x go through the IP layer as xproj = WIPx + bIP, where WIP and bIP are the trained IP weights and biases. For the given xproj, the equilibrium model iterates on the AOC hardware until convergence, with the fixed-point state s* read out as voltages (Extended Data Fig. 5). Finally, the inference result is obtained by applying the OP layer to the AOC solution as y = WOPs*  + bOP, where WOP and bOP are the trained OP weights and bias.

In the current hardware, the equilibrium model is implemented for a single-layer network with a 256-weight matrix, without symmetry constraints. A recurrent multilayer neural network can be constructed using a lower subdiagonal block-wise matrix (Fig. 3), whereas a continuous-valued Hopfield network arises for a symmetric matrix. We note that neural networks conventionally apply the activation function and weight matrix in a different order than in equation (2). However, this leads to only a minor difference in practice owing to the self-recursive process36.

The left panel shows a multilayer deep neural network (DNN) with recurrence, where orange, green and blue denote different layers. Here, s0 is the initial network state, x is the network input and s* represents the fixed point to which the network converges. This network structure can be realized on the AOC hardware by arranging the layers along the lower subdiagonal of a larger matrix W, placing the final layer as a recurrent block in the top-right corner, with its time evolution shown in the middle panel. The right panel further represents this architecture through a single block iterated over time, capturing the recurrent multilayered model structure. All three panels depict equivalent representations of the recurrent multilayer network.

The hardware realizes the equilibrium model as in equation (2) for two ML inference tasks: image classification and nonlinear regression (Fig. 2b). In both cases, models are trained digitally through the AOC-DT and are deployed on the hardware without further calibration, which requires high hardware precision and high fidelity of the AOC-DT (Methods).

We show that the AOC hardware can run nonlinear regression models. Regression tasks require continuous-valued outputs, which are challenging owing to the inherently noisy nature of analog computations. This is in contrast to classification tasks discussed below where the output labels are discrete and only the class of the largest probability is selected. From a model perspective, nonlinear regression tasks are well suited to the 256-weight AOC as they require small input (\({W}_{{\rm{IP}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{16\times 1}\)) and output (\({W}_{{\rm{OP}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{1\times 16}\)) projection matrices.

We select two nonlinear functions for regression: Gaussian and sinusoidal curves. In agreement with the AOC-DT results (see Supplementary Table 2), the hardware reproduces accurately both functions, as shown in Fig. 2c. The sinusoidal curve presents a greater challenge for accurate fitting than the Gaussian curve owing to its multiple minima and maxima, requiring higher AOC-DT fidelity. This may explain why the AOC hardware struggles to accurately fit the region near the right minimum of the sinusoidal curve. However, at no point does the AOC-DT curve fall outside the AOC standard deviation. We note the digital IP and OP layers alone would only be able to fit linear functions, highlighting the contribution of the equilibrium model running on the AOC hardware.

For the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST datasets, the inputs \({\bf{x}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{28\times 28}\) are rescaled to [−1, 1] range and flattened into vectors. Hence, the IP and OP layers have dimensions 16 × 784 and 10 × 16, respectively. The test dataset results on the 256-weight AOC hardware are shown in Fig. 2d (see also Supplementary Table 4). The AOC-predicted labels match the AOC-DT results for 99.8% of the inputs.

The AOC results demonstrate the viability of digital training with subsequent weight transfer for opto-electronic analog inference. The contribution of the equilibrium model running on the AOC further becomes apparent when comparing the AOC results with a linear classifier, which consists of digitally trained IP layer, a middle layer and an OP layer. We also train a simple feedforward model comprising an IP layer, a middle layer with tanh nonlinearity and an OP layer. Both linear classifier and feedforward models have the same number of parameters as the AOC hardware. Although the AOC achieves slightly higher accuracy (Fig. 2d), the simple nature of the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets is unlikely to demonstrate the full potential of self-recurrent models. Looking ahead, this potential may materialize in a form of test-time compute in sequence modelling tasks34,35 or inference of generative diffusion models.

In practice, model sizes tend to exceed what a given hardware can support, including traditional GPUs. To address this, we demonstrate time-multiplexing on the AOC by training a 4,096-weight ensemble equilibrium model, composed of 16 independent 256-weight equilibrium models. The overall architecture mirrors the previous 256-weight model, but the middle layer now consists of 16 independent equilibrium models, executed sequentially on the AOC for each slice of the input \({{\bf{x}}}_{\mathrm{proj}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{4096}\). Classification accuracies for these time-multiplexed models are shown in Fig. 2d. The time-to-solution increases linearly with the number of independent blocks in the ensemble. Across all architectures considered for classification tasks, the IP layer accounts for the majority of parameters, whereas nonlinearities within the AOC primarily drive performance differences compared with a linear classifier. Additional classification results, including ablation studies of the optical and electronic contributions with untrained IP layers, are provided in Supplementary Information section C.1.

Across all classification and regression tasks, the AOC-DT requires around nine iterations per input to reach convergence. On the AOC hardware, these fixed points can be achieved in 180 ns and, ideally, their sampling would occur immediately afterwards. In practice, to ensure the state stability and mitigate noise, we sample over a fixed 6.4-μs window at 6.25-MHz frequency (Extended Data Fig. 5). As the sampling rate is about eight-times slower than the hardware round-trip time, individual iterations cannot be resolved on the AOC. Compared with classification tasks, the regression tasks show greater sensitivity to noise, requiring up to 11 repeated runs for averaging to obtain smooth curves (Supplementary Fig. 6). We note that owing to the iterative process, the training and inference times of the AOC-DT running in silico are approximately nine-times slower than an equivalent feedforward model.

Equilibrium models, beyond being compute heavy, are also suitable for analog acceleration owing to the attractor nature of their iterative inference process. This provides enhanced robustness to analog noise compared with deep feedforward networks, which is a critical property for the AOC performance at scale (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

The QUMO formulation represents a wide class of combinatorial optimization problems aimed at minimizing the objective function \(F({\bf{x}})=-\frac{1}{2}{{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{T}}}W{\bf{x}}-{{\bf{b}}}^{{\rm{T}}}{\bf{x}}\), where the vector x includes binary and continuous variables, and the information about the optimization problem is encoded in the weight matrix W and the constant vector b. Without loss of generality, one may consider the values {0, 1} for binary and the interval [0, 1] for continuous variables. These variables are represented through the element-wise nonlinearity over the system state vector st in equation (1). The solution to the QUMO problem is the assignment of the variables x that minimizes the objective F(x). If the components of x are all binary variables, the problem reduces to the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. We note that the QUBO problem is equivalent to the well-known problems of minimizing the Hamiltonian of the Ising model37 and finding the maximum cut of a weighted graph38.

Besides being nonlinear, most optimization problems are constrained. A problem with linear inequality constraints highlights the greater expressiveness of the QUMO over the standard QUBO formulation, commonly used across many non-traditional platforms. For example, only one additional continuous variable, typically referred to as slack variable, is required for mapping one inequality constraint to the QUMO problem with a penalty method. In contrast, the QUBO formulation suffers from a large mapping overhead: 10 to 100 binary variables are needed to represent a single constraint with either binary or unary encoding (Supplementary Information section G.8). We next demonstrate solving QUMO problems on the AOC hardware for two applications: medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement.

We implement compressed sensing on the AOC hardware, a technique enabling accurate signal reconstruction from fewer measurements than traditionally required39,40. Compressed sensing accelerates image acquisition, reducing scan times and enhancing patient comfort. For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a sparse image representation is typically achieved using techniques such as wavelet regularization that penalize ‘unnatural' reconstructions. The standard regularization choice is the ℓ1-norm, which promotes sparsity and enables optimization via convex solvers. However, the original compressed-sensing method employs the ‘ℓ0-norm', which counts the number of non-zero elements in a vector. Minimizing the ℓ0-norm may yield better reconstruction in theory41,42, although the optimization problem is deemed impractical in this case and, hence, remains largely unexplored in applied image reconstruction tasks. With the AOC hardware, we can address this original hard problem by formulating the compressed-sensing approach as the QUMO optimization problem:

Here the first term ensures data fidelity between measurements \({\bf{y}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{M}\) and the image \({\bf{x}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) in the wavelet domain, and the matrix \({\bf{A}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{M\times N}\) represents the MRI acquisition process consisting of Fourier and inverse wavelet transforms with an undersampling mask (Methods). To reduce the MRI scan time, the number of measurements M needs to be smaller than the number of pixels N; hence this data-fidelity term has infinitely many solutions on its own. The image pixels are normalized to x ∈ [0, 1]N in the wavelet domain and σ ∈ {0, 1}N is a binary vector that controls the sparsity of x. When σi = 0, the λ1 penalty disappears and the corresponding non-zero pixel value xi penalizes the objective owing to the λ2 penalty. For σi = 1, the λ2 penalty disappears and the pixel xi can take any value to match the measurements, albeit at λ1 penalty cost to the objective. Lastly, 1 and (⋅)T denote the vector of ones and the transpose operation in equation (3), respectively. The generalization of this reconstruction problem to the complex-valued variables is presented in Supplementary Information section G.3.

We realize the compressed-sensing approach on the AOC hardware for a line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image of 32 × 32 pixels (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 10), formulated as a 64-variable 9-bit QUMO problem with equal split between binary and continuous variables. As an example of a realistic MRI process, we omit 37.5% of the measurements. By minimizing the data-fidelity term only, we obtain a poor reconstruction (Fig. 4a), highlighting the importance of the interactions between continuous and binary variables in the QUMO formulation.

a, Medical image reconstruction. Top: the AOC hardware realizes a compressed-sensing algorithm with the ‘ℓ0-norm' to reconstruct a line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image. The reconstruction process is formulated as optimization of the 64-variable QUMO instance and compared with the minimization of the data-fidelity term only in equation (3), achieving an MSE of 0.008 in the former and 0.079 in the latter cases. The greyscale bar denotes brightness values in the image, with 0 corresponding to black and 1 to white. Bottom: reconstructions by the AOC-DT for a real brain image from the FastMRI dataset at typical acceleration rates. b, Transaction settlement. Top: a schematic of the transaction-settlement process among multiple financial parties, with settled (green) and unsettled (red) transactions. Bottom: the number of settled transactions achieved by the AOC hardware for a 41-variable QUMO instance as a function of block coordinate descent steps. c, The AOC hardware solves synthetic 3-bit to 8-bit precision QUMO and QUBO instances with 16 variables, requiring fewer than 1,000 samples to reach at least ≥95% and 100% objective proximities for the QUMO and QUBO instances, respectively. The shaded regions indicate the 50% confidence interval. d, The time trace of 16 variables during the optimization process on the AOC hardware for a QUMO instance. The system converges to the fixed point within 30 μs, with the sampling window occurring over the last 6 μs. e, The relative speed-up of the AOC-DT compared with the Gurobi solver is shown for a QUMO-reformulated subset of QPLIB benchmark instances (QBL). The state-of-the-art solutions are found for instances 3,860 and 3,584. f, The hardest QBL instances require more than 60 s for the Gurobi solver to find the best-known solutions of 10 QBL instances in their original formulation.

Source Data

For the non-zero λ1 and λ2 penalties, we split the 64-variable QUMO problem into smaller subproblems and solve them all in the AOC hardware using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method43. Solutions to each subproblem, corresponding to one step of BCD, are used to create the subsequent ones, all of which are solved using the fixed-point abstraction realized on the AOC hardware. The convergence to the optimal solution takes around 30 –40 BCD steps with 1,000–1,500 AOC iterations per BCD step. The final image reconstruction closely matches the original line, as shown in Fig. 4a. We note that all QUMO instances are solved in an entirely analog manner without any digital post-processing.

To validate the QUMO formulation for compressed sensing at scale, we use the AOC-DT to reconstruct a brain scan image of 320 × 320 pixels from the FastMRI dataset44, which results in the QUMO problem with more than 200,000 variables. For the typical undersampling rates of 4 and 8, we achieve reconstructions with mean squared error (MSE) below 0.07 (Fig. 4a).

For optimization in the financial domain, we use the AOC hardware to solve a transaction-settlement problem. Each securities transaction is an exchange of securities for a payment, known as a delivery-versus-payment transaction. Clearing houses process batches of such transactions; for example, the subsidiaries of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) processed securities transactions valued at US$3 quadrillion in 202345. Within each batch, the transaction-settlement objective is to maximize the total number or total value of settled transactions, which is NP-hard46. This is a difficult optimization problem given the volume of transactions, legal constraints and additional requirements (for example, collateral and credit facilities).

A prevalent approach for solving the transaction-settlement problem is to formulate it as a linear optimization problem with binary variables and linear inequality constraints46. This formulation can be mapped to a QUMO problem, where the inequality constraints are efficiently incorporated into the objective function by introducing continuous slack variables (Supplementary Information section G.8).

We design a transaction-settlement instance generator that produces industrially relevant transaction-settlement scenarios for the given numbers of transactions, financial parties and assets. We also implement a pre-processing technique to eliminate trivial constraints. As an example, we generate a scenario with 46 transactions between 37 parties (Fig. 4b), resulting in 30 constraints, which is reduced to an effective 41-variable QUMO instance. As shown in Fig. 4b, the AOC hardware finds the globally optimal solution in seven BCD steps for this transaction-settlement scenario. Similar to reconstruction of the Shepp–Logan image, the QUMO instances across all transaction-settlement scenarios are solved in an entirely analog manner.

In addition, we evaluate several smaller-size scenarios derived from real settlement data47. After pre-processing, these reduce to QUMO instances of 8 variables, on which the AOC hardware achieves a 100% success rate (see Supplementary Table 8). In contrast, quantum hardware performance on the same problems yields success rates of 40–60% (ref. 47).

For the AOC hardware, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted on a diverse set of challenging synthetic QUMO and QUBO problems. The optimization problems include instances with 16 binary and continuous variables, with dense and sparse weight matrices up to 8-bit precision. For 100 instances, the AOC hardware achieves over 95% and 100% proximity to the optimal objectives of QUMO and QUBO instances, respectively, under 1,000 samples (Fig. 4c). The typical time trace of 16 variables during the optimization process on the AOC hardware is shown in Fig. 4d.

Using the AOC-DT, algorithmic performance is validated on the hardest quadratic binary problems with linear inequality constraints from the quadratic programming library (QPLIB) benchmark23, formulated as QUMO instances. The AOC approach is compared with the commercial Gurobi solver22, which requires over a minute to reach the best-known solutions for these problems. Figure 4e,f shows that the AOC-DT is up to three orders of magnitude faster in all instances, except for two, one of which it is unable to solve. Moreover, the AOC solver discovers the new best solutions for two heavily constrained instances (3,584 and 3,860), each with over 500 binary and 10,000 continuous variables in the QUMO formulation, in about 40 s. For instance, for 3,584, Gurobi matches the AOC solution in about 54,000 s, whereas proving its global optimality takes 4.5 days. The details of the AOC-DT parameters are provided in Supplementary Information section G.4 with additional benchmarks in Supplementary Information section G.5.

Addressing practical applications with the AOC necessitates hardware scalability from hundreds of millions to billions of weights. For example, typical MRI scans with resolutions around 100,000 pixels require systems capable of processing around 20,000 variables when using decomposition techniques such as BCD, which is equivalent to handling around 400 million weights. Similarly, deep learning models with a few billion weights are standard for real-world applications48, which, with mixture of experts models or techniques such as ensembling, could be reduced to many parallel models that are an order of magnitude smaller. The AOC hardware has the potential to scale to these requirements through a modular architecture that decomposes the core optical matrix–vector multiplication operation into multiplication of smaller subvectors and submatrices.

At scale, the AOC hardware will consist of multiple modules, each performing a part of the full-weight matrix multiplication. Each module will include a microLED array, a photodetector array and an SLM. With current SLMs supporting 4 million pixels, matrices with up to 4 million weights could be realized. When combined with integrated driving electronics, this results in a miniaturized module with dimensions of around 4 cm. Utilizing the third dimension for matrix–vector multiplication thus enables scalable in-memory computing. In contrast, emerging planar optical computers1,2 are constrained by the reticle-size limit of the chip area that is used for both routing and computing, which limits the matrix size28. Furthermore, as microLEDs are incoherent light sources, optical paths need to be matched only within the system bandwidth (gigahertz) rather than the source wavelength (hundreds of terahertz), which is a fundamental manufacturability advantage over coherent systems. Achieving the required miniaturization, however, is both a challenge and an opportunity to drive advancements in 3D optical technologies with broader applications. The miniaturized optical modules are coupled with integrated analog electronic models in a 3D mesh (Extended Data Fig. 4). These modules further aggregate the output vectors from the optical modules and perform the remaining compute primitives.

We envision that the AOC can support models with 0.1 billion to 2 billion weights, requiring 50 to 1,000 optical modules. The module count can be halved if a single optical module supports both positive and negative weights13. All AOC components, including microLEDs, photodetectors, SLMs and analog electronics, have an existing and growing manufacturing ecosystem with wafer-scale production. At the same time, complementing optics with analog electronics offers numerous opportunities to expand the compute primitives, including nonlinearities, the hardware can support, thereby enhancing its expressiveness.

The operational speed and power consumption of the AOC dictate its energy efficiency. The speed is limited by the bandwidth of the opto-electronic components, typically 2 GHz or higher49. For a 100-million-weight matrix with 25 AOC modules, the power consumption is estimated to be 800 W, resulting in a computing speed of 400 peta-OPS and an efficiency of 500 TOPS W−1 (2 fJ per operation) at 8-bit weight precision (Supplementary Information section A.1). In contrast, the latest GPUs achieve a system efficiency of up to 4.5 TOPS W−1 at the same precision for dense matrices24.

In conclusion, the AOC architecture shows promise for scaling to practical ML and optimization tasks, offering a potential 100-fold improvement in power efficiency. The current AOC hardware uses a rapid fixed-point search to power inference tasks, such as regression and classification, using equilibrium models with promising reasoning capabilities, and to successfully solve QUMO problems including medical image reconstruction and transaction settlement. Cross-validation with the digital twin, coupled with evaluation on large problems, offers confidence in the hardware's performance as it scales. Looking ahead, the AOC's co-design approach—aligning the hardware with the ML and optimization algorithms—could spur a flywheel of future innovations in hardware and algorithms, pivotal for a sustainable future of computing.

The key components of our experimental set-up are shown in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1.

The optical subsystem performs matrix–vector multiplication. The basic components are the optical sources (input vector), a system of fan-out optics to project the light onto the modulator matrix and a system of fan-in optics to project the light onto a photodetector array (output vector). The corresponding schematic is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2.

The incoherent light sources are an array of 16 independently addressable microLEDs. Each microLED is driven with a bias current and an offset voltage. The variable value is encoded by the light intensity, with a value of zero corresponding to the microLED bias point. Mathematical positive values are represented by microLED drive currents greater than the bias value. Negative values are represented by drive currents less than the bias value. The diameter of each emitter is 50 μm and the pitch is 75 μm. The sources are fabricated in gallium nitride wafers on a sapphire substrate and the die is wire-bonded onto a printed circuit board (Fig. 1c). The emission spectrum is centred at 520 nm with a full-width of half-maximum of 35 nm and the operational −3-dB bandwidth is 200 MHz at 20 mA, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

After the sources, there is a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS). From this point, there are two equivalent optical paths in this set-up. Each path performs two functions: first, they allow us to use both polarizations of the unpolarized light output; second, they allow us to perform non-negative and non-positive multiplications with only intensity modulation. Each path contains one amplitude modulator matrix and one photodetector array. The modulator matrix is a reflective parallel-aligned nematic liquid-crystal SLM. We refer to the first part of the optical system as the fan-out system. The task of this fan-out system is to image the microLEDs onto the SLM, where the weights are displayed, and to spread the light horizontally into lines. The microLEDs are arranged in a one-dimensional line (let this be the y axis) and are imaged onto the SLM using a 4F system composed of a high-numerical-aperture (Thorlabs TL10X-2P, numerical aperture 0.5, ×10 magnification, 22-mm field number) collection objective and a lower-numerical-aperture lens group composed of 2 achromatic doublets with combined focal length 77 mm. There is a cylindrical lens, Thorlabs LJ1558L1, in infinity space of this 4F system. This lens adds defocus to the image of the source array on the SLM but only in the x direction, so that the projected light pattern is a set of long horizontal lines, one per microLED. Each matrix element occupies a patch of 12 (height) × 10 (width) pixels of the modulator array. An 8-bit look-up table is used to linearize the SLM response as a function of grey level.

The SLM is imaged onto the photodetector array using a 4F system (the fan-in system). The first lens group of the fan-in is the same as the second lens group of the fan-out system as this is in double pass. From here, the light is directed towards the intended photodetector array through a second PBS. The light from each column of the SLM is collected by an array of 16 silicon photodetectors to perform the required summation operation. The active area of each element is 3.6 × 0.075 mm2. The photodetectors are on a pitch of 0.125 mm. The operation bandwidth is 490 MHz at −10 V measured at 600 nm.

After the photodetector array, the signals are in the analog electronic domain. The photocurrents from each photodetector element are amplified by a linear trans-impedance amplifier (Analog Devices MAX4066). Each trans-impedance amplifier provides 25-kΩ gain and is characterized by an input referred noise of \(3\,{\rm{pA}}\,\sqrt{\text{Hz}}\) and has differential outputs. The corresponding 2 sets (1 per photodetector board) of 16 differential pairs of signals are fed to the main boards where the per-channel nonlinear operation and other analog electronic processing is carried out. Each of the 16 signals sees the following circuitry: (1) a variable gain amplifier (VGA; Texas Instruments VCA824) to allow the input signal range to be set and equalized across channels; (2) a difference amplifier to perform the operation of subtracting the negative input signal from the positive one and achieve signed voltages (signed multiplications); (3) a VGA that adds and subtracts signals from the described path, referred to as gradient term, to the annealing and momentum terms, as per equation (1), while providing a common gain control to all these paths; (4) an electronic switch (ADG659) to open and close the loop to set and reset the solving state; (5) a buffer amplifier to distribute the signal to the gradient, annealing and momentum paths; (6) a bipolar differential pair to implement the tanh nonlinearity; (7) a VGA to adjust the signal level between the nonlinearity and the required voltage and current onto the microLED alternating-current input circuit. Both the annealing and momentum paths have VGAs with a common external control so that we can implement time-varying annealing and momentum schedules.

Each channel also has an offset to the common control signal added to allow minor adjustment or correction of channel-to-channel variations. The other VGAs are set with digital-to-analog converters controlled over an inter-integrated circuit (I2C) bus. This allows slower control at per-experiment timescales.

The per-channel nonlinear function is an approximation to a tanh. This is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5d. The system is designed so that all signals follow the same path through the solver. For ML workloads, the input domain of the tanh function is unrestricted by hardware; there are no gain variations across channels. The trained weights and equilibrium model input ensure that signals evolve accurately. For optimization workloads, binary and continuous variables require different handling in hardware. Here we set the gain after the trans-impedance amplifier and before the tanh nonlinearity to be lower for continuous variables than for binary variables. This adjustment ensures that the input domain of the nonlinearity results in a more linear output for continuous variables than for binary variables.

We characterized and calibrated the key opto-electronic and electronic components to equalize the gain of each AOC path. For example, we calibrate the optical paths by applying a set of 93 reference matrices and for each we digitally compute the result of the vector–matrix product. We then adjust the gain per channel slightly so that, averaged over the set of 93 computed vectors, the AOC result is as close as possible to the digital result.

Following this, the accuracy of the matrix–vector multiplication is characterized using the same 93 reference matrices on each SLM and measuring the output of the system, shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a. For each reference matrix in the set, we calculate the MSE between the known and the measured output. The mean MSE across all dot products is 5.5 × 10−3, and the matrix–vector multiplication MSE as a function of matrix (instance) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3b. For these experiments, we configure the system in open-loop mode without feedback and turn off the annealing and momentum paths.

In commercial deployments, training consumes less than 10% of the energy and, hence, is not targeted by the AOC. The equilibrium models are trained through our digital twin, which is based on equation (2). In the digital domain during training, the convergence criterion is set to ∣∣st+1 − st∣∣ < ε, with ε = 10−3. The AOC-DT models up to seven non-idealities measured on the AOC device; each non-ideality can be switched on and off (Supplementary Fig. 5). The AOC-DT is implemented as a Pytorch module with the weight matrix W and bias terms b, as well as the gain β as trainable parameters. The weight matrix is normalized to fulfil ∥W∥∞ = 1 throughout training to simulate the passive SLM. The numeric scale of the matrix is instead modelled by the gain β. This separation of scale is necessary as several nonlinear non-idealities occur between the matrix multiplication and the gain in equation (2), as discussed in Supplementary Information section D.

The weight matrix is initialized with the default Pytorch initialization for a 16 × 16 matrix, the bias term is initialized to 0 and β is initialized at 1. We trained all models with a batch size of B = 8, at a learning rate of η = 3 × 10−4 for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST and η = 7 × 10−4 for regression tasks. We used the Adam optimizer50. In all cases, models are trained end-to-end, with the equilibrium-section trained through our AOC-DT using the implicit gradient method17, which avoids storing activations for the fixed-point iterations. This decouples memory cost from iteration depth as intermediate activations do not need to be stored. In all experiments, the α gain in equation (2) is set to 0.5 to strike a balance between overall signal amplitude and speed of convergence. Low α values cause the signal to be too weak, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (Supplementary Information section D).

Once training has completed, the weight matrix W is quantized to signed 9-bit integers using

with the rounded and clamped matrix on the right-hand side being the quantized weight matrix WQ. Whenever we report AOC-DT results, we report results obtained with the quantized matrix.

Exporting trained models to the AOC requires several further steps. First, the model inputs x and the bias term b need to be condensed into a single vector bAOC = b + x followed by clamp to ensure the values fit into the dynamic range of the AOC device (Supplementary Information section D). Second, as the optical matrix multiplication is implemented using SLMs, elements of the weight matrix are bounded by one such that all quantization-related factors disappear. However, the original maximum element of the matrix max(W) needs to be re-injected, which we achieve via the β gain in equation (2), approximately restoring the original matrix W.

The quantized matrix is split into positive and negative parts, \({W}_{{\rm{Q}}}={W}_{{\rm{Q}}}^{+}-{W}_{{\rm{Q}}}^{-}\), and each part is displayed on its respective SLM.

Each classification instance (that is, MNIST or Fashion-MNIST test image) is run once on the AOC, and the fixed point is sampled at the point marked in Extended Data Fig. 3 after a short 2.5-μs cooldown window after the switch is closed, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5a,b. The sampling window extends over 40 samples at 6.25 MHz, corresponding to 6.4 μs. This ensures that the search of fixed points for the equilibrium models happens entirely in the analog domain. Once sampled, we digitally project the vector into the output space. For classification, the input is projected from 784 to 16 dimensions, the output is projected from 16 to 10 classes. The label is then determined by the index of the largest element in the output vector (argument-max). For regression tasks, the IP and OP layers transform a scalar to 16 dimensions and back, respectively. The MSE results in Fig. 2c were obtained by averaging over 11 repeats for each input. This means that we restart the solution process 11 times, including the sampling window, and average the resulting latent fixed-point vectors. Importantly, the solve-to-solve variability appears to be centred close to the curve produced by the AOC-DT, enabling us to average this variability out (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We can expand the model sizes supported by the hardware by using an ensemble of small models that fit on it. These smaller 256-weight models are independent at inference time but are trained jointly by receiving slices 16-sized slices of a larger input vector and stacking their outputs before the OP. To scale to a 4,096-weight equilibrium model, we expand the input space from 16 to 16 × 16 = 4,096 dimensions and the output space from 10 to 10 × 16 = 160 dimensions. The IP matrix is consequently a 784 × 4,096-shaped matrix and the OP matrix is shaped 160 × 10. MNIST or Fashion-MNIST images are scaled to the range [−1, 1] and, projected to 4,096 dimensions and split into 16 slices of 16 dimensions. Each of the 16 equilibrium models then runs its respective slice of input vectors to a fixed-point. Once all 16 models are run on the AOC, we concatenate outputs and project them into the 10-dimensional output space where the largest dimension determines the predicted cipher.

The first curve (I) is a Gaussian rescaled such that the Gaussian curve approximately stretches from −1 to 1, \({f}_{{\rm{I}}}(x)=2{{\rm{e}}}^{-{x}^{2}/2{\sigma }^{2}}-1\) for σ = 0.25 and x ∈ [−1, 1]. The second curve (II) is given by \({f}_{{\rm{II}}}(x)=\sqrt{| x| }\,\sin (3{\rm{\pi }}x)\). For training sets, we choose 10,000 equidistant points xi in the range [−1, 1] whereas for test regression datasets, we choose 200 points randomly xi ≈ U([−1, 1]).

For regression tasks, we concatenate the 40 samples from all 11 repeats and calculate the standard deviation per point on the curve.

We trained the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST models on 48,000 images from their respective training set, validated on a set of 12,000 images and tested them on the full test set comprising 10,000 images.

For experimental results, the error bars in Fig. 2d were estimated using a Bayesian approach for the decision variable ct ∈ {0, 1, …, 9} for each sample t along the sampling window per image. We assume an uninformative prior p(ct) = beta(1, 1), which we then update with the observed number of correct decisions nsuccess and failures nfailure over the sampling window. The variance of the conjugate posterior of a beta distribution is given by \(\mathrm{Var}({c}_{t}| {n}_{\mathrm{success}},{n}_{{\rm{failure}}})=\frac{(1+{n}_{\mathrm{success}})(1+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}{{(2+{n}_{\mathrm{success}}+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}^{2}(3+{n}_{\mathrm{success}}+{n}_{\mathrm{failure}})}\). We use this to estimate the variance and, by taking the square root, the standard deviation per input image. The dataset error bars are then estimated as the mean of the standard deviations over all members of the dataset.

To address optimization problems involving positive and negative weights on the AOC hardware, QUMO instances without linear terms can have up to eight variables, which applies to both transaction-settlement scenarios and reconstruction of one-dimensional line of the Shepp–Logan phantom image. The weight matrices are unsigned in synthetic QUMO and QUBO hardware benchmarks; hence the AOC hardware can accommodate up to 16-variable instances in the absence of linear terms. Such instance size difference arises because, when both positive and negative weights are present, non-idealities in the dual-SLM configuration reduce the accuracy of matrix–vector multiplication. To mitigate this, a single SLM is used to process both positive and negative weights, effectively halving the number of variables per instance.

For the transaction-settlement scenario and the Shepp–Logan phantom image slice, their 41-variable and 64-variable QUMO instances are decomposed into smaller 7-variable QUMO instances. For each of these subinstances, the 7 variables are connected with the rest of the variables via a linear vector b, which is incorporated into the quadratic matrix W via an additional binary variable. This decomposition is repeated for each subinstance and the linear vector b is updated at the end of each BCD iteration to create the next QUMO instance. Such an approach yields 8-variable QUMO instances and a single SLM is used to represent their positive and negative matrix elements, with analog electronics handling their subtraction, which effectively utilizes the full 16-variable capacity available in hardware. The required number of BCD iterations varies depending on factors such as the initial random state of the optimization instance variables, the selection of variable blocks among subinstances, and the order in which they are optimized.

For the one-dimensional Shepp–Logan phantom image, 12 out of 32 measurements are omitted, corresponding to a 37.5% data loss or a 1.6 undersampling (acceleration) rate. Although typical MRI acceleration ranges from 2 to 8, this rate is used here owing to the image's non-smoothness at a 32-pixel resolution.

In the AOC, binary variables are encoded using a hyperbolic tangent function, whereas continuous variables utilize the near-linear region of the function, connecting optimization variables to state variables via x = f(s). In simulations at scale with the AOC-DT, linear and sign functions are used for continuous and binary variables, respectively.

To ensure that some variables take indeed continuous values in the global optimal solution, we plant random continuous values and generate synthetic 16-variable QUMO instances. As the number of continuous variables increases for a given problem size, the problem instances become computationally easier to solve. Consequently, we consider instances with up to eight continuous variables.

We generate up to 8-bit dense and sparse instances. The sparse instances belong to the QUBO model on three-regular graphs that are NP-hard51, although NP-hardness does not imply that every random instance is difficult to solve. To make these instances more challenging to solve, we verify that their global objective minimizer is distinct from the signs of the principal eigenvector of the weight matrix52.

The QPLIB is a library of quadratic programming instances23 collected over almost a year-long open call from various communities, with the selected instances being challenging for state-of-the-art solvers. As described in the main part of the paper, we consider only the hardest instances within the QPLIB:QBL class of problems, which contains instances with quadratic objective and linear inequality constraints. The QPLIB:QCBO class of problems, which contains instances with quadratic objective and linear equality constraints, and the QPLIB:QBN class of problems, which contains QUBO instances, are considered in Supplementary Information section G.5.

The distinction of the AOC-DT algorithm is the simultaneous inclusion of both momentum and annealing terms, which markedly improves the performance of the standard steepest gradient-descent method on non-convex optimization problems. Typically, multiple hyperparameters need to be calibrated for heuristic methods to achieve their best performance in solving optimization problems. We consider \(\alpha (t)=1-\widehat{\alpha }(t)\), where \(\widehat{\alpha }(t)\) is a linearly decreasing function from some initial value α0 to 0 over time. From the hardware perspective, such an annealing schedule provides an explicit stopping criteria, which is an advantage for an all-analog hardware implementation as it avoids the complexity of multiple intermediate readouts that stochastic heuristic approaches suffer from53. In principle, the three main parameters {α0, β, γ} of the AOC fixed-point update rule need to be adjusted for each optimization instance. In our simulations, we notice that the algorithm is less sensitive to the momentum parameter value, whereas the α0 and β values substantially affect the solution quality. We further perform a linear stability analysis of the algorithm to evaluate reasonable exploration regions for these two parameters and find that by scaling the β parameter as β = β0/λlargest, where λlargest is the largest eigenvalue of the weight matrix W, we get scaled parameters β0 and α0 being in a similar optimal unit range across a wide range of problems.

We design a two-phase approach for the AOC-DT to operate similar to a black-box solver that can quickly adjust the critical parameters within the given time limit. During the ‘exploration' phase, we evaluate the relative algorithm performance across a vast range of parameters (α0, β0). A subset of ‘good' parameters is then passed for more extensive investigation in the ‘deep search' phase (Supplementary Information section G.1).

We note that for two QPLIB:QUMO instances, namely, 5,935 and 5,962, we developed a pre-processing technique that greedily picks variables with the highest impact on the objective functions and considers their possible values, which is accounted in the reported time speed-up of the AOC-DT.

For a fair comparison, we ensure that all methods use similar computing resources. Although the implementation of GPU- or central-processing-unit-based solvers can require highly varying engineering efforts, we try to estimate the cost of running solvers on the hardware, on which they are designed to run, and vary the time limit across solvers accordingly to ensure similar cost per solver run. In what follows, the Julia-based AOC-DT runs on a GV100 GPU for 5–300 s per instance across all benchmarks. In the case of Gurobi, our licence allows us to use only up to eight cores, and its time to achieve the best solution for the first time is used (not the time to prove its optimality).

More details about the AOC hardware and the AOC-DT performance on different optimization instances are provided in Supplementary Information section G.5.

a, Photo of AOC, used to simultaneous run ML models and solve optimization instances. Key highlighted components are: the microLED array, the SLMs, the photodetector array, and the analog electronic block. b, AOC photo inside a rack, with all required equipment included.

Light from the sources is collected by the objective. The sources are imaged onto the SLM using the combined 4F system of the objective and lens group 1 (LG1). Polarizing beamsplitter 1 (PBS 1) splits the light by linear polarization state and sends light to one of two modulators. The reflected light is modulated by polarization (multiplication) and the action of PBS 1 makes this an amplitude modulation. Each SLM is imaged onto its corresponding detector using LG1 and LG2 through PBS 1 and PBS 2. Summation happens at the detector.

a, Example trace of an MNIST example. We selected four time points of the trace where we projected the measured state into classification space using the output projection and applied a softmax to obtain probabilities. The most likely class stays on the wrong label 7 until the fully-sampled result is evaluated in which the correct class label 9 is reached. b, Example trace of a Fashion MNIST example. Here, the initial entropy of the class-probability distribution is high but drastically falls off over iterations. The correct class with label 2 emerges early on and is maintained throughout the iterations and in the sampled result. c, Example traces of a sinusoidal regression task for x = − 0.55. While the trace sampled during evolution averages multiple iterations and is asynchronously sampled, we can observe some correspondence between the evolution of the AOC-DT for the same point. The plot on the right shows the evolution of the entire curve over AOC-DT iterations. The point of interest is marked by the vertical dashed line and appears to follow the same trajectory from close to −1 to its target value. d, Multi-seed study of the Gaussian regression task for 100 independently trained and tested equilibrium models to test how reliable the AOC-DT models the AOC device.

The spatial resolution of omics analyses is fundamental to understanding tissue biology1,2,3. The capacity to spatially profile DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation4,5, is lacking. Here we introduce a method for whole-genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and the transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.

DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism that modulates gene expression and lineage specification by regulating chromatin structure and accessibility to transcriptional machinery4,5. This epigenetic modification varies dynamically across cell types, developmental stages and environmental conditions6. Abnormal cytosine-methylation patterns are associated with various diseases, including cancer7, autoimmune diseases8 and inflammation9. Furthermore, altered DNA-methylation levels have been observed in ageing tissues10, contributing to biomarkers and predictive clock models for chronological and biological age11.

Despite advances in single-cell methylome analysis5,12, the lack of spatial information regarding intact tissues limits our understanding of gene regulation during tissue development and disease progression. Emerging spatial multi-omics technologies now enable profiling of molecular features in native tissue microenvironments, significantly enhancing our understanding of biological complexity in situ. However, current spatial methods are limited to histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, transcriptomes and selected protein panels1,2,3. Direct spatial mapping of DNA methylation has not been available, leaving this crucial epigenetic layer underexplored.

Here we introduce a technology for spatial joint profiling of the DNA methylome and transcriptome (spatial-DMT) on the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. We used spatial-DMT to profile mouse embryos and postnatal mouse brains. The spatial maps uncovered intricate spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in a native tissue context. Spatial-DMT investigates interactive molecular hierarchies in development, physiology and pathogenesis in a spatially resolved manner.

Spatial-DMT combines microfluidic in situ barcoding1, cytosine deamination conversion12 and high-throughput next-generation sequencing to achieve spatial methylome profiling directly in tissue. The experimental workflow of spatial-DMT is illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, with a step-by-step protocol provided in Extended Data Fig. 1 and detailed reagent information provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4.

a, Spatial-DMT workflow. A tissue section is fixed, permeabilized, treated with HCl treatment, and subjected to Tn5 transposition and reverse transcription (RT). Spatial barcodes are sequentially ligated, after which cDNA and gDNA are separated using streptavidin beads. cDNA is processed using template switching, after which a cDNA library is prepared; gDNA is processed using enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) conversion and splint ligation, after which a library is constructed. b, Chemistry workflow of DNA methylation and RNA library preparation. BCA, barcode A; BCB, barcode B; TSO, template switch oligo. c, Comparison of the number of CpGs per tissue pixel per cell across spatial-DMT and other single-cell DNA-methylation datasets5,10,12,14 (number of cells: mouse muscle stem cells10, n = 260; mouse brain5, n = 103,560; human brain LA12, n = 1,049; human brain SL12, n = 1,920; mouse brain12, n = 491; number of pixels: E11 embryo (10 µm), n = 2,493; E11 embryo 1 (50 μm), n = 1,954; E11 embryo 2 (50 µm), n = 1,947; E13 embryo (50 µm), n = 1,699; P21 brain (20 µm), n = 2,235).

Specifically, hydrochloric acid (HCl) was applied to fixed frozen tissue sections to disrupt the nucleosome structures and remove histones to improve Tn5 transposome accessibility for DNA-methylation profiling13. Next, Tn5 transposition was performed and adapters containing a universal ligation linker were inserted into genomic DNA (gDNA). To further reduce the size of the large gDNA fragment and improve yield, we adopted a multi-tagmentation strategy as previously described13. Specifically, we implemented two rounds of tagmentation to balance DNA yield with experimental time and minimize the risk of RNA degradation. mRNAs were then captured by the biotinylated reverse transcription primer (poly-biotinylated deoxythymidine (dT) primer with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and a universal linker sequence; Supplementary Table 1), followed by reverse transcription to synthesize the complementary DNA (cDNA). Both genomic fragments and cDNA in the tissue were then ligated to spatial barcodes sequentially. In brief, two sets of spatial barcodes (barcodes A1–A50 and B1–B50; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) flowed perpendicularly to each other in the microfluidic channels. They were covalently conjugated to the universal linker through the templated ligation. This results in a two-dimensional grid of spatially barcoded tissue pixels in the region of interest (ROI), each defined by the unique combination of barcodes Ai and Bj (i = 1–50, j = 1–50; barcoded pixels, n = 2,500). Barcoded gDNA fragments and cDNA were then released after reverse crosslinking. Afterwards, the biotin-labelled cDNA was enriched by the streptavidin beads and separated from the gDNA-containing supernatant. Subsequently, cDNA was subjected to a template switching reaction and the cDNA library was constructed (Fig. 1b, right, and Extended Data Fig. 1). gDNA was treated with enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) conversion, splint ligation and DNA library construction (Fig. 1b, left, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods).

To minimize DNA damage during methylome profiling, we used enzymatic methyl-seq, an enzyme-based alternative to bisulfite conversion (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). In this process, modified cytosines (the sum of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) were both oxidized by the ten–eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) protein and protected from deamination by the APOBEC protein, whereas unmodified cytosines were deaminated to uracil. After the conversion, a SLP5 adapter with ten random H (A, C or T) nucleotides was ligated to the 3′ end of the gDNA, adding the other PCR handle12. The gDNA fragments were then amplified using uracil-literate VeraSeq Ultra DNA polymerase. Because C residues on the PCR handle of barcode B were changed to T residues after deamination and PCR, we modified the P7 primer (N70X-HT) by replacing C residues with T residues to complement the A residues on the PCR handle and amplify the fragments. Barcodes have been designed such that no crosstalk under C-to-T deamination is possible.

To demonstrate the ability of spatial-DMT to co-profile DNA methylation and transcription in complex tissues, we profiled mouse embryos on embryonic days 11 (E11) and 13 (E13) and mouse brain on postnatal day 21 (P21). Mouse embryos were profiled at two pixel resolutions: 50 μm for the head and upper body and 10 μm for zoomed-in mapping of the facial and forebrain region. Postnatal mouse brains were profiled at 20 μm pixel resolution. We developed a computational pipeline to preprocess and analyse the data (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Spatial-DMT is reproducible. DNA methylation and RNA expression had high concordance (Pearson's r = 0.9836 for DNA methylation and r = 0.9752 for RNA expression; Methods) between the replicate E11 embryo maps with matched body parts (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) co-embedding of the two replicate spatial maps revealed co-localization of pixels from similar body parts but from different datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Notably, marker genes, including Frem1 (face), Ank3 (brain) and Trim55 (heart), showed spatial expression patterns consistent with their known tissue-specific expression profiles (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f).

DNA-methylation analysis generated 2.8–3.9 billion raw reads per sample for E11 (10 μm and 50 μm), E13 (50 μm) and P21 brain (20 μm) samples (Supplementary Table 5). Low-signal pixels were filtered on the basis of the knee-plot cut-off threshold (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After stringent quality control, 32.2–65.7% of reads (887,671,712–1,882,630,968) were retained, yielding 355,069–753,052 reads per pixel across 1,699–2,493 pixels in the E11, E13 and P21 samples (Supplementary Table 5). On average, 136,639–281,447 CpGs were covered per pixel across E11, E13 and P21 samples (Supplementary Table 5), comparable to previous single-cell DNA-methylation studies of mouse embryos and brain samples5,10,12,14 (Fig. 1c). Duplication rates ranged from approximately 20 to 53% across samples (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The retention rate, defined as the percentage of unconverted cytosines owing to methylation or incomplete conversion12, of mitochondrial DNA was minimal (below 1%; Extended Data Fig. 3c). The CpG retention rates were consistently between 70% and 80% across all samples, whereas the methylation level of non-CpG sites (mCH; H denotes A, C or T) remained low (mCA < 1% in embryos; mCA ≈ 3–4% in the postnatal brain; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3d). The mCA level was higher in the P21 mouse brain, consistent with the known increase in non-CpG methylation in postnatal neuronal tissues5,15. Analysis of the methylation-free linker sequences showed that more than 99% of cytosines were successfully converted, further confirming conversion efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Furthermore, no evidence of RNA contamination, such as poly(A), poly(T) or template switching oligonucleotide sequences, was detected in the DNA-methylation libraries (Extended Data Fig. 3f).

We further assessed the genomic distribution of CpG coverage and found it to be uniformly distributed across genomic regions (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Furthermore, methylation levels across various chromatin states were consistent with known biology and comparable to those reported in published databases5,10,12,14,16 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). For instance, DNA-methylation levels were low at transcription start sites but increased upstream and downstream of these regions (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Collectively, our approach yielded accurate and unbiased profiling of DNA methylation across the genome.

Simultaneously, we generated high-quality RNA data from the same tissue sections, enabling direct comparisons between transcriptional activity and epigenetic states. Specifically, we identified expression of 23,822–28,695 genes in our spatial maps (Supplementary Table 5). At the pixel level, the average number of detected genes per pixel ranges from 1,890 (E11 embryo, 10 μm; 3,596 UMIs) to 4,626 (E11 embryo, 50 μm; 16,709 UMIs), comparable to previous spatial transcriptomic studies of the mouse embryo and brain1,2 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 5). Lower-resolution pixels (for example, 50 μm) captured more UMIs and expressed genes, probably owing to the inclusion of more cells in each pixel.

Mammalian embryogenesis is an intricately programmed process with complex gene-expression dynamics regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, at spatiotemporal scales17. We applied spatial-DMT to produce spatial tissue maps of the DNA methylation and gene expression of the E11 mouse embryo. The DNA methylome and transcriptome define cell identity independently, with pixels clustered by methylation read-outs sampled from variably methylated regions (VMRs)18 and expression levels from variably transcribed genes (Fig. 1f, left and middle, and Extended Data Fig. 4d). The two modalities can be integrated to achieve improved discrimination of intercellular and spatial diversity using a weighted nearest neighbour (WNN) method19 (Fig. 1f, right). Superimposing the WNN clusters over histological images suggests clear correspondence with anatomical structures, for example, craniofacial region (W0), hindbrain–spinal cord (W2) and embryonic heart (W6), consistent with the tissue histology (Fig. 1f, bottom left).

The correlations between single-modality (RNA and DNA methylation) clusters and their integrated WNN clustering results were evaluated (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Each modality captured distinct yet complementary aspects of cellular identity and their integration through WNN analysis yielded clusters with enhanced resolution. RNA-expression profiles had a broader dynamic range, which may result in distinct clustering granularity across modalities. To quantify the relative contributions of each modality to the integrated clusters, we computed modality weights for individual spatial pixels (Extended Data Fig. 4g). This analysis revealed that some clusters were defined predominantly by gene expression (for example, W6, cardiac tissue), whereas others by DNA methylation (for example, W11, craniofacial region). Collectively, these results highlight the advantage of spatial multi-omics integration in resolving cellular heterogeneity missed by single-modality analyses.

We examined VMR methylations specific to the brain (W2), craniofacial (W0) and heart (W6) regions (Fig. 1f) and neighbouring gene expression (Fig. 2a,b, cluster W2; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b, cluster W0; and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b, cluster W6). Spatial cluster-specific gene expression is frequently associated with low DNA methylation at the neighbouring VMRs, as exemplified by signature genes Runx2, Mapt, and Trim55, which mark the craniofacial regions (jaw and upper nasal), the brain and spinal cord, and the heart, respectively (Fig. 2c and see Extended Data Figs. 5a, 6c and 7c for additional signature gene examples). Testing the epigenetically regulated genes from each cluster for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment identified the developmental process related to the anatomical structures (Extended Data Figs. 5b, 6d and 7d). Although the canonical negative correlations between DNA methylation and RNA expression have been observed in many genes, we also identified genes, for example, Ank3, Atp11c, Cyfip2, Lmln and Khdrbs2, for which expression is positively correlated with the methylation levels of the associated VMRs (Fig. 2d). For instance, Ank3, primarily located at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems20, had high levels of expression and DNA methylation in the brain region (Fig. 2c). The positive correlations between DNA methylation and RNA expression have been documented at enhancers21, gene bodies22 and Polycomb targets23, suggesting a complex mechanism of DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation, contingent on its interaction with transcriptional factor (TF) binding and histone modifications.

The y axis shows the enrichment P values from Homer one-sided hypergeometric test of TF motifs and the x axis shows the average gene expression of the corresponding TFs.

To directly assess the influence of cell-type-specific methylation on TF binding, we performed motif enrichment analysis on differentially hypomethylated VMRs and examined the gene expression of each TF gene. Our findings uncovered a relationship between the expression of TFs and the DNA methylation at their binding sites. For example, TFs associated with heart development, Hand2, Tbx20 and Meis1, were expressed in cluster W6, the corresponding hypomethylated VMRs of which were enriched in the binding motifs of these TFs (Fig. 2e, right). Similar sets of tissue-specific TFs are identified for other embryo structures, for example, Ebf1 and Pbx1 in the brain and spinal cord and Sox9, Ebf1 and Zeb2 in the craniofacial region (Fig. 2e). Notably, Ebf1 was expressed and its binding motif was also enriched across all three tissue regions (Fig. 2e). EBF1 was reported as an interaction partner for TET2 and was suggested as a sequence-specific mechanism for regulating DNA methylation in cancer24.

To precisely resolve the fine structure of transcriptional regulation in the craniofacial and forebrain regions of the E11 embryo, we used a 10 μm pixel size microfluidic chip to produce a spatial map with near single-cell resolution (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Integration of our spatial dataset with a single-cell reference25 revealed a strong concordance between the two datasets (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). For example, W11 maps to neuroectoderm and glial cells in the single-cell reference, W7 to CNS neurons, W5 to olfactory sensory neurons and W10 to epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Cell-type deconvolution using the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference25 identified distinct clusters that correspond precisely to known anatomical structures of the developing mouse brain. Notably, two spatially defined clusters, W7 and W11, captured key telencephalic compartments. W11 was enriched for telencephalon progenitors in the ventricular zone of the pallium, a neurogenic niche characterized by active cell division and proliferation, whereas W7 corresponded to γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) cortical interneurons localized in the mantle zone, where newborn neurons migrate, accumulate and differentiate to establish cortical architecture26 (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 8d). GO enrichment analysis further supported these regional identities, highlighting biological processes associated with neurogenesis and progenitor proliferation in W11, and neuron projection and migration in W7 (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Moreover, the cell-type lineage tree constructed from the scRNA-seq reference confirmed the developmental trajectory, positioning telencephalon progenitors as direct precursors to GABAergic cortical interneurons25. Beyond the forebrain, our spatial analysis also resolved refined sensory structures in the developing olfactory system (cluster W5 and W10; Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Sensory neurons were notably enriched in W5 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), spatially localized adjacent to the forebrain. This spatial pattern aligns closely with the established developmental trajectory of the olfactory system, in which olfactory sensory neurons progressively form connections with the forebrain as embryogenesis progresses27. Together, these findings provide a high-resolution view of neural and sensory system formation, underscoring the power of spatial-DMT in resolving intricate anatomical structures and capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics.

Mammalian embryogenesis is a precisely timed process with dynamic DNA methylation and gene expression underlying cell differentiation and tissue development16. By using pseudotime and spatial-DMT analyses on embryos of two different gestational ages (E11 and E13), we can investigate the dynamics of DNA methylation, gene expression and their interactions at both spatial and temporal scales. We first analysed the developing brain, focusing on the differentiation trajectory from oligodendrocyte progenitors to premature oligodendrocytes. Spatial mapping of the pseudotime of each pixel revealed the organized migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from the subpallium to the pallium during oligodendrogenesis (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5c). This pseudotemporal process is associated with coupled DNA methylation and gene expression in different patterns. For example, loss of DNA methylation can be both associated with gene activation (for example, Nrg3, an oligodendrocyte marker28) and silencing (for example, Pdgfra, an oligodendrocyte precursor marker29; Fig. 3b, red boxes). The presence of both the positive and the negative couplings between DNA methylation and gene expression is aligned with the above comparisons across spatial pixels, reinforcing the regulatory diversity of mouse embryogenesis and oligodendrogenesis29.

To further illustrate the temporal molecular dynamics of embryonic development, we performed spatial mapping of the E13 mouse embryo (Extended Data Fig. 9a). First, we validated our RNA dataset by integrating it with a published spatial ATAC–RNA (ATAC, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin) reference2, which revealed a strong concordance (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Co-clustering the two datasets identified 11 distinct cluster populations, each corresponding to the histological location in both samples (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). By integrating spatial data from E11 and E13 embryos (Fig. 3c,d), we identified genes upregulated in E13 (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9b,d, left) associated with notable loss of DNA methylation (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d, right). These genes are implicated in the corresponding tissue functions. For example, Usp9x, Ank3 and Shank2 are critically involved in neuronal development, synaptic organization, morphogenesis and transmission30,31,32 (Fig. 3e,f). Ctnna1, Pecam1 and Lamb1 are pivotal for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity33, vascular development34 and cardiac tissue structuring35, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). Functional analysis of upregulated genes further corroborated their association with biological processes, for example, synapse organization, neuron projection organization and dendritic spine morphogenesis in the brain (Fig. 3g), and sphingolipid metabolic processes in the heart (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Our tissue map data more precisely timed these gene and pathway activations to a specific stage of embryo development, tissue location and shed light on their epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Notably, besides regulators of tissue development, some DNA methylation writers36, readers37 and eraser enzymes38, for example, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Mecp2 and Tet1, showed higher expression in the E13 embryo, suggesting elevated biochemical activity that drove the global DNA methylation dynamics (Fig. 3h).

mCH methylation, particularly mCA, is uniquely abundant in the brain5,15. To evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of non-CpG cytosine methylation, we applied spatial-DMT to the cortical and hippocampal regions of a P21 mouse brain (Fig. 4a). Initial analysis of global mCA and mCG levels revealed relatively low methylation in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis (CA)1/2 and CA3 regions, compared with the cortex (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

These plots demonstrate how differential methylation at CpG and CpA sites correlates with changes in gene expression, illustrating the complex regulatory landscape across different brain regions. f–h, Spatial mapping of CpG (left) and CpA (middle) methylation and RNA-expression levels (right) for selected genes in different brain regions.

The spatial distribution of methylome and transcriptome clusters matched anatomical structures shown by the histology image, reflecting the arealization of this brain region (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Expression of known cell-specific marker genes is spatially distributed in regions in which these cell types were enriched. For instance, Prox1, a TF crucial for neurogenesis and the maintenance of granule cell identity39, was prominently expressed in the DG (Fig. 4f, right). Satb1, which has a role in cortical neuron differentiation and layer formation40, was strongly enriched in the cerebral cortex (Extended Data Fig. 10b, right). Bcl11b, a TF essential for neuronal progenitor cell differentiation41, demonstrated elevated expression in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 10c, right).

To elucidate the regulatory roles of mCG and mCA on gene transcription, we compared the two modifications for the signature genes of each cluster against all other clusters combined. By correlating the modification levels with gene expression, we identified genes potentially regulated by mCG, mCA or both (Fig. 4c–e). Prox1 and Bcl11b expression was significantly associated with both mCG and mCA (Fig. 4c,f and Extended Data Fig. 10c), broadly marking the DG and CA1/2 regions, respectively. By contrast, Ntrk3, a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for nervous system function42, was highly expressed in the hippocampal CA1/2 and DG regions, correlating primarily with mCG levels but not with mCA (Fig. 4d,g). Similarly, Satb1 expression in the cortex was strongly correlated with mCG but not with mCA levels (Extended Data Fig. 10b). The silencing of Cux1, a TF involved in neuronal development and function43, had a negative correlation with CA and CG hypermethylation in the CA3 region. By contrast, in the CA1/2 region, Cux1 expression showed a negative correlation only with CA hypermethylation and seemed independent of mCG levels (Fig. 4e,h). Across both sequence contexts, negative correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression are more prevalent than positive ones, highlighting the predominantly repressive nature of these epigenetic modifications (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Collectively, mCG and mCA regulate transcription in a gene-specific manner, jointly defining the cell identity across cell types and brain regions.

Further analysis of neuronal and glial populations revealed cell-type- and region-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic variation. For example, Syt1 and Rbfox3 are broadly expressed across neurons in all cortical layers (Supplementary Fig. 3a). By contrast, Cux2, Cux1 and Satb2 were highly expressed in upper-layer neurons, whereas Bcl11b was enriched in the deeper cortical layers (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Oligodendrocytes (Mbp and Plp1) and fibrous astrocytes (Gfap) were specifically enriched in the corpus callosum and hippocampal regions (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). To further resolve cell identities, we integrated our spatial-DMT dataset with a reference scRNA-seq dataset44 to associate spatial clusters with previously defined cell types. For instance, W0, W3 and W5 were identified as oligodendrocytes, DG granule neurons and telencephalon-projecting excitatory neurons, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Aggregated gene-expression and DNA-methylation levels across pixels in each cluster were highly correlated with the corresponding scRNA-seq transcriptomes44 (Supplementary Fig. 4d) and single-cell DNA methylome profiles5 (Supplementary Fig. 4e), as illustrated by W3 (DG) and W5 (CA1) (Fig. 4b, right). Cell-type deconvolution using the same scRNA-seq reference44 revealed spatial organization of diverse cell types, consistent with known brain anatomy (Supplementary Fig. 4f). For example, cortical excitatory neurons showed expected laminar distribution: TEGLU7, TEGLU8, TEGLU4 and TEGLU3 were enriched in layers 2/3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. In the hippocampus, TEGLU24 and TEGLU23 mapped to CA1/2 and CA3 regions, whereas in granule neurons, DGGRC2 localized to the DG. Furthermore, DEGLU1 was enriched in the thalamic region. All cell types were mapped to expected brain anatomical regions in agreement with the scRNA-seq reference44. These observations underscore the robustness of spatial-DMT in resolving complex tissue architectures and simultaneously profiling the epigenome and transcriptome with their spatial context, which remains challenging for conventional anatomical and single-cell approaches.

The spatially resolved methylation landscape enables the identification of subtle, region-specific epigenetic variations that may otherwise be undetected. To illustrate this, we performed regional differential methylation analysis, comparing the ventricular and mantle zone of the hindbrain–spinal cord (Fig. 5a). This analysis identified differential methylation at promoters and enhancers specific to neural progenitor cells, as shown by the enrichment of corresponding methylated histone H3 K4 (H3K4me1). These differential methylated loci co-localized with enhancers functionally implicated in brain and neural tube development (mEnhA9), which are associated with TF binding sites crucial for neuronal differentiation, including for the TFs FOXO4 (ref. 45), NEUROG2 (ref. 46) and HOXC9 ref. 47).

Spatial methylation profiles may reveal subtle differences between distantly located pixels in the same WNN cell cluster. We examined two W7 pixel groups located in the forebrain and spinal cord, respectively (Fig. 5b). In the forebrain, regions with loss of methylation were enriched for binding sites of FOXI1, TFs crucial for auditory development48. By contrast, spinal-cord-specific hypomethylation correlated with occupancy by TLX1, a TF essential for spinal cord maturation and neuronal differentiation49. These findings demonstrate that spatial-DMT can resolve subtle epigenetic heterogeneity across distinct tissue microenvironments.

Besides capturing regional TF-mediated cell state differences, spatial-DMT enables the analysis of diverse cell traits through other methylation-based features. For example, partially methylated domains (PMDs), which lose methylation over successive mitotic divisions, serve as indicators of mitotic activity50. By spatially mapping PMD methylation in E11 and E13 embryos (Fig. 5c,d), we identified distinct regional patterns. For instance, regions such as the forebrain and hindbrain–spinal cord had higher PMD methylation, whereas embryonic heart tissue demonstrated lower PMD methylation levels, reflecting active cardiogenesis at these developmental stages51 (Fig. 5c,d). Notably, we observed spatial gradients in PMD methylation, decreasing from the centre to the periphery in the heart, and from the mantle to the ventricular zone in the forebrain and hindbrain–spinal cord. These gradients potentially reflect the spatial organization of progenitor cells and their differentiation trajectories. In the P21 brain (Fig. 5e), cortical layers displayed higher PMD methylation, consistent with reduced proliferative capacity typical of differentiated neurons52. By contrast, the DG has comparatively lower PMD methylation, consistent with the presence of neural stem and progenitor cells in the subgranular zone that continue to undergo mitotic division and neurogenesis53.

Finally, the spatially resolved variations in the methylome and transcriptome can complement each other in distinguishing differentiated cell states (Fig. 1f, left and middle). Despite originating from the same RNA-defined clusters (R3), DNA methylation-defined cluster 0 (D0) and 4 (D4) cells had distinct subpopulations when stratified by their VMRs. Motif enrichment analysis of low-methylation sites in D0 and D4 identified regulatory elements associated with facial and cardiac morphogenesis (Fig. 5f), whereas corresponding gene-expression changes were limited (Fig. 5g). This may reflect epigenetically primed subpopulations that share similar transcriptional states. Together, these findings highlight the power of spatial-DMT in delineating cell identity beyond the resolution of transcriptomic analysis alone.

Understanding how epigenetic regulation is spatially organized in tissues remains a major challenge. Although single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptomic technologies have revealed diverse regulatory architectures in both health and disease4,5,16, they require tissue dissociation, disrupting the native context. Here we developed spatial-DMT, a pioneering spatial multi-omics technology that enables simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same intact tissue sections, preserving cellular and anatomical architectures.

Spatial-DMT generated high-quality data, with strong reproducibility across technical replicates and concordance with established single-cell and spatial transcriptomic references. When applied to mouse embryos at E11 and E13, it revealed methylome dynamics during embryogenesis. In the postnatal brain, it resolved the neuronal mCH landscape, consistent with elevated mCA levels in mature neurons5. With 10 μm resolution, spatial-DMT approaches single-cell granularity, enabling precise delineation of fine tissue structures and region-specific epigenetic features that are typically obscured by tissue dissociation. Our data indicate that gene expression may be differentially influenced by mCG and mCA for different cell types in a spatially restricted manner, potentially owing to the distinct genomic distribution of these methylation marks. Although the observed associations are correlative, they offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between regulatory elements on gene expression. This integrative data analysis also demonstrated that each modality captures distinct yet complementary aspects of cellular states, enhancing cell state differentiation beyond what is achievable with single-modality approaches. This may reflect regulatory redundancy, in which distinct epigenetic mechanisms converge to produce similar transcriptional outcomes. Conversely, the opposite scenario is equally plausible—transcriptional states may diverge despite similar epigenetic landscapes, as epigenetic regulation represents only one layer influencing gene expression. As a result, spatial‐DMT offers a cost-effective strategy for high-resolution, unbiased genome-wide methylome analysis.

Future development of spatial-DMT may incorporate additional molecular modalities, including chromatin conformation (HiC), accessibility (ATAC-seq), histone modifications (CUT&Tag), metabolome (mass spectrometry imaging) and surface proteins (CITE-seq), to enhance the resolution of gene regulatory mechanisms in situ. The current enzymatic approach does not distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, this limitation may be overcome by using emerging methods that enable simultaneous measurement of the full spectrum of cytosine base modifications54. Coupling our method with long-read sequencing technologies, such as Nanopore or PacBio, could simplify detection and improve coverage of epigenetic modifications. Adaptation of the protocol to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens would broaden its clinical use, whereas optimizing tagmentation and data-processing pipelines will further improve sensitivity and interpretability. The development of advanced spatial computational deconvolution strategies is essential to resolve signals from lower-resolution pixels, minimize potential biases and enhance biological interpretability. Broader application across tissues, developmental stages and species will further establish the generalizability of spatial-DMT for spatial multi-omics profiling in both basic and translational research.

In summary, spatial-DMT advances spatial omics analyses by enabling the simultaneous mapping of DNA methylation and transcription in the native tissue context. This approach provides a powerful framework for exploring epigenetic regulation, facilitates the discovery of methylation biomarkers, deepens our understanding of disease mechanisms and benefits both fundamental and translational research.

Mouse C57 embryo sagittal frozen sections (MF-104-11-C57 and MF-104-13-C57) were purchased from Zyagen. Freshly collected E11 or E13 mouse embryos were snap frozen in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compounds and sectioned at 7–10 μm thickness. Tissue sections were collected on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 63478-AS).

Juvenile mouse brain tissue (P21) was obtained from the C57BL/6 mice housed in the University of Pennsylvania Animal Care Facilities under pathogen-free conditions. All procedures used were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Mice were euthanized at P21 using CO2 inhalation, followed by transcranial perfusion with cold Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS). After isolation, brains were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and snap frozen on dry ice and a 2-methylbutane bath. Coronal cryosections of 8–10 μm were mounted on the back of Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, 12-550-15).

Unloaded Tn5 transposome (C01070010) was purchased from Diagenode and the transposome was assembled following the manufacturer's guidelines. The oligonucleotides used for transposome assembly were: Tn5ME-B, 5′-/5Phos/CATCGGCGTACGACTAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-3′; Tn5MErev, 5′-/5Phos/CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT-3′.

DNA oligonucleotides used for PCR and library construction are shown in Supplementary Table 1. All DNA barcode sequences are provided in Supplementary Tables 2 (barcode A) and 3 (barcode B) and all other chemicals and reagents are listed in Supplementary Table 4.

Chrome photomasks were purchased from Front Range Photomasks, with a channel width of either 20 or 50 μm. The moulds for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices were fabricated using standard photolithography. The manufacturer's guidelines were followed to spin-coat SU-8-negative photoresist (Microchem, SU-2025 and SU-2010) onto a silicon wafer (WaferPro, C04004). The heights of the features were about 20 and 50 μm for 20- and 50-μm-wide devices, respectively. PDMS microfluidic devices were fabricated using the SU-8 moulds. We mixed the curing and base agents in a 1:10 ratio and poured the mixture onto the moulds. After degassing for 30 min, the mixture was cured at 66–70 °C for 2–16 h. Solidified PDMS was extracted from the moulds for further use. The detailed protocol for the fabrication and preparation of the PDMS device can be found in our previous research24.

Frozen tissue slides were quickly thawed for 1 min in a 37 °C incubator. The tissue was fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS containing 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) for 10 min and quenched with 1.25 M glycine for another 5 min at room temperature. After fixation, tissue was washed twice with 1 ml of DPBS–RNase inhibitor and cleaned with deionized H2O.

The tissue was subsequently permeabilized with 100 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor for 30 min at room temperature, then washed twice with 200 μl DPBS–RNase inhibitor for 5 min each. After permeabilization, the tissue was treated with 100 μl of 0.1 N HCl for 5 min at room temperature to disrupt histones from the chromatin, then washed twice with 200 μl of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20) plus 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 50 μl of transposition mixture (5 μl of assembled transposome, 16.5 μl of 1× DPBS, 25 μl of 2× Tagmentation buffer, 0.5 μl of 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl of 10% Tween 20, 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) and 1.87 μl nuclease-free water) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After 60 min incubation, the first round of transposition mixture was removed and a second round of 50 μl of fresh transposition mixture was added and incubated for another 60 min at 37 °C. To stop the transposition, 200 μl of 40 mM EDTA with 0.05 U ml−1 RNase inhibitor was added with incubation for 5 min at room temperature. After that, 200 μl 1× NEB3.1 buffer plus 1% RNase inhibitor was used to wash the tissue for 5 min at room temperature. The tissue was then washed again with 200 μl of DPBS–RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature before proceeding with the in situ reverse transcription reaction.

For the in situ reverse transcription, the following mixture was added: 12.5 μl 5× reverse transcription buffer, 4.05 μl RNase-free water, 0.4 μl RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics), 1.25 μl 50% PEG-8000, 3.1 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 6.2 μl 200 U μl−1 Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 25 μl 0.5× DPBS–RNase inhibitor and 10 μl 100 μM reverse transcription primer (biotinylated-dT oligo). The tissue was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then at 45 °C for 90 min in a humidified container. After the reverse transcription reaction, tissue was washed with 1× NEB3.1 buffer plus 1% RNase inhibitor for 5 min at room temperature.

For in situ ligation with the first barcode (barcode A), the first PDMS chip was covered at the tissue ROI. For alignment purposes, a 10× objective (KEYENCE BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope, BZ-X800 Viewer Software) was used to take the bright-field image. The PDMS device and tissue slide were clamped tightly with a custom acrylic clamp. Barcode A was first annealed with ligation linker 1 by mixing 10 μl of 100 μM ligation linker, 10 μl of 100 μM individual barcode A and 20 μl of 2× annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5–8.0, 100 mM NaCl2 and 2 mM EDTA). For each channel, 5 μl of ligation master mixture was prepared with 4 μl of ligation mixture (27 μl T4 DNA ligase buffer, 0.9 μl RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics), 5.4 μl 5% Triton X-100, 11 μl T4 DNA ligase and 71.43 μl RNase-free water) and 1 μl of each annealed DNA barcode A (A1–A50, 25 μM). Vacuum was applied to flow the ligation master mixture into the 50 channels of the device and cover the ROI of the tissue, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified container. Then the PDMS chip and clamp were removed after washing the tissue with 1× NEB 3.1 buffer for 5 min. The slide was then washed with deionized water and dried using compressed air.

For in situ ligation with the second barcode (barcode B), the second PDMS chip was covered at the ROI and a bright-field image was taken with the 10× objective. An acrylic clamp was applied to clamp the PDMS and tissue slide together. Annealing of barcode B (B1–B50, 25 μM) and preparation of the ligation mixture are the same as barcode A. The whole device was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified container. The PDMS chip and clamp were then removed, and the slide was washed with deionized water and dried using compressed air. A bright-field image was then taken for further alignment.

For tissue lysis, the ROI was digested with 100 μl of the reverse crosslinking mixture (0.4 mg ml−1 proteinase K, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 1% SDS) at 58–60 °C for 2 h in a humidified container. The lysate was then collected in a 0.2-ml PCR tube and incubated on a 60 °C shaker overnight.

For gDNA and cDNA separation, the lysate was purified with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit and eluted with 100 μl nuclease-free water. Next, 40 μl of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were used and washed three times with 1× B&W buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (50 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2,000 μl 5 M NaCl, 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 50 μl 10% Tween 20 and 7,890 μl nuclease-free water). After washing, beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× B&W buffer (50 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2,000 μl 5 M NaCl, 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA and 2,940 μl nuclease-free water) containing 2 μl of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor, then mixed with the gDNA–cDNA lysate and allowed to bind for 1 h with agitation at room temperature. A magnet was then used to separate the beads, which bind to the cDNA that contains dT, from the supernatant that contains the gDNA.

Supernatant (200 μl) was collected from the above separation process for further methylated gDNA detection and library construction. Next, 1 ml of DNA binding buffer was added to the 200 μl supernatant and purified with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit again, then eluted in 84 μl (3 × 28 μl) nuclease-free water. The NEBNext enzymatic methyl-seq conversion module (EM-seq) was then used to detect methylated DNA in the sample by converting unmethylated cytosines to uracil; the manufacturer's guidelines were followed. Then, 28 μl of DNA sample was aliquoted into each PCR tube, TET2 reaction mixture (10 μl TET2 reaction buffer containing reconstituted TET2 reaction buffer supplement, 1 μl oxidation supplement, 1 μl DTT, 1 μl oxidation enhancer and 4 μl TET2) was added to the DNA sample on ice. In brief, 5 μl of diluted 1:1,300 of 500 mM Fe (II) solution was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermocycler. After the reaction, the sample was transferred to ice and 1 μl of stop reagent from the kit was added. The sample was then incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. TET2 converted DNA was then purified with 90 μl of solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads and eluted with 16 μl nuclease-free water. The thermocycler was preheated to 85 °C, 4 μl formamide was added to the converted DNA and incubated for 10 min at 85 °C in the preheated thermocycler. After the reaction, the heated sample was immediately placed on ice to maintain the open chromatin structure, then reagents from the kit were added (68 μl nuclease-free water, 10 μl APOBEC reaction buffer, 1 μl BSA and 1 μl APOBEC) to deaminate unmethylated cytosines to uracil for 3 h at 37 °C in a thermocycler. Deaminated DNA was then cleaned up using 100 μl (1:1 ratio) of SPRI beads and eluted in 20 μl nuclease-free water.

The gDNA tube was heat-shocked for 3 min at 95 °C and immediately put on ice for 2 min. Then, 10 μl of 0.75 μM pre-annealed Splint Ligate P5 (SLP5) adapter was added. This adapter was diluted from a 12 μM stock, which contained 6 μl of 100 μΜ SLP5RC oligo, 8.4 μl of 100 μΜ SLS5ME-A-H10 oligo, 5 μl of 10× T4 RNA Ligase Buffer and 30.6 μl nuclease-free water in a PCR tube that was incubated at 95 °C for 1 min, then gradually cooled by −0.1 °C s−1 to 10 °C on a thermocycler. Next, 80 μl of ligation master mixture was added to the gDNA tube at room temperature. The mixture contained 40 μl preheated 50% PEG-8000, 12.5 μl SCR buffer (666 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 132 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water), 10 μl of 100 mM DTT, 10 μl of 10 mM ATP, 1.25 μl of 10,000 U ml−1 T4 PNK and 6.25 μl of 400,000 U ml−1 T4 ligase. The splint ligation mixture was then splinted into five 0.2-ml PCR tubes, 20 μl per tube. The tubes were shaken at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and spun down, then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by 20 min at 65 °C to inactivate the ligase. For splint ligation indexing PCR, 80 μl of the PCR reaction mixture was mixed in each splint ligated tube. The mixture contained 20 μl 5× VeraSeq GC Buffer, 4 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 3 μl VeraSeq Ultra Enzyme, 5 μl 20× EvaGreen dye, 2 μl of 10 μM N501 primer and 2 μl of 10 μM N70X-HT primer (Supplementary Table 1). The mixture was then aliquoted into a clean PCR tube with 50 μl volume and run on a thermocycler with the setting below, 98 °C for 1 min, then cycling at 98 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, for 13–19 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 10 s. The reaction was removed once the quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal began to plateau. The amplified PCR products were pooled and purified with a 0.8× volume ratio of SPRI beads (bead-to-sample ratio) and the completed DNA library was eluted in 15 μl nuclease-free water.

The separated beads containing cDNA were used for cDNA library generation. In brief, 400 μl of 1× B&W buffer with 0.05% Tween 20 was used to wash the beads twice. Then, the beads were washed once with 400 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min at room temperature. Streptavidin beads with bound cDNA molecules were placed on a magnetic rack and washed once with 250 μl nuclease-free water before being resuspended in a template switching oligonucleotide solution (44 μl 5× Maxima reverse transcription buffer, 44 μl of 20% Ficoll PM-400 solution, 22 μl of dNTPs, 5.5 μl of 100 mM template switch oligo, 11 μl Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase, 5.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (Enzymatics) and 88 μl nuclease-free water). Resuspended beads were then incubated for 30 min with agitation at room temperature and for 90 min at 42 °C, with gentle agitation. After the reaction, beads were washed with 400 μl of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 0.1% Tween 20 and washed without resuspension in 250 μl nuclease-free water. Water was removed on the magnetic rack and the beads were resuspended in the PCR solution (100 μl of 2× Kappa Master mix, 8.8 μl of 10 μM primers 1 and 2 and 92.4 μl nuclease-free water). Next, the beads were mixed well and 50 μl of the PCR mixture was split into four 0.2-ml PCR tubes. The PCR programme was run as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and cycling at 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 3 min, for a total of five cycles, followed by 4 °C on hold. After five cycles of PCR reaction, four PCR tubes were placed on a magnetic rack and 50 μl of the clear PCR solution was transferred to four optical-grade qPCR tubes, adding 2.5 μl of 20× Evagreen dye to each tube. The sample was run on a qPCR machine with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, cycling at 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 3 min, for 13–17 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The reaction was removed once the qPCR signal began to plateau. The amplified PCR product was purified with a 0.8× volume ratio of SPRI beads and eluted in 20 μl nuclease-free water.

A Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit was used for cDNA library preparation. In brief, 2 μl (2 ng) of purified cDNA (1 ng μl−1), 10 μl Tagment DNA buffer, 5 μl Amplicon Tagment mix and 3 μl nuclease-free water were mixed and incubated at 55 °C for 5 min. Then, 5 μl NT buffer was added to stop the reaction with incubation at room temperature for 5 min. PCR master mix (15 μl 2× N.P.M. Master mix, 1 μl of 10 μM P5 primer (N501) and 1 μl of 10 μM indexed P7 primer (N70X) and 8 μl nuclease-free water) was added. The PCR reaction was run with the following programme: 95 °C for 30 s, cycling at 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min, for a total of 12 cycles. The PCR product was then purified with a 0.7× ratio of SPRI beads and eluted in 15 μl nuclease-free water to obtain the cDNA library.

An Agilent Bioanalyzer D5000 ScreenTape was used to determine the size distribution and concentration of the library before sequencing. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and NovaSeq X Plus system (150 bp paired-end mode).

For RNA-sequencing data, Read 2 was processed to extract barcode A, barcode B and the UMIs. Using the STARsolo pipeline56 (v.2.7.10b), these processed data were mapped to the mouse genome reference (mm10). This step generated a gene matrix that captures both gene-expression and spatial-positioning information, encoded through the combination of barcodes A and B. The gene matrix was then imported into R for downstream spatial transcriptomic analysis using Seurat package (v.5.1.0)57.

For DNA-methylation data, adaptor sequences were trimmed before demultiplexing the FASTQ files using the combination of barcodes A and B. We used the BISulfite-seq CUI Toolkit (BISCUIT) (v.0.3.14)58 to align the DNA sequences to the mouse reference genome (mm10). Methylation levels at individual CG and CH sites were stored as continuous values between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of methylated reads after quality filtering. These processed CG–CH files were then analysed independently using the MethSCAn pipeline18 to identify VMRs59, defined as fused genome intervals with methylation-level variance in the top 2%. We used default parameter settings when running MethSCAn, and the MethSCAn filter min-sites parameter was determined from the read coverage knee plot (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The methylation levels and residuals of VMRs were then imported into R for downstream DNA-methylation analysis.

We mapped the exact location of pixels on the bright-field tissue image using a custom Python script (https://github.com/zhou-lab/Spatial-DMT-2024/tree/main/Data_preprocess/Image), before removing additional empty barcodes on the basis of read-count thresholds determined by the knee plot (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Clustering and data visualization were conducted using R in RStudio.

For RNA data, we used the SCTtransform function in the Seurat package (v.5.1.0), built using a regularized negative binomial model, for normalization and variance stabilization. Dimensionality reduction was performed using RunPCA function with the SCTtransformed assay. We then constructed the nearest-neighbour graph using the first 30 principal components with the FindNeighbors function and identified clusters with the default Leiden method in the FindClusters function. Finally, a UMAP embedding was computed using the same principal components with RunUMAP function.

Owing to the inherent sparsity of DNA-methylation data, it is impractical to analyse methylation status solely at the individual CpG level. Binary information at sparse loci cannot be used directly to construct a feature matrix suitable for downstream analysis. In our study, we adopted the VMR framework, which divides the genome into variable-sized tiles and calculates the average methylation level across CpGs in each tile for each pixel18. This approach results in a continuous-valued matrix, in which rows correspond to pixels and columns represent genomic tiles, with values ranging from 0 to 1. VMR methylation levels and residuals were then imputed using the iterative principal component analysis approach as suggested in the MethSCAn instructions. Initially, missing residual values were replaced with zero and missing methylation levels were replaced with the average values for that VMR interval. The principal component analysis approach was iteratively applied until updated values stabilized to a threshold. The imputed residual matrix for VMRs was then imported into the existing Seurat object as another modality. Similar to the RNA-clustering pipeline, dimensionality was reduced using the RunPCA function. The first ten principal components from the residual matrix were used for clustering and UMAP embedding.

To visualize clusters in their spatial locations, the SpatialDimPlot function was used after clustering on the basis of gene expression or VMR residuals. UMAP embedding was visualized with the DimPlot function. The FindMarkers function was applied to select genes and VMRs that were differentially expressed or methylated for each cluster. For spatial mapping of individual VMR methylation levels or gene expression, we applied the smoothScoresNN function from the FigR package60. The SpatialFeaturePlot function was then used to visualize VMR methylation levels and gene expression across all pixels. To illustrate the relationships between clustering results from different modalities, we generated the confusion matrix and alluvial diagram using the pheatmap and ggalluvial R package61.

To integrate spatial DNA methylation and RNA data, WNN analysis in Seurat was applied using the FindMultiModalNeighbors function19. On the basis of the WNN graph, clustering, UMAP embedding and spatial mapping of identified clusters were performed for integrated visualization.

For the integration of spatial transcriptomics data of E11 and E13 mouse embryos, the top 3,000 integration features were selected, followed by the use of PrepSCTIntegration and IntegrateData functions to generate an integrated dataset. Similarly, to integrate with public single-cell transcriptomic data25,44, we first identified anchors using the FindIntegrationAnchors function in Seurat, followed by data integration using the IntegrateData function. To integrate DNA-methylation data, common VMRs between both developmental stages were obtained and the integrated CCA method from the IntegrateLayers function was used to join the methylation data from the two developmental stages. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare the methylation levels and gene-expression differences between the two time points.

To perform TF motif enrichment, we first used the MethSCAn diff function on distinct groups of cells to identify differentially methylated VMRs on the basis of the clustering assignment. The HOMER62 findMotifsGenome function was then applied to analyse the enrichment of known TF motifs using its default database. We followed the same parameter settings used in MethSCAn, with motif lengths of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

Enrichment analysis of individual CpGs in the differential regions (Fig. 5a,b) was performed using knowYourCG (https://github.com/zhou-lab/knowYourCG), which provides a comprehensive annotation database for each CpG, including chromatin states, TF binding sites, motif occurrences, PMD annotations and more. To avoid inflated odds ratios for high-coverage data, genomic uniformity was quantified using fold enrichment, defined as the ratio of observed overlaps to expected overlaps. The expected number of overlaps was calculated as: (number of CpGs sequenced × number of CpGs in the chromatin state feature)/total number of CpGs in the genome.

Correlation analysis was performed for different clusters. We first used the findOverlaps function in GenomicRanges package (v.4.4)63 to map VMRs to overlapped genes. Then, the Pearson correlation test was applied to obtain the correlation between mapped genes and corresponding VMRs. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust all P values.

GO enrichment analysis was conducted using the enrichGO function from clusterProfiler package64 (v.4.2). For GO enrichment in the comparative analysis of E11 and E13 mouse embryos, the FindMarkers function in Seurat package was used to find differential genes and VMRs in the same cluster from integrated data across two developmental stages. Differentially upregulated genes (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05) with demethylated VMRs were used for the GO analysis.

The diagram illustrates the chemistry workflow for simultaneous DNA methylation and RNA library preparation in Spatial-DMT. Initially, tissue sections are fixed and permeabilized to preserve tissue architecture and molecular integrity while allowing reagent penetration. Following permeabilization, sections undergo HCl treatment to disrupt the protein structure and remove nucleosome histones to improve Tn5 transposome accessibility. Next, Tn5 transposition integrates adapters into genomic DNA, and in situ reverse transcription (RT) converts mRNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) directly within the tissue. Subsequently, Barcode A and Barcode B are sequentially ligated to label and spatially encode DNA and mRNA molecules. Streptavidin bead separation then facilitates the differential enrichment and processing of nucleic acids: cDNA molecules undergo a template switching reaction, followed by Nextera XT library preparation, while genomic DNA (gDNA) is subjected to NEBNext EM-seq conversion for methylation detection, splint ligation, and subsequent library construction.

The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons3,4,5,6. However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.

This study combines a temporal transect of the Elbe-Saale region in Eastern Germany with the wide-angle view of large-scale demographic and cultural transformations that emerged similarly in other Eastern and Central European regions. Traditionally, on the basis of historical writings, this transformation is attributed to the emigration of ‘Germanic' peoples from East-Central Europe and the arrival of a new population that contemporaries described as ‘Slavs'. These newcomers emerged after the dissolution of the Western Roman empire and mark the transition between the Migration Period (MP, late fourth to late sixth century) and the Slavic Period (SP, from the sixth or seventh century onwards).

At least since the first century bce, the lands between the Rhine and Vistula River were settled by numerous peoples and tribes for whom Roman observers used the umbrella term ‘Germani'7. These Germanic peoples were in contact with the Roman Empire west of the Rhine and south of the Danube, and since the late second century ce increasingly raided Roman provinces8,9. In the MP, many of them left and settled on Roman territory7,8,9,10, among them Vandals, Goths, Franks and Longobards11,12. The Thuringians stayed and established a kingdom, which included the Elbe-Saale region13,14. After the Franks subdued this kingdom10,15 in the 530s, the population declined, while some cemeteries continued14,16. During the seventh century, Slavs are first mentioned east of the Saale, but they soon expanded westward17, forming a contact zone between Slavic- and Germanic-speaking groups.

The term Slavs first appears as an ethnonym in the course of the sixth century in Constantinople and later in the west (Box 1 and Supplementary Note 1.1). Written sources locate them initially north of the Lower Danube, and later in the Carpathian Basin, the Balkans and the Eastern Alps1,2 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Many came under the rule of the Avar steppe empire along the Middle Danube (567 ce to around 800 ce). In the seventh century, there is evidence for the presence of Slavs in much of East-Central and Southeastern Europe. Where Slavs lived, Roman, Germanic and other pre-Slavic infrastructures were usually replaced by rather simple ways of life, archaeologically characterized by small settlements of pit houses, cremation burials, handmade, undecorated pottery and modest, low-metal material culture18, known as the Prague-Korchak group3,4. (Supplementary Note 1.2). More complex social systems and regional rulership developed later in the contact zones with Byzantium and the Christian west.

The similarity of early Slavic cultures was often attributed to a swift spread of Slavs from Northeast of the Carpathians, although debates continue, not only about their geographical origin (Supplementary Note 1,1). In Poland19, the non-native (allochthonist) view assumes Slavic origin from Ukraine–Belarus18, whereas the native (autochthonist) concept asserts that their ancestors inhabited Polish territory since the Bronze Age. Some scholars doubt Slavic expansion by migrations and assume that there was ‘Slavicisation' of existing populations5,18,20,21,22,23,24,25 (Supplementary Note 1,2). Previous modern26 and ancient DNA studies have supported gene flow into the Northern Balkans27 and the Russian Volga-Oka region28, but also argued for population continuity in Poland29, so that the scale and sequence of these movements and their association with ‘Slavic' material culture has remained unclear. Eventually, this cultural transformation led to the replacement of Germanic and other languages in East-Central and Southeastern Europe and the introduction of Slavic languages, which today represent the largest linguistic group in Europe30. Yet, this presumed joint spread of language and material culture is difficult to trace, given that the first longer texts in Slavic were written in the late ninth century5,31.

Together with previously published data from Roman and early medieval Europe27,28,29, the newly analysed ancient DNA from the Elbe-Saale region and complementary data transects from the Northwestern Balkans, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine identify large-scale population movement and a major demographic shift. This can be linked to historical information about the spread of Slavic groups in the sixth to eighth centuries and provides a plausible vector for the spread of Slavic languages across much of Eastern Europe21,23,32.

We selected skeletal remains from 591 ancient individuals from 26 different sites from Central and Eastern Europe (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), creating, in combination with previously published data, a dense sampling transect for three regions: (1) Elbe-Saale Region in Eastern Germany as the main study area; (2) the Northwestern Balkans; and (3) Poland–Northwestern Ukraine (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 7–10). Complementary to these three transects, we generated new data and collected published data from the Baltics and Northwestern Russia to form a reference transect in the east. After hybridization DNA capture and quality filtering (Methods), genome-wide data for 555 unique individuals with a median coverage of 538k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (on 1240k data) were available for analysis, including 359 ancient individuals from the SP, as well as 205 individuals predating the cultural transformations connected to the emergence of the Slavs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We analyse the ancient genome-wide data (Supplementary Table 11) together with an extended dataset of more than 11,500 present-day Europeans (Supplementary Table 3), covering all major Slavic-speaking groups, including data from more than 600 individuals belonging to the Sorbian minority in Eastern Germany33.

a, We assign newly reported (n = 550) and published genomic data (n = 723) to three study transects: the Northwestern Balkans (n = 301) (orange to yellow), Elbe-Saale region (Eastern Germany) (n = 483) (light and dark red), and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine (n = 489) (light and dark blue). We further analyse newly reported and published data from the Baltics as well as the Russian Volga-Oka region as reference, in total covering 1,840 ancient individuals. The size of the symbols corresponds to the number of individuals per site.

We selected samples from all three study regions that predate and postdate the transition to the SP. Circles, MP samples; squares, SP samples; diamonds, Bronze Age samples; triangles, present-day samples.

To visualize genome-wide ancestry diversity before and after the spread of Slavic groups, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on 10,528 present-day Europeans and projected our newly reported and other relevant ancient genome-wide data onto their genetic variation (Fig. 2). When comparing the SP samples to earlier and present-day data from our three study regions, we observe that the genetic composition within the transects changed markedly between about 600 and 800 ce. In general, the Roman and MP samples that predate the arrival of Slavic groups show high genetic heterogeneity in PCA space, with most samples from Germany and Poland29,34 clustering with present-day continental Northern German, Dutch and Scandinavian populations (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 6, 7, 10 and 12), whereas the Roman and MP individuals from Croatia34 cluster with present-day Italian and Eastern Mediterranean populations (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Note 3).

In Eastern Germany and the Northwestern Balkans, most of the genetic diversity within the Roman and MP clusters follows a north–south cline along PC1. For the Northwestern Balkans, this heterogeneity has been attributed to increasing Eastern Mediterranean ancestry that arrived subsequently to the incorporation of the region into the Roman Empire27,35. More unexpectedly, we detect a high number of MP individuals with non-local, Southern European ancestry in the Elbe-Saale region of Eastern Germany, although this area was never part of the Roman Empire. Using qpAdm36,37, we measure on average between approximately 15% and 25% of Southern European ancestry in all 4 MP sites of the region (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Both PCA-based MOBEST38 analysis and F4 statistics indicate that this non-local ancestry was most probably derived from contemporaneous source populations in Italy and/or the Northern Balkan Peninsula (or other areas of the Roman Empire where people of this ancestry were located) (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5). Previous studies already identified mixed communities of northern and southern ancestry in Hungary and Northern Italy that were interpreted as amalgamation between Northern European newcomers and the local romanized population39,40. In contrast to these earlier results, we do not find evidence that the two different ancestries were correlated to differences in material culture (Supplementary Table 4). Applying a generalized linear model, we demonstrate that neither the presence of grave goods overall, nor certain types of artefacts (such as weapons or brooches) are significantly correlated with either PCA position or ADMIXTURE profiles (Supplementary Fig. 60). Instead, we find the only significant (P < 0.05) correlation between ancestry and material culture among the burial constructions, where we show that individuals buried in pits feature on average higher Northern European ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 60c). The spatial organization of the burials was also not determined by similarity in ancestry. Instead, we observe that individuals were buried close to their biological relatives, within small kin groups composed of individuals with Northern European, Southern European or mixed ancestry, reflecting a high degree of admixture between individuals with different ancestry backgrounds during the MP. Consequently, our data from Eastern Germany demonstrate that the cosmopolitan character of the Roman Empire not only affected the incorporated territories but also facilitated exchange and mobility along its borders and beyond into barbarian lands (Barbaricum), resulting in an unprecedented genetic diversity in Central Europe during34 and, in the case of Eastern Germany, even after its existence. Although the causes and circumstances of their movement to the Elbe-Saale region remain open for speculation, these newcomers apparently adapted the fashions and traditions of the local populations, resulting in a rather homogenous material culture within a group of individuals with diverse genetic backgrounds.

However, this diversity had collapsed in the subsequent SP (Supplementary Note 6). In contrast to the preceding MP, the genetic profile of Eastern Germany during the SP has shifted considerably and clusters nearly exclusively with present-day Slavic-speaking populations (for example, Poles and Belarussians), indicative of a fundamental replacement of genetic ancestry (Fig. 2b,c). A similar pattern is seen in the Northwestern Balkans, Poland–Northwestern Ukraine as well as the Volga-Oka region in Russia28, illustrating that this influx of new genetic material was not limited to certain regions but affected wide areas of Central and Eastern Europe, consistent with the rather simple, very similar archaeological horizons observed during the SP (Supplementary Figs. 10–12). To formally test whether these patterns observed from PCA are consistent with gene-flow events from the east into our study regions, we used F-statistics to quantify genetic affinities of SP individuals to preceding MP and succeeding present-day groups (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Tables 17–19). The divergence between pre-Slavic and Slavic-associated groups is verified both in the distribution of genetic distances (FST) (Supplementary Fig. 19) as well as shared alleles (F4) (Supplementary Figs. 17–20) (Supplementary Note 4.2). Both on the population and the individual scale, SP individuals from all three study regions uniformly show less genetic affinity to the preceding local populations than to ancient and present-day groups from Eastern Europe and Baltics (Supplementary Figs. 34–38 and Supplementary Notes 4.2 and 4.4.1).

Error bars indicate 2 × s.d. b, Supervised ADMIXTURE modelling for the study regions. Ancient and present-day samples (n = 1,344) decomposed into 12 ancestral ancestry components. For different time periods, individual results were averaged and plotted according to their mean date. Influx of specific ancestries mentioned in the text are indicated using arrows. Relevant Y chromosome haplogroups associated with these autosomal ancestries are highlighted. Made with Natural Earth. c, Average sum of IBD segments (sIBD (in cM)) shared between nine ancient MP and SP groups. For all pairs of populations, the sum of IBD segments longer than 12 cM shared between members was calculated and normalized to the total number of pairs. The sums are depicted as symmetrical matrix. Hierarchical cluster analysis applying Ward's minimum variance method to the columns is added as a dendrogram.

Our results reveal that SP individuals display Baltic or Northeastern European-related ancestry that was previously absent in the three study regions. To quantitatively estimate this influx, we decomposed ancestral sources using a supervised clustering approach implemented in the software ADMIXTURE41. Specifically, we assembled modern populations into 12 metapopulations that serve as proxies for the source ancestries in Central Europe (Methods and Supplementary Note 4.1). Applying our ancestry decomposition to the ancient genome-wide data, we find that (despite differences in the local trajectories) Northeastern European ancestry (BAL, represented by present-day individuals from Belarus, Lithuania and Latvia) was either completely absent or only a minor ancestry component throughout most of prehistory in our study transects (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 3), accounting for 6 ± 2%, 5 ± 1% and 7 ± 2% of the total MP ancestry in the Northwestern Balkans, Eastern Germany and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine, respectively. However, consistent with PCA (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c) and F4 statistics (Fig. 3a–c), BAL ancestry increased after 600 ce and became the largest ancestry component in all three study regions, reaching 47 ± 2%, 65 ± 1% and 63 ± 2%, respectively, during the SP. Outside our three study transects, we furthermore identify a major surge of BAL ancestry (from 0% in the MP to approximately 27%) in the Avar-associated population of Mödling, Austria42, confirming an early arrival in the Pannonian Basin in the seventh century ce as reported by written sources, followed by substantial admixture with local groups (Extended Data Fig. 4). Only in Northwestern Russia do we detect a different trajectory: in the Volga-Oka area, the Slavic transition coincides with a significant decrease of BAL ancestry (from 65 ± 2% to 55 ± 7%), suggesting that the SP newcomers originated from a region further to the west of the Volga-Oka area where they incorporated additional ancestry not local to Eastern Europe.

The source for the incoming Northeastern European ancestry appears to be the same in all four regions. To showcase this shared descent, we applied ancIBD43 to identify segments that are identical by descent (IBD) that are shared between the MP and SP populations. We highlight that SP groups in Croatia, Eastern Germany and Poland–Ukraine share comparably large amounts of IBD with each other, despite the vast geographic distance between the three study regions, but share nearly no segments with the preceding populations (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 37). This IBD-sharing signal, including a large fraction of segments longer than 16 cM, clearly indicates that ancient individuals from Slavic-associated contexts descend from a common source population that migrated westwards and southwards at most a few generations earlier across Central Europe (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 10). Such evidence for large-scale population movement also explains the previously detected pattern of high levels of sharing of IBD between present-day pairs of individuals across Eastern Europe44 (Supplementary Fig. 56) and rejects the idea that this signal was caused predominantly by consistently low population densities45.

To obtain a finer-scale characterization of genetic ancestries across space and time, we applied a hierarchical cluster detection approach to a network of around 2,500 individuals constructed from these pairwise IBD-sharing similarities (Supplementary Table 38 and Supplementary Note 4.3.2). We identify a large IBD-sharing community that contains most of our new and published SP individuals as well as multiple other contemporary samples from Central and Southeastern Europe. Within this larger cluster, we identify two distinct sub-communities: one primarily includes SP individuals from north of the Carpathian Mountains, whereas the other comprises individuals buried further south. This separation may reflect two geographically diverging waves of expansion or different patterns of incorporation of the local populations (Extended Data Fig. 5). Yet, at least sporadic gene flow from Eastern Europe into Pannonia and the Balkans must have already occurred during the Iron Age and Roman Period, as we identify a substantial number of individuals within the SP cluster buried in Austria, Hungary, Serbia and Montenegro during the time period from 500 bce to 300 ce, predating the large-scale population movements of the sixth and seventh centuries (Supplementary Figs. 29a, 32a,b and 33).

Using newly generated early medieval data from the Polish site Gródek, Hrubieszów County, near the Ukrainian border, which represents some of the oldest Slavic inhumation burials from Poland (dating between the seventh and ninth centuries ce), as a proximal source (both in time and space) for the incoming BAL-enriched ancestry, we calculate using qpAdm that approximately 82 ± 1%, 83 ± 6%, 93 ± 3% and 65 ± 4% of the local gene pool in the Northwestern Balkans, Eastern Germany, Poland–Northwestern Ukraine and the Volga-Oka valley, respectively, were replaced during the SP by migrants from Eastern Europe (referred here to as ‘SP ancestry'; Methods) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Tables 47 and 51). These results contradict a model of substantial population continuation from the Iron Age or MP to the Middle Ages in present-day Western and Central Poland, where previous research claimed an autochthonous origin of the SP gene pool29,46,47 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Yet more samples are needed to assess the overall degree of genetic replacement over the larger area. Applying qpAdm to model present-day groups using ancient source populations, we show that Eastern European ancestry is the dominant genetic component in all Slavic-speaking populations today and is also found in neighbouring non-Slavic-speaking groups in Central Europe and regions bordering to the south (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 5). We measure the highest proportions of Eastern European ancestry in present-day Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, from where it gradually decreases to the east and south (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 41). Notably, we observe a profound duality to the west, in Eastern Germany, with the present-day German-speaking population from Saxony exhibiting around 40% SP ancestry and the Slavic-speaking Sorbs of Upper Lusatia (Saxony) exhibiting 88% SP ancestry (comparable to modern Poles) (Extended Data Fig. 7). This agrees with previous studies on the genetic isolation of the Sorbs33,48 and is consistent with them representing the descendants of these Slavic groups that were minimally (or at least less) integrated into the reproductive networks of the expanding German-speaking settlement east of Elbe and Saale from the twelfth century onwards49,50,51. Conversely, we suggest that the German eastward expansion and earlier Frankish conquest is probably associated with the reduction in SP ancestry observed in the German-speaking population.

This is supplemented by five lines of evidence: (A) ancient and present-day groups from the Baltics show the highest genetic similarity to SP individuals; (B) Bronze Age and Iron Age individuals from Estonia, Ingria and Karelia are less related to SP individuals than groups from Lithuania and Latvia; (C) populations in Western Russia feature too high proportions of Steppe and/or Siberian ancestry; (D) SP individuals are enriched in EEF and depleted in WHG ancestry compared with Bronze Age and Iron Age populations from the Baltics; (E) Putative migration directions inferred using pairwise mean sIBD sharing values between SP sites77 (n > 2).

Both F4 and FST statistics identify the highest genetic similarity between SP individuals and present-day populations from the Baltics, Poland and Belarus (Supplementary Figs. 17–22). These are also the regions where BAL and SP ancestry (here approximated by medieval samples from Gródek) are maximized today and where the highest proportions of R1a haplotypes (specifically R1a-M458 and R1a-M558) are found among the male population. In patterns of haplotype sharing between the ancient and modern individuals, this similarity was mirrored in a distinctive IBD signal (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs. 23–25): SP individuals from all three study regions share more and longer IBD fragments with Eastern Europeans than with any other Eurasian group, establishing direct genetic relatedness between present-day Balto-Slavic speakers and SP individuals in Central and Southeastern Europe (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 4.3.1). This pattern of excess affinity to Northern and Northeastern Europeans is not only evident in the comparison with present-day data but also in the archaeogenetic record: Comparing the SP individuals to other ancient samples, we show that they, independent of their geographic origin, share the highest drift and largest sum of IBD with Bronze and Iron Age groups from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia52,53, and are (as shown by F-statistics) more closely related to these individuals than to any other population in post-Neolithic Europe (for IBD see Supplementary Fig. 32c; for F3 and F4 see Supplementary Figs. 34–38; Supplementary Note 4.4.1).

Yet, in contrast to the Bronze Age Baltic samples, we note that SP individuals from all study regions exhibit substantially less Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) and more early European farmer (EEF) ancestry (Supplementary Figs. 41 and 42a and Supplementary Note 4.4.2). This suggests that the SP groups in Central Europe were already admixed, most probably between a WHG and Steppe ancestry-enriched Baltic Bronze Age-related source from the sub-Neolithic forest zone and at least one EEF-enriched source from the south. Using qpAdm, we identify various groups in Southeastern and East-Central Europe that constitute working proxies for such an EEF-enriched donor, yet we are not able to precisely identify the most likely representative (Supplementary Fig. 43). Across all fitting two-way models (P > 0.01) (and most non-fitting), the admixture proportions are highly similar, with the Eastern German and Polish-Northwestern Ukrainian SP samples receiving around 71% Baltic (95% confidence interval: 66.5%–76%) and around 29% (95% confidence interval: 24%–33.5%) EEF-enriched ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 43b and Supplementary Table 34). However, we highlight that the demographic trajectories that led to the formation of the SP gene pool were potentially more complex than a simple two-way admixture event. Although we calculate similar estimates of Baltic Bronze Age-derived ancestry applying a non-negative least squares approach based on PCA- and ADMIXTURE results54, mirroring previous results from genome-wide genealogies55, all models profit from the inclusion of an additional Western European source (Supplementary Figs. 40, 45 and 46). Thus, which vector population(s) ultimately transmitted EEF-enriched ancestry to the Northeast cannot be resolved fully for now (Supplementary Note 4.4.2-3).

Assuming a two-way admixture process, using DATES (distribution of ancestry tracts of evolutionary signals)56 we obtained an average date of approximately 1000 bce for this admixture event that formed the SP gene pool (972 bce ± 250 for Niederwünsch and 906 bce ± 362 for Poland_EMA, respectively) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 35). Of note, these DATES estimates overlap with the more recent part of the distribution of divergence estimates between Baltic and Slavic languages (Fig. 4b). Both phylogenetic analysis of cognate-coded basic vocabulary data (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8) and most Indo-European linguists date the disintegration of Proto-Balto-Slavic57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64 to the second millennium bce57,64. However, since the Bayesian linguistic estimates are on average shifted a few centuries older than the admixture estimates, we highlight the possibility that the admixing Baltic-related groups spoke a language that had already begun to diverge from the language or dialect continuum of the populations further north, the former eventually becoming the Slavic languages and the latter the (present-day) Baltic languages. To identify the most plausible geographic location for this initial formation of the SP gene pool, we applied MOBEST to perform spatiotemporal interpolation of the genetic affinities of SP individuals from the study regions to approximately 5,660 previously published ancient samples from Western Eurasia, obtaining similarity probabilities across Europe that can be interpreted as proxies for geographical origin at a specific time. We set the prediction time to 1,950 years before the present, providing us the most likely origin of an individual at this time point (and thus before the demographic transition in Central Europe). Averaging the probability surfaces, we infer a region spanning the south of Belarus and north of Ukraine as the best spatial proxy for the origin of the SP individuals in our three study transects (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34). Such a range would agree well with the area where many linguists propose the earliest development of Slavic languages and archaeologists locate the origin of Slavic-associated material culture5 (Supplementary Fig. 44); however, more ancient DNA (aDNA) data are needed to conclusively assess the genetic landscape of this region.

From there, Northeastern European ancestry is likely to have spread east, west and south, admixing with or even replacing the local gene pools (Fig. 4a). Although we cannot precisely measure the onset of this expansion or its duration, we highlight that DATES estimates for admixture between local and immigrant ancestries in SP individuals are generally recent and similar across the study transects, consistent with admixture processes starting in the sixth and early seventh century and agreeing with historically recorded arrival dates of Slavic groups in these regions (Extended Data Fig. 1). The detection of substantial genetic introgression from the northeast into regions in which Slavic came to be spoken26,27,44,65,66 indicates that the diffusion of Slavic language and Eastern European-derived ancestry were related, although the degree of their overlap cannot be ascertained. This provides a plausible explanation for the high genetic relatedness across present-day Slavic-speaking groups26,44, which was previously linked to the spread of the Slavic languages44,65. However, we highlight that such a simplified model does not capture the more complex regional dynamics that emerge from historical and archaeological evidence, and are still evident in language boundaries that do not correspond to genetic differences across the Balkans and Central Europe66. To investigate possible sex biases in these expansion and admixture processes, we compared estimates of SP-related ancestry on the X chromosomes and the autosomes to identify proportion differences indicative of male-biased admixture (Fig. 4c). Notably, we find no evidence for sex bias in any of the SP populations in Germany, Croatia, Poland or Russia (|z | <2; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 47). However, we observe that the previously undetected gene flow of Southern European-related ancestry into the MP population of Eastern Germany was significantly female-biased in most studied sites (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 59d).

The Slavic groups that we studied also showed fundamentally different social organization compared with the preceding MP population (Supplementary Note 8). Most notably, we highlight more intense inter-site and intra-site genetic relatedness in the Elbe-Saale region (Extended Data Fig. 2c), reflected by patrilineally organized pedigrees that comprise large numbers of individuals (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10a,b). The cemeteries of the preceding MP in Eastern Germany were characterized by small units of biological relatedness, mostly consisting of fewer than four first- and second-degree relatives. At the site level, we identified for each individual an average of 1.16 ± 0.18 close relatives (here defined as all relationships up to third degree) (in Brücken specifically: 0.64 ± 0.14; Supplementary Fig. 62). This pattern is also mirrored in IBD sharing within sites (which also captures distant genetic relatedness greater than third degree), with the proportion of pairs of individuals that share any IBD larger than 12 cM ranging between 1 ± 0.4%, 6.8 ± 1.8% and 5.2 ± 1.8% in Brücken, Deersheim and Obermöllern, respectively.

By contrast, during the SP, we show that the number of close relatives at the sites increased nearly sixfold to 6.41 ± 0.4%. We even observe one case of seven offspring from the same couple (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10b). Notably, four of the seven siblings had reached reproductive age, with three of them having offspring. As most of them were male, we can assume that several grown-up daughters might had gone elsewhere to marry. Moreover, the majority of offspring being male points towards additional unsampled female siblings (to statistically account for an equivalent number of females born). Notably, for all unions (in which at least one parent was identified on site), we find 52 sons (62% of the offspring; 95% confidence interval: 51–72%) but only 32 daughters (38% of the offspring; 95% confidence interval: 28–49%) (exact binomial test; P = 0.03753).

More distant genetic relationships also increased. For Niederwünsch and Steuden (approximately 8 km apart), 18.3 ± 0.6% and 15.3 ± 2.1% of the pairs of individuals share IBD fragments indicative of recent common descent (more than 12 cM apart). Although occupation periods in MP sites were shorter than in Niederwünsch (preventing the emergence of large-pedigree structures), the rather short-lived site of Steuden demonstrates that the differences in intra-community relatedness between MP and SP cemeteries were not caused exclusively by differences in the duration of site occupation.

Although these extensive kinship networks evidenced a high degree of relatedness among all individuals within sites, we do not find a single case of close consanguinity (defined here as offspring of first cousin unions or closer) (Supplementary Fig. 54d). This shows profound knowledge of the lineages and deliberate avoidance of consanguinity. We also identify at least 11 cases of individuals reproducing with multiple partners, pointing to polygamy or serial monogamy. Despite a 2.7:1 ratio of half-siblings sharing the same father (95% confidence interval: 0.43–0.91) versus those sharing the same mother (95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.57), we do not find a single instance of levirate marriages as practiced in late Avar-period communities in the Carpathian Basin67.

In parallel with the increase of genetic interconnectedness within the sites, we also observe that the organization of the cemeteries changed, reflecting in the spatial layout the extended pedigrees. Although close relatives were buried significantly closer together than non-related individuals in both the MP and the SP, only during the SP did cemeteries feature a significant correlation between genetic and spatial distances, suggesting that the cemeteries were planned and structured around these larger kin groups (Mantel statistic based on Spearman's rank correlation; P = 0.0001 for both Niederwünsch and Steuden) (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Figs. 63 and 65). This signal is most prominent in the site of Steuden, where at least 27% of all variance in spatial distances between graves is explained by genetic relatedness.

Although the sex ratio of adults across the SP sites is balanced (Exact binomial test; P = 1 for Steuden, P = 0.08794 for Niederwünsch), females have on average significantly fewer close relatives than males (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.008) and feature overall an increased pairwise mismatch rate compared with males (Wilcoxon rank sum test; test statistic (W) = 13,976,553, P = 0.04218; Supplementary Fig. 67) and a lower sum of IBD segments shared within sites (Welch two-sample t-test; t = −3.707, d.f. = 355.82, P = 0.0002431) (Extended Data Fig. 10c). However, females share more IBD segments between different sites than males, thereby demonstrating higher inter-site relatedness among females in contrast to higher intra-site relatedness among males (Welch two-sample t-test; t = 2.9513, d.f. = 64.952, P = 0.004398) (Extended Data Fig. 10c).

This demonstrates that exogenous origin was more common for females than for males, suggesting a patrilocal inheritance organization, and agrees well with the nearly exclusively patrilineally organized pedigrees (for example, 88% patrilineal lineages (95% confidence interval: 68–97%) versus 12% matrilineal lineages (95% confidence interval: 4–32%)) and the significant underrepresentation of female offspring at the sites (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10b and Aupplementary Fig. 54). Across all SP sites in Eastern Germany, we find only one instance of mitochondrial haplogroups being transmitted further than one daughter generation. This contrasts with the preceding MP population, for which we detect no difference in the number of close relatives between males and females (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.74) and no difference in pairwise mismatch rate in general (Wilcoxon rank sum test; W = 3,215,752, P = 0.06), potentially suggesting a less strictly patrilineal social system before the arrival of Slavic groups (Supplementary Fig. 67). However, owing to the overall smaller number of identified relatives, these tests might be less statistically conclusive and underestimate signals of MP female exogamy and patrilineal practices.

Patterns of patrilocal organization into kin groups are broadly similar across regions and might have contributed to the previously described turnover and homogenization of the paternal gene pool (Extended Data Fig. 10b). In particular, we find an identical pattern of correlation of spatial and genetic distances in SP Velim, Croatia (Mantel statistic based on Spearman's rank correlation; P = 0.0001; Supplementary Figs. 64 and 65d) as well as evidence for patrilocality and female exogamy (for example, more close biological relatives among males than among females (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.027) and higher pairwise mismatch rates among females compared to males (Wilcoxon rank sum; W = 156,550, P = 0.02377; Supplementary Fig. 67g–i)), mirroring the social stratification observed in the Elbe-Saale region. By contrast, at Velim the mean number of close relatives in the site is significantly lower than in Niederwünsch or Steuden (1.01 ± 0.17). Within a shared pattern of patrilocality, SP fine-scale organization differed substantially across Central Europe owing to the complex, regionally contingent nature of this expansion. Rather than simple replacement, partial integration of the local population was probably dependent on the fortunes of specific groups or families. However, the substantial number of individuals from sites across Eastern Germany, Croatia and Poland–Northwestern Ukraine who share comparably large amounts of IBD with each other confirms that these Slavic-associated groups were closely linked as the result of a shared biological origin and recent geographical expansion.

Here we present several results in a wide chronological and topographical range, based on fine-grained genetic transect studies of a number of complete cemeteries. Across Central Europe, we show that during the Roman Iron Age and subsequent MP genetic diversity increased not only within the empire, but also outside it. Southeastern Europe experienced an influx from the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas large parts of East-Central Europe were inhabited by people mainly related to modern inhabitants of Northern and Northwestern Europe. We also show a fifth and sixth century admixture of Mediterranean ancestry in Eastern Germany, prevalently but not exclusively through females. They and their offspring became well-integrated in the regional societies, and their burials show no signs of inferior status or cultural differences, a finding very different from those at early medieval cemeteries in Hungary, Italy39 and England68 with respect to incoming Northern versus local, Southern and Western European ancestry. Yet, after the fall of the Thuringian kingdom this diverse population gradually disappeared, and the SP began.

Most importantly, our results are relevant for the debate on whether the spread of Slavs was due to large migratory movements and the expansion of a homogeneous population, or to the gradual acculturation of regional populations. We were able to connect the fundamental transformations of culture in large parts of Eastern Europe to a substantial movement of people most plausibly from regions between the Eastern Baltics and the Northwestern Pontic region. This genetically inferred area agrees well with archaeological hypotheses for the origins of Slavic material culture east of the Vistula River, for instance, in the Kyivan culture (second or third to fifth centuries ce)4,5,20,21. However, without aDNA from this region and period, more precision remains impossible.

SP ancestry spread to many directions from the sixth century onwards. Yet we can only detect it when the immigrants stopped cremating their dead at different stages between the eighth and tenth centuries. Only few early inhumation burials (for example, Velim and Gródek) provide insights in line with more recent sites. Consequently, it remains unclear whether most of the SP ancestry arrived in a single pulse or over a prolonged time span. As described in previous publications27, our results indicate that sporadic individual percolation from Eastern Europe into the Balkans preceded (and potentially succeeded) any large-scale movements, pointing to long-term mobility accompanying the sixth and seventh century demographic transformation. To what extent the previous population disappeared, continued to live alongside the newcomers or mixed with them depended on the region69,70,71. Among our study regions, the shift was most marked close to the areas of origin, as in Poland and Eastern Germany. By contrast, we found more admixture with local populations in the Northwestern Balkans, the Carpathian Basin and the Volga-Oka area. Remarkably, the Slavic population buried in Eastern Germany in the late tenth to twelfth century, nearly four centuries after the first Slavic groups settled in the wider region, had little genetic exchange with the neighbouring Thuringian population, although archaeological finds demonstrate regular interactions between these groups. To some extent, this discrepancy might be caused by the selection of studied sites within a more heterogeneous genetic landscape. However, our results agree with the drastic break between the preceding Germanic material culture and that of the Early SP, probably after an intermediate phase of scarce settlement in most of the Northwestern Slavic area after the mid-sixth century69,70,71,72,73,74,75, and disagree with the model of a Slavicisation of the existing population.

This change was driven by substantial movements of people and can be linked with the dispersion of Slavic languages and the spread of a new material culture. However, our data do not support total population replacement across Eastern Europe, but point to a complex, regionally contingent demic diffusion with partial integration. SP ancestry in the Balkan Peninsula and Western Russia did not form the majority in all areas. Consequently, besides large-scale movements, several other mechanisms, including genetic and cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations by the expanding SP gene pool, are needed to explain the ancient and present-day genetic patterns observed on the margins of the diffusion area. Where the newcomers mixed with local populations, they did so without significant gender bias.

Unlike in the MP, the SP communities in the Elbe-Saale region relied more on biological relatedness in their organization, and their large pedigrees provide valuable information about their reproductive practices and social structure. Similar to earlier Avar communities in Pannonia67,76, the multi-generational SP communities we studied in Eastern Germany practiced a consistent reproductive strategy based on patrilineal and local descent, female exogamy, strict avoidance of consanguinity, and—in several cases—multiple reproductive partners. Not all of these patterns observed in Eastern Germany were shared with the SP societies in the Northern Balkans, which, in many aspects of their organization, appear more similar to preceding MP groups in Croatia, Eastern Germany, Hungary or Italy39,40. In some of these cases, previously established social practices may have survived the substantial demographic and linguistic changes, adding another level of genetic complexity to the new set of questions concerning social organization and interaction within and between Slavic-related societies across Europe.

In modern ethnic and national terminology, ‘Slavs' denotes all speakers of Slavic languages and/or citizens of the Slavic nation states. This concept of an ethnic collective spanning several nations is much more marked than among the Germanic or Romance speakers in the rest of Europe (Supplementary Note 1). The extent to which Slavic identity mattered diverged; it was important for nineteenth and twentieth century Slavic nationalisms, Pan-Slavism and Russian imperialism, but regional or national allegiances often carried more weight. The prejudices of their western neighbours who tended to regard Slavs as culturally inferior reinforced sentiments of Slavic commonality. The question of Slavic origins, addressed in this Article, had a crucial role in ideological debates about the unity and the significance of the Slavs. It is therefore important to be precise in the scholarly use of the term. In research about the early Slavs, the meanings of the term diverge. In written sources since the sixth and seventh century in Byzantium and the west, groups of Slavs or Wends increasingly appear in a wide range of lands beyond and along the Danube and the Elbe rivers. We can make use of different sources to understand how large parts of Europe became Slavic: outside perceptions about Slavs in texts; archaeological traces of shared cultural practices among early Slavs (particularly the Prague-Korchak culture); linguistic reconstructions of a common Slavic language prior to the particular Slavic idioms; and shifts in ancestry of the medieval gene pool, which point to migrations. We should not take these disciplinary results as proxies for each other as attributes of a coherent people called Slavs; yet, they provide different perspectives on the Slavicisation of Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Combining them allows us to overcome simplistic theories of an expansion of the Slavs and instead understand the common dynamic and the different ways in which Slavic peoples began to form in many parts of Europe. We therefore use Slavs for populations named in this way in contemporary texts, without implying that they self-identified as such. These Slavic groups can be localized, but hardly circumscribed. We do not use genetic or archaeological features in regions where Slavs spread to distinguish between Slavs and non-Slavs, or between speakers and non-speakers of Slavic languages, although we assume that these phenomena overlapped to a considerable degree.

For better comparison of genetic differences between groups pre- and post-dating the proposed expansion of groups associated with Slavic material culture, we refer to samples dating between 300 and 600 ce as MP individuals or groups, and samples dating between 600 and 1200 ce as SP individuals or groups. Although this naming scheme is simplified compared to the well-established historical and archaeological chronologies of our three study transects, it facilitates the quantification of the genetic turnover between groups pre- and post-dating 600 ce across Central Europe. We highlight that our SP samples were selected to represent sites that are considered Slavic in an archaeological sense. Besides this cultural attribution, sites were selected for their completeness and state of archaeological description or publication. However, we do not know if the buried individuals considered themselves as belonging to a Slavic ethnic or cultural community and whether or how they understood their common descent from groups of earlier periods in Eastern Europe. Similarly, whether they spoke a Slavic language can only be hypothetically assumed. We thus prefer a temporal nomenclature that is agnostic as to genetic, cultural or linguistic designations.

When necessary, we refer collectively to SP samples with Eastern Europe-specific ancestry as having SP ancestry. This term describes an Eastern European-derived ancestry component due to a recent common origin shared among most SP individuals in all three study transects. In our analyses this ancestry is approximated using data (n = 8) from the Polish site Gródek, Hrubieszów County, dating between 600 and 900 ce and representing the spatially and temporally closest surrogate in our dataset to the (so far) unsampled source population in Eastern Europe. This naming system is intended to differentiate medieval SP ancestry from the present-day genetic landscape of Eastern Europe, which is (at least partially) derived from this ancient source.

In the text, we label large-scale movements of people during the Early Middle Ages as migration, adhering to the traditional use of the term in population genetics79. We use the term with intention since the observed movements caused significant and lasting demographic change in the genetic landscape of Europe due to the large-scale, permanent translocation of people from one region to another.

Within tables and figures, we refer to groups of published individuals by the names given in the Allen Ancient DNA resource v.54.180. Sample sizes, context information and publication names can be found in Supplementary Tables 7–11. In the main text and Supplementary Notes, we used the following abbreviations for archaeological time periods: N, Neolithic; C, Chalcolithic; EBA, Early Bronze Age; MBA, Middle Bronze Age; LBA, Late Bronze Age; IA, Iron Age; RA, Roman Age; EMA, Early Middle Ages; MA, Middle Ages; H, historical.

Provenance information for samples from all archaeological sites is given in Supplementary Information Note 2, together with short descriptions of each site, the institution owning the samples (or custodians of the samples), the responsible co-author who obtained permission to analyse and the year of the permission granted.

We obtained all permissions for the work with archaeological and anthropological material in this study. Sampling of bone and teeth samples took place in the clean room facilities of the ArcheoGen laboratory at the Department of Archeology and Museology, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic as well as in the clean room facilities of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The sampling workflow included documenting and photographing the provided samples. For teeth, we either cut along the cementum–enamel junction and collected powder by drilling into the pulp chamber or accessed the pulp chamber by drilling the tooth transversally. For the petrous bones, we drilled from the outside of the bone towards the cochlear region in parallel to the auditory canal81. Other skeletal material such as long bones were used when no teeth or petrous bones were available. In these cases, areas with best preserved compact bone tissue were drilled. We collected between 25 and 50 mg of bone or tooth powder per sample for DNA extractions. The pulverized bone samples were sent to clean room facilities dedicated to ancient DNA work at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology for further processing and aDNA acquisition.

New radiocarbon dates for this study were measured on the bone and tooth fragments sampled for DNA. These dates were obtained at the Curt-Engelhorn-Center Archaeometry gGmbH, Mannheim, using MICADAS-AMS. Collagen was extracted from the previously sampled bones, purified by ultrafiltration and freeze-dried. 14C ages were normalized to δ13C = −25‰. The calibration was done using the IntCal20 calibration curve82 and the Oxcal program83.

Ancient DNA was extracted following a modified protocol of Dabney et al.84, as described at https://www.protocols.io/view/ancient-dna-extraction-from-skeletal-material-baksicwe, where we replaced the extended-MinElute-column assembly for manual extractions with columns from the Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit85, and for automated extraction with a protocol that replaced spin columns with silica beads in the purification step86.

We generated double-indexed87 single-stranded88 libraries using 25 µl of DNA extract and following established protocols89. We applied the partial UDG (UDG half)90 protocol to remove most of the aDNA damage while preserving the characteristic damage pattern in the terminal nucleotides.

We enriched libraries using in-solution capture probes synthesized by Agilent Technologies for 1,237,207 SNPs along the nuclear genome91. Libraries were sequenced in-house on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform to an average depth of 20 million reads and after demultiplexing processed through EAGER92.

After demultiplexing based on a unique pair of indexes, raw sequence data were processed using EAGER92. This included clipping sequencing adaptors from reads with AdapterRemoval (v.2.3.1)93 and mapping of reads with BWA (Burrows–Wheeler aligner) v.0.7.1294 against the Human Reference Genome Hs37d5, with seed length (-l) disabled, maximum number of differences (-n) of 0.01 and a quality filter (-q) of 30. We removed duplicate reads with the same orientation and start and end positions using DeDup v.0.12.292. Terminal base deamination damage calculation was done using mapDamage v.2.0.695, specifying a length (-l) of 100 bp. For the ten libraries that underwent UDG half treatment, we used BamUtil v.1.0.14 (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamUtil:_trimBam) to clip two bases at the start and end of all reads for each sample to remove residual deaminations, thus removing genotyping errors that could arise due to ancient DNA damage.

To determine the genetic sex of the ancient individuals, we calculated the coverage on the autosomes as well as on each sex chromosome and subsequently normalized the X- and Y-reads by the autosomal coverage96. For that, we used a custom script (https://github.com/TCLamnidis/Sex.DetERRmine) for the calculation of each relative coverage as well as their associated error bars97. Females are expected to have an X rate of 1 and a Y rate of 0, while males are expected to have a rate of 0.5 for both X and Y chromosomes.

We used the ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data) package98 (v.0.923) to test for heterozygosity of polymorphic sites on the X chromosome in male individuals, applying a contamination threshold of 5% at the results of method 1. For male and female samples, we estimated contamination levels on the mtDNA using Schmutzi99 (v.1.5.4) by comparing the consensus mitogenome of the ancient sample to a panel of 197 worldwide mitogenomes as a potential contamination source, applying a contamination threshold of 5%.

We used the program pileupCaller (v.1.4.0.2) (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools.git) to genotype the trimmed BAM files of 10 UDG half libraries. A pileup file was generated using samtools mpileup with parameters -q 30 -Q 30 -B containing only sites overlapping with our capture panel. From this file, for each individual and each SNP on the 1240k panel36,37,100, one read covering the SNP was drawn at random, and a pseudo-haploid call was made—that is, the ancient individual was assumed homozygous for the allele on the randomly drawn read for the SNP in question. We used the parameter -SingleStrandMode, which causes pileupCaller to ignore reads aligning to the forward strand at C/T polymorphisms and at G/A polymorphisms to ignore reads aligning to the reverse strand, which should remove post-mortem damage in ancient DNA libraries prepared with the non-UDG single-stranded protocol. To maximize our resolution, we filled missing data in the single-stranded libraries with additional genotypes present in the trimmed, double-stranded but not in the single-stranded libraries.

To process the mitochondrial DNA data, we extracted reads from 1240k data using samtools (v.1.3.1)101 and mapped these to the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS). We subsequently called consensus sequences using Geneious R9.8.1102 and used HaploGrep 2 (v.2.4.0)103 (https://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/; with PhyloTree version 17-FU1) to determine mitochondrial haplotypes. For the male individuals, we used pileup from the Rsamtools package to call the Y-chromosome SNPs of the 1240k SNP panel (mapping quality ≥30 and base quality ≥30). We then manually assigned Y-chromosome haplogroups using pileups of Y-SNPs included in the 1240k panel that overlap with SNPs included on the ISOGG SNP index v.15.73 (Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2019-2020; 2020.07.11).

We used the ancient-DNA-specific genotype caller MLE function of ATLAS104 (https://bitbucket. org/wegmannlab/atlas/) to call genotype likelihoods. ATLAS can also calculate the base-quality recalibration (the recal function) that we performed in batches among libraries sequenced in the same sequencing run, accounting for specific sequencing errors. ATLAS recalibration also corrects the base qualities accounting for the empirical ancient DNA damage pattern observed from the data and reduces the effect of reference bias introduced by genome mapping by relying on a list of 10 million highly conserved genomic positions across 88 mammal species downloaded from ensembl (https://grch37.ensembl.org/). We called genotype likelihoods on the whole 1000 Genomes SNPs panel of around 20 million SNPs and used these calls as input data for GLIMPSE105 (v.2.0.0) (https://github.com/odelaneau/GLIMPSE), applying the default parameters and using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. The function GLIMPSE_phase was used to perform simultaneous imputation and phasing on genomic chunks of 2,000,000 base pairs with a buffer of 200,000 base pairs. Samples with more than 600k SNPs exhibiting a genotype posterior of ≥0.99 after imputation were included in downstream IBD analysis. We then estimated segments that were IBD either in the context of: (1) other ancient individuals; or (2) present-day populations.

To investigate IBD sharing between pairs of ancient individuals we used the program ancIBD43. We applied the HapBLOCK function of ancIBD to perform the pairwise estimation with default parameters and only shared blocks of more than 8 cM containing more than 220 SNPs per centimorgan were considered. To further filter for possible false-positive hits in our IBD network analysis, we considered only shared IBD segments longer than 12 cM, and if a pair of individuals had segments of less than 16 cM, we included them only if they had more than one such segment.

To compare IBD segments shared with present-day individuals as well as estimates of effective population size, we used BEAGLE106,107 (v.5.2) to phase the newly imputed genotypes. Following Morez et al.108, the window and overlap lengths were set as wider than any chromosome (window length 380 cM and overlap length 190 cM) to maximize the information used for phasing the genomes. The 1000 Genomes phase 3 dataset (http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/1000_Genomes_phase3_v5a) and GRCh37 genomic maps (http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/genetic_maps/) provided by BEAGLE were used for phasing. We phased ancient and present-day data together since the BEAGLE phasing algorithm (hidden Markov model-based haplotype clustering) improves widely as the sample size increases. The identification of IBD segments was done using RefinedIBD109, which can also detect IBD fragments shorter than 8 cM. The window size was set to 3 cM. The minimal size for a segment to be considered shared by IBD is 1 cM, the same threshold used in Margaryan et al.110 and Morez et al.108. Finally, we removed gaps between IBD segments that have at most one discordant homozygote and that are less than 0.6 cM in length and aggregated the sum and number of IBD segments between each pair of ancient and present-day individuals.

To infer biological relatedness between individuals, we applied two independent approaches:

We calculated the pairwise mismatch rate111 in all pairs of individuals from our pseudo-haploid dataset to double-check for potential duplicate individuals and to determine first-, second- and third-degree relatives. For this purpose, we also used BREADR112 which utilizes Bayesian posterior probabilities for the classification of the genetic relationships.

We estimated the parts of the genome that are IBD in all pairs of individuals. We used KIN113 as the primary IBD-based method, although we validated the relatedness estimates with the method LcMLkin114. Both methods use genotype likelihoods to estimate the three k coefficients (k0, k1 and k2), which define the probability that two individuals have zero, one or two alleles that are IBD at a random site in the genome.

We calculated estimates of genetic diversity and effective population size using three different approaches.

Inbreeding estimation. We calculated the length of runs of homozygosity (RoH) using the software HapROH115 (v.0.6) in our pseudo-haploid data. A SNP cutoff of 300k SNPs was used, as well as the default 1000 Genomes reference panel. The number of RoH of size 4–8 cM per individual reflects the rate at which distant relatives have children, providing information about the sizes of mate pools (Ne) averaged over the hundreds of years prior to when individuals lived; offspring of close kin unions are reflected by sums of RoH >50 cM across the genome in runs of homozygosity of >12 cM.

Variability in population structure. We used the FSTruct116 package to quantify the variability of the Q matrix (which contains the row vectors of ancestry coefficients for each individual) outputted by supervised ADMIXTURE. The ancestry variability is measured in the ratio \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}/{F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) (where \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) is the maximal value of the fixation index FST). We generated 1,000 bootstrap replicate matrices for computing \({F}_{{\rm{ST}}}/{F}_{{\rm{ST}}}^{\text{max}}\) to compare bootstrap means and identify significantly different variabilities.

Effective population size. We used the method IBDNe117 to estimate ancestry-specific historical effective population size from around 4 generations to around 50 generations ago using identity-by-descent segments inferred from our imputed diploid data. We removed IBD segments shorter than 2 cM as well as IBD segments from avuncular and closer relationships using the parameter filtersamples: true. Confidence intervals for the estimated effective population size were calculated using 500 bootstrap replicates.

We merged our ancient DNA data with previously published datasets of ancient individuals reported by the Reich Lab in the Allen Ancient DNA Resource v.54.1 (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) (1240k SNP panel)80. For comparisons with present-day groups, we compiled and curated a high-resolution, quality-filtered reference dataset containing genotypes for 426,135 SNPs (the intersection of several different Affymetrix and Illumina chip types) from 12,176 contemporary individuals sampled from 49 (mostly European and West Asian) populations from previously published datasets as described in Gretzinger et al.68. Sample sizes are given in Supplementary Table 3. We produced four different datasets:

The whole 1240k panel (1240 K; 1.2 M SNPs). Used exclusively for comparison between ancient individuals as well as ancIBD and qpAdm analysis.

The overlap between the 1240k and HO panel (1240KHO; 0.6 M SNPs). Used for HO West Eurasian PCA.

The overlap between the 1240k and high-resolution panel (1240KEU; 0.4 M SNPs). Used for most analyses including ancient and present-day populations, e.g. PCA, F4 statistics and ADMIXTURE.

The overlap between the 1240KHO and the high-resolution panel (1240KHOEU; 0.3 M SNPs). Used for the calculation of SP ancestry proportions in present-day populations as well as FST and RefinedIBD analysis.

We carried out PCA using the smartpca software v.16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v.6.0.1)118. We computed principal components on three different sets of European and West Asian populations and projected ancient individuals using lsqproject: YES and shrinkmode: YES.

F3 and F4 statistics were computed with ADMIXTOOLS v.3.0119 (https://github.com/DReichLab). F3 statistics were calculated using qp3Pop (v.435). For F4 statistics, we used the qpDstat (v.755) and with the activated F4 mode. Significant deviation from zero can be interpreted as rejection of the tree population typology ((Outgroup, X);(Pop1, Pop2)). Under the assumption that no gene flow occurred between Pop1 and Pop2 and the Outgroup, a positive F-statistic suggests affinity between X and Pop2, whilst a negative value indicates affinity between X and Pop1. Standard errors were calculated with the default block jackknife 5 cM in size. As outgroups for F3 and F4 statistics, we either used haploid genotypes from YRI or CHB.

We calculated FST using smartpca software v.16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v.6.0.1)118 with the fstonly, inbreed, and fsthiprecision options set to YES.

We estimated ancestry proportions using qpWave36,120 (v.410) and qpAdm36 (v.810) from ADMIXTOOLS v.3.0119 with the allsnps: YES and inbreeding: YES options. Standard errors were calculated with the default block jackknife 5 cM in size. We used three basic sets of outgroups:

OldAfrica, WHGB, Turkey_N, Afanasievo79. This set was adapted from Patterson et al.79 and used to infer ancestry components from WHGs, EEFs and Yamnaya/Poltavka pastoralists (OldSteppe).

YRI.SG, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Wales, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands68. This set was adapted from Gretzinger et al.68 and used to infer ancestry components from SP individuals in present-day Central and Eastern Europeans.

OldAfrica, WHGB, Russia_Ust_Ishim.DG, CHG, EHG, Iran_GanjDareh_N, Israel_Natufian_published, Jordan_PPNB, Laos_Hoabinhian, OldSteppe, Turkey_N, Russia_MA1_HG, Morocco_Iberomaurusia. This set was adapted and modified from Antonio et al.34 to investigate the formation of the SP gene pool.

To analyse potential sex bias in the admixture process, we used qpAdm to estimate SP admixture proportions on the autosomes (default option) and on the X chromosome (option “chrom: 23”) using the abovementioned outgroups. Following the approach established by Mathieson et al.121, z-scores were calculated for the difference between the autosomes and the X chromosome using the formula \({\rm{z}}=\frac{pA-pX}{\sqrt{\sigma {A}^{2}+{\sigma X}^{2}}}\) where pA and pX are the SP admixture proportions on the autosomes and the X chromosome, and σA and σX are the corresponding jackknife standard deviations121. Thus, a negative z-score means that there is more SP admixture on the X chromosome than on the autosomes, indicating that the SP admixture was female-biased.

We performed model-based clustering analysis using two different approaches in ADMIXTURE:

We applied ADMIXTURE41 in unsupervised mode using modern and ancient individuals at K = 2 to 12. Variants with minor allele frequency of 0.01 were removed and PLINK was used for linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning with a window size of 200, a step size of 5 and an R2 threshold of 0.5.

We applied ADMIXTURE41 in supervised mode using modern reference populations at K = 12. This analysis was run on haploid data with the parameter “haploid” set to all (=“*”). To obtain point estimates for populations, we averaged individual point estimates and calculated the s.e.m. As modern references we used the groupings listed in the Supplementary Notes 4.1. The Q matrix of this ADMIXTURE analysis was also used as input for FSTruct as described by the authors116.

We constructed maximum likelihood trees using TreeMix (v.1.12)122. For each tree, we performed a round of global rearrangements after adding all populations (-global) and calculated 100 bootstrap replicates to assess the uncertainty of the fitted model (-bootstrap). Sample size correction was disabled.

Admixture dates were calculated using DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals) (v.4010)56, which calculates the decay of ancestry covariance coefficients between every pair of available overlapping SNPs between the test individuals and the source populations over increasing-genetic-distance window. We used standard settings with default bin size of 0.001 Morgans applied in our estimates (flag “binsize: 0.001”). We used a standard of 29 years per generation to convert the generation times in years since admixture.

We use Bayesian phylogenetic inference to estimate the ages of language divergence as described78. Analyses were performed on the IE-CoR database that stores data on cognate relationships (shared word origin) between 161 Indo-European languages, in a reference set of 170 basic meanings (https://iecor.clld.org). Divergence date distributions for the Balto-Slavic and Slavic subgroups were extracted from the sample of 37,004 trees resulting from the main analysis of Heggarty et al.78. A critical evaluation of this approach is discussed in Supplementary Note 9. However, we highlight that these computational estimates for the splits of the Baltic and Slavic languages compare well with estimates produced by methods of traditional Indo-European linguistics. These estimates are based on the reconstructed rapidity of diversification relative to that observed in the other branches of Indo-European (some of which is recorded in writing thousands of years before Baltic and Slavic), the nature of contacts and convergence between Balto-Slavic and other languages (IE and non-IE), and the character of the reconstructible Proto-Balto–Slavic vocabulary—but also attempted links to the archaeological picture57. The dating of the split of Proto-Balto–Slavic is generally in agreement with the results of traditional historical linguistics as described above; and earlier glottochronological approaches have yielded similar dating—for example, an estimation at the fifteenth and fourteenth century bce123.

The widely used diabetes drug metformin changes blood metal levels in humans. The Kobe University study is an important step in understanding the drug's many actions and designing better ones in the future.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed diabetes drug in the world. Apart from lowering blood sugar levels, it is also known to have a broad range of beneficial side effects such as against tumors, inflammations and atherosclerosis. However, although it has been used for more than 60 years now, its mechanism of action is still not clear, hampering the development of even better drugs against these conditions.

Kobe University endocrinologist Wataru Ogawa says: "It is known that diabetes patients experience changes in the blood levels of metals such as copper, iron and zinc. In addition, chemical studies found that metformin has the ability to bind certain metals, such as copper, and recent studies showed that it is this binding ability that might be responsible for some of the drug's beneficial effects. So, we wanted to know whether metformin actually affects blood metal levels in humans, which had not been clarified." To do so, Ogawa and his team enlisted about 200 diabetes patients at Kobe University Hospital, half of which took metformin and half of which did not, in a study to analyze their blood serum levels for those metals and various metal deficiency indicators.

In the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care, the Kobe University team now published the first clinical evidence of altered blood metal levels in patients taking metformin. They showed that drug-taking patients have significantly lower copper and iron levels and heightened zinc levels. Ogawa says: "It is significant that we could show this in humans. Furthermore, since decreases in copper and iron concentrations and an increase in zinc concentration are all considered to be associated with improved glucose tolerance and prevention of complications, these changes may indeed be related to metformin's action."

Recently, Japan has approved the use of imeglimin, a new diabetes drug that is a derivative of metformin but that should not be able to bind metals the same way as its parent. "Imeglimin is thought to have a different method of action, and we are already conducting studies to compare the effects the two drugs have," says Ogawa.

It is not just about understanding the current drugs, however. Ogawa explains the bigger picture, saying: "We need both clinical trials and animal experiments to pinpoint the causal relationship between the drug's action and its effects. If such studies progress further, they may lead to the development of new drugs for diabetes and its complications by properly adjusting the metal concentrations in the body."

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 24H00638) and the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation. It was conducted in collaboration with a researcher from the Kagayaki Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic Sannomiya.

A grim discovery sheds new light on the dark history of a Nazi fortress.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

Amateur archaeologists were recently searching for stray artifacts in an abandoned building in Poland when they made a sinister discovery beneath the floorboards: five decaying bodies with their hands and feet missing.

The site was an infamous villa that belonged to Nazi Party leader Hermann Göring within Adolf Hitler's secret military headquarters, the Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair), which was deserted after a 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler and later partially destroyed by retreating German forces near the end of World War II.

Reuters reports that the Latebra Foundation, which has scoured the site of the Wolf's Lair “with official permission for several years,” discovered the bodies of three adults, an older child, and a baby buried just below what would have been the floor of Göring's villa. In 1939, Hitler designated Göring, at the time the commander of the German air force, as his successor.

The discovery at the site raises a host of haunting questions, including about what transpired beneath the villa's ruins in the decades since the fall of the Third Reich.

“Everyone wondered what might have happened there ... We tried to think of something, but nothing reasonable comes to mind,” Latebra member Dominik Markiewicz told Reuters. “We didn't know what we were dealing with at all. Were they some occult rituals of Third Reich fanatics? We have no idea.”

Latebra called the police, prompting an investigation and a forensic examination of the remains. Although the case has since been closed, and there are no conclusive answers, a new report has provided additional clues into the potential origins of the bodies.

How did it take so long for the bodies to be discovered? While the Latebra Foundation has been searching the Wolf's Lair site for years, mostly finding “uniform buttons, tools, and machine parts,” per Reuters, the archaeologists only recently focused on Göring's villa due to the sheer amount of ground they had to cover. The villa was just one of approximately 200 buildings scattered across the huge compound, which spans an area of over 617 acres of land.

The Wolf's Lair was off limits to the public for nearly 50 years after World War II. It sustained significant damage at the hands of the Nazis themselves, who didn't want it to fall into the hands of the advancing Soviet forces. Hitler ordered its destruction shortly after his last visit in November 1944, with the actual demolition occurring in late January 1945, after the Soviets began their Vistula–Oder offensive. 

On the same day the Soviets liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp, they captured the Wolf's Lair without firing a single shot. Under Soviet control, the site fell into disrepair and was closed off to any exploration or excavation. The public couldn't access the site until the collapse of communism in Poland in 1990, which may explain how the corpses remained hidden for so long.

Besides, archaeologists wouldn't have necessarily looked to find remains at the Wolf's Lair, as it wasn't a death camp. Designed as Hitler's Eastern Front headquarters, this highly secretive complex served as the strategic center for the Nazi leadership to orchestrate their military campaign against the Soviet Union. 

In fact, the most famous act of violence to take place at the Wolf's Lair during the Third Reich was directed at Hitler himself. On July 20, 1944, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg carried out an assassination attempt on Hitler in a Wolf's Lair conference room, by placing a bomb concealed in a briefcase. Although the explosion resulted in the death of four Nazi officers and injured others, Hitler narrowly escaped with his life, largely due to the fortuitous shielding provided by a sturdy table leg that absorbed the brunt of the blast. 

Who were the five people buried where Nazi leaders once plotted? A new report in National Geographic pieces together some clues from the initial investigation:

So, it's possible the bodies were buried on the site before the Wolf's Lair was even built. (Construction concluded on the compound in June of 1941.)

Some experts have tried to connect the corpses to ritual sacrifice, as leading Nazi figures like Heinrich Himmler reportedly engaged in occult practices, according to NatGeo. They point to the presence of “dart-shaped stones called belemnites” near the bodies, which were reportedly sometimes placed at pagan burial sites as a “good luck charm.” But belemnite also naturally occurs in that area, so it's tough to definitively interpret the stones' proximity to the graves as evidence of ritualistic practices.

Since the corpses date back to a period between 1918 and 1939, the Latebra Foundation plans to proceed with radiocarbon dating. This analysis aims to pinpoint the bodies' time of death more precisely, potentially narrowing it down to a span of just a few years. But, as NatGeo notes, even if these three adults and two children were buried before the Nazis ever set foot within the Wolf's Lair, that also carries a disturbing implication:

Scientists sought to work out genetic errors by creating their own artificial genome, which replaced E. coli's original genome and used less genetic material.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The genetic code for just about all forms of life on Earth is fairly universal. It has the same 64 codons (sequences of nucleotides), molecules that both encode the amino acids (which encode the formation of proteins) and create the bases of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. Why mess with something that hasn't changed in billions of years?

Despite nature having its reasons for leaving some things unchanged, biologist Jason Chin from Oxford University, still decided to change things up. It turns out some codons have extra copies of directions for encoding amino acids and signals for switching the formation of proteins on and off. Chin wanted to see if life could still function with less. He already managed to prove that when he synthesized Syn61—E. coli bacteria with three fewer codons than before. But now, he has gone even further with the synthetic organism Syn57—E. coli with a 57-codon genome.

Narrowing down the codons that encode protein synthesis can make some organisms resistant to viruses—synthetic genetic codes transferred to organisms can actually block viruses, which genetically alter an organism by injecting cells with RNA that carries codes for producing viral proteins. It can also enable more efficient protein synthesis and help build protein polymers (chains of at least 500 amino acids). Protein polymers can behave like natural proteins, but they can also be designed to solve problems on a molecular level. 

“Emerging methods for the total synthesis of genomes provide opportunities to explore genome sequences that cannot be accessed by editing,” Chin and his research team said in a study recently published in Science. “Synthetic genomes may be radically different from those accessed by natural evolution, and genome synthesis provides a route to generating sequence and function that is [nonexistant] with respect to extant life.”

Previously, other teams of researchers have removed stop codons, which signal protein synthesis to end, from the E. coli genome. This was done through mutagenesis, or creating gene mutations by tweaking DNA. However, mutagenesis has its downsides—it often ends up with excess mutations, and can have difficulty adjusting the numbers of sense codons (which encode amino acids) versus stop codons. 

Syn61 already showed how organisms could survive with just 61 codons, but the question was whether or not that was the limit. In synthesizing the genetic code for Syn57, Chin swapped out repeating codons and made over a hundred thousand codon changes to the original. Some re-coded groups of codons needed to be tolerated over an entire region of the genome, while in other cases, a codon only needed to be replaced with a viable substitute. He then assembled the DNA into an artificial chromosome, introduced it into the E. coli genome (this was done for each group of codons), and sequenced the clones to see how successful they were.

Several strains of E. coli were cultured before the final version emerged. As bacterial strains within the lab-created genome cloned themselves, they were analyzed for growth. Taking a closer look at two strains revealed that recoded regions of the genome actually limited growth. When more alterations were made to these sections of the genome, however, growth improved in these strains. It was the final synthetic strain that Chin named Syn57. In upcoming research, he plans to continue testing the limits of a genome.

“In future work, we will build on the generation of the deeply recoded strain we have created to explore the generation of deeply [edited] genetic codes, enhanced virus resistance, the genetic coding of [new proteins] and [new polymers],” he said.

This synthetic life had its genome replaced instead of being created from scratch. Maybe it could tell us something about how life—and the genes that determine its traits—originated on Earth.

A Cosmic Void May Be Skewing Our Understanding of the Universe

Our understanding of cosmology hinges on how well we know our own local universe, which remains poorly mapped and poorly understood

By Paul M. Sutter edited by Clara Moskowitz

“You can journey to the ends of the earth in search of success,” 19th-century Baptist preacher Russell Conwell is said to have proclaimed, “but if you're lucky, you will discover happiness in your own backyard.”

Modern cosmology has stepped far beyond our cosmic backyard. We peer into the light from the earliest moments of the big bang. Our surveys stride across the universe, swallowing millions of galaxies at a time. We have mapped and measured the most subtle accelerations of cosmic expansion.

But our understanding of all of that hinges on how well we know our own local neighborhood, which remains poorly mapped and poorly understood.

In April 2024 the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration made headlines with a stunning announcement. Data from the first year of a galaxy survey that captured precise measurements of more than 13 million galaxies revealed slight but significant evidence that dark energy may be weakening with time. That is, the mysterious force or substance that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate might be fading away.

This new result adds to the growing list of problems faced by the leading model of cosmology, called LCDM for “lambda cold dark matter,” which hypothesizes that around 95 percent of all the stuff in the cosmos is either dark energy or dark matter. For years cosmologists have struggled with the so-called Hubble tension, a discrepancy between measurements of the present-day expansion rate based on the nearby universe compared with extrapolations taken from the ancient, distant cosmos.

But to see out into the wider universe and make these grand measurements, we must first look through the nearby cosmos, and that may bias our observations. Like peering through a distorted lens, our perspective may give us the illusion of problems affecting the grand sweep of the heavens when really we're just misinterpreting the data.

So what does our nearby universe look like?

The trouble with building a comprehensive map of the local cosmos (where “local” means out to a distance of a few hundred million light-years) is that to create a full picture, surveys must be deep, broad and complete. They need to map out every region of sky, going as far into the universe as possible, and capture every single galaxy, no matter how small and dim. Most astronomical surveys, however, typically achieve only two out of those three goals.

For example, in 2013 a team of researchers, Ryan Keenan, Amy Barger and Lennox Cowie, studied the possible existence of what was then known as the “local hole.” Since renamed the KBC void, it's a possible depression in the local density of the universe stretching two billion light-years wide. It's a not a particularly deep depression: this local span of the universe looks to be just 10 to 20 percent less dense than the cosmic average. But it might be enough to mess with our observations of cosmic expansion: the galaxies inside the void could experience an extra gravitational tug outward from all the higher-density regions on the outside, adding a bias that otherwise wouldn't be there and potentially alleviating the Hubble tension.

Shortly after the DESI results, Indranil Banik of the University of Portsmouth in England and Vasileios Kalaitzidis of the University of St Andrews in Scotland invoked the KBC void to explain those findings as well, arguing that these measurements are distorted because they are, essentially, anchored on the wrong assumption.

Cosmologists assume, and comprehensive surveys have shown, that the universe is homogenous at large scales, meaning basically the same in all directions. A patch of sufficiently large volume should be largely like any other patch. Sure, there will be different arrangements of galaxies and clusters and voids, but the statistics of those structures—their sizes and separations, and so on—will be the same. Yet it's not exactly clear where homogeneity kicks in or how far out our local universe can be different without running afoul of LCDM. Once we allow for the existence of the KBC void, Banik and Kalaitzidis argue, then the need for evolving dark energy might go away.

But we're not exactly sure if the KBC void actually exists. It does appear, given our limited surveys of the nearby universe, that there are indeed fewer galaxies in our billion-light-year patch than there are outside of it. But again, comprehensive astronomical surveys are notoriously tricky.

In May 2025 a team of cosmologists published the findings of a multiyear study into the structure of the nearby universe that casts some doubt on the empty spot. The researchers' tool wasn't a new telescope or instrument, though. It was a computer.

The team took existing catalogs of galaxy surveys and fed the data into a computer simulation of the growth of cosmic structure structures and the appearance of galaxies in an attempt to create a complete picture of the local universe. But these simulations contain all manner of tunable variables, such as the amount of dark energy in the universe and the efficiency of galaxies' star production. And the surveys themselves are far from complete, with gaps, holes and missing data; an unknown number of galaxies are too small and dim to be captured.

So the researchers used Bayesian statistics, a kind of statistical approach that cleanly incorporates prior knowledge and assumptions. They ran simulation after simulation, varying every possible parameter, to build up a suite of mock galaxy surveys that were statistically compatible with the actual data.

At the end of their exhaustive analysis, they were able to find matches to most of the known superclusters near the Milky Way with high statistical likelihood, implying that the clusters astronomers think they see in galaxy surveys are indeed the real deal and not a fluke of poor-quality data.

But there was no sign of the KBC void.

This study is not the final word, just a statistical analysis of the likelihood of the KBC void actually existing given the quality of current galaxy surveys. Plus, cosmologists don't know if large density variations in the distribution of galaxies around the Milky Way are enough to account for the Hubble tension and the DESI results.

But the lesson of these studies is clear. As we continue to scan the wider heavens and pierce deeply into the abyss in search of cosmic mysteries, we can't ignore the portion of the nearby universe that we call home.

“Your diamonds are not in the far distant mountains or in yonder seas,” Conwell reportedly said. “They are in your own backyard, if you but dig for them.”

Google announced on Wednesday that it's bringing a slew of new features to the Android ecosystem and Pixel devices. The tech giant is introducing Material 3 Expressive to Pixel phones, Adaptive Audio for the Pixel Buds Pro 2, on-wrist navigation for the Pixel Watch, new AI writing tools in Gboard, enhanced audio sharing capabilities, the ability to create custom Android bots, and more.

Starting Wednesday, Material 3 Expressive is coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices, as well as Pixel Tablet. Google says Material 3 Expressive will make your Pixel feel even more personal, as you can use Live effects to add animations to your lock screen's wallpaper and create customized calling cards for contacts.

Later this month, Google is bringing Adaptive Audio to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, allowing the buds to adjust to your surroundings so you can remain alert while listening to your music. Plus, you'll be able to use your buds to have clear talks with Gemini when you're in a loud environment. You can also accept or dismiss an incoming call by nodding or shaking your head.

Additionally, Pixel Watch users can now start walking or biking navigation on their phone in Google Maps and then have it automatically displayed on their smartwatch. 

As for the new AI writing tools in Gboard, you can now revise your tone to be more formal, expressive, or concise. You can also quickly fix your spelling and grammar. Google says all proofreading and rewriting happens on your device, which means your data remains private.

Google also announced that you can now pair two LE Audio Bluetooth headphones to your Android phone so you and another person can listen at the same time. With audio sharing, you can listen to a song at the same time or watch a movie together using your own headphones. The tech giant says this feature could be helpful in several different instances, like when you're in a busy cafe or commuting on a train. 

Plus, you can create a QR code to share audio with a group by starting a private broadcast that other people can join. The feature lets multiple people listen to the same playlist on their own headphones, which Google says could be used to do things like host a silent disco.

Google highlighted that the redesigned Quick Share feature on Android makes it easier to share and receive content, allowing you to instantly switch between sending and receiving, preview photos before sharing, and open received files immediately. Plus, there's a new progress indicator that shows you live updates about what percentage of the file has been transferred.

Last, Google announced that it's introducing Androidify, which is a way to build your own Android bot by uploading a selfie or writing a prompt. Androidify uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to caption the photo and Imagen to generate your custom Android bot. In some cases, it uses Veo 3, Google's latest video generation model, to animate your bot.

Breakthrough hollow-core design pulls ahead of glass after 40 years.

A Microsoft-backed research team from Lumenisity (a spinout of the University of Southampton Optoelectronics Research Center) has built a hollow-core cable with what it claims is the lowest signal loss ever recorded in any optical fiber. Published in Nature Photonics on Sept. 1, the team claims to have achieved 0.091 dB/km at 1,550nm using a design known as double nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (DNANF). This figure undercuts the ~0.14 dB/km floor of today's best silica fibers — and that number hasn't meaningfully improved since the 1980s. According to the researcherrs, this is “one of the most noteworthy improvements in waveguide technology for the past 40 years.”

Conventional single-mode fiber guides light through glass, slowing signals to roughly 200 million meters per second, which is two-thirds of their potential vacuum speed. In contrast, hollow-core fibers route photons mostly through air — reducing latency by nearly half and minimizing nonlinear effects. This, however, comes with a steep penalty: hollow-core designs leak energy at rates exceeding 1 dB/km, effectively confining them to short, specialist links. The DNANF design solves this by using concentric glass tubes that are just microns thick. These act like tiny mirrors, bouncing the light back into the air core and suppressing higher-order modes. Testing this on 15km spools using multiple measurement methods, including optical time-domain reflectometry, confirmed attenuation under 0.1 dB/km. Equally important: loss remained below 0.2 dB/km across a 66THz spectral band. That's far broader than the narrow telecom windows where silica performs best. Also, chromatic dispersion — which is where different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds through a medium — is reported to be seven times lower than it is in legacy fiber, which could simplify transceiver design and reduce energy use in network gear. Microsoft's 2022 acquisition of Lumenisity was a clear sign that it intended to push hollow-core tech out of the lab and into production. At the time, the company's hollow-core fibers were achieving around 2.5 dB/km loss, which was still a far cry from the traditional ~0.14 dB/km floor of glass fiber.Following a pilot project conducted alongside the team's research, Microsoft told Network World that some 1,200 km of the new fiber is actively carrying live traffic. During 2024's Microsoft Ignite conference, CEO Satya Nadella announced that the company plans to deploy 15,000 km of fiber across the Azure network over the next two years to support AI connectivity. Francesco Poletti, who co-invented the design, said that the low levels of loss achieved could let operators “skip one in every two or three amplifier sites, resulting in significant reductions in both capital and operational expenditure.”Of course, there are still some challenges. Scaling production will require new tooling, and standards have yet to be written. But for the first time ever, a fiber that carries light through air is both faster and less lossy than the glass it's trying to replace.

There was a lot of hype ahead of Lady Gaga's appearance on Netflix's Wednesday, but now that all of season two has dropped, it's clear that her new song, “The Dead Dance,” has an equally important presence in the series. No spoilers if you haven't binged the new episodes yet, but you can also enjoy the song on its own thanks to the Tim Burton-directed music video.

Though Burton has a cinematic filmography stretching back 40 years—all the way to 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, his feature debut—Wednesday is his first major foray into TV, and his list of music video credits also isn't terribly long. However, even if “The Dead Dance” wasn't part of his Netflix show, it's a pretty ideal pairing of artistic mindsets here; the eerie black-and-white palette suddenly shifts into lurid color as Lady Gaga invites all her pals to the undead doll disco.

Speaking to Tudum earlier this year, Lady Gaga explained “the inspiration for ‘The Dead Dance' was a breakup, and it was all about the way that we sometimes feel when it's over; how a relationship ending can kill our ability to feel hopeful about love. It's got this really cool, funky beat underneath it. And that is when the song becomes not just about the relationship; it becomes about having fun with your friends when you've been through something tough and amazing. I can't wait for people to listen to it.”

Wednesday season two is now streaming on Netflix.

Inspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school.

“I got to meet fruit professors who are the best in the world at what they do,” Wu told TechCrunch. “Through talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.”

He dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely.

On Wednesday, Orchard Robotics announced that it raised a $22 million Series A funding led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, and with participation from returning investors, including General Catalyst and Contrary.

Although the idea of using computer vision for specialty crops isn't new, Wu says that the largest farms in the U.S. still rely on manual sampling to make critical decisions about farm operations.

Since farmers inspect only a small percentage of their crops, their estimations of how many healthy fruits they have on their vineyard or orchard can be extremely imprecise.  

“If you don't know what you're growing in the field, you don't know how much chemical to apply to it. You don't know how many workers to hire to harvest it. You don't know what you can actually sell and market,” Wu said.

Orchard's small camera attaches to tractors or farm vehicles, collecting ultra-high-resolution images about fruit health as the operator drives through the field. Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health.

The data is then uploaded into Orchard's cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning, or thinning.

Orchard is already in use in some of the country's largest apple and grape farms, and the startup recently began to offer its technology to blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and strawberry growers.

The company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard's direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas.

Wu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard's product offerings.

He hopes Orchard's evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance.

“Our ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data,” Wu said. “We want to collect the data, then build an operating system on top of the data, and then eventually own all the workflows in the farm, and that's going to have the potential to expand our market by quite a bit.”

A pivotal antitrust ruling aimed at addressing Google's search monopoly may have handed Microsoft its best competitive opening in many years — but it's still a slim one, and it's not clear if the Redmond company will even consider it worth the effort.

In the long-awaited decision Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta barred Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on browsers and smartphones, such as the search giant's longstanding deal involving Apple's iPhone.

“The evidence presented required no guesswork about the exclusive agreements' impacts on competition — they ‘froze' the search ecosystem in place,” Mehta wrote in the ruling.

The court noted that Google paid an estimated $20 billion to Apple in 2022 alone to be the exclusive default search engine on Safari, a deal the ruling now makes illegal. That arrangement, the judge found, not only locked out rivals like Microsoft but also created a strong disincentive for Apple to build a competing search engine of its own.

But under the ruling, Google can still spend billions to secure default slots, as long as partners remain free to preload or promote rivals. That leaves Microsoft to fight both Google's scale and its checkbook.

So as an additional fix, Mehta also ordered Google to syndicate its organic search results and text ads to rivals for up to five years on commercially reasonable terms. For Microsoft, that could mean the ability to offer its users search results and ads backed by Google's industry-leading index.

That could help Microsoft's Bing search engine — and by extension its Copilot chatbot — compete more effectively against Google's search dominance. The stakes are higher than ever given the foundational role of search in the emerging world of artificial intelligence.

But it's not clear if Microsoft will try to take advantage of the remedies. Contacted by GeekWire on Wednesday, a spokesperson said the company had no comment on the ruling. 

In the meantime, the decision is already drawing harsh critiques from some legal experts, business leaders, and competitors. That's because the ruling falls well short of the deep structural changes sought by the Justice Department and state attorneys general. 

The plaintiffs asked the court to consider measures such as breaking off Google's Chrome browser or banning the multibillion-dollar payments Google makes to secure default placement. 

Judge Mehta rejected those proposals, citing the risk of harming partners and consumers. As a result, Google retains the ability to pay huge sums to remain the default choice, while still benefiting from the powerful network effects of its scale.

Google's critics called the ruling overly lenient and a missed opportunity. Some industry analysts called it a “big whiff” by the judge — suggesting it will do little to loosen Google's grip on the market in practice, even if it creates new openings on paper.

In a twist of historical irony, Microsoft's own antitrust case from two decades ago played a central role in the ruling. Judge Mehta leaned on that case as his main precedent, even writing, “Like Microsoft before it, Google has thwarted true competition.” 

The earlier case set the standard that antitrust enforcers don't need to prove rivals would have thrived without the illegal conduct — only that the conduct helped preserve monopoly power. 

But it also limited the remedies, steering Mehta away from a breakup of Google and toward narrower steps: banning exclusive contracts, ordering data-sharing, and requiring syndication for five years.

In theory, at least, Mehta's ruling means Microsoft could get Bing preloaded on smartphones under new distribution deals, while relying on syndicated Google results in the short term, and using the associated data-sharing remedy to better train Bing's own systems. 

Over time, the idea is that Microsoft would build up the volume of queries and user data it needs to compete independently, rather than being permanently reliant on Google.

Microsoft has been working for years to improve its own search index, frequently touting the parity of its own search results in head-to-head comparisons with Google over the years.

However, in Google's antitrust trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the power of device and software defaults, reinforced by habit, is nearly impossible to overcome.

“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella told the court, describing Microsoft as being caught in a “vicious cycle” in which Google's defaults give it more data, which improves quality, which makes it harder for competitors to win distribution.

Google shares are up more than 8% this morning on news of the ruling.

Amid lawsuits alleging child safety concerns, online gaming service Roblox announced on Wednesday that it's expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to provide age and content ratings for the games and apps on its platform.

The company said that by year's end, the age-estimation system will be rolled out to all Roblox users who access the company's communication tools, like voice and text-based chat. This involves scanning users' selfies and analyzing facial features to estimate age.

This age-estimation tech is combined with other systems, including ID age verification and verified parental consent, to provide a more accurate measure of a user's age, Roblox says — especially when compared with simply having kids type in a birth year when they create an account. The company notes that it's also planning to launch systems that will further limit communications between adults and minors on its platform.

Meanwhile, the company's partnership with IARC will see Roblox replacing its own content and maturity labels with those used by rating agencies worldwide. That means users in the U.S. will see ratings from the ESRB, while other countries will see those used by their own ratings authorities. Players in the Republic of Korea will see ratings from GRAC; players in Germany will see ratings from the USK; and players elsewhere in Europe and the United Kingdom will see ratings from the PEGI, for instance.

This system is meant to help parents better understand what sort of games their kids are playing, based on factors that could raise concerns, like whether game content features blood or gore, violence, substances, gambling, adult language, and more.

These updates follow earlier moves the company announced in July, designed to better protect younger users. 

Roblox introduced a series of safety features, including the age-verification system that analyzes users' ages via video selfies. This information is used to prevent users younger than 13 from accessing certain features within Roblox, like the ability to voice and text chat without filters. Roblox also prevents users ages 13 to 17 from adding users to their “trusted connections” unless they know them in real life — something Roblox verified through contact imports or QR code scans.

The move also follows the rollout of increasingly strict laws and regulations around the world that require social platforms to verify users' ages, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and Mississippi's age-assurance law, which has already seen social network Bluesky stop serving users in the state. Similar laws are in various stages in other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia.

Roblox has invested in safety features over the years as well.

Among its tools is Roblox Sentinel, an open source AI system designed to detect early signals of child endangerment. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when there are servers where a large number of users are breaking its rules, so it can take them down.

Despite the company's efforts, child predators still manage to access the platform and target children, according to complaints filed by Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill and in other lawsuits across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

In addition, The Guardian recently reported on a research study that discovered that kids on Roblox's service can still easily come across inappropriate content and interact with bad actors.

More recently, a popular Roblox farming simulator game, Grow a Garden, made headlines because its players began buying and selling its virtual items on online marketplaces for real money, in violation of the platform's rules. Parents and others raised concerns that the game was luring in children, then pushing them to spend cash to keep up with other players.

The changes to the ratings system may not put an end to all these bad experiences, but it could at least provide parents with more insight about the games their kids are playing. 

“Roblox is committed to creating a safe platform for our users and empowering parents to make the best decision for their children,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, in a prepared statement. “We're excited to partner with IARC and hope it will provide parents globally with more clarity and confidence regarding age-appropriate content.”

Amid lawsuits alleging child safety concerns, online gaming service Roblox announced on Wednesday that it's expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to provide age and content ratings for the games and apps on its platform.

The company said that by year's end, the age-estimation system will be rolled out to all Roblox users who access the company's communication tools, like voice and text-based chat. This involves scanning users' selfies and analyzing facial features to estimate age.

This age-estimation tech is combined with other systems, including ID age verification and verified parental consent, to provide a more accurate measure of a user's age, Roblox says — especially when compared with simply having kids type in a birth year when they create an account. The company notes that it's also planning to launch systems that will further limit communications between adults and minors on its platform.

Meanwhile, the company's partnership with IARC will see Roblox replacing its own content and maturity labels with those used by rating agencies worldwide. That means users in the U.S. will see ratings from the ESRB, while other countries will see those used by their own ratings authorities. Players in the Republic of Korea will see ratings from GRAC; players in Germany will see ratings from the USK; and players elsewhere in Europe and the United Kingdom will see ratings from the PEGI, for instance.

This system is meant to help parents better understand what sort of games their kids are playing, based on factors that could raise concerns, like whether game content features blood or gore, violence, substances, gambling, adult language, and more.

These updates follow earlier moves the company announced in July, designed to better protect younger users. 

Roblox introduced a series of safety features, including the age-verification system that analyzes users' ages via video selfies. This information is used to prevent users younger than 13 from accessing certain features within Roblox, like the ability to voice and text chat without filters. Roblox also prevents users ages 13 to 17 from adding users to their “trusted connections” unless they know them in real life — something Roblox verified through contact imports or QR code scans.

The move also follows the rollout of increasingly strict laws and regulations around the world that require social platforms to verify users' ages, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and Mississippi's age-assurance law, which has already seen social network Bluesky stop serving users in the state. Similar laws are in various stages in other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Roblox has invested in safety features over the years as well.

Among its tools is Roblox Sentinel, an open source AI system designed to detect early signals of child endangerment. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when there are servers where a large number of users are breaking its rules, so it can take them down.

Despite the company's efforts, child predators still manage to access the platform and target children, according to complaints filed by Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill and in other lawsuits across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

In addition, The Guardian recently reported on a research study that discovered that kids on Roblox's service can still easily come across inappropriate content and interact with bad actors.

More recently, a popular Roblox farming simulator game, Grow a Garden, made headlines because its players began buying and selling its virtual items on online marketplaces for real money, in violation of the platform's rules. Parents and others raised concerns that the game was luring in children, then pushing them to spend cash to keep up with other players.

The changes to the ratings system may not put an end to all these bad experiences, but it could at least provide parents with more insight about the games their kids are playing. 

“Roblox is committed to creating a safe platform for our users and empowering parents to make the best decision for their children,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, in a prepared statement. “We're excited to partner with IARC and hope it will provide parents globally with more clarity and confidence regarding age-appropriate content.”

During a press conference on Monday, Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, showed off a Huawei smartphone that China's President Xi Jinping gifted him, calling it “the best phone in the world,” and making a bold claim.

“The Americans can't hack it, neither their spy planes, nor their satellites,” Maduro said. 

The phone looked like a Mate X6, a foldable phone released by Huawei in 2024. 

Obviously, nothing is impossible to hack, and even less so by U.S. government hackers, who are considered some of the best in the world. 

A U.S.-based vulnerability researcher told TechCrunch that because Huawei makes its own hardware, as well as its own mobile operating system — HarmonyOS — its devices are easier to hack. 

“There's bound to be many more mistakes in their brand-new code than in iOS and Android at this time,” said the researcher, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive issues. 

HarmonyOS — like any software in the world — has had bugs and needs regular security updates. In the case of the Mate X6, Huawei promises monthly security patches but also notes that “the number of device models with monthly security patch updates is subject to change. Certain carriers may only support updates on a quarterly basis.”

Last month alone, Huawei patched 60 bugs in HarmonyOS, 13 of which were classified as “high severity” bugs. 

Huawei acknowledges that malware can get on its devices and has a page dedicated to helping customers who may have gotten their devices hacked. 

Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. 

There is a documented history of U.S. government hackers targeting Huawei. In 2014, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had hacked and hid backdoors inside Huawei servers in China. The hack was so bad that NSA spies got all the way inside Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen, which allowed them to spy on company executives' communications and get information about its products. 

“Many of our targets communicate over Huawei-produced products,” the NSA document said, according to The New York Times. “We want to make sure that we know how to exploit these products,” it added, to “gain access to networks of interest” around the world.

Even though that was in 2014, it is almost certain that the NSA, U.S. Cyber Command, and others have the mission to hack Huawei devices and find vulnerabilities in them for espionage purposes. There are likely U.S. government employees whose only job is to hack Huawei devices and systems. Earlier this year, the Chinese government accused the NSA of targeting Chinese critical infrastructure.

Minutes after the perpetrator of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis last week was identified, YouTube appeared to delete several videos they had shared that morning.

But not before the videos were downloaded and reshared in full on X.

Within hours, the platform was flooded with wild claims about the shooter and her motivation, with everyone from Elon Musk, the site's owner, to the head of the FBI and left-wing activists posting half-baked allegations blaming anti-Christian hate, transgender genocide, and white supremacy. Many of the posts racked up millions of views per X's public metrics.

While other social media platforms were also used to share unfounded claims about the shooter's motivations, X, under Musk, has become the perfect platform to supercharge the spread of dangerous disinformation during breaking news events. The entire team tasked with tackling disinformation on the platform was first culled years ago, and now X's biggest users claim they are incentivized by the platform to share out-of-context clickbait content over verified facts.

“X's feed algorithm is fully designed to maximize engagement, even negative engagement,” says Laura Edelson, an assistant professor in the computer sciences college at Northeastern University who specializes in tracking disinformation online. “In these conditions, conspiratorial, extreme content tends to perform very well. And when you couple that with the fact that with X's significantly weakened content rules, this is exactly what we would expect to result.”

X did not respond to WIRED‘s request for comment.

An 11-minute video from the shooter, which was shared by dozens of X accounts in the minutes after her identity was revealed, includes a wide array of guns and ammunition. The weapons were adorned with over 120 symbols, words, and phrases that reference dozens of hateful ideologies, mass shooters, memes, and coded language used by the nihilistic online communities the shooter was a member of.

As extremism researchers warned people against jumping to quick conclusions given the huge swath of digital, written, and video content that needed to be analyzed, X users took very little notice.

The same day, screenshots from the video were used by everyone from elected lawmakers and senior government officials to law enforcement personnel, activists, podcasters, and conspiracy theorists on X to push particular narratives about what was to blame for the latest mass shooting.

In one of the primary narratives erroneously pushed immediately after the shooting, conservative influencers and politicians claimed that the perpetrator's gender identity was at fault. Information about the shooter, who identified as transgender and changed her name to Robin Westman when she was 17 years old, spread like wildfire on X, pushed by a huge list of right-wing figures, including Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, and Musk himself. X's own AI-powered chatbot Grok refuted the idea that transgender people disproportionately carry out mass shootings.

Many X users, like right-wing commentator Nick Sortor, claimed the attack was motivated by hatred of God, citing “all the anti-Christian and and anti-God writings” on the shooter's guns. FBI director Kash Patel seemed to boost these claims by posting that the shooting was being investigated as a “hate crime targeting Catholics.” Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer alleged that the shooter was “radicalized by leftism and Islam.” Others cited anti-Israel phrases written on the weapons as proof the shooting was antisemitic.

On the left, most focused on the fact the shooter praised other mass shooters and used racist language. Left-wing podcaster Benjamin Dixon, who describes himself as “Pastor of Antifa,” described the shooter on X as “a right wing incel aggrieved white boy.”

The platform itself even helped boost some of these claims in the summaries it presented to users about the shooting, which highlighted the "anti-Trump messages" written on some of the shooter's weapons without mentioning all the other words and phrases.

The reality, according to extremism experts who are still trawling through the shooter's writings and digital footprint, is that there simply appears to have been no overarching ideology motivating the shooter. Instead, some have determined that the shooter was likely part of a growing group of nihilistic violent extremists whose sole motivation is the violence itself.

“They clearly state several times they are not doing this for any ideology or cause, they are simply doing this for the sake of violence, for their desire for notoriety, to know what it feels like to be one of their idols, to cause chaos and see the fear in the eyes of their victims,” Marc-André Argentino, an extremism researcher, wrote on Bluesky in reference to the diaries the shooter posted to YouTube hours before the attack.

Argentino also warned that nihilistic violent extremists can be performative, their messages and writings designed in part to trick people into boosting specific phrases out of context.

“These kind of attackers put on a performance, there is a script they follow and part of that script is trolling journalists or leaving ironic items in the hope someone in the media will bring on the Streisand effect to further spread their attack and be immortalized,” says Argentino.

But on X, where posting first and often is rewarded more than posting accurate and verified information, such warnings repeatedly fall on deaf ears.

“Context collapse is a rhetorical device that we see a lot in breaking news events—twisting real quotes or events to mislead or presenting it without the context in which it was said,” Nina Jankowicz, the former Biden administration disinformation czar who is now CEO of the American Sunlight Project, tells WIRED. “This is particularly prevalent on microblogging platforms like X, where users are disincentivized to read more than 280 characters or past the headline of a news item.”

Since Musk's takeover of Twitter in late 2022, almost every move he's taken with regards to content moderation has made it more difficult to find accurate and timely information on X.

Shortly after he bought the company, Musk removed the team responsible for tackling disinformation and replaced it with the crowdsourced Community Notes system, which made the misinformation situation worse, not better. More recently, users have relied on Grok to fact-check posts, which also hasn't helped. This lack of oversight, combined with a new verification system that rewards posts with the highest engagement over verified sources, has resulted in a toxic stew of disinformation flooding the platform during major global breaking news events. This was clearly seen at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and more recently during the protests in LA.

“There are no guardrails on X anymore, and it's become overrun by disinformation accounts and grifters,” says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists. “There are certain narratives about mass shootings that will instantly find homes on X, and nothing holds them back from spreading.”

NewDays, a Seattle startup using a generative AI therapy to treat people with mild dementia, today announced $7 million in funding to expand its service.

The company offers telehealth visits with clinicians once or twice a month combined with frequent, personalized conversations with an AI companion called Sunny. 

“We've had this large group of people that for the longest time has been told there is no cure, there is no drug that can fix your disease, there is no drug that can stop your disease,” said co-founder Babak Parviz. “Basically, you cannot do anything, just live with it … And what we're saying is that there is hope so you can actually take charge and meaningfully, actually do things that can make your life better and make life better for your loved ones.”

Parviz, who serves as CEO, launched the startup last year with Chief Innovation Officer Daniel Kelly. Parviz was a vice president at Amazon where he led the company's Grand Challenge initiative to discover new areas of operation. Prior to that role, he was at Google X and ran the Google Glass team. Kelly previously oversaw engineering teams at Amazon and Google X.

Both have dementia in their families and were eager to apply their tech expertise to providing care to people suffering from these diseases.

The need to support seniors with cognitive decline is massive. An estimated one-third of Americans 65 and older have either dementia or mild cognitive impairment, said the NewDays team. 

In a pilot project including more than 1,000 users, participants gave the startup's service a 4.5 out of 5 approval rating and 100% of respondents said they felt “better” or “a lot better” after using the program. The pilot ran in Washington, California and Florida and the service is now being offered in Texas as well.

NewDays' strategy for care is based on research from the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT), a study that provided virtual chats between healthcare providers and elderly participants that was led by a Harvard Medical School scientist. 

The project showed demonstrable benefits, slowing cognitive decline and reducing loneliness. But a model using human clinicians isn't scalable to serve the millions of Americans alone who need treatment and the costs would be prohibitive.

So NewDays offers AI-generated conversations that aim to mimic the treatment provided in I-CONECT.

As Parviz explains, the startup took clinically proven interventions and assigned 90%-95% of the work to AI while including a human clinician to supervise the care to make sure it's tailored and appropriate. The team has not conducted studies to determine efficacy.

The AI-led conversations are personalized to users and provide specific types of therapies including cognitive stimulation, cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation. The chats with Sunny will cover a users' interests and reminiscences. They'll practice skills needed in day-to-day life, like remembering a series of questions that come up naturally in conversations with friends and family. 

“We don't want to be a substitute for their social connections,” Parviz said. “We want to be an amplifier there and sort of the builder of confidence, so they can actually practice with us and then go to do more human-to-human conversations.”

Kelly said that his father has moderate dementia and enjoys talking with Sunny during stretches of 30 minutes or more. For his dad, the AI chats are a safe, non-judgmental place for interactions.

“He knows that this is a piece of software and he can open up to it and not be worried about making mistakes or repeating himself, and it just kind of allows him a lot of freedom to have conversations in ways that he might refrain from when he's interacting with other people,” Kelly said.

Another important benefit is Sunny is so engaging that Kelly's mom gets a break from caregiving during that time. 

People anywhere can try Sunny for free. The sessions with clinicians cost $150 per visit and unlimited use of Sunny is $99 per month. The service with clinicians is currently limited to Washington, California, Florida and Texas with plans for expansion.

NewDays' leaders said they do not share outside of the company any data collected in the conversations unless it's needed for someone's care.

Another startup using AI to deliver care to seniors called CloudMind is testing its technology in residential memory care homes. Multiple startups are offering AI-supported services for general mental health therapy and mindfulness, including Wysa, Woebot, Headspace and others.

Seattle's Madrona Venture Group and San Francisco's General Catalyst provided the seed round funding.

One of the first laptops with Intel's upcoming Panther Lake processors showed up at IFA 2025 with little fanfare. At Acer's press conference in Berlin, we found the Swift 16 AI, using the upcoming chip based on Intel's 18A process.

Acer Swift 16 AI

Processor

Intel's Panther Lake processors

Display

Up to 16-inch 3K, OLED, 120 Hz

Memory

Up to 32GB LPDDR5X

Connectivity

Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, Dual USB Type-C Thunderbolt 4

Trackpad

"World's Largest Haptic Trackpad with Stylus Support"

The system wasn't prominently featured in the press conference, which included an AMD-based Swift Air 16 alongside a number of gaming laptops. What we know is limited largely to the placard that sat next to the system at Acer's showcase.The system has a 16-inch, 3K OLED display (likely 2880 x 1800) with a 120 Hz refresh rate. It will support up to 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and the latest connectivity standards, including Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. However, it's using Thunderbolt 4 rather than Thunderbolt 5.The trackpad looks quite large (we don't have an exact size). Acer calls it the "largest haptic trackpad with stylus support," and the stylus support does heavy lifting. There aren't too many laptops that let you write on the touchpad.

This is the first system we've seen with Panther Lake that will head to market, but Acer is only saying that the system will launch in 2026. We have seen the chip's progress throughout the year. At CES 2025, ODMs like Wistron, Pegatron, and Compal showed designs for systems. Then at Computex, we saw the chips in Intel's own validation systems.At Deutsche Bank's 2025 Technology Conference, Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zisner said that "[Panther Lake] is still on track [to launch this year]... Things are looking good. Our first SKU will be out by the end of this year, and then we will have more SKUs in the first half of 2026, and you will really start to see the volume ramp as we kind of migrate through 2026." That's a long window where this laptop, as well as others using Panther Lake, could pop up. But it's likely we'll see more of Panther Lake at CES 2026 in early January.

Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. People just adore their reMarkable devices. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display.

Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately.

It's a handsome device that works exactly like a smaller version of the Paper Pro. About the only thing that I find a turnoff is the thick, inch-ish tall bezel on the bottom of the 1,696 x 954 color E Ink display. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. On the plus side, the density of the pixels is higher compared to the Paper Pro—264 PPI versus 229 PPI—which means content does appear just a smidge sharper. reMarkable says the Paper Pro Move can render the same 20,000 colors as the Paper Pro.

I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital.

The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. The handwriting-to-text recognition is also hit or miss—even AI can't perfectly convert the worst chicken scratch. Sorry, doctors, your unreadable handwriting is probably still unreadable to artificial intelligence.

 

The Paper Pro Move comes with 64GB of storage, which is good for up to 810 digital notebooks, and is the same amount you get in the Paper Pro. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.”

Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. It's not going to be for everyone—get an iPad if you want a multipurpose tablet that does messaging, videos, games, music, and more—but it's definitely for somebody who wants a focused device for jotting stuff down and will pay for it. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. The Paper Pro Move with Marker costs $449, but there's also a bundle that includes the Marker Plus, which comes with an eraser on the end, for $499. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

Invites to Perplexity's new AI-powered web browser, Comet, are one of the web's hottest commodities these days. The new product was made available first to the AI firm's $200-per-month Max subscribers and a small group of invitees. But now there's a new way to jump ahead on the waitlist. On Wednesday, PayPal announced it's giving its customers, including PayPal and Venmo users, early access to Comet as well as a free year's subscription to Perplexity's premium service, Perplexity Pro, normally $200 per year.

The browser, launched in July, offers an integrated AI assistant, AI-generated summaries of search results, product comparisons, and other features. 

While typically a co-marketing relationship isn't news, it's worth paying attention to this deal because of PayPal's ability to position Comet in front of millions of U.S. customers, and later, even more globally. 

The arrangement is part of an expanded partnership between PayPal and the AI provider, which benefits both companies in different ways. Earlier this summer, the two companies partnered on agentic commerce on Perplexity's platform, allowing PayPal or Venmo to check out instantly when they asked the AI to find products, book travel, or buy tickets.

For PayPal, the deal also has the potential to draw users to its apps with the promise of the Comet invite and free subscription, while also calling attention to a new subscriptions hub feature, which provides a single destination where users can view and manage their recurring subscriptions. (Alongside this, PayPal is running a promotion that pays out $50 to customers who link and pay for at least three subscriptions through its service.)

Meanwhile, Perplexity gains increased exposure at a time when AI agents are battling for attention, and AI-powered browsers are aiming to disrupt a market currently dominated by Chrome. It could also help Perplexity gain more paid subscribers, as users may either forget to cancel or actively decide to stay subscribed when the free year of Perplexity Pro is up.

To receive the free 12-month subscription and Comet invite, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to access the offer directly in their respective apps. Users only get one invite per PayPal account, and they can't already be Perplexity Pro customers. 

“Our partnership with Perplexity gives PayPal and Venmo customers early access to one of the most anticipated AI browsers and dynamic subscriptions,” said Diego Scotti, general manager of the Consumer Group at PayPal, in a prepared statement. “It's exciting to deliver offers and tools that our customers request most, meeting their needs and helping them navigate their financial lives with greater simplicity, added convenience, and even more rewards.”

The offer is valid through the end of 2025 and is only available to U.S. customers at launch, PayPal notes. It will roll out to international markets later in the month. After customers sign up for Perplexity Pro, they'll receive information on how to immediately download and install the Comet browser. 

The subscriptions hub is available this week to all U.S. customers after a prior ramp-up period.

27% increase in GPU shipments, 21.6% increase for CPUs


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The total number of GPUs sold for the second quarter of 2025 hit 11.6 million units, while desktop PC CPUs went up to 21.7 million units according to a Jon Peddie Research report. This is a 27% increase in graphics card shipments and a 21.6% jump in CPU shipments from the last quarter, which is a change from the usual drop in deliveries we've seen in recent years.

“AIB prices dropped for midrange and entry-level, while high-end AIB prices increased, and most retail suppliers ran out of stock. This is very unusual for the second quarter,” said Jon Peddie Research president Dr. Jon Peddie. “We think it is a continuation of higher prices expected due to the tariffs and buyers trying to get ahead of that.”

As for the three major GPU manufacturers, Nvidia still has the lead, taking in 94% of the market — an increase of 2.1% over the previous quarter — while AMD is at a distant second place with 6%. This is still a much better position than Intel, though, whose market share is so small it did not even register on the chart.

Intel was the first to launch its latest-generation GPUs, putting them on sale in December 2024. On the other hand, both Nvidia and AMD released their latest generation GPUs during the first quarter of the year, with the former continuing to release its value models well into the second and third quarters of 2025. However, all these releases were marred by shortages, with buyers unable to find units at SRP. This was true even as late as the start of the third quarter of this year, with prices for mid-range cards not normalizing until last month.

Still, it seems that gamers were willing to spend cash on upgrading their systems, as the data shows. The report even said that the overall attach rate for desktop PCs increased to 154%, meaning 1.54 GPUs were sold for every CPU bought by customers. So, aside from people building totally new PCs (or buying pre-built), it seems that there was also a good number purchasing new graphics cards to upgrade their systems.

Jon Peddie Research suggests that this increase was driven by tariff concerns, especially as the U.S. government has been announcing and delaying massive import taxes on many semiconductor products, including GPUs. Despite this, the research firm anticipates that the GPU market will decrease by 5.4% between 2024 and 2028.

If the projected shrinkage of the market holds, this increase is likely a temporary blip driven by tariffs and the artificial GPU shortage. This slump could be driven by several factors, including gamers leaving (or even not getting introduced to) PC gaming or the arrival of processors with powerful on-board graphics, like AMD's Strix Halo chips.

For the past two years, the U.S. has been supplying tens of billions of dollars worth of military aid to Israel so that it can bomb the living crap out of the civilian population in Gaza. Now, as multiple human rights organizations accuse Israel of committing genocide in the region, America's billionaire developer president seems to think it's time to spin the bloodshed into real estate gold.

The Washington Post has managed to get its hands on a 38-page prospectus that outlines an alleged U.S. plan for Gaza, now that the region has been reduced to rubble. The plan, dubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, is said to be circulating the Trump administration right now. It involves “temporarily relocating” the region's two million Palestinian inhabitants so that a series of high-tech smart cities can be constructed—an agenda that would appear to be consistent with prior comments made by Trump, who, in February, claimed he wanted to transform the corpse-strewn wreckage of Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”

The espoused plan is complicated, but in essence, it would convert Gaza into a “trusteeship” administered by the U.S. for a period of at least 10 years. During that time, the Gazan population would be largely moved out so that a big, westernized urban hub could be constructed. The Post notes that these relocations would occur through so-called “voluntary” departures, or—for those who choose not to leave voluntarily—a process whereby they are placed in “restricted, secured zones inside the enclave during reconstruction.” Additionally, it sounds a lot like the Gazans who currently own land in the region are going to be offered a cryptocurrency token in exchange for the legal right to convert it into commercial real estate. The Post reports:

Those who own land would be offered a digital token by the trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to finance a new life elsewhere or eventually redeemed for an apartment in one of six to eight new “AI-powered, smart cities” to be built in Gaza. Each Palestinian who chooses to leave would be given a $5,000 cash payment and subsidies to cover four years of rent elsewhere, as well as a year of food.

Those supposed “smart cities” will include “residences, commerce, light industry and other facilities, including clinics and hospitals, schools and more.” Additionally, other infrastructure will be built, including several high-tech manufacturing hubs, ports, highways, and something called “The Elon Musk Smart Manufacturing Zone.” Eventually, the expelled Gazans will be invited back to the new metropolises, the document claims:

Gazan families who remain, or leave and then return after residential areas are completed to exchange their land tokens, would be offered ownership of new 1,800-square-foot apartments the plan values at $75,000 each.

The plan appears to involve a substantial amount of effort (and, presumably, money) from the U.S., which is interesting, since it seems like the primary beneficiary of the development will be Israel. That said, the exact financials of the deal aren't totally clear. The Washington Post writes that the plan “purports to require no U.S. government funding and offer significant profit to investors.” However, the prospectus also notes that the plan requires “$70B-$100B in public investment, triggering a $35-$65B private investment.” The document mentions substantial sums of money coming from state-backed companies in Saudi Arabia. When questioned by Gizmodo about the cost in public dollars of the leaked plan, the State Department declined to comment but did not deny the authenticity of the document. The circulated plan appears to be just one of several currently being considered.

One of the most recent estimates places the Gaza death toll at well over 60,000, with women and children accounting for about half of the dead. Another 145,870 people are said to have been wounded. Additionally, a recent study from Brown University found that Israel has killed more journalists in the past two years than the “U.S. Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined.” On Monday, the world's leading genocide scholars' organization declared that Israel was committing genocide.

Finnish quantum computing startup IQM is now a unicorn: The company just raised more than $300 million in a Series B funding round that was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. investment firm focused on cybersecurity.

A university spinout, IQM builds quantum computers meant for on-premises installations as well as a cloud platform that taps this hardware. The company has already sold its quantum computers to enterprises in APAC and the U.S., but its strongest market remains Europe. 

That's what this round is intended to change: The startup is planning to use the fresh cash for both a commercial push as well as R&D to align with the market's evolving understanding of what's needed to turn advances in quantum science into practical impact.

To win U.S. clients in the face of competition from big tech companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft, IQM knows it must accelerate its roadmap for both hardware and software. According to its co-CEO and co-founder Jan Goetz, this means investing more in the company's chip fabrication facilities, as well as in software development and error correction research.

Error correction, the ability to detect and fix errors inherent in quantum systems, is a hot topic right now, given that the very notion of what makes a quantum computer competitive is being redefined — being able to compute a large number of qubits is less of a holy grail today than it used to be. “It's always a trade-off between number of qubits and quality and reliability,” Goetz said.

Navigating this trade-off will be critical for developing real-world uses for quantum computing that have long been envisioned but weren't prioritized. But now that quantum advances over traditional supercomputers no longer seem the stuff of sci-fi, companies like IQM are trying to make sure their computers will have practical applications sooner than later.

Reliability aside, IQM's roadmap aligns with the sector's growing focus on the software layer that will be required to put quantum computing in the hands of its first end users: experts with PhDs in fields that are not quantum computing.

An immediate software-related objective for IQM is to build a developer platform that, Goetz says, is akin to “an SDK for quantum computing,” with the goal to “bring in as many developers as possible to start working on our machines.” As an alternative to IBM's approach, this platform will rely on Qrisp, an open source project by Berlin-based research institute FOKUS. 

Second to its headquarters in Finland, Germany is where most of IQM's 300 staffers are located, with a large R&D unit working out of Munich, Goetz said. “But with this round, we want to grow the team and create more commercial traction, especially in the U.S.”

In the future, the company is considering becoming “a bit more operational in the U.S.,” said Goetz, adding that tariffs could play a role in this decision. “One thing that we are considering is that if we sell more systems in the U.S., we could do local assembly.”

But IQM will remain focused on sales in the U.S. for the time being. The company recently sold an on-premise quantum computer to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a science lab run by the U.S. Department of Energy. 

According to Ten Eleven Ventures' co-founder and managing general partner, Alex Doll, there's a strong overlap between the investment firm's thesis and IQM's focus. “Quantum computing will be a pivotal pillar in the next era of cybersecurity and computational innovation,” said Doll, who is also joining IQM's board as part of the fundraise. 

The fact that Ten Eleven Ventures has a strong network in the U.S. made it a strong fit for the startup, Goetz said.

The Series B also saw investment from Finnish investment firm Tesi, as well as Schwarz Group, Winbond Electronics Corporation, EIC, Bayern Kapital, and World Fund. Per IQM, this new round brings its total funding to date to $600 million.

Goetz feels the size of the round was justified by the commercial and technical milestones that the startup hit in the last few months. “We are now the company that has sold the most quantum computers globally, in all major continents,” he said.

In absolute numbers, that's still small — in late 2024, the company hit a production milestone of 30 quantum computers. That only serves to remind that the sector still has a long way to go before it reaches a wider audience.

Still, IQM's 54-qubit chips are already in use at computing centers, research labs, universities, and enterprises, and Goetz said that the company is now on track to deploying the first 150-qubit systems — a fact that seems to matter much more to him than IQM becoming a unicorn.

If the first trailer for 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple was just the words “Aren't you excited you only had to wait three months to see this footage?” it would be enough. The fact is, in modern Hollywood, it's incredibly rare for a movie to come out in June and for its sequel to be heading to theaters six months later, in January. But that's what happened with 28 Years Later and its sequel, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, which will be out January 16, 2026. And, lucky for us, the trailer is much, much more than a single sentence.

The Bone Temple is directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman, The Marvels) and picks up where Danny Boyle's previous film left off. After Spike (Alfie Williams) decided to leave his family and its safe village to explore the world, he ran into the insane Jimmy (Jack O'Connell) and his jumpsuit-wearing gang. The film will see Spike pulled between Jimmy's world as well as Dr. Kelson's (Ralph Fiennes) world. Here's your first taste.

After Danny Boyle surprised us with this summer's decidedly human follow-up to 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, The Bone Temple definitely seems like a less radical departure. But, we're fine with it, simply because it looks like the next chapter in this story. We follow and learn more about Spike; Dr. Kelson; the terrifying, well-endowed zombie named Samson (Chi Lewis-Parry); and, of course, Jimmy. Jimmy was the first character we encountered in the previous film, and after his surprising return at the end, it'll be very interesting to see where things with him go next.

Oh, and don't forget The Bone Temple is where we'll finally see the return of Jim, the first zombie survivor, played by Oscar winner Cillian Murphy. He shows up at some point in this story and, if this film is a success, will play a larger role in the trilogy capper. Do you think this film is going to do well enough to get there?

A survey released Monday by a trade-in comparison website found that 30% of iPhone owners are “considering” switching to foldable phones by Apple's competitors if the company waits until 2026 to launch a foldable of its own.

According to the survey by SellCell, 20.1% of iPhone owners would consider switching to a Samsung foldable and 10.2% to a Google one if Apple waits until next year to introduce its take on the form factor.

The survey of more than 2,000 U.S. iPhone owners also found that 3.3% were waiting for an iPhone foldable before upgrading to their next iPhone.

Nevertheless, the survey suggested a strong upgrade cycle ahead for Apple, with 68.3% of iPhone owners saying they will be buying an iPhone 17, which is expected to be announced next week.

“We don't see the lack of a foldable product significantly impacting Apple's iPhone unit sales,” said William Kerwin, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar Research Services in Chicago.

“We continue to see foldable phones as a relative market niche, with high price points and low volumes,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This is part of why Apple has held off on the form factor so far.”

“Additionally,” he continued, “the foldable screens have thus far lacked the quality Apple would require to release its own. We think they will come out with a foldable, but expect it to be a lower-volume product compared to the flagship iPhone lineup.”

“We don't see a future foldable hampering sales for the iPhone 17 lineup this fall,” he added. “In fact, we expect Apple to release a thin version of the iPhone that could get consumers excited about a new form factor for the first time in a few years.”

Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that “considering” switching was a weak measure for measuring loyalty. “There's a big leap between considering and actually switching,” he told TechNewsWorld.

He also doubted that 30% of iPhone owners would switch because “nowhere near 30% of even high-end Android users are choosing foldables.”

“We don't see a massive shift from iOS to Android or from iPhones to foldables,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for EMEA devices at IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass.

“The numbers on foldables are still very low,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The percentage of foldables is less than 2% of the 1.2 billion smartphones sold every year. We expect that to grow faster when Apple launches a foldable device.”

“But at the moment, we don't see the intentions of those responding to the survey materializing in real sales,” he noted.

This is another case of the market waiting for Apple to verify this form factor, he added. “I'm sure there's a lot more users waiting for Apple to launch their foldable device rather than rushing now to a foldable from Samsung or other vendors,” he said. “If someone is on iOS, it's very hard for them to move to Android, as well as when someone is on Android, it's quite hard to adapt to iOS.”

Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., explained that foldable smartphones are a niche market worldwide.

“In 2023, they accounted for approximately 1.4% of the overall smartphone market,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This share is expected to slightly increase to 1.5% in 2024. The market share is projected to exceed 2% only by 2025.”

Current U.S. iPhone model shares show that larger-screen formats like Pro Max and Plus already make up more than a third of sales, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a market research firm in Chicago.

Foldables remain a niche, but they're growing steadily, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas.

“Samsung has done the heavy lifting in normalizing the format, and Google has followed with its Pixel Fold and has made enormous engineering inroads on its hinge designs,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Still, foldables make up a small percentage of overall smartphone shipments, mostly appealing to early adopters and power users.”

While foldables are a niche market, Apple's pace in embracing the form factor, as indicated by the SellCell survey, has frustrated many of its faithful. “The SellCell survey reveals a palpable sense of impatience,” Vena said. “About a third of iPhone users are at least open to switching if Apple delays too long. That signals not mass rebellion, but enough frustration that Apple can't ignore it.”

He acknowledged, however, that the foot-dragging was “characteristic of Apple at its best.” “The company typically waits until a new category is mature before jumping in,” he explained. “Foldables are still ironing out durability, cost, and software optimization issues. Apple wants to deliver a foldable that feels polished from day one, not like a tech experiment.”

Creative Strategies' Bajarin agreed. “Apple is very disciplined and will only bring one out when they believe they can have one that is worthy of their brand,” he said. “There are still issues with foldable screens and other areas that emerge over time. Apple would want the technology to meet their high standards, and that is why they have not released one yet.”

“Apple is unlikely to release a foldable until they have a guarantee that they're not going to see a wave of returns,” added Andrew Cornwall, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.

“Traditionally, iPhone users have been a lot less willing to overlook UX imperfections,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They may not be as accepting of a line down the middle of the screen as their Android counterparts.”

“The SellCell survey appears to demonstrate some discontent, although we'd describe it as curiosity about foldable phones rather than unhappiness with the current iPhone models,” observed Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

“Upgrade intent is difficult to understand,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Consumers want new stuff all the time, so we prefer to look at actual behavior.”

“Apple makes significant form factor changes, like to a foldable phone, only when it is absolutely certain it has mastered the tech,” he added. “Until now, and probably for the time being, foldable phones are more of a novelty than a critical part of their model lineup.”

It's only this year that “no compromise” foldables, such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, the Magic E5, the Pixel, and others, have been introduced in the market, explained IDC's Jeronimo. “We believe the category will grow much faster,” he continued. “And that's why Apple is entering the market at the right time next year. It wouldn't make sense to bring a foldable device to market when the technology was not yet ready, and there probably wasn't enough demand for them to sell in large volumes.”

“Apple may end up redefining the foldable space when it finally enters, much as it did with smartwatches and tablets — much to the ironic chagrin of Samsung,” added Vena. “The question is less whether Apple will make a foldable, and more whether it can make one mainstream. When that happens, foldables could go from niche curiosity to everyday device.”

I love a list. I can happily write the same to-do list in six different places in a single day (good thing I test digital notebooks and paper planners). I often find myself rewriting the little brainstorms in my Notes app because the ideas are still banging around in my brain, asking to be let free onto a page, digital or not.

But not every brainstorm or list needs a full-size page. That's where ReMarkable's latest digital notebook comes in. The reMarkable Paper Pro Move ($449) takes the same technology as the company's flagship Paper Pro notebook—color e-ink screen included—and puts it on a much smaller screen. With a 7.3-inch e-paper display and a gentle front light, it's a good size that fits in your hand as you jot down notes or an idea while you're on the go—the classic reporter's notepad turned digital. Turns out, that's exactly what I needed.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is identical to the Paper Pro that launched last year in technology, just in a smaller profile (no small feat). You can write in color, add color highlights, and it has a soft frontlight for writing in dim environments. The front light doesn't get as bright as a Kindle or smartphone, but it does make the screen legible.

The Marker stylus that comes included is the same, and as usual, you can upgrade to the Marker Plus, which lets you use the other end of the stylus as an eraser (a must-have, in my opinion). It magnetically sticks to the right side of the tablet, and that's how it connects and charges. Speaking of, the Paper Pro Move retains the same two-week battery life claim as the Paper Pro. Much will depend on how much you use it, but I expect you'll probably have to charge it two times a month, three if you're rigorously using it every day.

The Move is 4 inches by a little over 7 inches, and weighs only 8 ounces (though it weighs 12 ounces with a case and stylus on), with a 16:9 aspect ratio in portrait mode, and a 4:3 aspect ratio in landscape mode to match ReMarkable's larger models. The Move's longest side is the same length as the Paper Pro's shortest side. It's the smallest of ReMarkable's tablets, but it has the highest pixels per inch, coming in at 264 ppi, while the Paper Pro is 229 ppi. That makes it sharper, but I didn't see a huge screen difference looking at the paper-like screens side by side.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move can sync with your existing ReMarkable notes, but it has its own special page size designed for the smaller form. Notebooks I started on the Move and then pulled up on my Paper Pro had a little gray bar on the right side, showing that the page size was smaller than the Paper Pro had room for. I saw similar gray bars if I pulled up a PDF or document on the Move and zoomed out to see it in its entirety. Usually, you won't see these bars on the Move if you're opening up a standard set of notes. The notebooks you started on ReMarkable's larger e-ink devices will adjust to fit onto the Move's smaller screen in portrait mode, and resume their normal size if you rotate to landscape mode.

The Move responds quickly to whichever orientation you move it to, whether it's in your hand or flat on a desk. Recent software updates actually make all ReMarkable devices more responsive to orientation adjustments—my larger Paper Pro used to ignore rotations until I activated the keyboard on the attached Type Folio case, but now it flips around just as fast as the Move.

Unsurprisingly, it's the size that really makes the ReMarkable Paper Pro Move shine. It was easy to grab and write down notes from an impromptu call with an exterminator after an ant infestation in my pantry (nothing like some late summer desperation from my neighborhood ant colonies).

It was comfortable to stack on top of a Hobonichi Techo and carry around the house without feeling like my hand could drop either item, and layered nicely on top of my planner when it was laid open if I wanted to fill out my planner's weekly spread and then write down my extended to-do list on the Move. It can fit into my favorite small handbag, and just about every handbag I own besides my shorter belt bags. The lighter weight and slim size made it comfortable to grab and write anywhere, especially compared to the Paper Pro and its heavy Type Folio case.

The Move was less convenient for PDFs and typed materials, but not impossible to use. Already typed copy on a different ReMarkable adjusts to fit the Move's screen, which felt very much like reading on a Kindle. It was more effort to zoom in and annotate or edit something on a PDF, like changing a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet. While you can't type directly on the Move, you can convert your handwritten text into type, which works quickly and does a good job recognizing block writing and cursive alike.

The color is also a really fun addition that you won't find on every digital notebook. It paired nicely with the color coding I like to do in my paper planners to help visualize different sections, though you only have nine colors for pen tools (including black and white) and six colors for the highlighter (including gray). It's not as wide a gamut as you'll get with real-life highlighter packs, but still enough color to spice things up.

ReMarkable is always adding more features to its devices via software updates, but you'll need to subscribe to ReMarkable Connect ($3 a month) to enjoy most of them. Earlier this year, the company debuted ReMarkable Methods, which added a new library of templates and workbooks designed by users and even the BulletJournal.com team. These are accessible on ReMarkable's website, and you can choose which ones to add to your devices.

There's another new feature for Connect subscribers: Handwriting Search, which can search through your notes even if they aren't typed. The search primarily focuses on the title of your notebooks rather than the content within them, but it opens up a lot of opportunities to find your content. It takes a little while to scan your notes, but after that, I could easily search words or even parts of words to find results; searching “phan” would pull up my notes from the Dungeons & Dragons campaign The Lost Mines of Phandelver, while searching “Friday” pulled up various to-do lists I'd written.

Once you select the note that best matches, the Move will open the note to the page with that word and highlight it. You can flip through how many times a word appears in the notes, too, with a set of arrows that appear in the right-hand corner of the note after you use Handwriting Search. This feature is only available if you join the Beta program, but it will roll out later this year. You won't need a Move to access it, but you will need to be a Connect subscriber.

The ReMarkable Paper Pro Move is my new favorite digital notebook. It's the perfect size to grab and jot down random ideas and a complicated list, and you can still zoom out to draw larger sketches or switch to landscape mode.

If you're a student looking to type notes, the Paper Pro is still a better pick. But compared to the cheaper, older ReMarkable 2, the Move's writing experience is smoother, plus the colors are a blast and make for great note-taking support. It's more affordable than the Paper Pro, and a good size for anyone mostly looking to jot down everyday notes and tasks rather than long-form distraction-free writing. But keep in mind, this is still a $449 notepad. Sometimes, all you need is a $25 reporter's notebook.

Nvidia CEO was in Taiwan for 13 hours.

Two weeks ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a surprise visit to Taiwan where he met TSMC for a few hours. It was a short stay but it sparked customary rumors pertaining to why he was there. Originally, it was thought to be just a routine check-up on the upcoming Vera Rubin chips that TSMC is manufacturing for Nvidia. However, amidst the thought pool, a report had claimed that Huang was actually there to deliver a message from President Trump over revenue sharing — a claim that has now been shut down by TSMC.

Earlier in August, the Trump administration struck an informal deal with semiconductor companies such as AMD and Nvidia to share profits. In exchange for permission to sell their chips in China, these companies would give 15% of the profit to the government. TSMC, so far, does not fall under this arrangement and that's where the original rumors stem from. Jensen's visit was claimed to be moonlighting as an envoy for the U.S. government, conveying some sort of message through a mutually important liaison.

 




According to FocusTaiwan, TSMC has since rejected these rumors and clarified that Huang was there to attend a belated birthday event for founder Morris Chang. Huang also gave an internal speech to the workers at TSMC. Later that day, CEOs from both sides, along with other suites at the company, also had dinner where Taiwanese media caught Huang and TSMC CEO C.C. Wei engaging in lighthearted banter over who'd pay for dinner. Wei said he'd pick up the check if Huang agrees to his wafer pricing, to which Huang cheekily replied with "I agree with your wafer pricing."

At the time of the visit, TSMC was asked about the Trump administration's unprecedented move to acquire stakes in American companies, sometimes by converting grants into equity, and CEO Wei replied with "They have already announced that they will not take shares." Apparently, there is no need for secretive talks or any back-alley deals because, ultimately, TSMC falls outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Owing to this, TSMC reiterated yesterday that it has smooth and positive communication with the White House.

Modder makes you wonder what expandable RAM would look like on modern-day GPUs

Expandable memory has arguably been one of the most desired features users have wanted in GPUs over the past 20 years. GDDR memory stubbornly remains soldered, but some people apparently want the thrill of plugging a DIMM into a GPU regardless. Bitsandpcs.Tech on Facebook recently showed off the work of a modder who went the extra mile to 3D-print a fan shroud that incorporates a single DDR5 slot on the side.

Before you start second-guessing yourself, no, this mod doesn't result in extra memory capacity. Modern-day GPUs don't support adding extra memory like you would do on a motherboard, especially DDR5 memory, which is significantly slower than GDDR7.

 




The modder stripped down an existing GeForce RTX GPU of some kind and replaced the card's exterior shroud with a completely custom 3D-printed design featuring Asus and ROG branding. Some of the card's shroud looks like it is inspired by the Asus Dual-series, particularly the sides of the shroud, which have the same shape and design as Asus' dual-fan graphics cards.

The selling point of the modded graphics card is located in the front, where (what would have been) the right intake fan has been removed to make room for a single DDR5 slot. The slot sits at an angle with the left side resting just above the left ROG-fan, and the right resting underneath it.

Not only is there a RAM slot, but whoever modded the graphics card went the extra mile to also wire the RAM slot with power so that RGB-equipped DDR5 memory would at least light up. The end result is a white ROG-branded graphics card with a RAM stick on the side that accompanies the GPU's internal RGB lighting, assuming the RAM stick installed boasts RGB to begin with.

The modder's 3D printed creation might have been made just for fun, but graphics cards with upgradable RAM have already been done before, for real. In the 90s, several graphics card designs offered upgradable memory slots that could double the GPU's available memory pool if used. One such video card was the ATI 3D Rage II, which incorporated a single SGRAM slot on the card, allowing users to double the card's memory capacity if needed.

Sadly, upgradable GPU memory went away by the 2000s. There is no single reason why it went away, but cost, complexity, performance requirements and cooling issues are all likely reasons why the board makers at the time dropped the feature. Adding expandable memory slots to a graphics card would add a significant amount of complexity to a manufacturer's board design. On top of this, board makers would have to figure out a cooler design that could work with extra memory slots as well.

The closest thing we have to expandable memory today is memory modding. Skilled GPU repair technicians and modders have actively been upgrading modern Nvidia and AMD GPUs with larger capacity memory ICs. We've seen this with a plethora of GPU models to date, including the RX 5600 XT, RTX 2070, and RTX 3070.

Initially for R&D use, until later this decade where it will transition to production

SK hynix and ASML early on Wednesday announced that they had assembled the industry's first Twinscan NXE:5200B High-NA EUV lithography system at the company's fab M16 in Icheon, South Korea. The device will initially serve as a development vehicle for next-generation process technologies, but eventually it will be used for mass production of DRAM using leading-edge process technologies a few years down the line.

For SK hynix, the assembly of one of the industry's first Twinscan NXE:5200B EUV system with 0.55 numerical aperture optics means that it leaps ahead of its arch-rivals Micron and Samsung as well as the vast majority of companies across the broad semiconductor industry, many of which still must adopt existing EUV systems with a 0.33 numerical aperture.

"We expect the addition of the critical infrastructure to bring our technological vision we have been pursuing into reality," Cha Seon Yong, head of R&D at SK hynix. "We aim to enhance our leadership in the AI memory space with the cutting-edge technology required by the fast-growing AI and next-generation computing markets."

ASML's Twinscan EXE:5200N with a 0.55 NA lens achieves 8nm resolution — compared to 13nm on current Low-NA EUV tools — enabling 1.7 times smaller transistors and 2.9 times higher transistor density in a single exposure. While Low-NA tools can match this with costly multi-patterning, High-NA EUV simplifies lithography steps, albeit at the cost of new technical challenges.

Given the capabilities of High-NA EUV machines that allow chipmakers to avoid double or triple EUV patterning, the NXE:5200B will initially be used to fast-track prototyping of next-gen DRAMs to be made using process technologies that rely on existing Low-NA EUV and DUV tools. Only then the tool will be used for development of fabrication processes that will actually mandate usage of High-NA EUV equipment for proper yields and cycle time. ASML estimated in one of the presentations for its investors that DRAM makers will transit to High-NA EUV tools in the 2030s.

Rapid prototyping greatly speeds up development of next-generation process technologies. The High-NA EUV machine enables detailed prototyping of DRAM structures (e.g., capacitor trenches, bitlines, wordlines) at a higher pace than is possible on existing Low-NA EUV tools, which gives a critical boost to SK hynix's R&D.

In the long-term future (towards 2030s), SK hynix can use this tool to test patterning limits, develop new layouts, and evaluate new materials it will need for fabrication nodes that obligate usage of High-NA EUV tools, well in advance of needing to commit to full High-NA EUV-based production.

The assembly of ASML's first Twinscan NXE:5200B machine at a client site (in this case SK hynix's M16, which is indeed a mass production facility) marks a milestone for the company as previously it built Twinscan NXE:5000 machines at Intel's D1X development fab near Hillsboro, Oregon, where they have produced tens of thousands of wafers already. The NXE:5000 systems are considered pre-production, but they can be upgraded to gain performance required for high-volume manufacturing.

"High-NA EUV is a critical technology that opens the next chapter of the semiconductor industry," said Kim Byeong-Chan, ASML's head of customer team. "ASML will closely collaborate with SK hynix to bring forward the innovation of the next-generation memory."

In the end, graphic-obsessed gamers only really care about maximizing frame rates. But that's not all gaming laptops are good for. If you ignore the blinking RGB lights most gamer devices stuff into every crevice, they pack high-end CPUs and GPUs built for intensive graphics processing—handy for artists or AI developers. Whereas there are plenty of workstation laptops with high-end specs built for working stiffs, Acer said screw it and gave us a business-centric laptop that looks like a gamer's dream device, even if it packs features players couldn't give a fig for.

The Acer Predator Helios 18P is the latest in the company's tank-like high-end mobile gaming rigs. The new 18-inch laptop—itself a refresh of the Predator Helios 18 announced at CES—packs extra features that would leave most gamers scratching their heads. It's rocking Intel vPro, the chipmaker's business security and management suite. Along with up to a whopping 192GB of ECC memory—a type of RAM that can correct small memory errors (which is important for those working on servers or other critical data infrastructure)—the Predator Helios 18P contains up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 mobile GPU. That CPU and GPU combo offered stellar performance in super-heavy laptops like the MSI Titan 18 HX. The extra business-specific bits and bobs plus the optional up to 6TB of storage would simply be extraneous to anybody who intends to supplant their gaming desktop with a device that's slightly more portable.

See Acer Predator Helios 18P at Amazon

Announced at IFA 2025, there's no price or availability yet, but I can't imagine combining a gaming laptop with a business laptop (normally two of the priciest PC options available today) will make the Predator Helios 18P cheap. At least it will make your games look nice with a 4K mini LED display, though it only runs up to a 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop weighs in at 7.7 pounds, so all you suits with gaming ambitions should start your forearm exercises early. Business types may need to disable all those fancy lights while plugging away in the office, but for work-from-home setups, the Predator Helios 18P could be your one and only PC.

If you were looking for something on the opposite end, Acer's new 16-inch Swift 16 Air seems too light to be real. Despite the Apple-like name, the Swift 16 Air weighs in at less than 1 kg, or 2.18 pounds. That's easily one of the lightest laptops of this size available. It's more frisbee-like than the 2.7-pound 13-inch MacBook Air and is somehow even lighter than the ultrathin Asus Zenbook A14 that first debuted at CES 2025 earlier this year. That laptop was one of the lightest in its class, but Acer's Swift 16 Air, with its magnesium-aluminum shell, has a larger wingspan and still will barely feel like anything in your backpack.

See Acer Swift 16 at Amazon

You can toss the Swift 16 Air around to your heart's content, but eventually you'll need to open it up and use it. The notebook either comes with a 60Hz IPS LCD screen or a 120Hz AMOLED display. The IPS is the lighter of the two options, while the AMOLED version clocks in at 2.43 pounds. Inevitably, you'll want the OLED not just for the deeper blacks and better contrast, but for the higher 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. The Swift 16 Air features up to an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU and 32GB of RAM. All that sounds pretty standard for today's light laptops. Even though the laptop is thin at 16.5mm, there's still a fair number of ports, including two USB-C, one USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.

It's still a very thin and light design, and that will demand some trade-offs. The Acer Swift 16 Air's 50Wh battery seems paltry compared to the Zenbook A14's 70Wh battery. Acer said the Swift 16 Air gets 13 hours of battery life in video playback tests. Real-life experience long ago taught us that real use—even completing regular browsing tasks—will deplete the battery sooner.

That battery life will be one of the biggest concerns for anybody thinking of dropping their money on a new laptop. Unfortunately, Acer isn't ready to share any details about when people in the U.S. can buy the Swift 16 Air or how much it will cost.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses that affect both males and females, but research in Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica indicates that sex may influence the characteristics and course of these conditions.

The research included 1,516 individuals from the multicenter PsyCourse Study: 543 with bipolar disorder, 517 with schizophrenia, and 456 healthy controls.

Several differences between groups and sexes were identified in age at diagnosis, age at treatment, illness duration, illicit drug use, and smoking. For example, females in the schizophrenia group were older than males at first outpatient treatment compared with females in the bipolar disorder group. Moreover, those who were older at first outpatient treatment presented a longer duration of illness. Regarding substance use, the highest rates were observed in males with schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance than those with schizophrenia. Among individuals with bipolar disorder, females reported better performance in verbal memory and psychomotor speed than males. Both females and males with serious mental illnesses showed higher rates of thyroid alterations than healthy controls.

Our findings reveal a clear message: sex-sensitive treatment is essential for improving clinical outcomes, promoting healthy habits, and managing comorbidities."

Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has developed a human vascularized liver cancer-on-a-chip model to evaluate vessel remodeling and cell death in response to embolic agents. This novel platform reflects the microenvironment of liver tumors, particularly a functional and perfusable microvasculature that can be embolized. This powerful in vitro tool aligns with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) efforts to reduce animal testing and promote alternative methods, including microfluidic devices that mimic human organs.

Embolic treatment for liver cancer is a minimally invasive therapy delivered through a catheter into the hepatic artery to block tumors' blood supply and starve them of oxygen and nutrients. This approach can be combined with chemotherapy or radioactive beads to enhance its effect. However, the development of novel embolic agents is often optimized in animal models, which differ significantly from humans at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels.

A vascularized cancer-on-a-chip offers a human-relevant, ethically sound alternative to animal testing, aligning with the growing push for non-animal technologies in preclinical drug development."

Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator

To bridge this gap, Dr. Jucaud's lab developed a vascularized embolization-on-a-chip model that replicates the microvascular networks of liver cancer. This platform incorporates a tumor spheroid surrounded by perfusable capillary-mimicking blood vessels in a microfluidic organ-on-a-chip system. To mimic the embolization of the hepatic artery, the inflow of perfusable microvasculatures can be occluded with embolic agents loaded via a catheter. The efficacy of embolic agents is easily measured through the quantification of tumor cell death, vessel regression, cytokine release profile, and cell-surface marker identification.

"By integrating functional blood vessels into a liver cancer-on-a-chip system, we can replicate the unique vascular dynamics that drive hepatocellular carcinoma growth and response to embolic therapies, something traditional cell cultures and animal models cannot achieve," said Dr. Huu Tuan Nguyen, first author of the publication.

"This platform allows us to deliver embolic agents directly into microengineered tumor vessels, closely mimicking the clinical procedure and providing unprecedented insight into how tumors respond at the cellular and tissue level," said Dr. Vadim Jucaud. "Beyond therapy testing, the vascularized model provides a powerful tool to study how embolization alters tumor hypoxia, immune infiltration, and angiogenic signaling, all of which are critical to advancing precision oncology."

This innovative model provides insight into embolization dynamics and opens the door to next-generation embolic agents, potentially accelerating translation of discoveries into clinical treatments for liver cancer.

It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, deepfakes, and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don't know seeking to profit from your behavior.

But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.

“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 video posted on the social platform X. “They're pressured to follow the money, not the science.”

Doctors and public health officials have been fielding questions on this topic for years.

A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drive pediatricians' childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.

Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off vaccines is counterintuitive.

“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you'd see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.

It costs money to stock, store, and administer a vaccine.

Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars' worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines' temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.

“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Pediatric Workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”

When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and its administration, Hackell said.

Many pediatricians also participate in a federal program that provides vaccines free of charge to eligible children whose parents can't afford them. Participating in that program isn't profitable because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don't cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it's valuable for patients, Hackell said.

When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don't make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.

Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children's Health Care System in Texas, said a practice's ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its situation.

Terk's practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn't lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.

Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice's patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies' payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.

“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.

Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics' or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended vaccine schedule.

Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.

“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn't wish that on anyone.”

Still, your pediatrician will consider your child's health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.

For example, a few children — less than 1% — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.

“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child's doctor,” Diasio said. “Don't get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”

The Trump administration has given notice that political appointees, rather than scientists, will ultimately decide who gets grant money from the world's largest biomedical research funder — the federal government's National Institutes of Health.

In an Aug. 7 executive order, President Donald Trump announced that political officers would have the power to summarily cancel any federal grant, including for scientific work, that is not "consistent with agency priorities." Senior officials should not "routinely defer" to recommendations from peer reviewers, who have provided the backbone of federal science funding for eight decades.

NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya reinforced the message in an Aug. 15 internal memorandum stating that political priorities may override the scoring system provided by outside experts appointed to hundreds of review panels.

"While the score and critiques an application receives in peer review are important factors in determining the scientific merit of a proposal," his memo stated, NIH institutes and centers should not rely on the scientific merit rankings "in developing their final pay plans."

Like ongoing conflicts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Reserve, NIH scientists told KFF Health News, the disruption of the peer review process represents an attack on agency expertise that the country has relied on for decades.

Although the priorities of top agency staffers have always influenced some NIH funding, those people were nearly always career scientists in the past. By downgrading its peer review process, the NIH could allow political appointees who now occupy key positions to stop grants that typically would be funded, and to fund grants they prefer that don't necessarily meet rigorous scientific standards, a dozen current and former NIH officials told KFF Health News.

Bhattacharya's guidelines "open the door to the politicization of NIH research," said Jenna Norton, a program officer in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

"Peer review is fundamental and makes sure we're doing the best science," she said. "If you're going to ignore that, the political appointee gets to make the final call."

NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine said that peer review would continue to be the cornerstone of the NIH's funding decisions but that funding would become less dependent on reviewers' rankings of grant proposals.

This will "ensure consistent, transparent, and strategic funding decisions that align with the agency's mission, maximize public health impact, and responsibly steward taxpayer dollars," she said. Trump's executive order said peer reviews would be "advisory" only.

Grants to scientists at universities and other research centers make up about 80% of the NIH's $48 billion budget, with the rest funding internal NIH research. Since 1946, the NIH has doled out funds based mainly on merits established by a scientific review process that ranks each proposal based on innovation, importance, and feasibility.

The peer review process, in which grant proposals scoring above a certain percentile generally receive funding, has always had its critics. Many a Nobel Prize speech has described failures by reviewers to recognize work that would end up leading to pathfinding discoveries, said Carrie Wolinetz, a former NIH chief of staff.

About half of the NIH's 27 centers and institutes provide leeway to raise or drop grants on the priority list because of factors like institute-wide research goals, Fine said. But these exceptions apply to fewer than 5% of grants, according to Richard Nakamura, who led the NIH's Center for Scientific Review from 2011 to 2018.

Nakamura's successor, Noni Byrnes, retired last week after overseeing changes aimed at reducing one frequent target of peer review critics: the awarding of multiple grants to well-placed scientists from top-tier universities.

The Bhattacharya document "itself is not so disturbing in the light of usual practice," said Harold Varmus, who led the NIH under President Bill Clinton and was the chief of the National Cancer Institute under Barack Obama. "What is disturbing is what it might mean in the context of the current administration."

The expansion of the Trump administration's political power at the NIH comes as it has strangled the release of thousands of grants with sometimes ambiguous policy statements and new layers of bureaucracy, including requirements that both the White House and the NIH director clear all new funding opportunities.

Career scientists, who have long run the NIH, have in some instances been replaced by political appointees playing critical roles in scientific decisions, staff scientists say.

New political appointees under Bhattacharya include chief of staff Seana Cranston, a former aide to conservative Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and former Department of Government Efficiency manager James McElroy, Cranston's deputy. The position of chief operations officer was created and filled by Eric Schnabel, a political appointee — since fired — who previously had been in charge of business development for a company that sold fitness programs.

Bhattacharya's deputy, meanwhile, is Matthew Memoli, an infectious disease scientist who emerged as a sharp critic of covid-19 vaccine mandates. The Department of Health and Human Services stunned vaccine experts in May when it awarded Memoli and colleagues a $500 million grant to develop an influenza vaccine using older technology, with no explanation other than a superlative-filled news release.

The mood at the agency is morbid, said Sylvia Chou, a program officer at the National Cancer Institute. While a minority of workers speak out in protest through documents like the “Bethesda Declaration,” others keep their heads down and their mouths shut.

Most grants must undergo new levels of review by senior NIH employees and the White House, program officers say. Staff members painstakingly police all grant applications for language — such as "diversity" or "climate change" — that might trigger scrutiny by higher-ups, according to four program officers, two of whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they feared retaliation.

"Bhattacharya has been saying that program officers are making up banned-words lists," Norton said. "It's true, we haven't gotten a list from him saying, 'Don't use these words.' But we do notice that when a grant says 'health equity,' it gets terminated."

"We review them and screen them for all these words as we're supposedly not doing — but we are doing," said a program officer who has been at the NIH for six years. "After we approve them, they go to the grant management office and sit there. Then they send them back and say, 'What about this word?'" This leads to self-censorship, the officer said.

The officer cited a recent proposal involving the effects of hotter weather on kidney disease. It contained the phrase "climate change" as background information, but "I had them remove it," the officer said. "It's a level of absurdity, but I wanted to avoid more delays."

The peer review process itself is "starting to break down" because highly scored grants haven't been funded for sometimes obscure reasons, Chou said.

The NIH picks hundreds of deeply experienced external scientists to serve on its review panels. While screened to avoid conflicts of interest, many reviewers are themselves NIH grant recipients. They accept pay of about $200 for 100 hours of work as a kind of social contract with the NIH, said Mollie Manier, a scientist at the Center for Scientific Review.

"We're finding that people are more likely to decline to serve on review panels because their own grants are frozen, or out of protest at what's happening at NIH," Manier said.

Another review officer described approaching a Brown University scientist with a request to serve on a panel recently: "They said normally they would do it, but they've lost three grants and need to figure out how to keep their lab running."

As grants crawl through the system, "reviewers are starting to feel they aren't being convened for anything real," Manier said. "If the government cancels your grant for no good reason, you can't expect a good-faith effort anymore."

"It's death by a thousand paper cuts, anything they can do to gum up payments, to gum up the decision-making, to wrest control of grant decisions from the career scientists," said Elizabeth Ginexi, an NIH program officer for 22 years who took early retirement in April.

Fine, the NIH spokesperson, said the agency had "no evidence that recruiting peer reviewers has become more difficult than in the past."

The administration's skepticism of peer review feeds doubts NIH scientists already had because of what they saw as irrational villainizing of mRNA vaccines and other matters — including Memoli's vaccine award.

Although in-house NIH research isn't subject to the same review process as external grants, Memoli's grant left officials aghast. "I'm not aware of a process that awards $500 million for a project using antiquated technology to develop vaccines," one seasoned reviewer said.

Trump's executive order says the grant review process "undermines the interests of American taxpayers," leaving many good proposals unfunded while supporting "too much unfocused research of marginal social utility."

"The opposite is true," the seasoned reviewer said. "We make sure taxpayer money goes to the most high-impact research."

"Alignment" is a word the Trump administration frequently uses to explain why an official got fired or research was rejected. Chou finds it appalling.

"The Chinese Communists call it 'harmonization,'" she said, and now her colleagues speak routinely about grants that are "clean" because they've "gone through alignment."

"We're saying this in plain English," she said. "Not Russian, not Beijing Chinese."

Given the seriousness and increased frequency of strokes, many studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and the risk of stroke with varying results. A new study suggests women having a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy have higher risks of stroke compared with those who did not have surgery. Results of the study are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The Menopause Society.

Stroke is the third dominant cause of death and the fourth dominant cause of disability around the world, representing a significant public health challenge. Therefore, ongoing prevention efforts that address modifiable risk factors are essential to reduce the burden of this disease.

Estrogen levels play a major role. Women of reproductive age have a lower stroke risk, whereas postmenopausal women are roughly two times more likely to have a stroke within a decade of menopause. Both hysterectomy and oophorectomy significantly affect estrogen levels. Hysterectomy may result in lower ovarian sex steroid levels, resulting in earlier menopause. An oophorectomy can reduce premenopausal serum estradiol by up to 80% and androgen levels by about 50% in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Although multiple studies have previously been conducted around the relationship between surgery and stroke risk, results have been mixed. This latest study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included more than 21,000 women, with an average of 8.3 follow-up years, documenting 193 stroke-related deaths. The analysis of these results found an increased risk for hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy but not for hysterectomy alone or hysterectomy with unliteral oophorectomy. A pooling analysis of this study's results with other cohorts, however, revealed an 18% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, and a 5% higher risk of stroke for hysterectomy alone.

Although the new study lacked surgical indication data, meta-analysis studies show that there is no connection between a benign or malignant diagnosis when determining the associated risk of surgery. Similarly, current evidence does not differentiate the amount of risk based on specific indications (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, or other rare conditions).

Additional studies with a large sample size and longer follow-up period are needed to address the disparities of type of stroke, age at surgery, surgical techniques, and menopause status on the association between stroke risk and hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

Survey results are published in the article "Stroke risk in women with or without hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy: evidence from the NHANES 1999-2018 and meta-analysis."

The results of this study demonstrate increased stroke risk related to hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, highlighting that these common procedures carry longer-term risks. They also call attention to an opportunity for more careful assessment of cardiovascular risk and implementation of risk reduction strategies in women who undergo these surgeries."

CN Bio, a leading provider of Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) Systems and solutions that accelerate drug discovery and development workflows, today announced the expansion of its Contract Research Services (CRS) with new PhysioMimix® computational modeling tools. These capabilities have been developed to enhance Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) profiling, for accelerated drug discovery and development workflows.



This launch represents the Company's new in silico tools available to customers and is designed to enhance data generation from its range of predictive in vitro tools - unlocking deeper insights into key ADME parameters, including human bioavailability, and enabling more confident in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE).

CN Bio's computational tools combine the insights gained from microphysiological system (MPS) assays with powerful mathematical models. These tools complement the Company's existing bioavailability assay based on its proprietary dual-organ Gut/Liver model, available via the CRS or as an off-the-shelf kit. The derived data is fully compatible with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) frameworks and can be used to extract additional data from preclinical studies, providing functional predictions of how compounds interact with human biology.

By working with CN Bio's CRS team, customers gain access to broad support and expertise from both MPS and computational modeling specialists. The team collaborates closely with customers throughout the process, from ensuring robust study design to translating experimental data into meaningful ADME predictions. Raw data generated from projects is also translated into an easy-to-interpret format, suitable for supporting go/no go and drug dosing decisions.

This year, the FDA made significant changes to phase out animal testing requirements, signaling a clear shift towards the use of more relevant human approaches for preclinical safety and toxicity testing. We are providing the tools to ensure our customers stay ahead of these regulatory changes." He added: "The launch of our Bioavailability assay last year was a major step towards improving understanding of the appropriate dose regimens for safe and effective new therapies. Now, by integrating advanced in silico modeling into our offering, we are enhancing this service to bridge the in vitro to in vivo translation gap for drug developers. By working with our expert CRS team, customers have access to dedicated support throughout the entire process."

Faced with a worsening drug crisis, policymakers in recent years have made it much easier for doctors to prescribe the highly effective opioid addiction treatment buprenorphine. However, many patients may still struggle to find pharmacies carrying the treatment, finds new research led by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.

Buprenorphine was available at just 39% of U.S. retail pharmacies in 2023, a modest increase from 33% in 2017, according to the study published Sept. 2 in Health Affairs. But disparities in who can access the treatment have persisted. Pharmacies in predominantly Black neighborhoods (18%) and Latino neighborhoods (17%) remain significantly less likely to carry buprenorphine as those in white neighborhoods (46%).

Buprenorphine is one of several medications that can ease opioid cravings and withdrawal, and it is the only one that can be prescribed in primary care settings and dispensed at retail pharmacies. Because these treatments are milder opioids and considered controlled substances, they historically have been subject to tight prescribing and dispensing rules.

Recent efforts to ease prescribing rules include the 2023 elimination of the so-called "X-waiver" that required doctors to receive specialized training and registration to prescribe the treatment. However, dispensing rates have changed little, suggesting that pharmacy regulations aimed at preventing opioid (and buprenorphine) diversion, abuse and misuse continue to discourage pharmacies from carrying the treatment, particularly in minority neighborhoods and some areas hit hardest by the opioid epidemic.

Relaxing buprenorphine prescribing rules was an important step in making this critical treatment more accessible, but too many patients lack a nearby pharmacy that carries it. Federal and state policymakers must reduce barriers that make it difficult for pharmacies to stock buprenorphine, especially in some of the more vulnerable communities."

Dima Mazen Qato, senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center and the Hygeia Centennial Chair at the USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences

Researchers analyzed buprenorphine claims from 2017 to 2023 from an IQVIA pharmacy database from covering 93% of U.S. retail prescription claims. Among their key findings:

Researchers said states should consider easing tight controls on buprenorphine dispensing, which can restrict access to the treatment in several ways.

When buprenorphine demand rises, suppliers may delay or pause shipments to pharmacies to avoid scrutiny from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and pharmacies often refuse to stock buprenorphine out of concern the orders will be flagged to the DEA. Some pharmacies carry the medication but refuse to dispense it for fear of running afoul of the federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state pharmacy regulations and laws, which require pharmacists to ensure that prescriptions for controlled substances are valid.

The researchers found buprenorphine availability was greatest in states with the least restrictive prescription drug monitoring programs, including those that limited how law enforcement could access the electronic databases to investigate suspicious prescribing.

The researchers said state and local governments should consider requiring pharmacies to maintain buprenorphine stock, noting that some have issued similar orders for the overdose reversal treatment naloxone and emergency contraception in an effort to improve access.

"If policymakers fail to introduce policies that increase equitable access to buprenorphine at local pharmacies, existing racial and ethnic disparities in opioid use disorder treatment and recovery will likely worsen," said first author Jenny S. Guadamuz, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.

Medicaid plays a key role for giving people with opioid-use disorder access to treatment, according to a Rutgers Health study.

Progress in life-saving treatment for opioid-use disorder with the medication has stalled in the past several years, according to a Rutgers Health study. However, researchers added that while some states were able to achieve substantial improvement, others lost ground. 

Specifically, states that have expanded access to Medicaid insurance coverage since 2018 saw increases in prescriptions for opioid-use disorder treatment, according to the study, while states that haven't expanded Medicaid experienced declining treatment rates after 2022. 

Researchers found that state Medicaid policies were key drivers of population-level treatment rates.

The study, published in Health Affairs, examined trends in national retail pharmacy claims by Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance across states between 2018 and 2024, a period of rising fatal overdose rates and national policy changes aimed at increasing treatment. Researchers compared the claims with state populations and overdose rates to assess the impact of Medicaid eligibility on treatment uptake.

We were impressed by the success stories in some states, such as those with recent eligibility expansions. Several of these states, like Virginia, Utah and Missouri, doubled or tripled Medicaid-paid prescribing, driving strong population-level improvement. These successes point to opportunities for improvement even when the overall national rate of progress is disappointing. Nevertheless, wide disparities between states remained, as shown in maps and state comparison tables in the paper and its appendix." 

Stephen Crystal, Director of the Rutgers Center for Health Services Research at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research

Despite the availability of effective treatments for opioid-use disorder, more than 80,000 died in 2024from opioid-use overdoses. In addition to the disease of addiction, there are a number of policy and financial barriers preventing people from accessing medication, the researchers said. The federal government declared an opioid public health emergency in 2017 and again in 2025. 

Because people with opioid-use disorder tend to be low-income single adults, Medicaid is the most important payer for buprenorphine, a highly effective medication used to treat opioid-use disorder. However, Medicaid policies covering opioid-use disorder treatment vary state to state, resulting in vastly different uptake of treatments that can dramatically lower the risk of overdose and support recovery. New Jersey is among the states that have implemented important initiatives that have aided access to Medicaid-paid treatment, including Medicaid expansion, elimination of buprenorphine prior authorization, and increased reimbursement for treatment, with improvements in Medicaid and all-payer buprenorphine prescribing during the study period.

The national analysis led by Crystal, who is a Distinguished Research Professor at the Rutgers School of Social Work, showed diverse state-level trends that often pointed to the importance of Medicaid. 

States that recently expanded the eligibility criteria to qualify for Medicaid insurance experienced a 27.3% increase in buprenorphine prescribing rates. But in states that didn't expand Medicaid, overall prescribing lagged, with declines after 2022. 

Researchers said expanding Medicaid eligibility and minimizing disenrollment from Medicaid during eligibility redeterminations are critical steps in increasing access to opioid-use disorder treatment across the country.

"Translating evidence into consistent practice has been uneven across the country for multiple reasons, including the stigma surrounding people with addiction," said Crystal. "But progress is possible when states take action to help residents access and afford effective medication. Maintaining the progress that has been made in opioid-use disorder treatment through state Medicaid policies will be challenging under the financial pressures created by recent federal legislation, but it is vital in maintaining progress on preventing overdoses and supporting recovery."

Coauthors of the study include Fangzhou Xie, Hillary Samples, Elizabeth Stone and Jennifer Miles of Rutgers; Allen Campbell of the IQVIA Institute, Peter Treitler of Boston University; and Sumedha Gupta and Kosali I. Simon of Indiana University.

Crystal will discuss the research during the Health Affairs Health Policy Briefing focused on the opioid crisis on Sept. 3 and in an upcoming Health Affairs Health Podyssey podcast episode.

A father's exposure to passive smoking as a child may impair the lifelong lung function of his children, putting them at risk of COPD-a risk that is heightened further if they are childhood passive smokers themselves-finds research published online in the respiratory journal Thorax.

The findings highlight the intergenerational harms of smoking, say the researchers, who urge fathers to intercept this harmful legacy by avoiding smoking around their children.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more usually known by its acronym of COPD, includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Now the third leading cause of death around the world, COPD kills around 3 million people every year, say the researchers.

Several factors throughout the lifespan may increase the risk of poor lung function and subsequent COPD, and attention is now beginning to focus on the potential role of intergenerational factors, they explain.

While previously published research showed that passive smoking during a father's childhood may be linked to a heightened risk of asthma in his children by the time they are 7, it's not clear if compromised lung function may extend into middle age and beyond, they add. 

To explore this further, the researchers drew on 8022 child participants in the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS), all of whom had tests to assess their lung function (spirometry).

Their parents completed an initial comprehensive survey on their and their children's respiratory health. Further check-ups ensued when those children were 13, 18, 43, 50 and 53. These included spirometry to assess 2 measures of lung function (FEV1 and FVC) as well as questionnaires on demographics and respiratory symptoms/disease. 

Of the 7243 parents who were alive and could be traced in 2010, 5111 were re-surveyed about whether either of their own parents had smoked when they were under the age of 5 and/or up to when they were 15.

Among the 5097 respondents with complete data, 2096 were fathers. The final analysis included 890 father-child pairs with data on the father's passive smoke exposure before puberty and lung function data for their children up to the age of 53.

More than two thirds of the fathers (nearly 69%) and more than half of their children (56.5%) had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhoods.

Around half of the children (49%) had a history of active smoking by middle age, and just over 5% of them had developed COPD by this time point, as assessed by spirometry.

After adjusting for potentially influential factors, including the father's lifetime history of asthma/wheeze and his age, his passive smoke exposure as a child was associated with 56% higher odds of below average FEV1, but not FVC, across the lifespan of his children. 

Similarly, fathers' childhood passive smoke exposure was also associated with a doubling in the odds of an early low-rapid decline in FEV1/FVC in their children. This was statistically significant even after adjusting for potentially influential factors.

And paternal exposure to passive smoking as a child was also associated with a doubling in the risk of COPD by the age of 53 in his children, although this was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for potentially influential factors. 

But children whose fathers had been exposed to passive smoking as a child were twice as likely to have below average FEV1 if they, too, had been exposed to passive smoking during their childhood.

The observed associations were only partly mediated through smoking and respiratory illnesses in fathers and their children (each contributing less than 15%).

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that TAHS lacks data on paternal lung function and genetics, preventing assessment of familial aggregation as a potential mechanism. 

And their children's childhood passive smoke exposure was defined as at least one parent smoking 6 days a week, which might have misclassified moderate/light smokers as non-smokers, they add.

But the period before puberty is especially critical for boys, when exposure to harmful substances may change gene expression and modify repair mechanisms, which may then become heritable, say the researchers by way of an explanation for their findings. 

"Our findings are novel as this is the first study to investigate and provide evidence for an adverse association of paternal prepubertal passive smoke exposure, rather than just active smoking, on impaired lung function of offspring by middle age," they write. 

"This is of importance from a public health perspective, as passive smoke exposure affects about 63% of adolescents, which is significantly higher than the approximately 7% affected by active smoking." 

They conclude: "These findings suggest that smoking may adversely affect lung function not only in smokers but also in their children and grandchildren…Fathers exposed to tobacco smoke during prepuberty may still reduce risk for future generations by avoiding smoking around their children."

A new study shows that beetroot juice can reduce blood pressure in older adults by enhancing nitric oxide pathways through shifts in oral bacteria, pointing to a simple nutritional strategy for healthier aging.

In a recent study published in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine, researchers investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) deficiencies, a common aspect of human aging, could be mitigated by consuming nitrate-rich beetroot juice. The study leveraged data from a randomized crossover trial comparing the impacts of beetroot juice consumption on young and older adults.

Study findings revealed that beetroot juice consumption substantially lowered blood pressure (BP) scores in older adults, while having no statistically significant impact on their younger counterparts. Furthermore, the study found that this BP improvement was associated with higher plasma nitrite levels and correlated with decreases in a Prevotella-dominated bacterial module, rather than directly with increases in nitrate-reducing genera. The Prevotella-dominated group included taxa capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), which may divert nitrite away from NO production. These findings support the notion that dietary nitrate may enhance blood pressure regulation in older adults, with microbiome shifts potentially mediating this effect. However, endothelial function and arterial stiffness were unchanged.

Decades of research have elucidated some of the routine processes associated with aging, with the body's deteriorating ability to produce nitric oxide (NO), a key molecule for cardiovascular health, well-documented. Conventional interventions often involve the use of pharmacological supplements; however, a significant number of patients respond poorly to these interventions, prompting the search for newer, naturally derived, and physiologically safe alternatives.

Recent research has also established robust links between oral health and systemic disease. However, the biological mechanisms governing these benefits remain largely unknown. One of the few well-documented pathways involves the conversion of dietary nitrate, abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot, into nitric oxide (NO). Studies have shown that this process entirely depends on specific oral bacteria (living on human tongues) that process the machinery to convert (enzymatically reduce) nitrate to nitrite. This nitrite is then converted to NO, a vital signaling molecule that relaxes blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.

Unfortunately, aging substantially hinders this process, as the body's primary mechanism for producing NO, via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), becomes less efficient. This age-related decline has been observed to contribute to hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. However, the oral microbiome and vascular system responses to the aging process remain unknown. Elucidating these interactions may allow for a new "backup" means to mitigate NO deficiency, thereby contributing to healthier aging. In this study cohort, however, baseline NO biomarkers were similar across age groups, suggesting that NO availability may be maintained during healthy aging, and thus, age-related NO decline should be framed cautiously.

The present study aimed to address the knowledge gaps by conducting a placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover trial involving 39 young adults (aged 18–30) and 36 older adults (aged 67–79), to investigate the impacts of different oral solutions (beetroot juice and mouthwash) on participants' oral microbiome and vascular responses.

Individuals with known medical histories of pulmonary, metabolic, or cardiovascular diseases were excluded from the sample cohort. Exclusion criteria also included oral diseases, smoking, high BP (> 140/90 mmHg) at baseline, and recent (<3 months) antibiotic use.

The study intervention lasted two weeks (each treatment), separated by additional two-week 'washout' periods. The interventions included:

Data collection involved the collection of tongue swabs (before and after each period) for oral microbiome analysis via high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, participants' key cardiovascular health markers (brachial and central BP) and endothelial function (using flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) were recorded at the same frequency. Finally, Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were measured as proxy biomarkers of NO bioavailability.

The study demonstrated a surprising contrast in how young and older participants responded to the dietary nitrate. The latter cohort had higher baseline BP (mean arterial pressure of 95 vs. 87 mmHg, P < 0.001), but when provided the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, demonstrated a significant reduction in brachial mean arterial pressure (4 ± 4 mmHg [P = 0.003]). Young, healthy adults, however, did not see any such change. Post-nitrate BP was lower than after mouthwash, but not lower than after placebo beetroot juice, which itself increased plasma nitrate and nitrite and had a modest effect on BP in older adults.

Further analyses revealed that the nitrate intervention directly correlated with the decrease in a co-occurring module of bacteria dominated by the genus Prevotella. Prevotella concentrations, in turn, were strongly associated with both the increase in plasma nitrite (r = -0.72, P = 0.001) and decreased BP.

The use of antiseptic mouthwash was also associated with reduced oral microbial diversity (Shannon index, P = 0.004) and impaired vascular function in the young group. Conversely, nitrate supplementation altered the oral microbiome in older adults, leading to increases in specific nitrate-reducing genera, including Neisseria and Rothia. Notably, Neisseria exhibited a proportionally greater increase in older adults compared to the young group.

The present study reveals that dietary nitrate may serve as a potent tool for enhancing cardiovascular health, particularly in older adults. The findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a shift in the oral microbiome associated with higher plasma nitrite levels may contribute to the blood-pressure-lowering effect of nitrate, rather than proving direct causation. This research opens a new frontier for targeted nutritional and probiotic strategies to support cardiovascular health, especially in our aging global population.

People with learning disabilities progress faster to severe type 2 diabetes and are at greater risk of dying from their condition than people without these disabilities, suggests research published in the open access journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Control.

This is despite having better overall blood glucose control and similar risks of vascular complications, the findings indicate.

Around 1.5 million people (950,000 adults) in the UK have a learning disability, which includes conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, note the researchers. 

Type 2 diabetes in those with learning disabilities can be challenging as it requires a substantial amount of monitoring and management, which they may not always be able to do, potentially compromising their blood glucose control, explain the researchers.

But there's been no large study on the potential impact of learning disabilities on the outcomes of type 2 diabetes, including blood glucose control, progression to microvascular and macrovascular complications, initiation of insulin therapy (proxy for severe disease), and risk of death, they add.

Macrovascular complications refer to stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or amputation more than 6 months after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Microvascular complications refer to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy.

In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers extracted anonymized medical records for 352,215 adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in primary care between January 2004 and January 2021 from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD.

Of these, 280,300 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study, 2074 of whom had a learning disability when they were diagnosed.

They tended to be younger (average age 51 vs 64) and have a shorter monitoring period. And they included higher proportions of men, people of White ethnicity, people living with severe obesity and in areas of greatest deprivation than those without learning disabilities.

They were also more likely to be taking medication for diabetes and high blood pressure and to have more complications related to diabetes at the time of their diagnosis. 

Even after adjusting for these potentially influential risk factors they were 19% less likely to have poor blood glucose control than those without learning disabilities 5 years after diagnosis.

But they were 20% more likely to progress faster to severe disease and the need for insulin therapy than those who didn't have learning disabilities. 

And they were around twice as likely to die from any cause and specifically from diabetes despite having similar risks of vascular complications as those who didn't have learning disabilities.

This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause and effect, and the researchers acknowledge that large numbers of values for the outcome variables for blood glucose control were missing among those with learning disabilities. Complication rates may therefore have either been underdiagnosed or under-recorded, they suggest. 

"Our finding of higher rates of insulin initiation in those with learning disabilities warrants further investigation into whether this is due to poorer glycemic control at presentation (and therefore faster advancing type 2 diabetes) or due to having a greater degree of clinical surveillance," say the researchers.

"Future research into the mechanisms behind this could help reduce health disparities for people with [type 2 diabetes] and learning disabilities," they add.

Ahead of co-hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026, the U.S. men's national team will reportedly square off against the country that sealed their Copa América fate in 2024: Uruguay.

Their final friendly of the calendar year will take place Nov. 18, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The U.S. Soccer Federation reportedly was in talks with Brazil, but couldn't come to an agreement on a time and place.

It'll be the first time since July 2024 that these two countries face off against each other. The USMNT met Uruguay to conclude Copa América Group C play with La Celeste emerging victorious. The host nation was eliminated from the competition after the game given the USMNT lost to Panama the game prior. 

Gregg Berhalter was subsequently relieved of his duties and in came former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino. The high-profile coach has delivered mixed results so far. While there have been some positive wins in friendlies, a Concacaf Gold Cup final loss to Mexico and a fourth-place exit in the Concacaf Nations League earlier this year stain his first year in charge.

The team is looking for momentum any way possible. There are no more competitive matches before the World Cup, so friendlies are the best opportunities Pochettino and his team will get. 

The USMNT play two international friendlies during the September break against South Korea and Japan. Star forward Christian Pulisic was called-up for the games after missing the Concacaf Gold Cup over the summer.

Also included in the September squad are MLS standouts Max Arfsten, Matt Freese, Tristan Blackmon, Alex Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna. Abroad, the likes of Tyler Adams, Damion Downs, Tim Weah, Josh Sargent and Chris Richards return. Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie were not named to the squad.

Before Uruguay, they'll also face Ecuador and Australia in October. 

Uruguay and the USMNT previously played each other in a friendly back in 2022 ahead of the World Cup in Qatar.

Hello! The men's international break is well and truly here, the focus squarely on the 2026 World Cup as qualification continues in a handful of continents and the rest keep busy with all-important friendlies. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update before international matches come thick and fast.

All times U.S./Eastern

Wednesday, Sept. 3🌎 CWCC: Washington Spirit vs. Vancouver Rise, 7 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+🇺🇸 USL Championship: Hartford Athletic vs. Indy Eleven, 7:30 p.m. ➡️ ESPN+

Thursday, Sept.4🌍 WCQ: Bulgaria vs. Spain, 2:45 p.m. ➡️ FS2🌎 WCQ: Brazil vs. Chile, 8:30 p.m. ➡️ Universo🌎 WCQ: Guatemala vs. El Salvador, 10:30 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino may have billed this international break as the last chance to vet inexperienced players before the World Cup, but the latest roster is headlined by a few familiar faces, and a years-old quandary -- who exactly is going to be the USMNT's starting forward at the World Cup?

The competition is likely down to four players -- Patrick Agyemang, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi and Josh Sargent -- and while Agyemang recovers from hernia surgery and Pepi is in the early stages of a return from a knee injury, Balogun and Sargent will shoot their shot this month. Balogun has the chance to suit up for the national team for the first time after an injury-plagued year and may still be the frontrunner for the job, though Sargent theoretically poses a stiff challenge.

Sargent has five goals in four matches to start the season with Norwich City, sticking around at the Championship club after drawing interest elsewhere over the summer, including from Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The task in front of him now is translating that form to the national team – Sargent enjoyed a 15 goal season with Norwich last campaign but saw his USMNT opportunities come and go, missing out on this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup roster in what Pochettino described as a "football decision" at the time. This month's friendlies, then, are the latest in a dwindling number of chances for Sargent to break an international goalscoring drought that dates back to November 2019.

A handful of teams could book their spots at the 2026 World Cup this month as qualification tournaments continue, with many of the world's national teams targeting the 35 spots at next summer's competition that are still up for grabs.

South America's qualification tournament comes to a close this month, with three teams still in the mix for one guaranteed spot at the World cup and an additional berth in the intercontinental playoff. Colombia are the favorites to take that guaranteed spot and could get across the finish line as soon as Thursday, when they host fellow contender Bolivia in Barranquilla. Los Cafeteros have a five point lead over Bolivia (and a four point advantage over Venezuela), a win enough to collect the last guaranteed spot at the World Cup. That would leave Venezuela and Bolivia to duke it out for a spot in the playoff when CONMEBOL's qualification run concludes, each with an uphill battle of their own to climb – Venezuela will host Colombia, while Bolivia will welcome Brazil in the qualification finale.

Meanwhile in Africa, there are still four games to go in the first round of qualification but two regulars could get the job done this month if all things tilt in their favor. Morocco, the 2022 World Cup semifinalists, are poised to be the first team from the continent to book their spot at the 2026 tournament with a win over Niger on Friday plus a Tanzania loss to Congo on the same day. Egypt could join them on Tuesday if they win the two games on their plate this month against Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.

No spots are up for grabs in Europe or North America, though each continent kicks off major stages of qualification this month. A handful of heavy-hitters in Europe will actually begin their qualification journeys over the next couple of days, including the last three teams from the continent to win the World Cup – France, Germany and Spain – while Portugal also makes up the list as teams begin to compete for the 16 spots that are available to them. In North America, the third qualification round will begin this month and end in November with three teams booking their spots at the World Cup and two more playoff spots up for grabs later. After the three hosts, Costa Rica target back-to-back World Cup trips while Concacaf Nations League finalists Panama and regional heavyweights Jamaica are among the favorites to finish the job by November.

Today's News

International Football

U.S. striker Folarin Balogun, back with the national team for the first time in nearly a year, said Wednesday that the injuries that kept him away from the USMNT are “behind me.”

“I'm in a good shape, and in a good way,” Balogun said via Zoom from U.S. camp in Morristown, N.J., ahead of Saturday's game against South Korea.

Those injuries cost him four consecutive U.S. camps, the team's first four under head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Balogun, after starting or appearing in all nine A-team games for the USMNT in 2024 under former head coach Gregg Berhalter and interim Mikey Varas, missed camps in October, November and this past March due to injury. He was initially named in Pochettino's pre-Gold Cup squad, but also withdrew from that camp due to an ankle ailment.

“It was a tough period, but I think every athlete goes through that at some stage,” Balogun said.

Another ankle issue in August cost him a preseason game and Monaco's Ligue 1 opener. It was presumably part of the reason why the 24-year-old was not on the first version of the USMNT's September roster, which was revealed last week.

But when Brian White withdrew due to injury, U.S. Soccer contacted Balogun, who'd made his 2025-26 debut that past weekend, playing 90 minutes in a 1-0 loss to Lille.

“I got the call — I can't remember the date, exactly, but it was a bit late,” Balogun acknowledged Wednesday.

“I was really happy,” he added. “It was important for me to be back with the team.”

Several days later, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3-2 win over Strasbourg. Then he jetted across the Atlantic, to New Jersey, where he was one of the last to arrive at U.S. camp.

Now, he will get his chance to make a delayed first impression. He is one of a few players who, at roughly the midway point of Pochettino's tenure, are meeting and training under the new boss for the first time.

“Everyone wants to make an impression,” Balogun said. “And I think that's just natural, with such a big competition coming in 10 months, it's important to leave your mark.”

That “big competition,” of course, is the World Cup. The 2026 edition, slated for June and July in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, would be Balogun's first.

For roughly 11 months, the countdown to that milestone coincided with Balogun's absence from the USMNT. Now, a first opportunity to impress the coach who'll select the U.S. World Cup roster might lead some players to press, to over-exert, to try to be something other than themselves.

“That's part of the psychology, to not overdo it, because things will just become more complicated,” Balogun said. “The harder you try sometimes, the more difficult it is.”

But Balogun is comfortable searching for and finding a middle ground, and pushing for a potential place in the U.S. starting lineup come next June. He'll compete with EFL Championship leading scorer Josh Sargent and new Southampton signing Damion Downs for the prime minutes at striker in this camp, which also includes a friendly against Japan.

“It's something I've been doing all my career, fighting for my position and fighting to get in teams,” the former Arsenal academy product said. “I believe that's a balance that comes naturally to me.”

Dynamic pricing has drawn complaints in other areas

Start of sales process for tournament will begin next week

Fifa has confirmed that it will employ dynamic pricing for tickets to the 2026 World Cup from the beginning of the sales process, which starts next week. The system was also used for this year's Club World Cup and, in the UK, drew widespread complaints from fans buying tickets for Oasis's comeback tour.

The use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed around ticketing for the World Cup one week before sales open, including the first collection of prices. The cheapest tickets will start at $60 (£44), with the most expensive, for a prime spot at the final, starting at $6,730 (£5,760). Fifa did not provide any price points in between those two.

Dynamic pricing means that those starting prices can, and probably will, rise significantly. This will be the first men's World Cup to use the scheme, in which the ticket prices are adjusted by the seller to reflect demand – ­similar to the way surge pricing works for .

Ticket companies have benefited significantly from dynamic pricing as its usage has risen over the last ­decade . Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation broke its record for revenue in 2024, with dynamic pricing thought to be a significant factor. The practice has also attracted complaints from fans priced out of events – including in high-profile cases surrounding Oasis's tour and last season's FA Cup final.

Fifa officials justified the use of dynamic pricing by saying it was the organization's way of adapting to the domestic market in the United States and Canada, where the practice is common, and where it says the public already accepts that event tickets will be priced according to demand. One official added that Fifa couldn't pass up the additional revenue that would be generated by dynamic pricing, citing the 211 Fifa member nations that could benefit from a more profitable World Cup. According to the officials, Fifa never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing – suggesting the topic was never really up for debate.

The pricing structure is expected to be put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales, which begins on 10 September. Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on, meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others before the World Cup draw has even begun.

Fifa used dynamic pricing at the 2025 Club World Cup, with mixed results. Prices for those games initially rose sharply, only to drop – in some cases as low as $13.40 (£10) – just before kickoff as stadiums remains only partially full. However, demand at the World Cup is almost certain to be significantly higher than at the Club World Cup, and a Fifa official said that this time around prices would not go lower than $60.

Another significant change described by Fifa officials comes in the way tickets are categorized for the World Cup. In past tournaments, Fifa has broken down seats into a category system, with Category 1 generally considered to be the best seats, Category 2 the next best, and so on until Category 4. It had been standard practice for a seat's placement in relation to the pitch to affect its categorization: a seat along the sideline, for example, was far more likely to be considered Category 1, while a seat at the same level but located behind the goal might be Category 2 or lower.

That approach is no longer in use. In 2026, seat categories will in most cases correspond to the level of the stadium the seat is located. At the World Cup final, for example, the entire lower level of MetLife Stadium is expected to count as Category 1, with the suite level in the middle counting as Category 2, and then the upper bowl making up Categories 3 and 4.

Once again, Fifa officials said that the change was made to bring the organization in line with perceived cultural norms in the host countries. The officials said that according to their research, North American fans place a higher emphasis on proximity to the field than they do having a certain type of view of the match.

Fifa and longtime financial partner Visa announced in late July the details of the first phase of ticket sales, and those remain largely the same. From 10-19 September, Visa cardholders worldwide may submit an application on Fifa's website, and by 29 September the randomly accepted applicants will be notified and given a date and time window in October, during which they can buy tickets. A Fifa official said that application data would be screened to prevent the influence of bots, and that the randomized draw would be made in the presence of a public notary in Zurich.

As in past World Cups, fans may buy single-game tickets, or packages that give access to every game at a certain venue, or every game played by a specific team. Tickets will only be sold by category, with seats assigned at random within those categories until the final phase of sales, in which fans can buy specific seats on a first-come, first-served basis, many months after dynamic pricing has gone into effect.

Fans can buy a maximum of four tickets per match, for a maximum of 10 matches during the tournament. Fifa said it would operate a resale marketplace in an effort to avoid scalping.

Looking to buy tickets to FIFA World Cup 2026? Here's everything you need to know about the first wave of ticket sales.

The presale draw is the first of four phases for ticket buying for the World Cup – set for June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The "Visa Presale Draw" begins Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. ET and will end on Sept. 19 at 11 a.m. ET, allowing fans worldwide (who are Visa cardholders) to register to buy World Cup tickets.

FIFA says the draw will be randomized, and eligibility will be established with a no-value transaction. Fans can go to FIFA.com/tickets to sign up.

On Sept. 29, applicants will be notified if their application was successful.

From Oct. 1 to Oct. 21, ticket buyers will be issued a dedicated date and time slot to purchase their World Cup tickets.

Ticket buyers will be issued a ticket in a category seating range, based on the 16 different World Cup venues across the three countries. Specific seats will be assigned later.

After the presale, FIFA says multiple additional ticket phases will launch in the coming months.

“Get your tickets early, especially if you know where you'll be because you live in that city or you're a fan of the three hosting nations. You know already when and where they'll play. Get your tickets early, because anything can happen,” FIFA World Cup 26 chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi said during a Sept. 2 media briefing.

While the World Cup match schedule is already set, the matchups not featuring host nations will be determined following the FIFA World Cup draw on Dec. 5.

The United States (Group D) will play group stage matches in Los Angeles on June 12, 2026, in Seattle on June 19, 2026, and Los Angeles again on June 25, 2026.

Mexico (Group A) will play in the World Cup opening match at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, 2026. They will also play on June 18 in Guadalajara and June 24 in Mexico City.

Canada (Group B) will play group stage matches in Toronto on June 12, 2026, and Vancouver on June 18, 2026 and June 24, 2026.

The World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.

Here's everything you need to know about the FIFA World Cup presale draw

Prospective World Cup ticket buyers need to sign up for a FIFA account, and have a Visa payment card. After Oct. 21, fans will be able to buy World Cup tickets with other payment methods.

FIFA will have approximately 1 million tickets for sale during the Visa Presale Draw phase.

FIFA says the lowest price ticket for group stage matches will be $60 USD, while the most expensive ticket price for the World Cup final will be set at $6,730 through each ticket purchasing phase. However, dyanmic pricing could affect how much those prices could fluctuate based on demand.

Fans will be able to purchase three different types of tickets:

There are four categories of World Cup tickets available to purchase, reflective of the level seating areas in World Cup venues. FIFA will provide maps of each stadium venue, explaining the ticket categories.

FIFA says a ticket buyer can purchase up to four tickets per match, for up to 10 matches, 40 tickets in total.

FIFA will also launch its own resale platform for ticket holders to safeguard fans against invalid or unauthorized resale tickets. Note: Ticket resellers outside of Mexico will be able to set their own resale prices.

“We are not capping the FIFA resale platform in terms of ticket prices. Obviously, people would go to other resale platforms and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want,” Schirgi said.

“We want to keep a safe and secure, and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets, also ensuring that from a technical point of view, that the resale ticket actually works when you come to the gate.”

The next ticket sales draw following the Visa Presale draw will be in November. FIFA is in discussion with the three host nations to see “if and how” they can give domestic customers priority to buy tickets in their home countries.

World Cup

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are not yet on general sale, but soon, the yearslong wait will end.

After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The opening of a presale application window on Sept. 10 will mark the start of a multi-phase process that is now more defined, but still requires lots of explanation.

So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

The “Visa Presale Draw” opens at 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 10, but you do not need to rush to your computer or smartphone that day. You can enter anytime between then and Sept. 19. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The first official purchases of tickets, by the successful applicants, will then happen in October.

For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December.

Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup.

Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing).

To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.”

You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform.

And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible.

Yes. (Visa is a FIFA sponsor, hence the scheme.)

A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access.

But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods.

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person.

If you'd like to go to a game with a larger group, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs.

You'll have three options, per FIFA:

You won't have to choose between these options until October. When you apply, you're merely applying for a place in line — for a time slot. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says.

The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. Most tickets, though, will be more expensive, and probably much more expensive. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices.

And all of those prices could change. FIFA will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer.

The highest price for the 2026 World Cup final will start at $6,730, FIFA said Wednesday. That's more than four times the price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2022 World Cup final, which cost $1,605.

In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69.

The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section.

For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

A Category 1 ticket, for example, might be in the 20th row of the lower bowl in a sideline section level with the penalty box; or it might be on the second deck closer to midfield.

Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. “Fans value the front-row seat much higher,” an official said, “than the seats that have a technical view of the pitch.” So, rather than sideline vs. endline, the delineation will generally be lower level (Category 1), second deck (Category 2) and upper deck (Category 3 and 4).

FIFA will release maps of each stadium showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022.

In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app.

Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. The main difference there is that the transfer of tickets into your account and app depends on the seller, and isn't always immediate. (More on that below.)

For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market.

“You will get your ticket in the app at a later stage, not at the moment of the purchase,” Jean-Marie Tardy, a FIFA ticketing manager, said of the system generally on a TicketCo podcast in 2023. “And once the ticket is loaded into your app … you've got all the information about all your tickets — the seat category, the stadium, the match, even the seat details — but you don't get anything that can get scanned at that moment.”

FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. And many sites are already doing that. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches.

FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schrigi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA can.

FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.”

Those sites don't require a seller to upload the digital ticket to list it.

They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have.

So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. And there are four main theories about what, exactly, those “tickets” are:

That remains up in the air. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

The Visa presale draw opens Sept. 10. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

World Cup

FIFA said Wednesday that ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup will start at $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats and range to $6,730 for the most expensive tickets to the final – but all of that is subject to change once sales begin in October.

A FIFA official, speaking to reporters on a Zoom call Tuesday, confirmed that organizers will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets.

This means that prices may – and probably will – change before and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when group-stage matchups, dates and locations will be set.

“We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” the FIFA official said.

An initial ticket phase, featuring a lottery, will open Sept. 10. Fans will apply for the chance to purchase tickets (using a Visa card); and if randomly selected, they'll get the opportunity to buy up to 40 — up to four per match, for up to 10 matches — in a specific time slot in October.

A similar second phase, which will not include the Visa card requirement, will run from late October through early December. There will then be another lottery phase, followed by a first-come-first-served phase, after the World Cup draw.

FIFA officials said they had not yet determined all of the initial prices. They will divide tickets into four categories — with Category 1 being the most expensive and Category 4 the least expensive — but when asked about the prices for Category 1, 2 and 3 tickets to group-stage matches, one official said that those numbers weren't set.

He also would not say how many of the $60 tickets will be available, nor what percentage of a given stadium will be considered “Category 4” seats, though he did say that percentage will “not be insignificant.”

In general, the lower bowl of stadiums will be Category 1; the second deck will be Category 2; and the upper deck will be Category 3 and 4. In most of the sales phases, fans will purchase tickets in these categories without knowing what section or row they'll be assigned; they will not be able to choose specific seats.

The initial $6,730 maximum price for the final is not a hospitality ticket — those are already on sale, and range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person across the tournament.

The regular-ticket maximum is more than four times the price of Category 1 tickets to the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, which cost $1,605. (Category 2 was $1,002, and Category 3 was $604.)

The FIFA official said Tuesday that organizers had “committed to the $60” as a starting point, but that “we will apply variable pricing from Day 1 of the process.” That means prices could rise or fall during the presale phase, which will run through Oct. 21. (Sept. 19 is the deadline to apply.)

Although dynamic pricing is typically associated with price increases, the opposite happened ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. Months after FIFA overestimated demand with its initial prices, the cost of tickets plummeted as FIFA scrambled to fill otherwise-empty seats.

The expectation, though, is that demand for the 2026 World Cup, which will feature 104 matches in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be much higher, and prices could rise.

“We do not intend at all to change prices every five minutes,” the official clarified, but he acknowledged that part of the process would involve automation.

To justify the “variable pricing” approach, he and another World Cup official said that it would allow FIFA to maximize revenues and attendance. Soccer's global governing body, which runs the World Cup, expects to make over $3 billion from hospitality and ticket sales. It also expects to smash the previous World Cup attendance record, which is still held by the 1994 edition, a 24-team tournament in the U.S.

The FIFA official also cited local customs. “What FIFA is doing is adapting to the domestic market,” he said. “And it's a reality in the U.S. and Canada that events are being priced as per the demand that is coming in for that event.”

FIFA will also adapt its resale strategy to North America. When ticket sales begin, it will launch its own resale platform. In the past, it has capped prices on these secondary sales, to prevent fans and scalpers from reselling for profit. But in 2026, for ticket buyers in the U.S. and Canada, there will be no cap, according to World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schrigi.

The reason, Schrigi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

The exception is for Mexico, where resale laws are stricter. After extensive discussions with the Mexican government, FIFA agreed to create a separate, dedicated resale platform for Mexicans fans, who will only be allowed to post their tickets for resale at face value. It will function more like a ticket exchange than a resale market.

When asked what fees or cut of resales FIFA would take on its official platform, a spokesman said that would be finalized at a later date.

FIFA officials said that around 1 million tickets would likely be available in the first Visa presale phase — out of roughly 6 million in total for the tournament.

One official mentioned that 8.5 million people had officially “registered their interest” in tickets since FIFA began asking fans to do so.

The World Cup is slated to begin June 11 in Mexico City and conclude with the final July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

For event organizers like FIFA, dynamic pricing comes with dual benefits.

It allows them to raise prices if and when they sense they can make more money on tickets.

It also allows them to set high initial prices, knowing they can eventually lower those prices if sales are slow. (This is precisely what happened with the Club World Cup.)

The argument against dynamic pricing, of course, is that a lower fixed price would allow fans with less money to experience the World Cup.

The argument for dynamic pricing, essentially, is that a lower fixed price also incentivizes scalping. The scalpers then resell for profits, and the outcome for most consumers is the same — prices on the secondary market end up just as high as, if not higher than, the dynamic prices FIFA could charge. The only difference is that the money ends up in the hands of the scalpers — some of them Average Joes, some of them slimy profiteers — rather than FIFA.

Some would argue that's a good thing. FIFA would argue that the money should go into its coffers and then out into the world to fund football development.

And because FIFA controls the World Cup, FIFA's argument wins.

NEW YORK - The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament in international soccer, but its list of champions is a very exclusive club. Since the first tournament in 1930, only eight countries have managed to lift the coveted trophy.

The backstory:

Brazil holds the record for the most World Cup wins with five titles and is the only team to have competed in every tournament. The most recent winner is Argentina, which won its third title in 2022. 

Lionel Messi won the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar with his Argentinian teammates after defeating France in one of the most intensely dramatic finals in memory. The match ended 3-3 after extra time and was decided in a nail-biting penalty shootout. Argentina won the shootout 4-2, and Messi lifted his first World Cup at 35 years old.

What's next:

Will a new country surprise us in 2026 and make it to the list of champions? Or will we see the return of another giant lifting the prestigious World Cup trophy?

Real Madrid's Gonzalo Garcia has admitted that his rapid rise into the spotlight, capped by a starring role at the FIFA Club World Cup, still feels surreal.

The young forward, who has been a key figure in Xabi Alonso's project, especially at the Club World Cup, sat down with AS to reflect on his journey so far and the challenges ahead.

The 21-year-old is clear about his ambitions with the national team as well. “I always aim for the top. Being able to represent my country in a World Cup… It's a dream. As it would be for any other player.”

He also revealed how limited his contact has been with Spain boss Luis de la Fuente, explaining,

“I haven't had much time to talk to him. Just one training session, and we said hello on the field. Pretty good, four of us made it up there, and it was amazing.”

Furthermore, when reminded of comparisons with former Madrid striker Joselu, he was quick to downplay them.

“I appreciate it, but let's be clear, there's a big gap between me and Raul or Joselu. I'm just starting out, and hopefully I can get close to the numbers they've achieved with Madrid or the national team.”

Speaking about the similarities between Xabi Alonso and Alvaro Arbeloa, Garcia noted,

“Every coach has their own style of play, their own way of seeing football. They are similar in many ways, such as in high pressure. 

“It's not that they are very, very similar and tell us different things, although there are similarities.”

As a forward, he accepts the responsibility of pressing from the front.

“The forward is the first to press when the goalkeeper takes a goal kick, and when the forward presses, it always makes things easier for the team. 

“When you press, if you win the ball back closer to the opponent's goal, you're closer to scoring (smiles).”

The 21-year-old was later asked about the comparisons between Alonso and Carlo Ancelotti, to which he noted,

“With Ancelotti, last year, I came on at very specific moments. It's not like I was there long enough to have an opinion. 

“What I can talk about is Xabi and what he's been telling us. That we need to polish those details to get closer to what he's trying to convey to us.”

Perhaps the most defining moment of his young career came when he was told he would start against Al Hilal in the Club World Cup.

“I'm not going to lie, I knew there was a possibility because Kylian was ill. Obviously, I was surprised, but I approached it with confidence. 

“I was sure of myself because I had worked hard to take advantage of any opportunity. (Thinks and laughs) And I was very happy with how it went.”

On the advice he received that day, he added, “The coach always made me feel calm and confident. 

“He told me to be confident, to press well, to bother the centre backs so they couldn't get the ball out, and when we had it, to try to pin down the centre backs. 

“And inside the box, to take advantage of any opportunity that came up to score a goal.”

That tournament ended with Garcia winning the Golden Boot, something he is still processing. “There, as the World Cup goes on, you don't realize it. 

“You're focused and there are games every day, you don't have time to digest it, but once I'm back in Spain and I'm with my family and friends, you talk about how it was and how it all happened. 

“You look back and think, ‘If someone had told me a year ago… finishing the season playing with the first team and winning the Golden Boot… I can't believe it myself.”

Far from feeling overwhelmed by Madrid's galaxy of stars like Kylian Mbappe, Garcia remains grounded.

“In the end, it's true that you go from playing for Castilla and watching your idols on TV to training with them, and that, of course, impresses you.

“I am just very grateful to be able to share a locker room with them, with the best players in the world.”

His pride was equally evident when speaking about his contract renewal. “I was extremely happy when it was finalised.

“It's the dream of any youth player, and for me it was very special after so many years at the club. I'm very happy to be able to say after so many years that I've fulfilled a dream.”

As for shirt numbers, Garcia was relaxed: “In the summer, my agent was negotiating with Madrid and told me about the options available, but in the end, my priority was to be part of the first team. 

“The number is secondary. Being able to play for the best club in the world… With any number!”

Finally, reflecting on his Santiago Bernabeu appearance against Mallorca, he added,

“Special. I was lucky enough to play there for a year, as I had to move there for family reasons. 

“I was lucky to make good friends and have good teammates, and I'm very happy to have been able to play a few minutes against them,” he concluded.

Preparations are underway in Arlington for next year's FIFA World Cup.

ARLINGTON, Texas - The Arlington City Council released more details about the preparations for the World Cup.

What we know:

The city expects most international visitors to spend about 10 days in North Texas for the tournament.

Law enforcement will limit activity and close off most streets surrounding AT&T Stadium before and after matches to focus on security and other needs.

Arlington Deputy City Manager Jennifer Wichmann said the city is also encouraging local business owners to get excited about the event, saying the opportunity to market to visitors will be key.

"That kind of creativity is what we're trying to help our business see and understand. It most likely won't be a direct contract with FIFA, but it might be a way to attract visitors to your restaurant or enhance a hotel. So we're really working with our community to help with that," she said.

Applications to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held in North Texas, are set to open on Monday.

Council members also dug into the next steps for thousands of volunteers. The applications opened in August and FIFA will reach out to every person who applied this month and next.

FIFA said once approved, volunteers will work several eight-hour shifts. They will get merch in exchange for their time.

People who speak multiple languages are in the highest demand.

The Associated Press reported that the 2026 World Cup will follow the same format as in recent years, just with a bigger collection of teams. 

There will be 12 groups of four teams. The teams in each group play each other and the top two will advance to a knockout stage. The eight best third-place teams will also advance. The knockouts will be played from the round of 32 to the final.

Arlington is encouraging residents to volunteer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as the world's largest sporting event grows nearer.

The city will host the most matches of any city with nine, and Deputy City Manager Jennifer Wichmann said the tournament will need a lot of volunteers.

Anyone who is selected as a volunteer would work eight to 10 shifts of about eight hours, she said. In return, they will get World Cup gear like hats, backpacks and T-shirts, along with possible access to the games while volunteering.

Multilingual volunteers will be in especially high demand since around 54% of visitors, including non-ticket holders, are expected to be international.

The city is looking for ways to get those international visitors to stick around Arlington when they're not attending games or FIFA events, some of which are expected to be held in the entertainment district on non-game days.

According to data from the city, international visitors are expected to stay between nine and 10 days on average, and less than half are anticipated to speak English.

The World Cup is expected to have “Fan Activation” events in the Arlington Entertainment District and at Fort Worth's Sundance Square, according to Wichmann.

She encouraged anybody interested in learning more about the tournament to visit the World Cup 2026 page on the city's website.

The city includes information for residents, visitors and businesses.

It offers guidance on volunteering, the match schedule, short-term rentals like Airbnb and the match schedule for residents. For visitors, the city has compiled information on lodging options, travel information and things to do around the city between matches.

Business owners can also use the website to learn more about commercial regulations and permitting guidelines.

Wichmann said more information will quickly start becoming after Dec. 5, when FIFA will announce which matches will be played and where.

That will open the door for teams to pick basecamps – with six possible locations identified around North Texas including in Mansfield, Dallas and Fort Worth.

The city will hold a town hall for businesses in and around the entertainment district at 1 p.m. Sept. 25 in the Convention and Visitors Bureau auditorium. Another town hall with a yet-to-be-determined focus will be held Oct. 23 at the same time and place.

Speaking ahead of France's opening 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Iceland, Kounde said the relentless pace of fixtures was taking a toll.

"It's not just about the players," he told a press conference on Wednesday.

"There are families. I also think about all the people who work around football and who are sometimes victims of this relentless pace."

France face Ukraine in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday and Iceland in Paris next Tuesday.

Kounde, who plays for Barcelona, did not feature in this year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which ran from June 14th to July 13th in the United States, but the 26-year-old still hinted at the tournament's impact on the already packed season.

Manchester City's Rayan Cherki and Arsenal's William Saliba have pulled out of the double header with injury, while Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele missed training on Tuesday because of a thigh injury.

PSG, who reached the Club World Cup final, played 65 matches in the 2024/25 season.

"It's a whole ecosystem," he said.

"Sometimes in life, when we overdo things, we stop appreciating them. When we see too much, we no longer give it the same importance. 

"That's what's happening with football - it's overconsumption."

The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup added 63 matches to the summer schedule, prompting criticism from players and clubs over fatigue and injury risks.

Kounde urged football's governing bodies to reflect on the long-term sustainability of the current model.

"These are things we need to put into perspective," he said. "And I think they need to change."

Marc Cucurella has revealed a behind-the-scenes incident that occurred during the Club World Cup, which was held in the United States of America.

The Chelsea defender spoke about the moment when US President Donald Trump presented the medals to the winning team, in this case the "Blues", who defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the final, writes "Gazeta Express".

The Spanish defender even reveals that Trump had taken a medal with him during the awards ceremony, in addition to the trophy, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino had previously given him.

"It was an experience, that's clear. He stayed there on the podium to celebrate the title with us. But, on the other hand, we said we wouldn't celebrate until he left. And, the fact is, Trump didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay there. He even got a champions' medal, which I saw in his office in the White House," the left-back told Spanish media outlet AS.

Furthermore, he also spoke about the experience at the Club World Cup, which was held for the first time in the new format, although there were difficulties, especially with the high temperatures.

"I hope things improve at the World Cup, because it was difficult to play in those conditions, with such great heat. I hope things improve next summer," the Spanish footballer further underlined.

"We among the favorites? Spain will be a candidate because we are the reigning European champions, we have the level and the enthusiasm. Let's see if we can close the qualifiers in the best possible way and arrive at the World Cup in good shape," concluded Cucurella. /Express newspaper

Premier League sides spent big strengthening their respective squads, but neither PSG nor Barca made many moves in the market

The 2025 summer transfer window closed on Monday, bringing an end to a summer of almost endless drama and controversy. Premier League sides spent more money than the other 'Big Five' leagues combined, meaning there's a very real risk of title-challenging teams from La Liga, Serie A, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 becoming feeder clubs for England's elite.

That said, Real Madrid splashed a fair bit of cash remodelling their backline, taking Trent Alexander-Arnold away from Liverpool in the process, but it's not as if the right-back is being missed at Anfield, which bore witness to one of the most remarkable spending sprees in football history.

But who were the big winners of the summer? Below, GOAL grades 10 of the continent's top teams in terms of their summer business...

Four years after reaching his first major semi-final at the US Open in 2021, Felix Auger-Aliassime is once again into the last four in New York, this time thanks to an inspired comeback against eighth seed Alex de Minaur on Wednesday afternoon.

On the verge of falling two sets back, the free-hitting Canadian won an absorbing 85-minute second set to draw level, then held his nerve under pressure to claim a gritty 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5, 7-6(4) victory after four hours, 10 minutes. Awaiting Auger-Aliassime in his second major semi-final is either defending champion Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti, while De Minaur slips to 0-6 in Grand Slam quarter-finals.

“It was just a lot of nerves today during the whole match, it wasn't pretty at all times, but that's what Grand Slam matches are,” said Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview. “Somedays you won't feel your best but I was willing to dig deep and do everything I can to stand here right now.

“It feels amazing. Four years ago… It feels like more. It was a tough couple of years but it feels great to be back in the semi-finals. It's been an amazing tournament so far. It's not over, there's some tennis to play and the biggest challenges are yet to come, but that's what I live for.”

Auger-Aliassime had raised hopes of a Nitto ATP Finals berth by winning titles in Adelaide and Montpellier through the opening two months of the year and, after a mid-season struggle, he has thrust himself firmly back into the conversation. With his deep run in New York, which includes a third-round win over third seed Alexander Zverev, Auger-Aliassime is up eight spots to 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

This semifinal was the most anticipated first meeting of the 2022 ATP season. It's safe to say, after Alcaraz's win, in three hours and 35 minutes, that the match and his performance lived to up to all of those expectations, and may have added a few more for the future. “Both of us played an incredible match.” READ MORE2023 Roland Garros SF: Djokovic wins, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1Through two sets, the match was played at hyper speed and delivered on all of its shotmaking promise.

The sun-filled, tension-filled Centre Court. The royalty, Spanish and English, young and old, rooting like hardcore fans. The world's two best players pushing each to their physical and mental limits. “I grew up a lot since that moment in the French Open.” READ MORE2023 Cincinnati F: Djokovic wins, 5-7, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (4)If any final deserved a third-set tiebreaker, it was this one.

There was little between the two players in the first half hour of the match as they traded holds through the first seven games. That's when Djokovic pounced, winning five of the next six games. Perhaps the biggest stat: Djokovic saved all four break points he faced. “Best match of the tournament for me without a doubt.” READ MORE2024 Wimbledon F: Alcaraz wins, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4)Alcaraz looked all of his 21 years.

Djokovic and Alcaraz knew how much Sunday's gold-medal match meant to their careers. And because it was a best-of-three-set contest, unlike many of their recent collisions, they also knew how much the first set meant. It was a first that felt like a fifth—and which, in a way, turned out to be decisive. The Serbian put an end to any men's tennis GOAT debates with his win. "Arguably the biggest success I ever had."

NEW YORK—Rest and relaxation typically aren't associated with the US Open, but Jessica Pegula is making an exception.Start with her results in Flushing Meadows: She's played five matches, and they've all ended in straight sets. The most recent, a 6-3, 6-3 victory over 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, lasted a tidy hour and 26 minutes—her second-longest match of the tournament.Beyond her efficiency on the court, Pegula has probably rested as much as possible off it. That's because of an abnormally consistent schedule for an event that leans into the frenetic.

It's a little weird. Jessica Pegula, on her 2025 US Open schedule

It started on the first day of main-draw play—a Sunday—August 24. Pegula wasn't a fan of the US Open's decision to add a third day to the first round, but she made the most of it, winning her night match 6-0, 6-4—earning her two days off, highly unusual during a major. Even this seen-it-all veteran was unsure how she'd spend her tonnage of idle time.“It's a little bit different than I'm used to, so I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do tomorrow—whether I take the day off and chill, or want to practice, or keep it low key,” Pegula told me afterward in an exclusive chat. “Two days off, I've never had to do that before. It's a little weird.”As our conversation in a hallway by the entrance to Arthur Ashe Stadium continued, Sunday turned to Monday.“With the late finish, though, I think it's kind of nice that I don't have to worry too much about feeling that I only have a day to recover.”High seeds, particularly if they're American, are desirable attractions for US Open tournament officials. They often headline night sessions in Ashe or, during the first three rounds, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Pegula hasn't played under the lights since that opening Sunday, enabling her to develop a routine while colleagues deal with uncertain start times and bizarre sleep patterns. Pegula's second and third-round matches were scheduled second on Ashe, and her fourth-round and quarterfinal contests were on first.

“I think it helps when you can get into a rhythm,” Pegula told Tennis Channel's Jon Wertheim on Tuesday, after reaching her second Grand Slam singles semifinal. “I love being able to play first. It's nice, during the day, everyone's in a good mood and happy. And then, if you win, you're done. It's nice just to go to back to the hotel.”“Always great to have similar schedules from day to day,” Mark Knowles, one of Pegula's two coaches, shared with me over text. “Very helpful.”On top of that, Pegula's Sunday start ensured she'd be playing the first set of matches each round. She'll head into Thursday's (night) semifinal with a full day of rest, unlike, say, Iga Swiatek or Amanda Anisimova, who play on Wednesday.Of course, so will her opponent, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka—who got some unlikely rest of her own with Marketa Vondrouosova's sudden withdrawal.

She embraced it, right? Mark Knowles, on Pegula's 2024 US Open run

The only thing unusual about this match-up is that a trophy isn't at stake. The three most recent Sabalenka vs. Pegula matches, all in the last 13 months, have been giant hard-court finals: at Cincinnati and the US Open last year, and in Miami earlier this year.And like all seven of Sabalenka's wins over Pegula in their nine meetings, they ended in straight sets.Pegula last stood across the net from Sabalenka during Fan Week, after competing in the mixed doubles. She decided to cut their cold and windy practice short, describing it as “terrible.” Then she went to an escape room in the city with friends, and enjoyed a couple of beverages. (Not her first in New York.)

Two weeks later, she's back in the final four.She will surely try something different this encounter, but it may be more mental than tactical. It may be more…relaxing.“Instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly,” Pegula said in her press conference on Tuesday, “enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final, and I'm playing the best player in the world.”She echoed a similar sentiment to Wertheim: “Back myself, and know that I can play good tennis. That I'm a great player.”The 31-year-old has reminded us of that this US Open—a tournament where, after eight months of globetrotting and grinding tennis, any advantage helps. Physically, she comes into her latest Sabalenka showdown with plenty in the tank. Mentally, she appears to be in her best head space in months.Emotionally? Seemingly great, considering her post on X that her mom, Kim, was at her last two matches:

(Usually tight-lipped about her family, the Buffalo native made another reveal in our conversation, when I asked her about HBO's latest season of Hard Knocks, featuring her beloved Bills: “People say my dad's in it a lot—he's pretty funny, which is true,” Pegula says with a laugh. “Maybe that's kind of why I don't want to watch, because it's like, a little embarrassing.”)If Pegula is to overcome Sabalenka, the US Open would be a fitting venue. It was here, last year, that she snapped a six-match losing streak in Grand Slam singles quarterfinals. She also did that against a world No. 1, Swiatek.Referencing the pressure-filled moment, Knowles asks me after a Pegula practice at Indian Wells in March: “She embraced it, right?”“She hadn't gotten past the quarterfinal stage—which, by the way, millions of players would sign up for. The win over Iga was obviously super important, bright lights in New York City, trying to get over that hump.”Pegula followed that with another breakthrough result, over Karolina Muchova in the semis. Victory seemed unlikely when Pegula trailed 6-1, 2-0 and faced break point. But out of position, she sprinted to get her racquet on a Muchova forehand with a defensive stab, and the Czech overcooked the volley. It was the match's turning point.“For me, that was probably a greater victory, because that showed true adversity,” Knowles recalls. “As I told her the minute she walked off the court—and I've been around a long time—99 percent of players would have just said, my run's come to an end.“She was able to dig deep. She's a tenacious player, but she's an incredible fighter.”

Success is... Jessica Pegula, ten days ago

A word that keeps surrounding Pegula this season is “challenges.” When I asked her what success at this US Open is, way back on Sunday, August 24, she said, “it's dealing with the challenges, the ups and downs.” When she won a WTA 250 in Austin in early March, she thanked Knowles in her champion's speech for “accepting the challenges every single day.”A week later at the BNP Paribas Open, I asked Knowles what he thought Pegula meant by that. He gave a remarkable answer:“It's always fascinating when you work with great athletes, and she's one of those. I've known a lot of them, and I've played at a pretty decent level as well. I understand all the stuff that goes into it. It's not just the hitting of the tennis ball or those types of things, it's a grind. I was taken aback at how hard she works—pretty impressive—but there's also a balance there.“I think with any coach, when they start working with a player, you want to hear from the player, you want to see how they react, how they deal with pressure, all the different things, and then you want to ingratiate your own philosophy. You've got to understand, she's been very successful before me, and will probably be very successful after me. So it's about trying to make our relationship, and the same with (fellow coach) Mark Merklein. We're in tandem, we're a full team, we're all on the same page, which I think helps a lot.“What's important for Jess, like all great champions, is they demand a lot of themselves. That's probably what she was referring to. Trying to see an athlete fulfill their potential. And there's going to be challenges. If there wasn't, everyone would be doing it.”

Sabalenka, another great champion, has owned their recent history, but this may be Pegula's best chance to capture an elusive Grand Slam title. It's a full-circle moment for her—bright lights in New York City, trying to get over that hump.It hasn't been the Summer of Pegula, but it could be the September of Jess.“The summer swing hasn't been my best summer swing, and I haven't really been happy with that,” Pegula tells me. “But at the same time, I know I'm able to turn things around, and I know that I can play really good tennis here. I've had really good results here. I just kind of want to tap into that, what I know I'm capable of.“So I feel like success is being able to turn around when things are challenging.”Challenge accepted.

There has been a lot of talk of a Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz final at the US Open this fortnight. The World No. 1 and World No. 2 have met in the past two major championship matches, with their previous five clashes on Tour coming in title deciders.

However, one man keen to block out the Sinner-Alcaraz noise and spoil the party is Novak Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major. The 38-year-old Serbian defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets on Tuesday night to set a semi-final meeting against Alcaraz.

“We know that they are the two best players in the world. Everybody is probably expecting and anticipating the finals between the two of them. I'm going to try to mess up the plans of most of the people,” Djokovic said. “Let's see. Sinner still has to win a couple of matches to get to the final. But they are playing the best tennis of any players here. They have been the dominant force since the beginning of the tournament.

“But I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court. I don't think anybody does really when they play them, but particularly not me. I put myself in another semi-final of a Grand Slam this year. I have been very consistent, most consistent on Slams this season and that's what I said at the beginning of the year, where I would like to perform my best tennis and make the best results. Here we are. I have another chance, another shot.”

Djokovic has advanced to the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025, losing to Sinner at Roland Garros and Wimbledon and retiring against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open.

The four-time US Open champion is chasing his first major since he won in Flushing Meadows in 2023 and might have to go through both Alcaraz and Sinner if he is to end his two-year wait. Sinner – who meets Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals – and Alcaraz have won the past seven majors between them.

Having defeated Fritz in three hours and 27 minutes, Djokovic is hoping to be ready to go by the time he walks back onto Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday. He leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“It's not going to get easier. I tell you that,” Djokovic said cracking a smile. “I'm going to try to take one day at a time. Really take care of my body. Try to relax and recover. The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed. I just would really love that.

“I would love to be fit enough to play and to play potentially five sets with Carlos. I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion. Normally I like to play the big matches on a big stage. It's just that I'm not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days. But I'm going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that.”

Djokovic also reflected on his quarter-final win against Fritz in his post-match press conference. The seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, up three spots to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, improved to 11-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the American.
“Taylor is the kind of player that if you allow him to play, he's going to try to dictate, he's going to be aggressive, stay close to the line. He's going to take his forehands and punish you. I was just trying to survive, just trying to stay in the rally, make him play,” said Djokovic, who is 31-9 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
“I think it was good for me that he wasn't making a lot of first serves in the first couple of sets. Then he raised the level of the first serve, and the first-serve percentage went up. Then, all of a sudden, it was so much more difficult for me to stay in his service games. But then, you know, I think in important moments in the fourth I served well, mixed it up, came to the net as well…. It's one of those days where you just have to grind, you know. You just have to play with your heart and fight.”

Djokovic is now tied with Jimmy Connors for the most semi-final appearances (14) in tournament history. He won the US Open in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2023.

For the 11th straight time against Fritz, it was Djokovic's match. He did everything a little better, especially on the points that mattered most.BySteve TignorPublished Sep 03, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—On Sunday, Taylor Fritz was asked why he thought he had an 0-10 record against Novak Djokovic. His answer was simple:“I think the first, almost like seven or eight times I played him, I probably just wasn't a good-enough player to really have that much of a chance.”Fritz is a better player now, and he showed that by pushing Djokovic through four competitive sets in the US Open quarterfinals on Tuesday night. But in the end, the reason for his 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 loss was the same: He wasn't as good as Djokovic.Djokovic and Fritz looked and played much the same. They were both dressed in black. Both have similarly lanky but strong builds; Fritz is 6'5”, Djokovic 6'2”. Both hit semi-Western forehands and two-handed backhands. Both spend most of their time pummeling the ball from the baseline.

But with the exception of the serve—and even there it's close—Djokovic does all of those things a little better than Fritz. He can rally for longer. He can spread the court more and put his shots closer to the lines and the corners. He's a better returner, a looser and more flexible mover, a better defender, and he has a better transition game. And while Fritz had more aces and won a higher percentage of his first-serve points, Djokovic was the more clutch server: He saved 11 of 13 break points, while Fritz saved five of nine.All of this meant that Fritz faced a difficult tactical question: Should he use his pace to try to end the points quickly, knowing that Djokovic is a rock from the backcourt? Or should he extend the rallies, knowing that he has 11 years on Djokovic? Fritz, according to his coach, Michael Russell, followed his usual instincts and opted for the former. It got him closer than he's been in the past, but still short of victory.

It didn't help that he got off to a predictably nervous start, missing first serves, overhitting forehands, and going down an early break. While the American settled down soon after, he never got that break back. The match's first inflection point came with Djokovic serving at 5-4. Five times he faced a break point, and five times he saved it, each with an aggressive play.“In many of my service games I was just trying to stay alive, fight for every ball,” Djokovic said. “He was aggressive, staying close to the line, not easy to play him.”That pattern held through the first nine games of the second set. Fritz reached break point with Djokovic serving at 1-2, 2-3, and 5-4. Finally, when Djokovic served for the set, Fritz broke through to make it 5-5.The crowd was on its feet, Fritz was pumping his fist for the first time, and Djokovic finished the game with a weary bail-out drop shot that fluttered into the net.

But then, with the prospect of a dreaded fifth set looming, Djokovic knuckled down. At 4-4, he played a crisp attacking game and held at love. With Fritz serving at 4-5, a nearly exhausted Djokovic hung on for dear life through a series of long rallies with the crowd urging Fritz on, and closed it out on his third match point.“It was incredibly close match, it was really anybody's match,” Djokovic said. “In these kind of matches, a few points decide the winner. It was fortunately coming on my side, end of the fourth. That last game was nerve-wracking.”As for Fritz, it was a case of déjà vu all over again: He couldn't take the points he needed most from Djokovic.“That's one of the things that makes, like, the great players great. They win the big points, and that's something that I kind of touched on before the match is, like, I'm going to need to go out and take those points from him,” Fritz said. “He's not just going to hand them over to me.”“That's exactly what happened. A lot of my weapons, aggressive shots were just not there, letting me down. So I felt like it was tough for me to go out and take those points.”

Djokovic was uncharacteristically subdued in victory. In part, he was a bit chastened by his fights with the crowd.“I wear my heart on my sleeve,” he said. “I'm really proud of the fight I put in.”The other reason he may have been more low-keel in victory. He's already thinking about his next assignment: A semifinal war with Carlos Alcaraz, in two day's time.

Novak Djokovic was tested by Taylor Fritz on Tuesday at the US Open, but managed to navigate the key moments and capitalise on the American's missed opportunities to continue his quest for a record-extending 25th major crown.



The 38-year-old, who has lifted the trophy in New York four times, dispatched last year's finalist 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 to extend his perfect Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Fritz to 11-0. Fritz will rue his two-for-13 break-point conversion rate, letting slip his first nine break opportunities.

"Incredibly close match," Djokovic said in his on-court interview. "It was really anybody's match. I thought I was lucky to save some crucial break points in the second set. I think for most of the second and third set, he was a better player. In these kind of matches, a few points decide the winner."


After below-par performances in the early rounds and several visits from the physio during those matches, Djokovic has played into form throughout this fortnight and will next face rival Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster semi-final clash. Djokovic leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including victories in their past two matches. Friday will mark their first encounter at Flushing Meadows.

Djokovic was clutch in big moments against Fritz, including when the Serbian served for the opener at 5-3, a game in which the American held five break points, but was unable to convert.That theme continued throughout the night. Fritz again had three consecutive break points when Djokovic served for the second set at 5-4. This time, the California native converted his second break point of the game — his 10th of the match — when Djokovic dumped a backhand drop shot in the net, but the momentum shift was short-lived.Fritz double faulted down break point the next game, which handed the advantage right back to the 24-time major champion. Djokovic slammed the door, serving out the set and deflating Fritz's hopes of a maiden win against the 100-time tour-level titlist.Despite Djokovic's two-sets-to-love lead, the drama intensified early in the third set when Djokovic dropped serve in the fourth game. The Serbian, visibly irritated, had to contend not just with Fritz's pressure, but also a restless New York crowd. Fans roared when he missed first serves, and their agitation grew when Djokovic pleaded chair umpire Damien Dumusois for more crowd control.Fritz began to swing more freely off his forehand and started to hold the advantage in longer rallies, but a sloppy game at 4-5 in the fourth set cost him a chance at a decider. Fritz double faulted on Djokovic's third match point, putting an end to the thrilling three-hour, 24-minute match."That last game was nerve-wracking," said Djokovic, who is third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, only behind Alcaraz and second-placed Jannik Sinner. "Tough one for Taylor to finish with a double fault, he didn't deserve that, but a great fight and a great tournament for him.“I didn't feel like I was dominating today from the back of the court. In many of my service games, I was just trying to stay alive, fight for every ball. He was aggressive, staying close to the line. Not easy to play him. At the end of the day, winning matters and I'm really proud of the fight that I put in and I wear my heart on my sleeve always for this sport. I'm still enjoying it.”After shaking hands with Fritz and the chair umpire, the seventh seed busted out the viral ‘Soda Pop' K-pop dance. Djokovic explained in his on-court interview that it was dedicated to his daughter, Tara, who was celebrating her eighth birthday.
Djokovic is now tied with Jimmy Connors for the most semi-final appearances (14) in tournament history. He won the US Open in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2023.

Djokovic has reached the semi-finals at all four majors this season, marking the seventh time in his career that he has achieved that feat. He holds a 31-9 season record, according to the Infosys Win/Loss Index.

The 2022 champion is into his third semifinal in Flushing Meadows in four years.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 02, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 02, 2025

NEW YORK—Few have played Carlos Alcaraz tougher in 2025 than Jiri Lehecka, who split a pair of three-set matches with the former world No. 1 earlier this season.But the US Open proved a different stage entirely as the second-seeded Alcaraz blitzed No. 20 Lehecka, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to race into his third semifinal in four years at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Tuesday."I think that today I kind of met the Grand Slam version of Carlos," Lehecka said after the match. "I felt that against Carlos, if you want to beat him, you need to win at least few of the big points, and he won all of them, you know. Even when I played really good rally, even when I tried to put him under pressure, go to the net, change the rhythm, do something, he was there, and he had an answer for everything I tried."Alcaraz won his first major title in Flushing Meadows back in 2022, but has not won a hard-court major since, picking up two titles each at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. The former No. 1 has not dropped a set this year and now stands two wins from his second US Open victory after a one-hour, 56-minute victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium.Lehecka was partly responsible for some of Alcaraz's hard-court struggles earlier in the year, stunning the Spaniard in three sets at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in February. Though he avenged the Doha defeat two months ago on grass in Queen's Club, Alcaraz conceded the big hitter from the Czech Republic has become a formidable rival.

“I struggle every time that I played against him,” Alcaraz said after reaching the last eight on Sunday. “There is no doubt about it. That means really how difficult it's play against him.”Lehecka was initially reluctant to explain exactly what makes him such a tough out against Alcaraz, ultimately boiling down the test to be one of focus.“Against a player like Carlos you need to bring your best, and it means that it's not only about playing one particular shot, because he knows how to react,” Lehecka said after reaching his second career Grand Slam quarterfinal. “That's his big weapon. You know, that he knows how to react when someone is playing well, when someone is playing this or that.”That focus wasn't there in the early goings for Lehecka, who dropped serve in the opening games of the first and second sets and failed to make in-roads on return as Alcaraz eased to a two-set lead.

Lehecka opened the third set more promisingly, keeping on serve through the first six games. He saved a break point in the seventh, outvolleying Alcaraz at net to take a 4-3 lead.Alcaraz found another opening two games later, flipping a 30-0 deficit to earn another break point, this time converting after turning defense to offense and drawing a wild forehand error from Lehecka."If I want to beat a guy like him, then I really need to show my best at the big points, because every time I had a chance—for example, in the second set when there was a close game when I had a chance to go at least for a break point, you know, there was a good rally. We played very good rally, but unfortunately, he was everywhere. He always managed to do something special," Lehecka said in his post-match press conference. "So even although I didn't play bad, I played very good shot or something like that, he had the answer. Yeah, that was kind of demotivating sometimes."

Serving for the match, Alcaraz breezed towards the finish line, winning 12 of the match's final 14 points and fended off some late rain drops to roar over the finish line with a final forehand winner.In all, Alcaraz struck an impressive 28 winers to just 17 unforced errors, winning 84% of points played on his first serve and won without facing a break point across three sets.Alcaraz will next face the winner of another intriguing quarterfinal clash that pits former No. 1 Novak Djokovic against top-ranked American Taylor Fritz, who made his first major final at this very tournament last year.

At 45 years, old, the former world No. 1 partnered Leylah Fernandez to reach the quarterfinals.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 03, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—Having already achieved a Hall of Fame-worthy career multiple times over, Venus Williams still sees room for growth after her summer comeback ended at the US Open on Tuesday.“I think after this tournament I can really see where I want to improve, what I can work on,” Williams said following a quarterfinal-round defeat in women's doubles. “Yeah, I think that it's all great feedback. But also, I had a lot of chances to play a lot of matches here, which is what I would desperately need to get better. I saw myself improving so much with every match I was playing.”Off the court for 16 months, Williams made a valiant return to action at 45 years old this summer, winning her first singles match since 2023 at the Mubadala Citi DC Open and pushing two-time semifinalist Karolina Muchova to three sets in the first round of this year's US Open.

Despite the disappointing exit, Williams rebounded in doubles with Fernandez, a 2021 singles runner-up. In their first tournament as a pair, they upset No. 6 seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez en route to the last eight, where they ultimately fell to top seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.“In a lot of ways, we just ran out of time,” Williams said. “I wish I could have played better today for Leylah. I blame myself for a lot of it. I just wasn't there. I think with a few matches I could have been a stronger partner today.”The five-time Wimbledon champion has been reluctant to commit to more tournament after the US Open swing, blaming her ambivalence towards long flights as she seemingly ruled out the upcoming Asian Swing and even the 2026 Australian Open.

“I do have commitments, you know, places I said I'd be, people expecting me to be there, like, the next few weeks,” said Williams. “So I have to go and show up. But I'm very serious about my commitments. I would never want to cancel now, so I'll try to keep those.“If there is opportunity for me to play, then hopefully I can get back somewhere this year. I just don't know. I really don't.”For all the talk of Williams' age, the press conference with Fernandez ended with a bit of levity when the former No. 1 was asked about Will Smith, the Academy Award-winning actor who played her father Richard in the eponymous King Richard biopic in 2021.Q.

Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach. The American-Canadian pairing is into the quarterfinals in New York.

Update: Venus and Leylah Fernandez's doubles run ended on Tuesday with a 6-1, 6-2 loss to the top-seeded team of Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. Sadly, Serena never showed up at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, but we know she was locked in at home.

NEW YORK -- Serena, you're on the clock.

Venus Williams called her sister out and requested her presence in New York after reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open doubles draw, alongside partner Leylah Fernandez, on Monday.

"She's given us advice, and we just need her in the box," the 45-year-old icon said in her on-court interview after the pair's impressive 6-3, 6-4 win over 12th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai. "So my message is, 'Serena you need to show up.'"

Asked later what kind of advice the 23-time Grand Slam singles champ had for her sister -- whom she won 14 major doubles titles with, don't forget -- Venus said Serena is a motivator, and she can hardly contain her nervousness watching them on TV.

"She gave me a pep talk and made sure to call me today," Venus said. "She's definitely coaching from afar. She's so excited. She gets so nervous watching, and she's got the kids watching. They're all at home, just really on our side."

But if Serena is going to coach them, Venus prefers that she do so in Queens, not from a distance.

"If she came, it would be a dream for both of us, and we'd have her on the court coaching," Venus said. "We'd force her to hit, even though she doesn't hit often. It's probably best she doesn't come because we'd probably bully her."

It's been quite an interesting tournament for Williams, who lost in the revamped mixed doubles event before dropping her first-round match to now-quarterfinalist Karolina Muchova.

But Williams decided to stick around in New York a bit longer, accepting a wild card into the doubles draw with Fernandez. They've torn the house down in Louis Armstrong Stadium since playing their first match last Thursday, winning three straight without dropping a set and becoming one of the more delightful stories of the tournament.

But they're much more than just a nice story; they're a legitimate threat to win it all. We all know about Venus' doubles pedigree, and Fernandez -- a former US Open singles finalist in Flushing Meadows -- is also a former French Open doubles finalist.

They'll face their stiffest test on Tuesday, again in Louis Armstrong Stadium (their happy place), against the top-ranked doubles players in the world, Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. 

Hopefully Serena will be in the house to give them an extra boost. Though the way they're playing, they might not need one.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was half a second away from scoring a point at the Dutch Grand Prix, following criticism earlier in the weekend by the team's Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore.

Franco Colapinto has earned praise from Flavio Briatore after narrowly missing out on a points finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Alpine chief calling it “probably his strongest” performance of the season so far.

Going into the weekend, Briatore made headlines by declaring that he was “not happy” with Colapinto's results since the Argentinian took over from Jack Doohan at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix – having so far failed to score.

However, Zandvoort brought more encouraging signs from the F2 race winner, who made his F1 debut as a Williams substitute driver last season before being released to join Alpine over the winter, initially as a test and reserve driver.

Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out.

In an encounter full of incidents and Safety Cars, and amid battling displays from both drivers, Alpine split their approach for the final restart by giving Colapinto fresh tyres and leaving Gasly out on old rubber.

Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position.

“Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”.

Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. It was a race where we had to be alert and ready to capture any opportunity. I felt I drove well and, at the flag, [scored] my best finish of the season.

“As a team there are some parts of the race we will assess to see what we could have done better. We made a call at the end to pit for softs during the final Safety Car to try and attack cars ahead towards the points. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end.

“There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Both Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll finished in the points for Aston Martin in the Dutch Grand Prix, and they give their views on how the race panned out.

Aston Martin had an up and down weekend in Zandvoort, at times looking set to be McLaren's closest challengers but also enduring two separate car rebuilds. As a result, getting both cars home in the points can count as a success – even if one driver seemed happier than the other.

Fernando Alonso finished eighth but was left frustrated after rueing some of the strategy calls across the race. Having started P10, he dropped down the order after a poor getaway and soon found himself stuck in a queue of cars.

He started to question the calls over the radio, and the team chose to pit him a second time – even though at that point, it looked like everyone was going to try and go to the end on one set of tyres. As such, he missed out on a cheap stop under the Safety Car, but still picked up a handful of places as others came in for more tyres.

“At the end to be in the points in P8 is great, a nice result but the afternoon was not easy,” Alonso explained.

“The Safety Cars didn't help, they were all at the wrong time and the wrong place. And yeah, some of the cars that finished in front of us, I think they were significantly slower than us… [like] the Haas [cars], so we lost maybe an opportunity.”

Aston Martin had started the weekend strongly – both cars in the top four in the first practice session, with Alonso then finishing second in FP2. But their pace faded on Saturday as others began to turn up their engines, and so the Spaniard only managed P10 on the grid.

That, coupled with his poor start, is where his race ultimately came undone – but recovering to eighth at the flag is still a decent result.

“It was tough. I think when we were all in the same conditions in Quali, we were just on the edge of Q3 so yeah, we still need to improve,” he concluded.

As for Lance Stroll, he managed to come home seventh despite starting from P19 on the grid and making contact with Gabriel Bortoleto in the early stages. That moment ended up being a blessing in disguise, as the team brought him in for a very early pit stop.

As such, he undercut his way past the majority of the field – and then benefitted when the Safety Car came out. It was a good recovery from his lowly grid slot, and just reward for his team, who had had to rebuild his car not once but twice thanks to crashes in FP2 and Qualifying.

“Shoutout to the team for rebuilding the car Friday night and then again Saturday after the off in Qualifying,” the Canadian said.

“It was a frustrating weekend until that point but we had good speed though from FP1, we were up there and I felt good in FP3, it was just Saturday afternoon that was a shame so it was nice to bounce back today.”

The result keeps Aston Martin in the fight for fifth in the Championship with Williams, whom they trail by 18 points. But they need to be wary of the recovering Racing Bulls, who are just two points behind now thanks to Isack Hadjar's maiden podium.

The Cooldown Room - Stroopwafel Challenge with Alba Larsen

Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc

Isack Hadjar secured his first podium finish in Formula 1 at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Racing Bulls team boss Alan Permane surprised by his pace.

Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane has admitted that running towards the front of the field during the Dutch Grand Prix "was actually pretty comfortable", as the team secured a podium finish.

Isack Hadjar put in one of the performances of the weekend, taking fourth place on the grid behind both McLarens and Max Verstappen at the Zandvoort Circuit.

Having held his position at the start, the 20-year-old kept both Charles Leclerc and George Russell at bay during various points, and when Lando Norris ahead retired in the closing stages, it allowed Hadjar to become the youngest Frenchman to claim a Formula 1 rostrum.

"A bit dazed, a bit over the moon, excited. Honestly, I can't wait to get to Monza, all of those [races]. Proud of the team," said Permane when reflecting on the podium, the team's first since 2021 when it was known as AlphaTauri.

"I don't want to sound blasé but at the start of the race I thought it was going to be tricky to race the Ferraris and the Mercedes. And then after 10 laps you think, this is going to be okay, we've got this.

"The Safety Car came and that gave us a relatively straightforward stop on to the hard tyre and from then it would have been a run to the end and we had the pace, we were pulling away. So fourth was actually pretty comfortable, which is lovely to say."

While Hadjar was able to claim an unexpected result, team mate Liam Lawson was left frustratingly outside the points after a collision with Carlos Sainz when running seventh and on course for his fifth points finish of the season.

"Such a shame for Liam. He was doing well, he got a great start," said Permane, with Racing Bulls now seventh and only 20 points behind Williams in the Teams' Championship in fifth.

"I don't know where he would have finished, I guess he would have finished with the Mercedes had he not been taken out by Carlos. These things happen, he'll come back strong and we can expect him to be back in Monza fighting."

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.

							By 

	Andrew Perez



Donald Trump's least convincing impersonator, Ron DeSantis, is bringing the president's attacks on science and the health and safety of children to the Sunshine State. 


	DeSantis' handpicked state surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced Wednesday the state will move to eliminate all vaccine requirements for children to attend public schools. That means Florida children will no longer need to get vaccinated against measles, polio, mumps, or chickenpox. It would be the first state to eliminate such requirements.


	Speaking about vaccine mandates on Wednesday, Ladapo said: “Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” adding: “Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and God.” Ladapo is best-known for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines, including the claim that mRNA-based vaccines may threaten “the integrity of the human genome.” 


	DeSantis additionally announced the launch of a state MAHA Commission, named after the “Make America Healthy Again” slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary and one-time brain-worm haver Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 

	











	DeSantis said the state's commission will work toward “improving transparency and accountability in health care” and “restoring trust in the medical profession and in public health.”


	The governor's pledge to end all childhood vaccine mandates in Florida comes as the Trump administration, led by Kennedy, conducts a sweeping assault on science and the ability of Americans to vaccinate themselves and their children. It comes as measles, a highly contagious disease that was once eradicated in the United States, is spreading throughout the country once again.

	











	Kennedy has long promoted the baseless theory that some childhood vaccines cause autism, and once claimed “there's no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” 


	Under RFK Jr.'s leadership at the Health and Human Services Department (HHS), the Trump administration has restricted eligibility for Covid vaccines and booster shots, and there's concern the administration will attempt to remove them from the shelves altogether. Last week, the White House attempted to oust the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), creating chaos throughout the agency.

	In June, Kennedy fired members of the panel that advises the CDC on vaccine safety, so he could attempt to replace them with non-experts who share his views. 


	DeSantis is now making Florida healthy again the same way Trump and Kennedy are doing so at a national level: by putting everyone at risk of getting diseases that vaccines have protected us from.

It's been three years since Will Smith, on the night he won his first Academy Award for his performance in “King Richard,” changed his career forever (and for the worse) by slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage. In the immediate aftermath, Smith was banned from the Oscars ceremony for 10 years, and he's spent years rehabilitating his public image, including most recently going back to his rap roots as The Fresh Prince.

Hollywood appears to have forgiven him. 

Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and their company Westbrook have now signed a first-look deal with Paramount that will see Smith starring in and producing multiple features, ones the studio is labeling “global, four-quadrant theatrical movies.” Under the pact, Paramount has already announced two projects that are meant to star Smith and that the studio also hopes could be the start of new franchises. Westbrook will also get some fancy office space on the Paramount lot.

First up for Smith is “Sugar Bandits,” which is based on the book “Devils in Exile” by author Chuck Hogan. The film was previously set up at Universal but Paramount has acquired all rights and have it in development, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire. Hogan is the author of “Prince of Thieves,” which later became Ben Affleck's “The Town,” and “Devils in Exile,” originally published in 2010, is the story of an Iraq War veteran who begins running jobs ripping off drug dealers in Boston. And the second project is “Rabbit Hole,” which is an original screenplay being written by “Dune” scribe Jon Spaihts, though no details on that one just yet.

 










It's a major opportunity and major shift in the industry perception of Smith, who did star in 2024's “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and has still proven to be a bankable star with that film (it made $404 million worldwide), but between a few films put into development with old collaborators like Michael Bay and some other notable projects set up at Westbrook, saying he's taken a step back is an understatement.

Paramount, which has flashy new owners in Skydance, has been aggressively making deals with big names to bolster its film roster, all par for the course for a new regime looking to make a name for themselves. It won a bid for a James Mangold project that would reunite him with Timothée Chalamet, it recently wrenched the Duffer Brothers away from Netflix to produce and direct films, series, and streaming properties, and it also this week inked a deal with video game developer Activision to bring the massive “Call of Duty” franchise to the screen.

Smith is just another feather in their cap and proof that David Ellison and company aren't going to be shy about taking a few big swings.

Paramount Pictures continues its streak of high-profile deals, sealing a first-look, multi-picture deal with Will Smith and his company Westbrook.


	Following the closing of the Skydance merger last month, the new pact with Smith will focus on creating global, four-quadrant theatrical movies with franchise-starting and IP-based films.  


	The terms encompass a first-look deal with a development commitment to franchise-starters positioned as starring vehicles for Smith, which include the thriller Sugar Bandits and Rabbit Hole. Westbrook will be based on the Paramount lot in Hollywood.

	











	Based on the book Devils in Exile by Chuck Hogan, Sugar Bandits follows a former Special Forces soldier who runs an elite vigilante squad working to wipe out the drug trade in Boston.




			Watch on Deadline		







Rabbit Hole will be penned by Dune scribe Jon Spaihts; plot details are unknown at this time.


	The deal marks another huge win for Paramount, which has been on a streak of luring big-time talent under new boss David Ellison. Last month, the Duffer brothers, who had a strong relationship with Netflix going back to the debut of Stranger Things, signed a four-year deal with Paramount last month that stunned the industry.


	Smith and Westbrook previously had their deal with Sony for decades. 


	Paramount has also been busy on the content front, recently acquiring the rights to adapt a feature film based on the Activision video game series Call of Duty. It also made a big splash the day the Skydance deal closed, landing the coveted package High Side starring Timothée Chalamet, with James Mangold directing.

	











	Smith and Westbrook are repped by CAA.

Chad Hodge is joining creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as co-showrunner. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Prime Video is ready to send Lara Croft on her next adventure.


	The Amazon-owned streamer has confirmed that Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner will play Lara Croft in its Tomb Raider series from creator, writer and co-showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As THR previously reported, Turner emerged as the frontrunner for the coveted role late last year from a short list of actresses that also included Mackenzie Davis, Emma Mackey and Lucy Boynton. 




	The series has also brought on Chad Hodge (Good Behavior, Single All the Way) as co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge and set a Jan. 19 date for production to begin. Jonathan Van Tulleken (Dope Thief, Shōgun) has also signed on as director and executive producer.

	Turner, whose recent credits include HBO Max's The Staircase and the ITV/CW miniseries Joan, will be the third actress to play the iconic video game character in a live-action adaptation of Tomb Raider. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander took on the role in previous feature films.


	“I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said in a statement. “It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out — Croft is coming.”


	Said Turner, “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft. She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many — and I am giving everything I've got. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.” 

	











	Waller-Bridge, an avowed fan of the video game franchise, began developing Tomb Raider in early 2023, and Prime Video placed a series order for the show in May 2024. Cyrstal Dynamics (which developed the Tomb Raider game franchise), Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM Studios are producing the series.


	Waller-Bridge executive produces via her Wells Street Productions. Hodge, Van Tulleken, Wells Street's Jenny Robins, Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson, Michael Scheel, and Legendary Television also exec produce. 


	Turner is repped by Independent Talent Group and Public Eye Communications; Waller-Bridge, by UTA, Independent Talent, McEwan & Penford and Johnson Shapiro; Hodge, by WME, Anonymous Content and Ziffren Brittenham; Van Tulleken, by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Independent Talent; and Story Kitchen, by WME and Pryor Cashman.

	It took awhile but Prime Video's Tomb Raider series is finally going to production. Some elements have stayed the same — Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who had been attached from the get-go, is creator, writer, executive producer.


	And Sophie Turner, who entered negotiations last November after testing for Lara Croft, is confirmed for the high-profile role previously played on the big screen by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander.


	New additions include Chad Hodge as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge and Jonathan Van Tulleken (Shōgun, Dope Thief) as director and executive producer.

	That is exactly three years after word first emerged that Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Waller-Bridge had been tapped to write a Tomb Raider TV series under her overall deal with Amazon MGM Studios. The series was officially greenlighted in May 2024, with Turner identified for the lead six months later. 


	That was followed by months of no new updates amid speculation about creative issues on the series which reportedly went through two writers rooms that didn't result in approved scripts. Hodge, creator of such series as Runaway, The Playboy Club, Wayward Pines and Good Behavior, was brought in as a consultant in the second room, sources said. That led to his appointment as executive-producer and showrunner. Meanwhile, Turner's schedule started filling up, putting a 2025 production start in doubt.

	











	“I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” Waller-Bridge said. “It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…”


Tomb Raider is based on the popular video game franchise, which follows the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft (Turner).


	The series, from Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, is executive produced by Crystal Dynamics, Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions, Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen, Michael Scheel, and Legendary Television.


	“Lara Croft is one of the most recognizable and iconic video game characters of all time. We are thrilled to have the wonderfully talented Sophie Turner bring this character to life who is defined by her courage, strength, and unshakable resolve,” said Vernon Sanders, Head of Global Television, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios. “Led by the brilliant Phoebe Waller-Bridge, this series will honor the beloved Tomb Raider legacy while delivering fresh adventures to fans worldwide.”


	Turner, an Emmy nominee for her first major role as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones, recently headlined the British crime drama limited series Joan and the thriller movie Trust and next stars in another British show, The Dreadful.


	“I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said. “She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I've got. They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”Waller-Bridge is represented by UTA, Independent Talent, McEwan & Penford, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Turner is repped by CAA and Independent Talent Group. Hodge is repped by WME, Cullen Conly at Anonymous Content, and Dean Bahat at Ziffren, Brittenham. Van Tulleken is repped by WME, Untitled, and Independent Talent. Story Kitchen is repped by WME & Pryor Cashman.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate‘s feature take of Freida McFadden novel The Housemaid will now be released on December 19 instead of Christmas Day.


	The studio is so over the moon about the Paul Feig-directed thriller starring Sydney Sweeney, Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar that the plan is to get the age 18-24 bunch who are off from college, who'll then spread the word of mouth on the pic heading into Christmas.


The Housemaid will now open against 20th Century Studios' James Cameron event title Avatar: Fire & Ash. Note, The Housemaid in its young, heavy-female skew is counterprogramming to that family event title. The Housemaid will also be sharing the marquee with wide entries in Paramount/Nickelodeon's SpongeBob Movie: The Search for Squarepants and Angel Studios' Zero A.D.

	Sweeney's previous romantic comedy with Glenn Powell, Anyone But You, bowed on the Friday before Christmas in 2023 to $6 million and did an awesome 14.7x multiple stateside for an $88.3M take, $220.3M worldwide, becoming one of Sony's most profitable titles that year.  In The Housemaid, Millie (Sweeney) is trying to escape her past and accepts a job as a live-in housemaid for the wealthy Nina (Seyfried) and Andrew Winchester (Sklenar). But what begins as a dream job quickly unravels into something far more dangerous — a sexy, seductive game of secrets, scandal and power. Behind the Winchesters' closed doors lies a world of shocking twists that will leave you guessing until the very end.Pic also stars Michele Morrone and Elizabeth Perkins. Rebecca Sonnenshine wrote the screenplay off McFadden's novel. Producers are Todd Lieberman, Feig and Laura Fischer.

Painting an attractively-composed picture of Italian theater legend Eleanora Duse (1858-1924), festival favorite Pietro Marcello has for his latest feature swapped an underdog striving to achieve — as seen in 2019's “Martin Eden” — for an achiever striving to maintain. In a post-war landscape where everything is uncertain, the decades-strong and since-retired actress Eleanora Duse (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) announces her return to the stage, signaling the start of a singular rise and a simultaneous fall; an ever-tightening grip on her passions whilst her relationships with those she loves and is loved by disintegrate around her.

It should be noted that Eleanora Duse is a historical figure of whom there is very little documentation. Hardly anything was recorded of her acting or voice, which is why Marcello — who has equally worked in documentary forms over the years — has opted for a fictitious exploration of her life. It is a shame then that the figure that he conjures is so one-dimensional. Bruni Tedeschi, who has a striking resemblance to historian Mary Beard in this role, plays Duse with a perpetually raised voice and wild-eyed fervor for theater that is, at first, uncomfortably parodic.

 










Her commanding presence is undeniably powerful, but we're granted little in which to root her intensity. Marcello himself admits in the film's press notes that filming the theater scares him, and unfortunately it shows. “Duse” suffers for the scarcity of the pursuit that it and its inhabitants purportedly care so passionately about. When the stage is finally set for a rehearsal, doubts about Marcello's approach escalate. “I did not learn how to shout without losing my voice just to be told to lower it” yells Gabriele D'Annunzio (Fausto Russo Alesi), creative and romantic partner of Eleanora Duse, as he intimidates and educates a new member of the company. For the first act of Marcello's film, you would believe the director had imbibed this idea as a mantra for himself. It is hard to understand someone or grow sympathy for them when they won't stop yelling at you, and when all the world's a maximalist stage for the ensemble of “Duse,” an emotional response is hard to elicit.

Stepping into this equation like a salve is Noémie Merlant, the film's standout performance and true emotional core, playing Eleanora's soft-spoken daughter, Enrichetta. Frequently pictured getting in and out of boats, the clear blue sea lapping behind her, she never stays long. She is cast away by her mother, who wishes nothing to interfere with her theater. In an almost-stirring early scene, she is denied entry to Duse's new play, forced to walk away tearfully with her kids in tow. It's a shame that the film's screenplay, penned by Marcello and co-writers Letizia Russo and Guido Silei, sidelines her just as Eleonora does.

 










There's a real sense that “Duse” has been structured the wrong way around. We are introduced to the supposedly legendary figure of Elenora Duse and her desire to return to the stage before we've seen even a glimpse of her performing on one. The rise of fascism encroaches on her like a disease, culminating in a personal invitation from Mussolini himself, but we're dealt countless scenes of Eleonora's psychosis before we're granted a contextual explanation of what feeds it. The gradual cementing of this satisfying micro-macro parallel does little to counter the one-note nature of the central performance that must be endured for the hour that precedes it, even if “Duse” may play more immediately and understandably to a domestic audience. Archival footage appears to be spliced between scenes in place of exterior establishing shots, but, if anything, these glimpses are frustratingly intriguing, allowing us to wonder what a deeper delve into the world surrounding Eleonora might have elucidated about her life and the theater she strives to perform.

All this is presented in a continuous stream, where characters will note the passed time to each other, their conversations stretching across years in a matter of minutes to a disorienting effect which becomes poignant in the film's final act. Eleanora's psychosis takes on richer meaning as the acting slows and characters are forced to confront one another — and themselves. Bruni Tedeschi is in a one-woman play for too long, and the film finally has a chance to sing as Merlant re-enters the picture.

 










A cursory post-screening internet search of Eleonora Duse reveals that she dabbled in film acting, and almost worked with D.W. Griffith. In her later life, she was the partner of Lina Poletti, one of the first out lesbian women in Italy. But neither of these absent episodes fit the overly-neat, tried-and-tested narrative arc found in Marcello's film. There's an intriguing thread to pull on in the mother-daughter relationship, which could have been expanded on earlier — ultimately it is too little too late.

“Duse” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Kaouther Ben Hania's Gaza-set drama The Voice of Hind Rajab, one of the buzziest titles coming into this year's Venice Film Festival given its subject matter, received what might be a film festival record 23-minute and 50-second ovation after its world premiere Wednesday evening, when the audience broke into chants of “free Palestine” after the lights went up.


	It was certainly the biggest response at this year's festival for the drama, which reconstructs the events surrounding the killing of 6-year-old Hind Rajab, her four cousins, her aunt and uncle, and the two paramedics who came to her rescue after their car came under fire by Israeli forces as they tried to flee Gaza City in January 2024.

	











	The killings took place some three months into Israel's ongoing military operation in the Gaza Strip, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 terror attacks, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 61,000 people living in the Palestinian territory.

	Here in Venice, it's thought that Pedro Almodóvar's English-language debut, last year's The Room Next Door, had been the ovation record-holder at 18 minutes. The longest recorded applause at a film festival had been a 22-minute standing ovation for Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth at the Cannes Film Festival.

	After tonight's screening, as the “free Palestine” chants began, Hind Rajab actor Motaz Malhees took one of many Palestinian flags in the audience and held it up in the gallery. Several audience members were seen and heard sobbing during the film — and some were still crying even after it ended.

	Last week, a number of Hollywood A-listers came on board Hind Rajab as executive producers including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer. Phoenix and Mara were present today at the Venice photo call for the film and attended the premiere screening, where the cast of the film held up a photo of Hind Rajab amid the ovation.

	Tunisia has already selected the drama as its submission for the Best International Feature Oscar.


	At the film's press conference this afternoon, Ben Hania and her cast entered the room, and were greeted with a standing ovation, after which actress Saja Kilani took the mic and gave an impassioned speech on behalf of the film's crew.


	“Enough of the mass killing, the starvation, the dehumanization, the destruction, and the ongoing occupation,” Kilani said. 


	“This film is not an opinion or a fantasy. It is anchored in truth. Hind's story carries the weight of an entire people. Her voice is one amongst 10s of 1000s of children that were killed in Gaza in the last two years alone. It is the voice of every daughter and every son with the right to live, to dream, to exist in dignity. Yet all of it was stolen in front of our unblinking eyes.” 


	On Saturday, a large protest gathered on the Lido in support of Palestine and to denounce Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. 


	In his review, Deadline's Damon Wise called the movie “extraordinary” saying it “could be the lightning rod that supporters of the Gazan cause are waiting for, an urgent procedural that uses cinematic means — close, hand-held takes and a camera that paces around like an expectant father — to make its point.”


	He also noted, “This vital movie is not about the how or the when, it is all about the why.”


	Ben Hania is one of Tunisia's most internationally renowned directors. Her last film, Four Daughters, was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2024 Academy Awards, having been presented in Competition at Cannes and winning the Golden Eye award.


	Her previous film, The Man Who Sold His Skin, was also nominated at the Oscars, for Best International Feature in 2021.


The Voice of Hind Rajab is produced by Nadim Cheikhrouha under his Mime Films and Tanit Films banners. Additional producers are Odessa Rae at New York-based RaeFilm Studios and James Wilson at London-based Jw Films Production.


	The Party Film Sales is handling international with a number of key distributors already on board. CAA Media Finance reps North America.

Great.  Maybe we should divide The Venice Film Festival into two halves with walls and checkpoints.

Feel bad for Hinds and her family but the chants of “free Palestine” during the standing O are disgusting. I won't have anything to do with Venice going forward.  This is just another example of how out of touch with mainstream America most filmmakers are.

Gotta be honest with you big dawg, I don't think this French-Tunisian co-production was very concerned about mainstream American interest when they were making a film about the murder of a Palestinian child

The fact that everything is getting a standing ovation is proof that it all sucks.

The Odyssey will get a one hour standing ovation.

Sickening

Yes, what Palestinians have endured for the last 75 years or so is sickening.

What's scarier than aliens or doppelgängers? Perhaps the waiting game for a highly anticipated film from an acclaimed director with a constantly shifting release date? If that's high on your list of phobias, Jordan Peele and Universal have a scare in store for you. The Get Out director's next film—his first since 2022's Nope—has been quietly removed from the studio's 2026 calendar, Variety reports. 

As is typical of Peele's work, there are no known details about the film's plot or cast. We do know that it was originally supposed to premiere around Christmas 2024, but it was rescheduled due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes. It was then pushed to October 2026 for a (perhaps thematically appropriate) Halloween release, but it has since vanished from the calendar entirely. A source close to the project did tell Variety that Peele was at work on the film, so it seems like it's still happening—just a little later than originally planned. Cameras reportedly haven't rolled yet, so it could be a while until we hear anything definitive.

Like Peele's prior films, this one is being described as a “horror thriller.” The director also spoke about it—albeit vaguely—on the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast in 2024. “I do feel like my next project is clear to me, and I'm psyched that I have another film that, you know, could be my favorite movie if I make it right,” he said. 

Peele has been keeping busy as a producer in the meantime. Last year, he helped rescue Dev Patel's Monkey Man from Netflix obscurity. Later this month, Universal will also release Justin Tipping's Him, a film he produced starring Tyriq Withers and Marlon Wayans. Him follows a rookie football player's journey to the top, with what seems like an appropriately Peele-esque supernatural twist somewhere along the way. That film kicks off September 19 in theaters.

The Warrens wrap up their role in 'The Conjuring' universe with this latest entry in the hit horror franchise. 


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	It's not just the floorboards that are creaky in the ninth entry in the venerable Conjuring horror franchise. It all began with the 2013 original, depicting the exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. That indomitable duo is back for one last go-around in The Conjuring: Last Rites, and it must be said that they look tired.


	And why wouldn't they be, considering the travails they've been through in their previous films? Not to mention that Ed suffered a heart attack in the last one, from which he is still recovering. As this installment set in 1986 begins, the couple are semi-retired, reduced to giving talks in virtually empty lecture halls to young people who are much more excited about Ghostbusters.

The Bottom Line

	
	A franchise suffering from fatigue.
	



Release date: Friday, September 5Cast: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Mia Tomlinson, Ben Hardy, Steve Coulter, Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Beau Gadson, Kila Lord Cassidy, John Brotherton, Shannon KookDirector: Michael ChavesScreenwriters: Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick

								2 hours 15 minutes			






	Of course, just when the Warrens thought they were out, they're pulled back in for one last case. Specifically, the real-life case of the Smurls, an extended family living in a Pennsylvania coal town who experience things going bump in the night after they make the mistake of purchasing a hideous, hand-carved wooden mirror featuring cherubs at its top.

	Unfortunately for them as well as the film's viewers, it takes a long time for the Warrens to arrive. As a matter of fact, everything takes a long time in this attenuated entry clocking in at a bloated 135 minutes. It begins with an unnecessary prologue set in 1964 depicting the birth of the couple's daughter Judy, who nearly doesn't survive.

	











	When the action shifts forward 22 years, it resembles an old-fashioned television show, with the now-grown Judy (Mia Tomlinson) and her boyfriend Tony (Ben Hardy) arriving for a family get-together that includes much comic banter, a lively game of ping-pong, and Tony nervously asking Ed and Lorraine for their blessing before he proposes to their daughter. Lorraine beams with pleasure, while Ed registers grumpy disapproval like every dad in every family sitcom ever.


	It soon becomes clear that Judy has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, leading her to become aware of the Smurl family's plight. Also aware is her parent's old friend Father Gordon (franchise veteran Steve Coulter), who goes to see a bishop to request help for the beleaguered family. Not surprisingly, the visit doesn't go well.


	So it's left to the Warrens, with Judy and Tony in tow, to head to Pennsylvania where the Smurls have become a media sensation. Cue the predictable spooky mayhem as everyone battles a series of evil manifestations, including dolls, that by now feel all too familiar in their jump scares. This is the kind of haunted house movie in which everything seems to happen in dark rooms, the characters armed only with flashlights, as horrific storms rage outside. It's the kind of movie in which a character enters a dark attic alone, because she's apparently never seen a scary movie before.


The Conjuring: Last Rites trades heavily in nostalgia, with numerous callbacks to past adventures and frequent visitations to the Warren's “Artifact Room,” where Annabelle still resides in her locked cabinet. And since we've been watching the Warrens battle demonic entities for 12 years, they now feel like old friends. Farmiga and Wilson haven't lost their appeal, and with their relaxed chemistry they make for engaging company.

	











	But it all feels old hat by now, with returning director Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun II) failing to bring much freshness or vitality to the proceedings. The stateliness of it all feels even more old-fashioned in light of such recent audacious and original horror films as Sinners, Weapons, and everything directed by Jordan Peele.


	Despite its title and final moments informing us of what happened to the real-life Warrens in their last years (complete with archival clips and photographs), the family tradition may live on, cinematically at least. Tomlinson delivers a terrifically intense performance as the psychically gifted Judy, leading one to think she could easily headline yet another Conjuring offshoot.

Ed Harris (Top Gun: Maverick) has been cast in a leading role in Paramount+‘s Yellowstone, Beth and Rip spinoff series, The Dutton Ranch (w/t). He will star alongside the previously announced Kelly Reilly, Cole Hauser, and Finn Little, who will reprise their original roles. Annette Bening was also recently cast as a lead in the upcoming drama, which will be showrun by Chad Feehan.


The Dutton Ranch, home to Beth Dutton (Reilly) and Rip Wheeler (Hauser), is a testament to the peace they sought, fought for, and nearly died for, as they've come to cherish their 7,000-acre land. With tough times and stiff competition, Beth and Rip do what they must to survive, all while ensuring Carter (Little) becomes the man he's supposed to be.

	Harris will play Everett McKinney, a weathered veteran and veterinarian who treats animals with compassion and understanding, and possesses a good sense of humor.




			Watch on Deadline		







As Deadline revealed in December, the show is expected to remain on the same present-day timeline as the original series, with the new offshoot sharing the most DNA with the mothership of any show in the universe to date.


Yellowstone follows the Dutton family, which controls the largest contiguous cattle ranch in the United States. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son.


Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros, and Keith Cox. Paramount Global Content Distribution distributes the series.


	The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals, for CBS, starring Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton. Additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 were previously announced as being in development.

	











	From Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios, The Dutton Ranch is executive produced by Sheridan, Glasser, the Linsons, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Yari, Friedman, Feehan, Voros, Reilly, Hauser and Cox.


	Harris has been nominated for Academy Awards (Apollo 13, The Truman Show, Pollock, The Hours), Emmys (Westworld, Game Change, Empire Falls), and a Tony Award (Precious Sons). He was last seen on TV in HBO's Westworld playing The Man in Black across the show's four-season run. His small screen credits also include HBO's Empire Falls and TNT's Riders of the Purple Sage.


	Last year, he narrated the Netflix documentary Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy War. Up next, he will play Hollywood agent Neal Saroyan in Marvel's Wonder Man for Disney+. On the big screen, he starred opposite Jessica Lange in Long Day's Journey into Night, which is currently on the festival circuit. He will next be seen in the black comedy-thriller Huntington, working opposite Glen Powell and Margaret Qualley, as well as in the pickleball comedy The Dink. 


	A further sampling of his film credits includes Top Gun: Maverick, Netflix's The Lost Daughter, the A24 film Love Lies Bleeding, the comedy-drama film My Dead Friend Zoe, and the crime thriller feature film Riff Raff. Harris is repped by CAA.

ROAM represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent booking agency worldwide. 


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Two of independent music's most respected booking agencies, North America-based Arrival Artists and U.K.-based ATC Live, have merged to form ROAM, a new global booking agency with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris and Glasgow, Scotland. The combined agency represents more than 800 artists, making it the largest independent and fifth-largest music booking agency worldwide (behind WME, CAA, Wasserman Music and UTA). 


	According to ATC Live co-founder Alex Bruford, ROAM will “provide a genuine alternative in the global booking agency landscape.” 


	Bruford founded ATC Live 15 years ago with a small roster of six artists and grew it to more than 400 artists and 40 staff. When Arrival Artists first launched during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the company already had a relationship with ATC Live and saw the potential for a “strategic partnership” with a “similar mindset,” explains Arrival co-founder Ethan Berlin. “This initial collaboration was rooted in a commitment to developing artists, and the shared vision for growth solidified during the pandemic,” he adds.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Arrival co-founder Ali Hedrick adds that early on, the two companies had twice-weekly talks and realized they had a “shared identity, a shared culture.”


	The business structure of ROAM is a 50/50 ownership between the two former agencies. Hedrick says this was a deliberate choice: “Neither one of us wanted to own each other. We wanted to be a true partnership.” This structure allows the agency to remain partner-owned, which Berlin says offers “a sense of pride in being able to run our own company that bleeds into the work that we do every day.”


	The name ROAM was chosen to reflect the agency's mission, explains Bruford, noting that it “gravitated towards the meaning of traveling with curiosity and purpose,” while foreshadowing “how we wanted to work with our artists and build road maps with them exploring opportunities and making journeys together.”


	ROAM's strategy is to offer a high-touch, artist-centric approach to global representation, where agents maintain their primary territories and “collaborate on the rest of the world” to find the best opportunities for their clients. Bruford adds that the goal is to offer “global representation to the artists who want it” with “agents on the ground representing artists in a global manner.” 


	“We have a proven track record of developing artists from small venues to major stages,” says Bruford, who pointed to ATC Live's taking Fontaines D.C. from the 150-capacity shows in 2018 to a 45,000-capacity sellout concert in London's Finsbury Park earlier this summer. ATC Live also booked The Lumineers in 2012 to play a small venue in the U.K.; this year, the band booked the O2 Arena for the third time. 


	Bruford also notes the work ATC Live has done with established artists like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, who joined ATC Live in 2018 as an arena headliner and saw a “50% increase in ticket sales” on the band's most recent tour. He emphasizes that “growing artists from day one is such an important part of our business, but also adding value to established artists is key as well.” 


Sarah Joy, who started as a coordinator at ATC Live and worked her way up to partner, says the company is “keen to champion homegrown agent talent” and is putting “a lot of energy into nurturing diversity across the workforce”. She proudly notes that ROAM has a gender split of “59% female and 41% male across its workforce,” bucking the male-dominated agency business.


	Beyond concert and appearance booking, ROAM provides a range of services including digital marketing, brand partnerships and philanthropic activations. Both companies also jointly invested in a third-party company called Company X to serve as a branding and sponsorship division. Hedrick described having more branding opportunities at Arrival than at any other agency she's worked for, citing a two-and-a-half-year sponsorship deal between Mt. Joy and Coors that was involved in the band's sold-out Madison Square Garden show.


	“Their approach is incredibly artist-focused and tailored to each artist,” says Joy.


	The goal of combining resources into a unified company means “creating an agency where artists can grow careers without compromise, uniting scale with agility and execution with creativity,” Bruford tells Billboard.   “Any artist that's looking for some strong global representation but with that high-touch artist-centric approach should come and talk to us,” he adds.

Every TV fan knows the power of the workplace comedy.

Sure, there's “The Office” and two decades of its single camera successors — but it's also the backdrop of everything from earlier hits like “Murphy Brown” and “The West Wing” and classic examples of the genre like “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” To be a working American is to unwind by watching other working Americans.

It is in that rich tradition that “The Office” creator Greg Daniels teams up with co-creator Michael Koman for “The Paper,” which quickly sheds the pressure of a spinoff while introducing a new office full of people to love. Set in Ohio, the show follows a struggling local newspaper and its many employees. With no budget to hire real journalists, the “Toledo Truth Teller” sets out to become a local paper of repute, all while followed by the same documentary crew that captured “The Office.”

There's new editor-in-chief Ned (Domhnall Gleeson), online editor Esmeralda (Sabrina Impacciatore), writers (or those aspiring to be) Mare (Chelsea Frei), Nicole (Ramona Young), and Detrick (Melvin Gregg). Tracy Letts is a brilliant choice for a recurring executive who supports the “Truth Teller” while running a toilet paper empire (you read that right).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The Paper” has much of what made “The Office” soar, with the benefit of an existing playbook (as well as the aforementioned workplace comedies and many more): bumbling bosses, budding romance, and Oscar Nuñez — reprising his role as Oscar Martinez in a new accounting job. The joke density is lethally calibrated between the writing, direction, performances, reactions, and heightened absurdity of any mundane situation. (The pilot includes Ned being locked in a room by his soon-to-be employees while they assess him as a security risk, and one of them noting, “We don't know you, sir. Why should we know why you say the things you say?”).

The biggest critique that can be leveled at “The Paper” is that it introduces a lot of characters — no more or less than “The Office” in its first season, but with half as many episodes to get to know them, especially those along the periphery — but even those along the edges provide killer punchlines and a strong enough skeletal character to be built out moving forward. Consider Travis (Eric Rahill), Adelola (Gbemisola Ikumelo), Adam (Alex Edelman), and wizened journalism vet Barry (Duane R. Shepard Sr.). Showrunner Koman and the writing staff stick to a few standout dynamics in Season 1, but with lots more space to play in the future.

 










Gleeson is the de facto lead, armed with a solid American accent and Leslie Knope-esque love for journalism, but Impacciatore runs away with every scene from the start. To compare Esmeralda to Michael Scott would be a disservice (especially when more of that spirit can be found in Tim Key's supervisor Ken), but on paper she fills the role of a slightly obtuse authority figure preoccupied with her own agenda. In practice, she's outrageously entertaining, from line readings to body language to glimpses of Esmeralda's genuine street smarts (or lackthereof, which provide some of the season's biggest laughs in Episode 5, “Scam Alert!”).

The first 10 episodes chronicle the day-to-day of keeping the “Truth Teller” afloat, a struggle that feels as futile as Dunder Mifflin's quest to sell paper did in 2005 (and hits extremely close to home if you happen to be working in news media, ahem). With the focus on local news and the paper's staff, “The Paper” indulges in world-building its workplace like its predecessor or “Parks and Recreation” or “Abbott Elementary” and so much other esteemed company. If you've never imagined how a newspaper staff might co-work with toilet paper sales workers, that's about to change.

 










The bingeable first season will leave everyone from “Office” diehards to new viewers wanting more — which is just as well, since Peacock ordered a second season a day before its debut. While we hope for a bigger episode order and quick turnaround, the “Truth Teller” staff will be reporting for duty, available to stream and make us laugh any time.

All 10 episodes of “The Paper” Season 1 will premiere Thursday, September 4 on Peacock.

Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — his law slashing taxes for the wealthy and health care for the poor — is getting a rebrand. After meeting with the president's 2024 campaign team, Republican lawmakers are now calling their law a “working families tax plan.”


	This latest name, of course, is a misnomer: The law's tax cuts are designed to disproportionately benefit the wealthy and will do little to nothing for poorer Americans. And its provisions slashing Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are expected to force millions of people off their coverage. 


Polls show the law, which GOP lawmakers named the “Big Beautiful Bill” at Trump's insistence, isn't popular with voters. Republicans seem to be ceding that point now, with the new message coming from the White House. 


	Trump's top campaign advisers held a workshop Wednesday with House Republican lawmakers and their staffers. According to an invite published by Punchbowl News, Team Trump said it would track attendance at the event, conveying that “at least one staffer per office” was expected to attend. 

	











	“I'm told House Republicans are being told by the WH to start calling TRUMP's Big Beautiful Bill the ‘Working Families Tax Cuts' Plan in order to message it to voters better ahead of midterms,” a Fox News reporter posted on X during the meeting.


	As the event ended, a New York Times reporter noted that Republican lawmakers were now describing Trump's signature legislation as a “working families tax plan.”

	











	“So we are discussing the Working Families Tax-cuts Plan!” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) posted on Wednesday. “Some call it the ‘one big beautiful bill' and the reason is that it is the absolute best tool to give WORKING FAMILIES Tax Cuts!… thank you, President Trump!”


	Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) wrote, “The working families tax plan passed this year is a huge win for everyday families across rural Arizona. Radical democrats resent it because they wanted to keep giving Medicaid to illegals.”

	Vice President J.D. Vance previewed the big, beautiful rebrand in a recent Fox News appearance, touting the administration's “incredible working families tax cuts.” In an interview with USA Today, Vance called the bill “the biggest working families tax cut in a generation.”


	In truth, Trump's second tax law is designed to give a big hand up to America's wealthiest, not working families — which might explain the messaging issue.

	In December 2006, Taylor Swift spent around three hours serenading a crowd of about 45 people at Jeff Jarrett's home in Tennessee. In a recent interview with TMZ Sports, WWE Hall of Famer recalled the “amazing experience” where the singer-songwriter, who had recently released her self-titled debut featuring “Tim McGraw,” hosted an impromptu private concert for his family a few months before his wife died.


	“It was Christmas of 2006. My first wife [Jill Gregory] was really ill with breast cancer. She passed away about five months after this, so she was really ill,” Jarrett said. Swift was a family friend who often babysat their young daughters. They were the ones who set the show in motion. “The girls wanted her to sing and play,” he continued, noting that Swift had to “actually run back home” to grab her guitar. 


	“She kind of bonded with the family, specifically with the girls,” Jarrett said. Swift continued to show up for the family after Gregory died. “What a very cool relationship that developed. When my wife passed away, Taylor would come around, and was really good with the girls.”

	Jarrett keeps in touch with Swift's father, Scott Swift, and is rooting for Swift and her fiancé, Travis Kelce. “It's very cool to see this side of Taylor,” he said. “She's early 30s, and I can just see little kids running around when Scott and Andrea have grand babies. It's really cool to see the evolution of her not of her professional career, but her personal life.”

	Swift and Kelce announced their engagement on Aug. 26. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” they wrote in a shared Instagram post. During an appearance on his New Heights podcast, the musician said that their love story “is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.”

Paris Jackson rebuffed Colman Domingo for calling her “helpful” during the production of Antoine Fuqua's Michael Jackson biopic, saying instead that her notes were ignored and that the film about her father is filled with inaccuracies and “just full-blown lies.” 


	Across several posts on Instagram Stories, Paris distanced herself from the biopic, the first part of which is set to arrive in April 2026 (no release date has been announced yet for the second part). Paris said she “read one of the first drafts of the scripts and gave my notes about what was dishonest/didn't sit right with me, and when they didn't address it I moved on with my life. Not my monkeys, not my circus.”


Paris felt compelled to speak out on the film after Domingo — who plays controversial Jackson family patriarch Joe — made some innocuous-seeming remarks about her involvement with Michael at a benefit gala during the Venice Film Festival. Domingo thanked Paris and her brother, Prince, for their guidance, saying, “They're very much in support of our film,” and that Paris had been “very helpful” during the production. (Paris was also attending the event.)

	











	After Domingo's comments got picked up, Paris responded to him directly on IG Stories: “Don't be telling people I was ‘helpful' on the set of a movie I had 0% involvement in lol that is so weird.” (A rep for Domingo did not immediately return a request for comment.) 


	But Paris focused her dissatisfaction primarily on the film itself. She said after her script notes were ignored, she decided to leave the film “alone, because it's not my project.” Of the film's veracity, she seemed to directly address her dad's fans, pointedly adding: “A big reason why I haven't said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you are going to be happy with [the movie]. Like, a big section — the film panders to a very specific section of my dad's fandom that still lives in the fantasy. And they're going to be happy with it.”

	Mentioning other major biopics like the Queen/Freddie Mercury film Bohemian Rhapsody and the Mötley Crüe adaptation of The Dirt, Paris said, “The thing about these biopics is, it's Hollywood. It's fantasyland. It's not real. But it's sold to you as real.” 


	She suggested the same thing was happening on Michael: “The narrative is being controlled. And there's a lot of inaccuracy and there's a lot of just full-blown lies. At the end of the day, that doesn't really fly with me. I don't really like dishonesty. I spoke up, I wasn't heard, I fucked off. Y'all are gonna like the fucking movie. So just, go watch it, go enjoy it, do whatever, leave me out of it.”


	Paris did not offer any specific examples of what she felt was wrong with the film or its portrayal of her father. A representative for Lionsgate, the film's production company, also did not immediately return a request for comment. And despite Paris' qualms with the film, Michael does otherwise have the backing of the Jackson estate.


Michael has faced numerous delays and controversy over the course of its beleaguered production. Filming initially wrapped in May 2024, but its original April 2025 release date was pushed until October 2025 after 22 days of reshoots were required. After that date came and went, the latest April 2026 release was announced earlier this summer.


	According to reports, the reshoots centered on the film's third act, which was set to delve into the child molestation accusations against Jackson. But Michael reportedly violated a legal agreement between representatives for Jackson and then-13-year-old Jordan Chandler, who accused Jackson of molestation in 1993 and later received a $20 million settlement. That agreement also stipulated that Chandler's story and personhood could not be dramatized in a film about Jackson.

	As it stands, the first half of Michael is set to focus on the early days of Jackson's career, from his time in the Jackson 5 to his decision to go solo after releasing Off the Wall in 1979. The second film would cover the rest of the King of Pop's career, though its third act would likely sidestep the accusations Jackson faced. 


Michael is set to star Jackson's own nephew, Jaafar Jackson, in the lead role. Along with Domingo as Joe Jackson, the cast includes Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, Laura Harrier as music executive Suzanne de Passe, and Kat Graham as Diana Ross.

Seven years after her explosive debut, the superstar is back with a new album and ready to prove she doesn't just talk a good game — she's still at its top.


													By
												

	Carl Lamarre



	It's well past midnight at New York's Daylight Studio, and Cardi B is fighting to stay awake. Five hours into her Billboard photo shoot, a slight wardrobe malfunction with her black dress is prompting a quick timeout. “S–t, I got a wedgie,” she groans, dropping into her seat with a smirk. But like a true New Yorker, she toughs it out — chewing ice and cracking jokes like she's headlining her own late-night set.

	











	Clutching a Chick-fil-A cup, she rattles off a story about the fast-food chain botching her order. Then she seamlessly swerves into her recent social media spat with WWE's Naomi. A couple of days earlier, Cardi had hosted SummerSlam at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium — and in the run-up to the event, she'd threatened on X to shave Naomi's head and use her hair as a wig. “I just be talking s–t because I know these b–ches can really fight,” she gags, eyes gleaming.


	Cardi's jokes and swagger never clock out. But behind the antics, she's focused — and eager to reassert her hip-hop dominance. Seven years after her Grammy Award-winning, multiplatinum-selling, culture-shifting debut, Invasion of Privacy, she's finally ready to launch her next act with her long-awaited second album, Am I the Drama?


	“I'm really one of those artists that people ask for their albums the most every year,” Cardi says matter-of-factly. “I wouldn't be confident if nobody asked me for my s–t. Imagine nobody asking for an album of yours? Imagine nobody asking for your music? That's why I'm so confident.”

	











	She has only released one album, but Cardi B already boasts a Hip-Hop Hall of Fame-caliber résumé. She became the first female rapper to win best rap album at the 2019 Grammys. She has five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s and 13 top 10 hits. She's also the first female artist to have every track on an album certified platinum or higher by the RIAA.


	Along the way, Cardi evolved into one of music's most sought-after collaborators, partnering with pop giants Bruno Mars and Maroon 5 for Hot 100 chart-toppers, as well as hip-hop upstarts such as Latto and GloRilla.


	“What's special about Cardi is that she knows her audience, her fan base and how to stay relevant,” says Shawn Holiday, her manager at Full Stop Management. “She hasn't put out an album in seven years, but she knows how to stay current because she knows how to do features that keep her in the marketplace.


	“GloRilla was a new artist at the time [they collaborated],” he continues. “Cardi didn't care. She was really trying to empower other females in hip-hop. It wasn't about the money for Cardi; she did it because she loved the song and knew she could add value to it.”


	While her music wins are undeniable, it's Cardi's triumphs outside of the studio that have solidified her legacy. Since releasing Invasion of Privacy, she has become a global brand force, securing partnerships with Fashion Nova, Reebok and Whipshots; her deal with NYX Professional Makeup culminated in a Super Bowl commercial in 2024.


	It's hard to believe, given all this enormous cultural influence, that she still has yet to embark on her own headlining tour. “A lot of people say I got comfortable because I make money, but the most money I make is when I go and do shows,” says Cardi, who tweeted in 2022 that she'd netted $1 million for a 35-minute show at a private event during Miami's Art Basel. “I could rush and put out music like it's nothing and then pick up millions of dollars per show, but it's not about that. I want the music to be great. I want it to be amazing.”

	













	With 23 tracks set to appear on Am I the Drama?, including two Hot 100 No. 1s — 2020's “WAP” and 2021's “Up” — Cardi's aiming to prove it was worth the wait. Slated for release on Sept. 19, Cardi's second act features a tougher storyline: Expectations are sky-high, her divorce from rapper Offset is pending, she's raising their three kids on her own and she's navigating the new Atlantic Music Group (AMG) regime under CEO Elliot Grainge.


	“Cardi B is synonymous with the excellence that has made Atlantic Records a historically significant record label,” Grainge tells Billboard. “She is a real vanguard and a groundbreaking career artist who continues to push hip-hop and popular music culture forward in surprising and inspiring ways. There is no one like her. We are fortunate to be in her orbit.”


	In June, Cardi released the album's first single, “Outside,” a trunk-rattling track where she defiantly shakes off the shackles of her marriage and steps into singlehood. The song debuted in the top 10 of the Hot 100, a reminder that even amid chaos, Cardi can still storm the charts.

	











	But if “Outside” was Cardi coming out swinging, it's the René & Angela-sampling “Imaginary Playerz,” released in mid-August, where her pen first draws blood. Jay-Z famously flipped the R&B duo's 1982 single “Imaginary Playmate” for his own “Imaginary Players” in 1997, and on her version, Cardi makes the beat her own as she fires shots with sniper-like precision. “My flop and your flop is not the same/If you did my numbers, y'all would pop champagne,” she snaps.


	“Cardi remains at the top of her game,” AMG COO Zach Friedman says. “She released a great record with ‘Outside,' marking another exciting milestone for her. The entire AMG family is here to support her vision for the new album. She continues to be one of one.”


	It's 2 a.m. when Cardi finally steps off-set, the 11-hour shoot behind her. She exhales, eager to trade couture for pajamas and finally fix that pesky wedgie. These marathon days, the kind that test your patience and prove your stamina, are the grind she has been craving — the same grind that helped her become an overnight icon. Now, seven years after Invasion of Privacy forever changed the rap game, Cardi is ready to be the headline, the plot twist and the finisher all over again. This time, she's walking straight into the drama, daring anyone to even match her smoke.


It has been seven years since Invasion of Privacy. How have you grown since then?


	Since then, I've experienced a lot. The good and bad of fame, the hate, jealousy, drama, balancing my career with my personal life and growing up and maturing. I've learned to control my emotions and understand how life works and how to play chess better.


With all you've accomplished, what still motivates you to chase greatness?


	I'm passionate about winning and everything that I do. If I'm learning something, I want to be the best I can be. I love the game, I love evolving. I don't love listening to my own music.


Really?












	No, it's not that I don't like it, but I've heard it a million times. Now I hear so many things and I'm like, “Ooh. Why do I sound like that?” So I like evolving, the way I pronounce things and the way I come up with things. I really love it.


Did you ever have a moment where you questioned whether this second album would actually come together?


	Never. I always knew that I was going to drop a second album, I just didn't have a project well put together.


	My fans be like, “Oh, you should have put a project together when ‘WAP' and ‘Up' was out,” but I only had four records that I liked. I didn't have an album done around that time. I'm not the kind of person that's going to lock in in two months and complete an album. I'm very picky with my music.


But in this era, you can drop one-off singles like you did with “WAP” and “Up” and be OK.


	Yeah, but I want to put out this whole project because I have a lot of songs. I recorded 60 songs. Every other day, I'm a different person, I change my mind [about everything]. My team is always like, “I hope you don't change your mind about your songs.” I'm like, “Nope. I'm settled.”


Since you broke out, the world of talented female rappers has become more competitive than ever. How do you stay confident and clear in your lane amid all that?


	So many girls come and go. They're great, but yet [the fans are] asking for my product. Every year there's a debate on social media about when is my album dropping. They're not saying that about other people, so y'all need to ask them. That's why I'm so confident.


Why do you think people are fascinated with women MCs feuding? Is there a world where everyone can coexist peacefully, or does the game thrive off competition?












	No lie, these b–ches be catty. You can't prevent a b–ch from being shady. Sometimes b–ches want to see what you're about. They want to test you and they want to test your gangsta. A lot of the b–ches will come in this game and feel like they can challenge you. Some b–ches like to die young. In this game, you need to really know who you're challenging.


People often refer to you, Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion as the “Big Three” women in rap. Even without an album in seven years, why do you still feel like you belong in that tier?


	Because I do my job well and I take my time with my music — clearly you can see that. But it's something you'd have to ask the fans. So many [rappers] come and go, and I'm still here. You can downplay my accent, but I put a lot of thought into my work. I don't half-ass anything I do.


What does success look like for Am I the Drama? A No. 1? A Grammy? Or is the win just in finally delivering it?


	Winning a Grammy, the most prestigious award, you can never take that from me. Everybody wants to downplay it, but everybody wants one. [But] times have changed. Success for me will be people saying, “She put out a great album.“ If [at] 3 a.m. people are talking about the album, that's going to be success for me because people can't wait to downplay it. I even want the people who don't like me to be like, “Yo. That s–t is fire.” Yeah, eat your f–king fruits, n—a.


SZA said she owed you a verse for the album. Did she ever send it in?


	She did not! I feel like she's been really tired because she's been on tour and then on top of that, I don't know. Maybe she did do the verse. I've been hearing other conversations. We'll see about that.


Can you share any features we can expect on Am I the Drama?


	Nah, I don't want to share it. (Laughs.) You just got to hear it.


What went into the decision to include “WAP” and “Up” — both several years old — on the album?












	Because my fans asked for it. My fans always be like, “B–ch, you better not [leave them off the album].” My fans do not stop reminding me of the fact that I didn't submit “WAP” for the Grammys. I'm not always going to submit [my music to the Grammys], but on top of that, people are crying about that like, “Oh, it's about numbers.” Those two records are not going to count for the first-week numbers, which everybody cares about. So what's the issue? [Editor's note: Any activity generated by “WAP” and “Up” before Sept. 19, when the album is to be released, will not count toward the album's weekly chart performance.] At the end of the day, so what, you're going to get 21 new songs. [“WAP” and “Up”] are going to be at the end. So what you're crying for? You really don't care.


	Other artists do the same thing. You only care because of me. If I'm really doing it for the numbers, I could put “Money” [released six months after Invasion of Privacy] because “Money” is [multiplatinum]. I could put “Press” [from 2019]. That's platinum. Hold on, I got a lot of successful f–king records. (Laughs.)


How would you compare your relationship with Atlantic now versus when you first started in your career?


	It's a little different because there's a lot of new people. I started off with different bosses and now I have new ones. S–t, I feel like I had a disagreement on a song with them because I didn't really want to put it out, but it still worked out in my favor. It's like, “Alright. Maybe I can trust y'all a little bit with that.” It's never like, “Oh, I hate my label. I'm [bumping heads] with my label,” and stuff like that. As long as y'all give me my budget, I'm happy. It is a little sad not being with the same people that you started off with, but the new bosses, they're cool. They're young. They get it. You just have to have conversations with people and go directly to them. Be direct, say what you want, be direct to me and that's just that. We're good.


Your connection to fans, especially through Spaces on X or Instagram Live, has always been strong. How much did those bonds keep your spirit up through the album process?












	We have a relationship where I love them. Just like how you love your family and friends, you are going to get into arguments with them. They could be a little bit annoying, like, “Aight. Now y'all doing too much,” but I really love them. They can be therapeutic. It's so weird because I have somebody new in my life and explaining that type of relationship to my fans [can be weird], but they know me. And I know them. I don't go by people's approvals, but I do take my fans' approval for certain things into consideration. It's kind of weird. If they don't like something or somebody, I want them to like them, but it's like, “Why do I care? Why do I want my fans' approval?” But that's because they care about me a lot.


You've built one of the strongest feature runs in rap. In your eyes, what makes a Cardi B verse so special?


	First, I got to really like the song. Second, even if I like the song and I don't hear myself on it, I'll literally tell an artist, “I don't want to ruin your song.” If I do it, it's because I feel very confident. I'm going to put my 100% on it. If you're putting me on your stuff, I'm going to show love to it. I'm not just going to be like, “Oh, here's the record,” promote it for one day and goodbye. I really put my all in it and if I can't do it, I'm going to tell you straight up, I can't.


You've never officially hit the road for a full tour. What would a Cardi B tour look and feel like?


	I know I'm a good performer. Well, am I? No, I'm great. I'm actually really great because I was a stripper. (Laughs.) But no, I think my personal tour is not going to be like any other performances that I've ever had. From the aesthetics to the look to even the way I perform, I'm going to be doing things that I don't normally do, like work out, because I want to be the best. I've been going to so many different tours. I went to the Madonna show and the Beyoncé show. I can't perform like Beyoncé, but you can't half-ass nothing.


You know Beyoncé doesn't drink water onstage, right? If she does, it's only a sip.












	Yeah, but I got asthma. My fans know I got asthma. They know I'm going to have to take a water break, but I'm going to give it my all. I always say this: I have two left feet, but I'm going to have to get a fake leg. A right one because I'm going to give it my all. This is going to be one of the greatest tours. I'm going to make it the best.


What about the Super Bowl? Is performing at halftime something you see in your future?


	Of course. I got asked to do the Super Bowl and I denied it. I feel like soon, if I get to do it, I'm going to have more hits. I'm going to be more experienced and I'm going to eat that up.


Since Invasion of Privacy, you've become a ­mother of three. How has motherhood shaped you?


	It turned me into a real woman. I was like, “What makes a woman? Her body? Her cooking?” It's her maturity and her thinking. If I didn't have kids, I wouldn't sacrifice so much. This summer, I haven't even put my feet in a pool. I do everything for my kids. I'm the only provider and you know what? Ain't no complaining about it. I love them so much and they ground me. Sometimes I be so exhausted and it's not even about work, it's just life. If you think when you get rich you're going to stop working, you're never going to stop working. My mom used to be a freakin' cashier and she used to work every single day. To this day, I still talk about how hard my mom worked. I had a very rough childhood, but my mom always made sure we ain't go to no shelter. I want my kids to be like, “My mom made sure I had everything that I wanted.”


Friendship has always been at the core of your relationship with Offset. Despite the ups and downs, do you envision a lasting friendship with him?


	I tried. Next question.


You're dating NFL star Stefon Diggs. Was it tough at first to not only date again, but go public, especially with someone who's also in the spotlight?












	It was very tough, but it is what it is. It's tough hiding. It's tough dating in your 30s, too, but I like him. I love him, today. (Laughs.) I was always scared of dating people [because] I've always been in a long relationship since I was like 21.


How has he inspired you to be a better version of yourself creatively or personally?


	Personally, I'll never complain about my job or about lack of sleep. I'm not superdisciplined. I don't really have a sleep schedule. I don't ever like to map out my day. I don't even like to schedule my month. It just overwhelms me. The one thing I've been learning is to be more organized and not complain.


	He has to do two different things: learn his playbook and get physical. He has to be in bed at a certain time and wake up at a certain time. I'm like, “Oh, my gosh. You're literally in the military. You really work hard.” I work hard, but I can take a little break. I can lay back and I don't have to be running, but it's very inspirational to see how hard somebody works. It's just like, “Wow. You should be proud of yourself.”


You've inspired a generation of new female rappers. Do you see yourself as a mentor now, and is that a role you embrace?












	Have your ever read [Sister Souljah's novel] The Coldest Winter Ever? (Laughs.) At the end of the book, the main character, Winter, was in jail. She cut a b–ch — or some s–t like that — then they let her out to go to her mom's funeral. She saw her sister going in her same footsteps and wanted to give her advice. Before she gave her advice she was like, “You know what? F–k it. Let her go through what I went through. Let her learn on her own.” Sometimes you got to let b–ches learn on their own. I have to because there were so many b–ches that I've sat down and given advice from the heart. Like, if I see people bullying you because of whatever the f–k, I'm going to go in your DMs and give you advice. But sometimes I got to really hold myself [back] and say, “No, b–ch. Don't do it,” because these b–ches turned their backs on me, f–ked my man, talked about me and somebody told me about it.


After your first album, you became a force in fashion, beauty and branding. How intentional was that?


	Fashion is something I really love. I love clothes. I love style. I like putting things together well. I have an amazing team and we always get a thrill about putting amazing outfits [together]. It's really a sport to us. Even when it gets intense, like this Fashion Week that just passed. We were always arguing. There were tears shed, but we loved those end results so much. This is why we do it all the time. The lack of sleep, the disagreements [happen], but at the end, I look like a doll and people say I look amazing.


	When it comes to branding, if you're going to put something out, it has to be the best. Imagine somebody f–king you on the first date. They f–ked you but it's not the best p—y they ever had? You want people to say that's the best p—y they ever had. You don't want to give people drunk p—y. Drunk p—y is good, but what happens when you're not drunk? It's not good. I want it to be good all the time.


You've always immersed yourself in politics. Is that something that you hope to pass down to your kids when they get older?












	Yes, please! I hope they take that trait from me. You always have to be aware of what's happening to the world and what's happened before, because things really do repeat themselves. Maybe not something drastic like a world war, slavery or the Holocaust, but there's always shady s–t going on. I just want them to always be aware of what's going on and what could happen. But there's something about politics that gets me in a rabbit hole. I remember wanting to say something so bad this week, but I was like, “I can't.”


You bit your tongue?


	I have to bite my tongue. I really, really had to bite my tongue, but you know the reason why I've been so silent about politics? It's because when I used to complain the past four years, I know for a fact that people watch my stuff. I know it. I know the White House watches my stuff. I have a big platform. I know they listen to what I say. I might not say it the prettiest way, but I know they listen to what I'm saying. There's a president that knows I've never supported him and it's like if I say something, he's not going to care. I tried to give people warnings and it is what it is. What I can do? What I can say?


	There was a time when I said I wasn't voting for nobody. Everybody's doing shady s–t. I was like, you know what? I had to pick the lesser evil. People thought it was funny. People made fun of my accent. People made fun of my speech [at a Kamala Harris rally days before the 2024 presidential election]. I was, “Aight. Y'all gonna see what's funny.” S–t ain't funny right now, isn't it? It's really tough out here. S–t is really rough out here for everybody. I tried to warn ya.

	











	All I'm going to say is America is in a very bad place. No matter who's in charge, it's going to stay like that because we're paying for bad karma. Why [are we] paying for bad karma? Because we have been involved in something morally illegal, morally that God hates, morally that is disgusting. I'm not going to speak about it. Y'all should know why. All I'm going to say is we're going to be paying for a very long time because there's no bigger leader than God. We've been doing immoral stuff. We've been supporting and endorsing immoral, evil things. Not one person is going to pay for it; the whole country is going to pay for it.


If you could pick one word to title this chapter in your life, what word would that be and why?


	At first, I was going to say “confusing.”


How so?


	It felt like a reset. Maybe that's the word. I'm resetting again in my career. I took a break and I'm about to go back again. I'm about to be heavy on tour and I haven't been heavy on the road in a long time. That's a reset there. Then, it's a reset on my personal life. The last time I was on the road, I had one kid. Now I have three kids. I was married, now I'm getting a divorce. I'm dating. It's a reset on everything. Sometimes I feel like I'm 20 again. I shouldn't feel like I'm 20. I should be feeling like I'm in my 30s and I'm settled, but I don't feel as settled. I feel like I'm redoing things and relearning again in every aspect of life. Career and personal. So I guess we should say a reset.

	Sen. Susan Collins did not vote for President Donald Trump's signature piece of legislation, his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a massive package of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans financed by slashing an estimated $1 trillion from Medicaid. 


	“I did the right thing for the people of Maine, and I am proud of my no vote,” Collins told a local outlet after the bill passed in July. 


	But before she voted against it, Collins cast a critical vote to advance the legislation, which is projected to kick at least 10 million people off their health insurance — and she cast that vote just one day after private equity billionaire Steve Schwarzman, the chair of the Blackstone Group and a man who will personally reap huge rewards from the bill, kicked in $2 million toward her reelection effort.


	On June 27, Schwarzman gave $2 million to Pine Tree Results PAC, a Super PAC backing Collins; on June 28, Collins cast a decisive vote allowing Trump's bill to advance to the floor. The vote was 51-49. Vice President J.D. Vance was present at the Capitol, on hand to break a tie, but was not needed after Collins voted in favor of the bill. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The bill went on to pass the Senate just a few days later, to Schwarzman's presumed delight, since the legislation both extended the pass-through business deduction — treasured by the owners of private equity firms — and made it permanent, allowing partnerships to deduct 20 percent of their pretax income. Blackstone did not respond to a request for comment. 

	











	Ahead of the vote, the watchdog Americans for Financial Reform sent a letter urging senators to let the loophole, which was set to sunset in 2025, expire. “Pass-through income is heavily concentrated at the top, with nearly two-thirds of the deduction going to households earning over $410,000 and more than half captured by those making above $1 million,” the group wrote.


	A separate provision in the legislation made the use of private jets for business a tax write-off, another boon for both Schwarzman, a private-jet owner himself, and his firm, which has large investments in the private-jet companies, including Signature Aviation Plc, which the firm purchased for $4.7 billion in 2021.

	Collins' office strenuously objected to the idea that Schwarzman's contribution influenced her decision to advance the bill. “The notion that Sen. Collins' vote to proceed somehow helped Blackstone get this bill across the finish line is absurd. The procedural vote passed with 51 Republican Senators voting yes … As a matter of basic arithmetic, the motion to proceed would have passed without her vote,” press secretary Blake Kernen wrote in an emailed statement. “Neither of her votes had anything to do with any financial support her Super PAC received. The Super PAC is separate from the campaign operation (like all Super PACs) so the senator was not aware of this contribution until after the FEC report was filed.”


	The June vote was not the first time that Collins cast an important vote that happened to benefit Schwarzman. Back in November 2017, when Trump was pushing through his first round of tax cuts for the wealthy, Collins proposed an amendment to make child care more affordable, by making changes to the private equity industry's beloved carried interest loophole. (The tax break is particularly precious to Schwarzman, who once compared an effort to increase tax on carried interest to the Nazi invasion of Poland.)

	Reporting from ProPublica revealed that Collins dropped the amendment a day after first floating it, and she went on to support the bill, which passed the chamber, by another razor-thin margin: 51-49. At the time, Collins' spokesperson told ProPublica she dropped the amendment because of opposition from other Republicans and Democrats, and her belief that she wouldn't have been able to persuade enough of her colleagues to pass it.


	After Collins voted in favor of that bill, Schwarzman — and the private equity industry — backed her reelection in a big way. Schwarzman donated $2 million to a Super PAC that supported Collins' 2020 reelection, and he and his wife both gave maximum individual contributions to her campaign. That year, private equity executives gave more to Collins than almost any other senator.

Disney stayed No. 1 as Warners roared back to life, Universal remained steady as ever and streamers pulled off a big coup ('F1: The Movie').


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Disney maintained its lead in summer marketshare at the 2025 box office but the toast of the town was Warner Bros., which came in a close second thanks to standout hits including Weapons, Superman and Apple Original Films' record-smashing F1: The Movie starring Brad Pitt, as well as enjoying carryover money from spring blockbusters A Minecraft Movie and Sinners. Not so long ago, some thought Warners film studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy were gone. Not anymore.


	Heading into the season, Weapons and F1 were nowhere to be found when Fandango put out its annual survey of the top-10 most anticipated summer films. The survey was close to being bang-on correct regarding No. 1 on the list, which was Jurassic World Rebirth. Many in Hollywood were dubious as to whether Universal and Amblin could reboot the Jurassic franchise for a third time, and birth a new trilogy more than three decades after Steven Spielberg's dinos first stomped onto the big screen in 1993's Jurassic Park. But relaunch it they have.

					Summer Box Office Clobbered by Kryptonite: Domestic Revenue Barely Matches Last Year		
			









Jurassic World Rebirth is the summer's second-biggest film, with more than $855.6 million in worldwide ticket sales behind Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch (Lilo was No. 9 on Fandango's list). Yet Lilo is the only film of the year so far to have crossed $1 billion globally, with total earnings of $1.33 billion through Sept. 1. It has played both to families and to nostalgic teenagers and Gen Zers who grew up watching the 2002 animated film of the same name about the friendship forged between a lonely Hawaiian girl and a troublesome, pet-like, blue alien. Like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, it points to the limitless financial potential of tapping into such nostalgia.

	











	Warners rebound has been anchored by Joseph Kosinski's F1: The Movie. The big-budget Formula One movie finished Labor Day with more than $613 million in worldwide ticket sales, a sum no one thought possible considering its lead star is in his early 60s and this particular racing sport has never been all that popular in the U.S. (that's why no studio would shell out $200 million to $300 million to make the racing film; instead Apple Original Films made the pic, and brought on Warners as its distribution and marketing partner).


	On Aug. 27, FI broke its latest record when passing up Warner and DC Studios' Superman, a feat few could have imagined. It also is the top-grossing sports pic of all time, and the best of Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation.


	Abdy and De Luca also became heroes of the summer box office when originality paid off in a major way with the mid-August release of Zach Cregger's Weapons. The film has became a cultural sensation, grossing north of $250 million to date against a $38 million budget. (Naysayers were just as dismissive when Ryan Coogler's original pic Sinners, another De Luca and Abdy project, opened in theaters in April. They were silenced when the pic topped out north of $455.7 million globally.)


	It's true that Superman, which has earned $611 million to date worldwide, has given DC a much longed-for win over Marvel, but the Man of Steel can't exactly gloat. Superhero fatigue at the box office, a phenomenon which is now impacting the foreign box office in a major way, remains a major issue.

	











	Elsewhere, the ever-steady Universal remained in fine standing this summer between Jurassic World Rebirth and DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon, which is the third top-grossing Hollywood title of the summer with a global cume of $629 million (it's the first time DWA has borrowed from the Disney playbook and made a live-action adaptation of one of its library titles).


	Paramount and Sony both had tough summers, albeit for different reasons. The former was in the midst of waiting for the Skydance merger to close as it released Tom Cruise's latest Mission: Impossible movie, The Final Reckoning. Sony was left bereft in terms of having a summer tentpole to release because of delays related to the labor strikes, say insiders.


	On Sept. 2, Comscore revised its summer revenue estimate after it finished tallying Labor Day numbers. For the period May 2-Sept. 1, domestic revenue came in at $3.672 billion, a decline of 0.10 percent from last year's $3.672 billion. Comscore initially forecast a decline of 0.2 percent.


	Below is summer domestic, international and global revenue broken down by the five major legacy studios.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	Warner Bros. continues its ownership of the post-Labor Day frame with this weekend's New Line/Safran Company/Atomic Monster supposed finale, The Conjuring: Last Rites, which is eyeing $40M+ domestic and $80M+ worldwide.


	The opening here is bound to rep a return to form for the Conjuring franchise at the box office; the previous sequel, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, was a theatrical day-and-date release in post-pandemic 2021 on HBO Max and in theaters, and posted a siphoned opening of $24.1M domestic, finishing with $65.6M stateside and $206M worldwide take.


	After a summer that came in even at $3.67 billion in North America, the industry is bracing for a slowdown this month vs. last year, which saw Warner Bros' Beetlejuice Beetlejuice post the second-best start for September at $111M domestic — this after the studio's all-time opening record was set by Stephen King's It back in 2017, which bowed to $123.4M.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Conjuring: Last Rites is expected to be the biggest tentpole in early fall until Disney's Tron: Ares arrives on October 10. That is, unless Warner's Leonardo DiCaprio-starring, Paul Thomas Anderson-directed One Battle After Another (September 26) or Sony's Margot Robbie-Colin Farrell pic A Big Bold Beautiful Journey (September 19) suddenly surprises.


Conjuring: Last Rites is booked at 3,700 theaters in U.S./Canada and 15,500 screens abroad in 66 territories including Korea, Germany, Italy, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Spain and the UK. Conjuring will have all the prayers from Imax, Dolby, PLFs and Motion Seat ticket upcharges. Previews start stateside on at 3 p.m. Thursday

	











	The pic is directed by New Line horror fave Michael Chaves, who helmed The Curse of La Llorona, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It and spinoff The Nun 2. Last Rites follows Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's Ed and Lorraine Warren, who tackle one final case in the 1980s that takes a personal toll on the duo and their daughter (Mia Tomlinson).

	On U.S. tracking, Conjuring: Last Rites looks heaven-sent with overall unaided awareness ahead of Final Destination: Bloodlines ($51.6M in May) and The Nun 2 ($32.6M during the 2023 strike). First choice is on par with Bloodlines and close to double that of Nun 2, with women under 25 being the strongest demographic. In The Conjuring universe, 2018's The Nun holds the franchise-record opening at $53.8M. It's also the top-grossing pic in the series at $366 million. The Conjuring universe is the largest-grossing horror franchise in motion picture history with $2.3B+ worldwide. New Line is the only company with two billion-dollar horror franchises, with The Conjuring universe and IT/IT Chapter Two at $1.2B.


	Disney has the second wide studio entry this weekend with the filmed version of Broadway sensation Hamilton, which already played on Disney+ back in July 2020 to great viewership and won two Emmys. The theatrical release is expected to ring up around $7M at 1,800 theaters with previews starting Thursday at 2PM. Disney bought the musical created by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda in February 2020 for $75M. Before Covid, the movie was originally intended to have a theatrical release.

	No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet on Last Rites. The first two Conjuring movies have the best grades in the series with an A- apiece, an anomaly for a horror film, which usually scores in the Bs or Cs with general audiences.

Following a world premiere at Cannes, Oliver Hermanus brought his “The History of Sound” to the east coast on Monday night for its New York City premiere. His historical wartime romance follows Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor as they journey through a post-World War America, and follows a decades-long quiet connection that reverberates through one man's lifetime.

Early buzz of the film teased hot and steamy sex scenes between the co-stars. However, following its debut in France, the film's approach opted to tell a softer love story without explicit intimacy. “There are many different kinds of sex scenes in the film, one of which is Paul's character just walking around Josh's character's house, his apartment,” Hermanus told IndieWire on the red carpet. “I tried to, you know, suggest that queer people, gay people, can have relationships that are more than just hookups. This is about the deeper things. I'm proud of my choice.”

As for how the duo developed their chemistry, the director said that it was obvious from the very beginning. “We hung out a few times in London a lot and there was one night I was at a friend's house and they were both over, I think I was DJing, I was hanging out, and it was immediately at ease with which they got on, and by the time we were shooting the movie, it was its own thing,” he said.

 










“I've done my fair share of sex scenes, I'm like, ‘been there, done that,'” Mescal previously told us at Cannes. “What feels slightly different about this from [other] romantic relationships onscreen, I would say in the hierarchy of their relationship, physical touch isn't the priority. It's intellectual stimulation, it's friendship. Not that they're not physically attracted to each other; they very much are, but their chemistry is born from this shared love of these folk songs, and it extends from there.”

With this project, O'Connor will have three indie releases in 2025 alone, along with “Rebuilding” and “The Mastermind.” Reflecting on often starring in independent films, he told us, “I don't necessarily see them as independent movies or studio or anything like that. It's really to do with just good stories, characters, that feel like they're challenging me or, oftentimes, characters that I can learn from and develop as a person.”

Earlier this year, O'Connor wrapped filming on Steven Spielberg's next film, set to release in 2026. He told us that working with the director was “the best ever. He's the boss, I learned so much from him. He's still inquisitive. He's still excited, like a child, when he sees something he likes, he wants to do it more. He's a big inspiration to me.” The project also stars Emily Blunt, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson. Kristie Macosko Krieger will produce for Amblin Entertainment. 

 










“The History of Sound” received positive reviews at Cannes, with IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio writing that “The false notes are rare in director Oliver Hermanus' affecting and dustily textured romance ‘The History of Sound,' written by Ben Shattuck from his own short story about men in love, together and apart, circa World War I and its aftermath. But for a queer love story starring two of the hottest, of-this-moment leading actors around — Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor— ‘The History of Sound' almost perversely denies your expectations of what a gay romance could be.”

MUBI will release the film on Friday, September 12.

	A site billed as the largest live sports piracy operation in the world has been shut down in Egypt, an antipiracy coalition announced on Wednesday.


Streameast had logged more an 1.6 billion visits in the past year, with 80 associated domains, offering unauthorized access to top European soccer leagues. It also gave users access to UEFA club competitions and international qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro and UEFA Nations League, and CONMEBOL Copa America, according to the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, the global antipiracy group.


ACE, which is led by the Motion Picture Association, said that Streameast also provided access to piracy sites for the NFL, the NBA, the NHL and Major League Baseball, as well as sites for pay-per-view boxing, Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, and motorsports, including Formula One and Moto GP.

	The shutdown followed an investigation from July, 2024 to June, 2025, and operators were arrested on suspicion of copyright infringement in an action by Egyptian authorities late last month, according to ACE. Egyptian authorities also seized three laptops and four smartphones used to operate the sites, as well as 10 Visa cards that contained about 6 million Egyptian pounds, or $123,000 in U.S. dollars, as well as about $200,000 USD in crypto wallets, ACE said. Authorities also found that the operators created a UAE shell company to funnel advertising revenue from the sites.




			Watch on Deadline		







	All sites will be redirected to a “watch legally” page. Most of the visits to Streameast originated from the U.S. and Canada, per ACE.

	











	Charles Rivkin, the chairman of ACE and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement, “With this landmark action, we have put more points on the board for sports leagues, entertainment companies, and fans worldwide—and our global alliance will stay on the field as long as it takes to identify and target the biggest piracy rings across the globe.”

Kathryn Bigelow hasn't directed a feature film since 2017's “Detroit,” an eight-year hiatus during which our increasingly unstable world began to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to her geopolitical thrillers. Fortunately, fans of her distinct brand of filmmaking will have another white knuckler to stress over when “A House of Dynamite” premieres this fall. 

Bigelow's new film, which has been branded as one of Netflix's strongest Oscar contenders of the season, follows a President of the United States (Idris Elba) as he meets with advisors to determine the “best” course of action in the face of a deadly nuclear missile strike.

“A House of Dynamite” is written by Noah Oppenheim, who enjoyed a lengthy TV career as a producer for and eventual president of NBC News before co-creating “Zero Day” and writing films like “Jackie” and “The Maze Runner.” In addition to Elba, the film stars Rebecca Ferguson, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Jonah Hauer-King, with Greta Lee, and Jason Clarke.

“A House of Dynamite” premiered at the 2025 Venice International Film Festival, where critics praised the film for its unapologetic bleakness and willingness to portray the ultimate geopolitical worst-case-scenario with thorough research and elite technical filmmaking.

“Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie — with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber with a cataclysmic whisper of an ending,” IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his review. “We used to duck under our desks to rehearse surviving a nuclear annihilation; now, we only duck our heads in the sand we keep shoveling over ourselves. You can't stop what's coming, and what's coming is worse than you thought.”

During her Venice press conference, Bigelow explained that her eight years away from filmmaking was partially due to a lack of material that piqued her interest the way “A House of Dynamite” did.

“I have to be passionate about a subject matter,” Bigelow said. “For me, I don't know if I'm really a director or not, but I'm absolutely committed to a subject and a story. And then I feel like I can do anything, but I have to really believe in whatever the material is.” 

 










“A House of Dynamite” opens in select theaters on October 10 before streaming on Netflix on October 24. Watch the teaser below.

Paul Mescal has been one busy man. Just days after celebrating the world premiere of Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” at Telluride, he flew across the country to attend the New York City premiere of Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” which debuted at Cannes earlier this year, alongside co-star Josh O'Connor. All this while being in production for Sam Mendes' Beatles biopic and in off-and-on production for Richard Linklater's “Merrily We Roll Along.” Mr. Mescal, let's hope you're sleeping!

“Hamnet” reviews have been revelatory, coining it an instant awards contender. “It's been such a relief for all of us, you know,” Mescal told IndieWire on the red carpet for his MUBI release. “Having a film premiere in any context is like giving a baby out into the world and we're so, so thrilled that people seem to be, not [necessarily] responding positively, but people seem to be understanding the film that we made as filmmakers. It's a big, big relief.”

In the midst of his releases, Mescal is preparing to play Paul McCartney in Mendes' four Beatles films, set to release in theaters April 2028 as the first “bingeable” movie experience. As for if he has connected with the real life counterpart, Mescal revealed, “I have, yeah. He's an extraordinary man, like to spend any time— it's a crazy sentence to say that I've spent time with that man, let alone play him.” As for if Mescal will be doing his own singing in the films, he said, “Yeah, yeah, absolutely yeah.”

 










Additionally, he's filming Linklater's decades-long project “Merrily We Roll Along,” a project that he remained a bit more tightly sealed about. “It's one that he's kind of swearing us to silence on, because if we start talking about it now, there'll be nothing to talk about in 20 years, but I can say that he is one of my favorite directors in the world,” he said. “I make my way to Texas every couple of years and see him and see Beanie [Feldstein] and see Ben [Platt] and get to work with them. It's also such a crazy process that it's, like, so individual for me.”

“The History of Sound” made waves at Cannes for its sensitive portrayal of a love affair between Mescal and O'Connor's characters. The former had nothing but praise for working with Hermanus: “Oliver made one of my favorite films that I've seen in the last give years, ‘Moffie.'”

“I think he's a true auteur,” he continued. “He's just got such a clear means of attack on scenes and who these characters are, and he knows how to frame them and put them at the center of the story. I loved working with him, he's one of my closest friends.”

“I've been very lucky with the actors I've worked with across my career, with Josh [O'Connor], Andrew [Scott], Jessie [Buckley], Saoirse [Ronan], Daisy [Edgar-Jones], where nothing was ever intentional in terms of how you build a relationship [onscreen],” Mescal previously told IndieWire of creating chemistry with his co-star over an interview at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Cannes the day before “The History of Sound” premiered at the Palais.

 










“It either stands on its own two legs, or it doesn't happen,” Mescal said. “With Josh, it very much felt comfortable. We knew each other, and we'd been talking about the film since 2020, so that's when we first initially connected. He's such a good soul. We're quite similar in terms of the work that we like and are relatively similar as people. It just grew from there.”

A MUBI release, “The History of Sound” opens in theaters on Friday, September 12. Watch the trailer here.

Long before the video diary became the en vogue format of personal expression on YouTube and social media platforms like TikTok, Ross McElwee was America's preeminent first-person filmmaker. While studying under cinéma vérité pioneers Richard Leacock and Ed Pincus in MIT's graduate film program, McElwee developed his own style of memoir cinema informed by direct cinema, a Southern literary sensibility ingrained from his North Carolina upbringing, and an almost religious belief in elevating the mundane texture of daily life, previously the province of amateur home movies, to a large artistic canvas. His droll voiceover, which warmly blankets and contextualizes his imagery, provides viewers an entrée into an worldview effortlessly engaged with culture, politics, and the smallest details of his private life.

While many of his films feature traditional documentary premises — the lingering effects of the Civil War on the South in “Sherman's March,” broadcast television's warped view of reality in “Six O'Clock News,” the complicated legacy of the tobacco industry in “Bright Leaves” — McElwee inevitably deploys them as scaffolding to examine himself and his family. For McElwee, the personal is paramount, and it will either intersect with or supersede any supposedly “professional” requisites whenever it can. His father and siblings, his friends and mentors, they all become recurring characters in his work. McElwee's innately generous eye keeps his work from devolving into solipsism; he frequently extends his gaze to outsiders to help expand his perspective. For instance, gregarious poet and teacher Charleen Swansea appears in many of his films, playing both captivating subject and a pointed foil. She frequently expresses gentle skepticism towards his longtime friend's life's work in casually philosophical terms.

 










McElwee constantly interrogates his compulsion to film daily life, a recurring theme that becomes more prominent once he begins a family. Part of the joy of watching McElwee's work over the years not only comes from watching his family grow up, but also seeing how his creative perspective changes in response to his concerns as a late-in-life husband and father. He adapts his working methods and cheerfully embraces his family as co-authors, but his belief in continuous filmmaking eventually clashes with the wishes of his wife and kids, who understandably don't want their private lives to be grist for the artistic mill. “Turn it off! This is important. This is not art; this is life!” Charleen exclaims to McElwee in “Sherman's March,” insisting that his camera has become a mechanism of detachment. But this tension between art and life, and McElwee's insistence in rendering it a Möbius strip, ultimatelydrives his singular artistic practice.

“Remake,” McElwee's latest accomplished feature, strikes a raw nerve because he makes his family his primary subject for an especially tragic reason. McElwee's son Adrian, a recurring figure in his father's work dating back to when his birth wasdocumented in “Time Indefinite” way back in 1993, died in 2016 of an accidental drug overdose following a long struggle with mental health issues. With “Remake,” McElwee pays tribute to his son by tracing their on-camera relationship, incorporating footage he and Adrian filmed separately and together. In his voiceover, McElwee frequently addresses Adrian and eulogizes his memory, but also expresses self-critical ruminations about his part in his son's death, how his filmmaking may have contributed to his shaky self-image and the growing distance between them.

 










Pain and heartbreak understandably radiate from McElwee's voice throughout “Remake,” a deliberately heavy affair that dives headfirst into the director's lingering remorse. He announces Adrian's death minutes into the film, so every subsequent image of him, from when he was a happy, photogenic child through his more troubled adolescence and subdued final years, are framed by his absence. “Remake” adopts a non-linear approach similar to fragmented memory, jumping back and forth between the past and more recent present, which Ross compares to film reels being out of order. His commentary across the film, which potently mixes 16mm film and contemporary digital imagery that encompass the multiple eras of Adrian's life, switches between adoration and regret befitting a father still contending with such a devastating loss.

Save for a few notable exceptions, McElwee has almost always been the main character in his films, but with “Remake,” he appropriately shares focus with his son, whom he paints without judgment as a lovable, flawed human being. “Remake” portrays Adrian as an ambitious, charming young man whose drive was stymied by substance abuse and unmanaged bipolar disorder, but McElwee never lets his son's setbacks define him in the film. He frequently captures his outgoing personality and sly wit, both as a kid and an adult. Their alternatively affable and tense banter in front of the camera depict a fraught father-son relationship in miniature, but also how self-aware and intelligent Adrian could be even in his lowest moments.

 










Adrian's professional goals varied across multiple disciplines — filmmaker of music and skateboard videos, online entrepreneur, brand manager — but they were founded on a love of moving-image work clearly stemming from his father's influence. At one point, Adrian speaks unfavorably of documentary cinema, claiming he wants to make “real movies” and happily agrees to work within a Hollywood ecosystem that his dad rejected. But he eventually begins filming himself and his friends, like McElwee once did, and even addresses the camera in a similarly intimate fashion. McElwee incorporates Adrian's own unvarnished filmmaking efforts into “Remake,” some of which were designed to be part of a project on opioid addiction in youth culture. The results are authentic and occasionally upsetting: sometimes it's fluid first-person snowboarding footage and other times it's dark scenes of drug use.

Like most of McElwee's films, “Remake” meanders from his relationship with his son to various other personal and professional threads, which serve as necessary breaks from the film's central tragedy and meaningful detours on their own. He discusses the painful separation from his wife Marilyn and how it impacted his relationships with Adrian and his daughter Mariah. At one point, McElwee undergoes brain surgery after a doctor discovers a massive tumor that surprisingly caused no physical symptoms. The most prominent digression involves the futile attempts of comedy director Steve Carr, whose credits include “Daddy Day Care” and “Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” to remake McElwee's most enduring film “Sherman's March” into a fictional movie. Though initially skeptical of the idea, McElwee agrees to Carr's proposal and, in typical fashion, plans to document his efforts. This was the initial foundation of “Remake,” hence the title.

 










As to be expected, a fictional “Sherman's March” never gets off the ground, but not before going through multiple phases of prolonged development: the movie eventually morphs into an hour-long dramatic series before reaching its final failed state as a half-hour comedy. (The single funniest moment in “Remake” features McElwee, shocked and dismayed, watching a sizzle reel of scenes from “Sherman's March,” presumably assembled for interested producers, soundtracked to Beck's “Loser.”) Yet, McElwee uses Hollywood's fleeting attraction with “Sherman's March” to reconnect with real-life figures from his 1986 film and restage certain scenes in the present day. A former girlfriend featured in the film remarks to McElwee that it now plays like a version of sense memory for her and a crucial document of a bygone time in her life.

But as much as McElwee wanders away from Adrian in “Remake,” his absence always snaps the film back into place. So much of “Remake” plays like a companion piece to “Time Indefinite,” McElwee's last film explicitly focused on family and loss. Whereas that film was an optimistic portrait of new beginnings (McElwee‘s engagement and marriage to Marilyn; the birth of Adrian) tinged with a series of unexpected deaths, “Remake” is its explicitly mournful counterpart. On paper, the choice for McElwee to detail his son's final year in painstaking detail, across interview footage and recorded phone calls, might seem like an exercise in misery. In practice, however, the sheer accumulation of documented material becomes absorbing because it's the act of a father desperately struggling to hold onto the memory of his son, even in his darkest hour.

 










Adrian's death encompasses so many various endings in McElwee's life, both small and large, including the end of his 24-year-long marriage, the sale of his beloved house, and the slow evaporation of his friend Charleen's memory. Anyone remotely invested in McElwee's career will feel nothing short of devastated to watch McElwee interview an elderly Charleen as she struggles to remember her appearances in his work.

Despite being so dependent on McElwee's personal and professional history, “Remake” plays perfectly well in a vacuum; he constantly incorporates scenes from his previous films as exposition and background information to ensure that everyone will be up to speed. However, “Remake” will certainlyhave greater significance for those familiar with McElwee's oeuvre since so much of it recontextualizes and fills in gaps from his prior work, particularly his last feature “Photographic Memory,” which partly chronicles McElwee and Adrian's fracturing relationship in a different stage. “Remake” questions some of McElwee's filmmaking choices in the previous film, including the unexamined ethical dilemma of a parent filming their child, especially one obviously struggling with mental illness, for the purpose of public exhibition.

McElwee's bouts of self-doubt about his modus operandi in “Remake” comprise some of the best scenes of his career. When he watches footage from his wedding during a screening of “Time Indefinite” in Poland right around the end of his marriage, he fantasizes about turning off the projector and storming the stage to the film a lie. For such a reflexive filmmaker, McElwee has never appeared so nakedly introspective as to when he's implicitly questioning the value of his career and future as a filmmaker, going beyond mere pondering about the relationship between camera and subject. While this contemplative approach was likely inspired by Adrian's death, it also certainly stems from an aging filmmaker looking back on an intertwined, recursive body of work with a new set of eyes.

 










“Remake” occasionally suffers from occasionally clumsy cross-cutting and some needless repetition in sound and image, but those minor blemishes fade away in the face of its remarkably affecting heights, which capture a father's palpable love for his son and a filmmaker's enduring passion for his creative vision in tandem. McElwee has stated that “Remake” was his attempt to hold onto Adrian and also to let him go. He succeeds in that charge, but that tension he describes, of clinging to memory while desiring to relinquish it, defines McElwee's vision to a tee. His films document the present, but they also preserve the past in amber and point towards an uncertain future. “Remake,” like all of McElwee's personal cinema, embody the passage of time itself. In other words, it's the stuff of life.

“Remake” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The former Pink Floyd bassist recently said in an interview that he "never" cared about Black Sabbath.

	Gil Kaufman



	Jack Osbourne has two pointed words for Roger Waters: “f–k you.” The comment came in an Instagram post from Osbourne on Tuesday (Sept. 2) in response to a recent interview with the former Pink Floyd bassist and solo act who said he didn't “give a f–k” about the late Ozzy Osbourne‘s solo music or that of his band, Black Sabbath.

	











	“Hey Roger Waters. F–k you,” Jack Osbourne wrote in his post. “How pathetic and out of touch you've become. The only way you seem to get attention these days is by vomiting out bulls–t in the press. My father always thought you were a c–t — thanks for proving him right [clown emoji.]” 


	In an interview with The Independent Ink, Rogers was discussing the state of British politics when he said, “Ozzy Osbourne, who just died, bless him in his whatever state that he was in his whole life. We'll never know. Although he was all over the TV for hundreds of years wit his idiocy and nonsense and… the music, I have no idea. I couldn't give a f–k. I don't care about Black Sabbath, I never did.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The comments from Waters, 81, came six weeks after Osbourne's death on July 22 at age 76 of a heart attack, just weeks after performing for the final time at the all-star July 5 Back to the Beginning concert featuring tributes from Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Mastodon, Lamb of God and dozens more.

	











	Waters' rant about Osbourne continued with another dig at one of Ozzy's most infamous moments. “I have no interest in biting the heads off chickens or whatever they do. I couldn't care less, you know,” he said, with the interviewer clarifying that it was a bat whose head Ozzy famously bit off, not a chicken. “That's even worse, isn't it?” 


	The comments on Jack Osbourne's post doubled-down on his Waters diss, with fans writing, “People have to ask who Roger Waters is, but no one has to ask who Ozzy is. Enough said,” as well as, “Your Father was The Best Judge of Character” and “disrespecting those who have passed away is a reflection of your character. Obviously Roger has none. God speed Ozzy! You are loved and missed.”

Director Romain Garvas talks about his latest movie that also stars Anya Taylor-Joy: “I'm surrounded in a world that I don't really get. To make a film is the attempt to not give answers, but at least to question it.”


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	“Just to be clear,” says director Romain Gavras when discussing his new movie Sacrifice.  “We didn't actually throw anyone in a volcano.”


	A disclosure like this may seem unnecessary, but for a film that was partially shot on location on the rim of a semi-active volcano, it is not entirely needless.




	For Sacrifice, which is set to debut at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 6, Gavras and producers traversed treacherous terrain —  from mines in Northern Greece to the Cannes film market — to make an independent feature that really doesn't look like one.

	In Sacrifice, Gavras dissects myth-making in its many forms. The movie follows actor Mike Tyler (Chris Evans), who is attempting a comeback after a personal crisis and subsequent soul-searching. For his first public appearance, he attends a black-tie environmental charity gala thrown by a billionaire entrepreneur (Vincent Cassel) and his wife (Salma Hayek-Pinault). But it gets interrupted by a violent radical group led by Joan (Anya Taylor-Joy) that is searching for individuals to fulfill a volcano-inclusive prophecy.

	Gavras made the jump to feature filmmaking after a successful career directing music videos for the likes of M.I.A. and Jay-Z.  In 2022, he released the French-language action-drama Athena with Netflix, after which he wanted to tackle his English-language debut. For this, he enlisted Will Arbery, a writer from one percent-skewering HBO sensation Succession.

	











Sacrifice captures the tenor of these high-end charity events that are attended by the famous and ultra-wealthy, and have a tendency to land somewhere between tone-deaf to hopelessly self-congratulatory.


	“Having been in those kinds of ceremonies, the cheeky side of my brain wonders what would happen if people arrived with guns and started to create mayhem,” says Gavras, who says he normally avoids these kinds of social commitments. “I try not to go because they make you feel uncomfortable. Because we were researching the film, I went to some, and there is stuff you can't even put in the movie because it was too much.” 


	What does end up in the film is a popstar (played by Charli xcx) calling herself “mother nature” singing about the ills of the planet, as strobe lights flash, electro-pop plays and back-up dancers twerk onstage.


	Gavras and Arbery delivered the script at the top of 2024 to producers Robert Walak and Jacob Perlin of Iconoclast. The director flew out to Los Angeles in April to meet with potential cast, landing his stars Evans and Taylor-Joy in less than a week.


	“What I love about him is that he's the perfect American movie star,” says the director of his leading man. With Mike Tyler, Evans gets to play a bizarro-world version of himself. In real life, Evans has successfully landed the dismount after years playing Marvel's Captain America, not getting swallowed up by his own celebrity or the role that made him famous, instead now opting for projects with filmmakers like Celine Song (The Materialists). (Though he occasionally returns to Marvel, as well.)

	











	Onscreen, Evans's Mike Tyler instead takes a more self-destructive route — at times, equal parts hilarious and harrowing — preoccupied by his public image and being perceived as a righteous do-gooder.


	Says Gavras of Evans taking on the role, “This is very, very risky, and that's the beauty of it.”


	For her part, after meeting with Gavras, Taylor-Joy “the next day, texted him a picture of an emoji of a volcano and someone falling into it,” remembers Walak. “We thought, ‘I think that means that she's in.'”


	Weeks after the cast locked, the movie, which was boarded by Mid March Media and Film4, was presented to buyers at the 2024 Cannes film market. While on the Croisette, the producers got an alert about volcanoes erupting in Iceland. In between meetings with potential partners, the team sent a drone to capture the activity for what would become nature-documentary worthy insert shots used in the movie.


	But Iceland, which is known for its high volcanic activity and has hosted productions like Ridley Scott's Prometheus, would not work for their shoot. Gavras wanted to film in order, which meant that by the time the 50-day production wound its way to the volcano sequences, it would be wintertime in the country. Instead, filmmakers found their volcano near Santorini. For the filmmaker, who is half Greek, Greece felt like the right place for his mythology-centric story.


	Even outside of the volcano, from a massive mine and caves to military helicopters, Sacrifice is filled with the kind of set pieces and locations you wouldn't expect in an independently financed feature. Says Gavras, “I'm terrible with VFX and stuff like that, so I always shoot practically.”

	











	Says Perlin, “Anyone else would be, ‘Can we do this? Can you execute it?' And I think that's where Romain shines.” Walak notes that should they have taken the studio route with the film, but that would have changed the outcomes, saying, “We always felt that this would most likely be an indie feature to give Romain that freedom.”


	For his part, Gavras adds, “I have a lot more gray hair now.”


	To build the film's charity event, the team shot in a marble quarry in the city of Volakas in Northern Greece. 400 extras were brought in to fill out the space, with Charli xcx, in the middle of prep for a globe-spanning Brat arena tour, flying in for two days for her pitch-perfect scene.


	When it did finally come time to film on the rim of the volcano, a question emerged about how to physically get there. The answer: donkeys.


	“Robert and I would look through the budget and be like, ‘That's a lot for donkeys!'” says Perlin. Walak adds, “There were some definitely irate emails about donkeys.”


	No vehicles are allowed on the volcanic island, which meant Evans, Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast and crew had an hour-plus hike up the shooting location, while donkeys carried equipment uphill. The group would arrive already tired, with smoke and wind whipping through the setup. But Gavras notes that the film's performances would not be the same if they were captured in the comfort of a soundstage. He says, “It puts the whole team and the whole cast in an energy where we know that we are making a film that is going to be difficult but will be super satisfying.”

	











Sacrifice is looking for distribution at TIFF, with CAA Media Finance and Rocket Science handling sales. Outside of the satire, high concept, and higher production value, the director notes that the film, at its core, is about people who are trying to figure out their place in the world and, just maybe, along the way, make it a better one.


	“We live in a world that's fucking crazy. You turn on the news, you turn on the internet, and everything is mad,” says Gavras. “I'm surrounded in a world that I don't really get, I don't completely understand. To make a film is the attempt to not give answers, but at least to question it.”


	As for what's next, after his experience on Sacrifice, the director says, “I'm thinking of maybe making a nice story in a small apartment.”

New details emerge about Graham Greene's final moments leading up to his death.

A representative of the late actor shared with TMZ that one of his dying wishes was to reconnect with his “Dances With Wolves” co-star, Kevin Costner.

According to the outlet, Greene wanted to speak with Costner and show his appreciation for giving indigenous people a chance to be represented in media over the years. The late actor's team tried their best to get in touch with Costner, but were unsuccessful, TMZ added.

A post shared by Kevin Costner (@kevincostner)

However, on Tuesday, the “Yellowstone” star paid his tribute to Greene on social media, and it's clear that the admiration between them is mutual.

Costner honored Greene by posting a scene from their iconic film “Dances With Wolves,” which they starred in together in the 1990s. He praised his late co-star, calling him both a masterful actor and a wonderful person.

“A few things come to mind when I think of Graham Greene and our time together on ‘Dances With Wolves,'” Costner captioned the post.

“I think of how willing he was to learn the Lakota language. I think of my joy when I heard that his work on the film was recognized with an @theacademy Awards nomination.

And I think of this scene in particular, when he was able to establish so much about the relationship between Dunbar and the natives with so few words. He was a master at work and a wonderful human being. I'm grateful to have been a witness to this part of his lasting legacy. Rest in peace, Graham,” Costner added.

Meanwhile, fans took to the comments of Costner's post to share their own tributes for Greene. One fan wrote, “The most iconic movie in my eyes! Rest well, ‘Kicking Bird.'”

Another pointed out, “This film was the first time I ever heard my language in a movie outside of my family circle. Thank you, Kevin. RIP mitȟákȟola.”

Someone also praised Greene for his contribution to the native community. “RIP Graham Greene. A trailblazing talent who gave so much exposure to the Native American artists.”

A fan added, “The most famous and underrated Native American actor in film history. You don't even have to know his name, but you know that face. No matter what role he did, he always caught your attention and added to the quality of the film. Rest in peace, my brother. You did us proud.”

Greene passed away on Monday, after a “lengthy illness,” TMZ reported. He was 73.

	Cardi B sits down with Billboard's Carl Lamarre in anticipation of her second album ‘AM I THE DRAMA.' The star gets candid on everything from why the album took years to release, ‘WAP' and ‘UP' being a part of the track list, female rap beefs and her relationship with Stefon Diggs.


Carl Lamarre:


What's going on, y'all? I am senior director of R&B/Hip-Hop, Mr. Carl Lamarre, and we are here with one of music's most transcendent superstars. She is a Grammy Award winner, five chart-toppers on the Hot 100, Miss Cardi B. 


	Cardi B:


	Hi. How are you? 


I'm good. How are you? 


	It's been a long day shooting, but we here.


You've been trooping like a real soldier. We're here because of album number two. 


	Yes.


It's finally here. You know, it's been seven years since ‘Invasion of Privacy.' How would you say you have grown since then?


	Well, since the seven years, I have experienced a lot. I have experienced fame, the good and the bad of fame, the hate, the jealousy, the drama, the personal life, the balancing my career with my personal life and just growing up and maturing and like opening my eyes more, learning how to like, control my emotions more, or like, understand my emotions, or like, understand just the way life works and like, it's just how to play chess better.


Right. 


	Yeah. 


I mean, listen, I think you've been playing the chess pretty d*mn well. 


	Well you know… 


At any moment in the past seven years, did you question or have any doubts, like, “Sh–, I don't know if this second album is going to drop.”


	No, never. I always knew that I was going to drop a second album. It's not even about dropping a second album.

Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams' daughter, Matilda Ledger, made a rare public appearance in New York City last Thursday, her first in nearly seven months. The 19-year-old, who bears a striking resemblance to her late father, was photographed riding her bike through the city.

As per photos published by Page Six, for the outing, Matilda wore a blue-and-white striped sweater with an A-line denim midi skirt and bright red flats. Later, she changed into a light gray jacket, carrying a green tote bag and pulling a large suitcase while shopping.

A post shared by Heath Ledger 🍁 (@loveheathledger_)

Matilda was last photographed in January while stepping out for coffee with a friend in Brooklyn. For that outing, she wore the same pair of red flats, this time styled with black tights to keep warm. She completed the look with a green puffer jacket and baggy jeans.

The sighting came just one week before the anniversary of Ledger's death. The actor, known for roles in “The Dark Knight” and “Brokeback Mountain”, died on January 22, 2008, at age 28 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs.

Williams welcomed Matilda in October 2005, a year after she met Ledger on the set of Brokeback Mountain. The couple ended their relationship in 2007, a year before his passing.

In March, Williams reflected on raising her daughter during an appearance on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast. “When I make mistakes in front of my daughter and own up to them and apologize, it teaches her to apologize and say, ‘Oops, Mommy, I'm sorry,' and it's not a big deal,” the actress said.

She also spoke about the challenges of being young while navigating love and loss, saying, “I suppose maybe a good thing about being young is that you don't have so much life experience that you can contextualize things.”

Alongside Matilda, Williams is also mom to three younger children with husband Thomas Kail: son Hart, 5, and two more children, including one welcomed via surrogate earlier this year.

In April, the actress was spotted with her family of six in their New York neighborhood. A source told People that Matilda has embraced her role as a big sister. “They couldn't be happier to expand their family, and Matilda has been doting on her younger siblings,” the insider said.

Williams publicly thanked her surrogate during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August, saying, “Thanks to Christine, I have three under 5 at home.”

Gunna's DS4EVER edged out Abel's Dawn FM by 2,300 units to take the top spot on the Billboard 200 back in January 2022.

	Alleged phone calls made from jail by Young Thug have been leaked in recent days, as the YSL honcho faces snitching allegations stemming from a 2015 conversation with authorities surrounding a Lil Wayne tour bus shooting. 


	Thugger continues to distance himself from Gunna, who was released nearly two years before Thug after reaching an Alford plea deal in the YSL RICO case in December 2022, as Thug believes his mentee snitched on him.


	One recent alleged jail phone call involving Thug found him claiming that he paid $50,000 for streams to help Gunna's DS4EVER album debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 over The Weeknd's Dawn FM in 2022.

	“Like, the No. 1 album you just had right now, I paid for you to have the No. 1 album,” he said. ”You didn't honestly earn a No. 1 album over The Weeknd, my boy. I paid for that sh–. I never said anything to him. I never told him that.”




	He continued: “We just got the plug on that. You never earned a No. 1 album. I spent 50 extra grand buying motherf—ing streams for you.”


	Gunna earned his second No. 1 album atop the Billboard 200 in January 2022 in a tight race against The Weeknd. DS4EVER launched with 150,300 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 13, according to Luminate.


	The album's first-week sales figure was nearly entirely comprised of streaming. SEA units comprised 144,600 (equaling 193.5 million on-demand official streams), while album sales held 4,700 and TEA units comprised 1,000. 


	It was also the most-streamed album that week and Gunna added a Drake collaboration titled “P Power” to the project's track list on the final tracking day. DS4EVER was on sale for $7.99 on the iTunes store and could be purchased digitally on his website for $4. 


	As for The Weeknd, Dawn FM bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 148,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 13, according to Luminate.


	Of the total, SEA units made up 131,300 (equaling 173.04 million on-demand official streams of the album's songs), while album sales bested Gunna's total with 14,800 and TEA units comprised 1,900.

Noah Hawley talks episode five, "In Space, No One...", which stages an 'Alien' mini-movie and explains that (perhaps controversial?) twist: "It escalates in a way that ends up feeling a little crazy." 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


[This story contains spoilers from Alien: Earth‘s fifth episode, “In Space, No One…”]


Alien: Earth gave franchise fans an unexpected treat with its fifth episode: A mini-Alien movie that feels like the FX drama took Ridley Scott‘s 1979 original film and re-imagined its core elements as a unique one-hour story. 




	Aptly titled “In Space, No One…” (playing off the original film's famous marketing tagline, “In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream”), the flashback episode showed what happened aboard the ill-fated USCSS Maginot that caused its dangerous creatures to escape and the ship to crash into Earth.

					'Alien: Earth' Boss Noah Hawley on Making That Eyeball Alien Even Creepier in Episode 4		
			









	With the ship's interior sets as a near replica of those from the first film's ship, Nostromo, the action played like an alternate universe version of the decades-old film that we'd never seen before. The sequence also contained a twist that upended many of the audience's assumptions about the previous episodes and was inspired by the antics of a certain tech billionaire.


	“This allowed me — in the middle of trying to innovate what [the Alien franchise could be as a series] — to also pick up the gauntlet for classic Alien to say, ‘We could do classic Alien and do it as well as anyone,'” Hawley said. “But what's interesting to me at the same time is adding all these new elements, and putting the creatures in this thematic context. It's the number of elements at play that make it fun to me. It's like by the time the xenomorph enters the story, you're six tragedies deep with these other creatures. Then the xenomorph arrives and it just escalates.”

	











	Hawley continued, “When you think about the last 10 minutes of James Cameron‘s movie [Aliens], there's no other word for it than ‘thrilling.' And my hope was that by putting these elements together and with all these creatures — the sabotage and getting to the bridge and then the chief engineer with The Eye — and now the xenomorph is there, that it just escalates in a way that I think ends up feeling a little crazy. You leave the predictable Alien world and are like, ‘I do not know what is going to happen next.'”


	One key moment is the revelation that Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) was behind the sabotage of the Maginot in an effort to get the ship to crash into his territory so he could steal the creatures. It's a perhaps controversial twist and I suggest to Hawley that — for a famed smartest-geek-alive genius — this seems like a really dumb plan that should never have worked. But it turns out that the plan's reckless idiocy was kind of the point.


	“I don't look at our tech billionaires and think these guys are orchestrating some master plan,” Hawley replies. “I think you have a lot of ADHD billionaires with impulse control issues. And we always look to impose a certain logic on our fiction that doesn't apply to real life. For me, it's a way to tie everything together and as the show plays out in the rest of the season, we find that the boy genius is not a terribly thoughtful and calculating guy. He has all these ideas. He chases all of them at the same time. And he has never failed. So he thinks failure is impossible. He's trying to launch this immortality product, so why would he do this other stuff? He thinks, ‘Oh, I could do everything.'”

	











	Hawley then suggested the characterization is a comment on Elon Musk (he doesn't say the billionaire's name, but his description seems to clearly point to the Tesla/SpaceX/The Boring Company/X mogul as an inspiration. “It's a statement, on some level, about the hubris we're seeing around us by people who think they can go to space, re-invent travel, drill in the earth and enter politics,” he said. “They're doing all of these at the same time when none of them are necessarily being done well. They're just all being done a lot.”


	Throughout the episode, the viewer is also wondering the deal with one character in particular: Andy Yu's crew member Teng, who spied on a fellow crew member in her sleep and seemed rather unpleasant, and then was taken out by the xenomorph. So was he just a creepy human then?


	“It's always open to interpretation, and that's the fun of that franchise — who is an android and who isn't?” Hawley said. “At a certain point, you start to question everybody. But yeah, for me, he's a creepy dude.”


	Hawley added that the show's casting drew from his showrunning experiences on Fargo.   


	“When I realized that I wanted to do that flashback episode, selfishly I was like, ‘Well, I have to [direct] that one; I don't want to hand that one off,'” Hawley said. “Part of that was the casting. [The security officer cyborg Morrow, played by Babou Ceesay] obviously carries the show, but you need that cast to be memorable instantly. A lot of it for me was being over in Thailand like, ‘Well, who can I call that will come?' So I called Richa Moorjani. I called Karen Aldridge from season four of Fargo. I called Andy Yu from season three of Fargo. And the great Michael Smiley and so many great UK actors. They all pop and resonate. So much of what I do in these big ensemble shows is constantly building new worlds and you can't really assign that to another director. The specificity of it, I felt like I needed to do.”

	The U.S. military killed 11 alleged Tren de Aragua members during a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel leaving Venezuela and suspected of carrying drugs, according to President Donald Trump. 


	In a Truth Social Post on Tuesday, Trump said that on his orders, the military “conducted a kinetic strike” while “the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.” He posted a video of what appeared to be a small boat carrying a group of people bursting into flames, and said that no U.S. personnel were harmed in the strike.


	Trump also accused President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela of controlling Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. designated as a terrorist group in February. The Department of Justice is offering a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro and has accused the Venezuelan president of violating U.S. narcotics laws.


	“We just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug-carrying boat, a lot of drugs in that boat,” he told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, per Reuters. “And there's more where that came from. We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country, coming in for a long time … These came out of Venezuela.”

	











	Maduro previously warned that he would respond to any U.S. military action with an “armed fight” and claimed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was attempting to pull Trump into a war in the Caribbean. “Mr. President, Donald Trump,” the Venezuelan president said on Monday, per The New York Times, “watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood.”

	As the Associated Press reports, the U.S. government is increasing its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat what it says are threats from drug cartels, ed. In turn, the Venezuelan government deployed troops along its coast and border with Colombia, and has encouraged Venezuelans to join a volunteer militia.


	Maduro has also accused the Trump administration of trying to force him from office, and told reporters on Monday that if Venezuela was attacked by U.S. forces in the Caribbean, he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms.”

September 3, 2025



House lawmakers are reviewing new legislation that would codify distinct protections for whistleblowers who disclose information about any use of U.S. government funding to study “unidentified anomalous phenomenon material” — or matter associated with objects observed in air, space, or sea domains that cannot be immediately explained.

From UFOs to modern and transmedium UAP, the government has a complicated history in terms of its handling of reports about craft that appear to transcend the capabilities of existing technology, and records documenting related incidents. 

But efforts to compel more transparency and oversight have continued to emerge in recent years, largely due to mounting public pressure and mandates from Congress.

The UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, introduced last week by Reps. Tim Burchett (R-TN) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), marks the latest move by lawmakers to help shield people who want to share information with Congress but fear retaliation — and motivate more of them to come forward.

A member of Burchett's team told DefenseScoop in an email that the bill is identical to legislation put forward in November during Congress' last session. If passed, they said it would ultimately add “provisions for individuals to report on the use of taxpayer funds to evaluate or research [UAP] to existing whistleblower protection statutes.”

This version of the bill was referred to the House committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Armed Services, and Intelligence for consideration.

Burchett and Luna are among a small cadre of policymakers who have been steadily prioritizing whistleblower hearings, public engagement sessions and other legislative efforts to promote more accountability and disclosure from the intelligence community, Department of Defense and other agencies regarding UAP.

On Wednesday, Luna announced a hearing on “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” that's officially set for Sept. 9.

The Committee on Oversight and Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which she chairs, will host the event next week. Recurring transparency concerns and the effectiveness of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) are among several topics that will be up for discussion.

The panel of four witnesses testifying will include two Air Force veterans — Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland.

“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety,” Luna said in a statement. “Whistleblowers who provide details on spending information and policies and procedures regarding the classification and declassification of UAPs should be able to do so without retribution.”

	It was part party palace, part personal sanctuary, and all spectacle. Now, Jackie Gleason's legendary estate in New York‘s picturesque Hudson Valley—better known as the Mothership—has reemerged for sale at $5.5 million with Corcoran's Heidi Henshaw.

	











	Commissioned by the late comedian and musician as a retreat from filming the groundbreaking 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners, the spaceship-like residence in Cortlandt Manor is one of the most unusual homes ever built for a Hollywood icon. Gleason, famously fascinated with UFOs and metaphysical theory, dreamed up the circular home that embodied futuristic ambition while showcasing old-fashioned craftsmanship.

	To execute his otherworldly vision, Gleason tapped architect Robert Cika, a protégé of Frank Lloyd Wright, who enlisted a Scandinavian shipbuilder to help realize the extraordinary design. At least some of the prefabrication work took place inside an airplane hangar before the copper-roofed house was assembled on-site. It took five years and a reported $650,000, partly underwritten by Gleason's bosses at CBS, before the Mothership was completed in 1959.


	The mid-century masterpiece is defined by its curving, organic architecture: there are no right angles anywhere in the 3,950-square-foot main residence. Banks of floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interiors with light, while the vaulted wooden ceiling evokes the hull of a ship and metal vents mimic stylized fish. Gleason even purchased an entire marble quarry in Italy to ensure the finest stone for the home's flooring and massive fireplaces—some slabs so large they had to be delivered to the site by helicopter.


	The circular plan includes three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, one half bathroom, a curved stainless-steel kitchen, a dining room, a spacious living area, and a circular library and office. Many original details, including built-in cabinetry, closets, and bespoke furnishings, remain intact.

	The home was conceived as much for entertainment as for solitude. Gleason's late-night soirées reportedly drew the likes of Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and even President Richard Nixon. Three dramatic swooping bars, a marble dance floor, and a game room with a shuffleboard table speak to its party-ready pedigree. Yet the Mothership also offers serenity, seclusion, and an intimate connection to the natural world, with panoramic views of its wooded 8.6-acre setting just an hour north of Manhattan.

	The estate includes two additional dwellings: a smaller, secondary “spaceship,” long used as a bunkhouse and glamping spot, and the Barracks, a charming (and far more conventional) 1930s stone Colonial Revival home that functions as a guesthouse. A cultivated vegetable and herb garden, plus a gardening shed, round out the retreat.


	The estate last traded hands in 1976 for just $150,000, when CBS sold the property following Gleason's move to Florida. It briefly surfaced for sale back in 2018 for $12 million but never sold.

I'm always fascinated by descriptions of circular houses as having “no right angles anywhere.”. Where the floors meet the walls is all right angles. The window frames in this house are all rectangles, with four right angles in each one.

In any event, it's an interesting house and I do love the living room fireplace.

We have received text from H.R. 5060: UAP Whistleblower Protection Act. This bill was received on 2025-08-29, and currently has 1 cosponsor.

Here is a short summary of the bill:


 This bill, known as the UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, aims to enhance protections for federal employees, including military personnel and contractors, who disclose the use of federal taxpayer funds for evaluating or researching unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) material. The key points of the bill include the following:



 The bill modifies existing laws to ensure that federal civilian employees, members of the military, contractors, and members of the intelligence community are protected when they disclose specific information about the allocation of taxpayer funds for UAP-related activities. This includes:



 The bill explicitly applies to:



 The main objective of this legislation is to encourage transparency by ensuring that individuals who report potential misuse of taxpayer money related to UAP research can do so without fear of repercussions. By reinforcing protections for whistleblowers, the bill aims to foster an environment where federal employees feel safe to speak out about wasteful or questionable government spending, particularly in connection with UAP-related projects.



 The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and has been referred to several committees, including:



 These committees are expected to evaluate the provisions of the bill according to their areas of jurisdiction.



 If passed, this bill could result in increased reporting of UAP-related activities by federal employees due to improved protections against retaliation. The exact implementation details and how these changes will be enforced are to be determined following the bill's advancement through the legislative process.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- "The Conjuring" universe comes to a close with one final spine-chilling case.

Based on real life events, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as Ed and Lorraine Warren in "The Conjuring: Last Rites."

For more than a decade, they brought the characters to life.

But this case is personal. It's not just about saving a family. It's about protecting their own.

Set in the 1980s, the Warrens have retired from paranormal investigating. But when the Smearle family becomes the target of a vengeful demon with a decades old grudge, Ed and Lorraine are forced back into action.

"For us, for me, what just makes this and for everyone, what will make this the ultimate is that this isn't just any old demon that the Warrens are dealing with. Like, we're dealing with something really sordid, that's got a score to settle with these particular two," Farmiga said. "Like, this demon has had a history with the Warrens. It's got a bone to pick. It's cult it's come to its due. You know, we're not just dealing with some random evil that's just like after random souls.

This demon has a personal vendetta against these two. So, the stakes are higher than they've ever been."

"Early on, it was every case that Lorraine took on and what it did to her emotionally, physically. And so you're always weighing the cost of these cases. But, I think it's the love and the relationship that has been the continual thread," Wilson said. "So when we come back to it, because we'll all be different and the fears will all be different and all of that. But it's this. Alright. Where are you? Are you that one? Are you that one?"

"Yes," Farmiga said.

"It's that," Wilson said.

They have heard their share of interesting stories over the years from people who associate the stars with this franchise.

"I mean, we picked Lorraine's brain when she was alive, and, and, you know, we were friends with her and we would visit with her before every conjuring. And we would just, I mean, you know, we would hear after story after story. We would hear tapes, you know, that Tony Spear would play for us," Farmiga said. "And it's just ludicrous what went down from, like, the smells they would encounter to the audio that they would encounter, and it's just outlandish. And it's like one of those things where there's so many crazy stories. I mean, thank God I've never encountered and I never want it because I don't need to, like, see it to believe it or smell it or hear it to believe it."

"People will jokingly, you know, say I need you to come over and I'm dumb enough to probably think that I could handle it and it helped them. Naïve," Wilson said.

"Now I feel like I could, like, handle a situation if I have to," Farmiga said.

"Well, sure," Wilson said.

"I think in complete delusion, I bet you I could," Farmiga said.

Let's just hope no one has to find out.

Exclusive: Director Michael Chaves had his own spooky encounter when filming The Conjuring: Last Rites

Despite making many scary movies over his career, The Conjuring: Last Rites director Michael Chaves says he was never really a big believer in the supernatural, that is, until he had his first paranormal experience whilst filming the new horror movie.

"We shot [The Conjuring: Last Rites] in London, and I actually stayed in a haunted house. And I was, honestly, mostly, entirely a skeptic before shooting this movie," says Chaves to GamesRadar+. The director added that he and his family were staying at an "old vicarage" at the time of filming, which is the name given to a house where a vicar lives or once lived, as provided by the church.

"So my daughter one day showed me a picture on her iPad," continues Chaves. "It was like a picture down the hall, and she was like, Do you see the man in the hall? It was kind of like shadowy, and there was like a mirror there, which obviously was kind of like in the movie. And I'm like, 'Sweetie, you're probably listening to me making the movie,' because I'm looking at it. I'm like, I can't see the figure or anything."

 




However, Chaves didn't remain a skeptic for long. "So everyone leaves to see a show. The whole house is empty… This place is like, over 200 years old. I wouldn't be surprised, 300 years old. This was, like, you know, super old Harry Potter house. I'm downstairs. I'm playing video games. It's totally quiet, and I hear voices. I hear male voices." In a bid to find out who was talking, Chaves says he turned off the TV and looked outside, around the house, to find the culprit. But there was no one there.

"I hear it, and it sounds like it's coming from inside the house… It's like articulated, like two male voices talking to each other. Went through every room in the house, and there was, like, no one there, but literally, the spookiest experience I ever had," adds Chaves. "And honestly, it was like the combination of that and then working with the Smurl sisters on the film… I am totally a believer after it, 100%”

Chaves has been involved with the franchise for many years, directing both The Nun and The Nun 2, as well as The Conjuring 3, aka The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, and The Curse of La Llorona. However, with a decade of making horror films under his belt, it seems fitting that the Warrens' final on-screen outing would bring Chaves' first ghostly encounter.

 Matt Fraser is expecting another little one!


 The psychic medium, 34, and his wife Alexa, 27, are expecting their third baby together, announcing the exciting news exclusively with PEOPLE. The expectant mother is currently 18 weeks pregnant and expecting their new addition in February 2026.


 Fraser, who already shares sons Rowan, 5 months, and Royce, 3, with his wife, tells PEOPLE that the news of a third child is a dream come true.


 "I have seen God working in serious ways, and it's amazing to now witness it happening in my own life," he says. "Alexa and I have always talked about how beautiful it would be to have three children, and I always dreamed of having them by the time I turned 35, so I could enjoy every single moment with them."


Kelsi-Mariah Oresman

 Echoing her husband's sentiments, Alexa says that while they've always wanted three children, she "didn't think it would come so quickly."


 “We've always known we wanted at least three children, we just didn't think it would come so quickly! It was a bit of a shock getting a positive pregnancy test only two months postpartum, but we knew right away what a blessing it is," she tells PEOPLE. "Having children has been such an exciting chapter together, and although we're in the thick of it, the love in our house is overflowing."


 Fraser admits to PEOPLE that he felt a mixture of emotions when he first heard the news.


 "At first, I was scared, anxious, and overwhelmed. I'm the type of person who likes everything planned and thought out," he explains. "But, once I processed what was happening, I realized this was the greatest blessing of all. God was giving us exactly what we had prayed for — everything we ever wanted."

 The soon-to-be dad of three shares that he's already thought about some of the more practical things that come with having another baby, like whether the car is big enough or if there's enough room at the dining room table. However, he continues to be reminded that there's no perfect way to raise a child.


 "I've learned that nobody wrote the book on parenting," he says. "You learn as you go. You make mistakes. You grow, and, most importantly, you learn to trust and enjoy the journey. What felt unexpected at first quickly became the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Now I'm embracing this moment fully and have been in complete bliss ever since.”


 The couple will soon have three children under 5, and Alexa tells PEOPLE that although they have been busy, they've "never been so fulfilled."


 "Yes, there are fingerprints everywhere, Goldfish in our couch cushions, and little feet running everywhere, but we wouldn't want it any other way," she shares. "The boys are already growing so fast, so we are taking in every minute, and we can't wait to give them yet another sibling this next year. I can't wait to see the dynamic between the three kids!"

Paper clippings of a UFO sighting in Rendlesham.

Unexplained aerial phenomena, commonly branded as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) and more recently as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), remain one of history's most enduring enigmas.

While most sightings are dismissed as misidentifications or atmospheric oddities, a select few stand apart – defying scientific and governmental scrutiny and leaving behind more questions than answers. These are cases with solid physical evidence, radar confirmation, or witnessed by military and aviation professionals.

Let's delve into the 11 most compelling UFO sightings across the globe – incidents with documentation, official investigation, and mysteries that have persisted for decades despite analysis.

In November 2004, off the coast of San Diego, multiple US Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz Strike Group spotted a white object resembling a Tic Tac breath mint, maneuvering in ways that defied aerodynamics. It had rapid acceleration, abrupt stops, instant turns – with no visible propulsion. The object was moving in the area for around an hour.

The Pentagon officially corroborated these sightings in 2020. Commander David Fravor, a primary witness, described the object's physics-defying movement as “not like anything I'd ever seen”.

Japanese Airlines cargo pilot Kenju Terauchi, a veteran aviator, observed a strange phenomenon in the skies of Alaska while flying the JAL Flight 1628. Alongside his team, he encountered three UFOs for nearly fifty minutes.

Apart from Terauchi and his two crew members, the incident was also witnessed by civilian and radar operators, and later investigated by FAA officials. The FAA Division Chief, John Callahan, confirmed the radar evidence of the encounter and preserved copies of the data.

While the case garnered global acclaim, Captain Terauchi was demoted to a desk job for 'embarrassing' the airline, only to be reinstated later. The FAA briefing was officially buried, but Callahan retained evidence, later sharing it publicly as one of the strongest radar-verified UFO cases in history.

Stefan Michalak, a mechanic and amateur geologist, faced the most extraordinary incident of his life. He encountered a strange disc-shaped craft near Falcon Lake, Manitoba. However, the moment he approached it, Michalak was burned by a blast of hot gas through a grid-like vent. The blast left a grid pattern of burns on his chest and stomach.

While Michalak was the only witness, many others, including RCMP officers, doctors, US Air Force, and Canadian authorities, investigated the incident. The soil, clothing, and metal samples from the site tested radioactive.

Michalak's encounter went on to become a national sensation, documented as one of Canada's most famous, unexplained UFO encounters.

Often dubbed as Britain's Roswell, the Rendlesham Forest Incident became one of the U.K.'s most famous UFO cases, also garnering acclaim worldwide. In late December 1980, US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge saw strange lights descending into the forest.

The officials entered the woods and stumbled upon a metallic, glowing object. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, they witnessed flashing lights, hovering star-like objects, and recorded radiation readings.

Halt filed a memo and made a real-time audio recording during their investigation, now famously known as the ‘Halt Tape'. The officials also discovered that the radiation levels were ten times the normal background level during tests.

On October 4, 1967, residents in the village of Shag Harbor noticed strange orange lights in the night sky. Five teenagers witnessed these lights fluctuating in sequence, suddenly diving at a 45-degree angle toward the water's surface.

Surprisingly, the lights didn't sink into the water but seemed floating on it. A joint Navy, RCMP(Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and Coast Guard underwater search ensued after the residents reported this incident as an air crash.

However, the concerned authorities found no traces of a crashed aircraft. The Rescue Coordination Center later confirmed this fact, and the case was referred to as a UFO in the Government of Canada documents. To date, it remains one of Canada's most celebrated UFO cases.

Thousands of residents across Phoenix and other locations across Arizona were baffled when they witnessed a huge V-shaped UFO pass the night sky on March 13, 1997. People from various locations reported seeing the UFO moving silently across the sky.

About two hours later, the US Air Force dropped military flares in the sky, with rumors stating this was an attempt to cover up and discredit the UFO incident that occurred earlier in the evening.

Former Arizona Governor Fife Symington III later said, “I can say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I'd ever seen. And it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares don't fly in formation.”

During the 30th and 31st March in 1990, hundreds of residents across the Wallonia region of Belgium witnessed a strange, triangular formation of lights moving across the night sky. Many eyewitnesses described these craft-like objects as having three bright lights at each vertex and a central, red, pulsating light.

The Belgian Air Force used two F-16 fighter jets to intercept these objects, but the pilots couldn't make visual contact with the objects. The reason was that these unidentified objects descended from high altitudes of over 10,000 feet to as low as 500 feet in seconds.

The government was forced to acknowledge the anomalies officially, despite the lack of logical explanations regarding the sightings.

On April 6, 1966, more than 200 students and several teachers in the Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a grey, saucer-shaped object that was about twice the size of a family car. The mysterious craft hovered around the school for approximately 20 minutes, descending into a nearby field.

A few Australian skeptics tried dismissing the object as an experimental military aircraft. Still, the Air Force reported that they were not in the airspace at the time of the incident. Others tried to dismiss it as a massive balloon that happened to hover around the school.

In the aftermath, a few men in dark suits arrived at the school, warning eyewitnesses to never speak about the incident again.

On September 19, 1976, two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom II jets scrambled to intercept a luminous unidentified object over Tehran. Both jets saw their weapons and communications systems go haywire when they closed on the object. The functionality came back to normal only when they withdrew from the object.

Hundreds of civilians, including pilots, military officials, and ground observers across Tehran, witnessed this phenomenon. The US Defence Intelligence Agency compiled a four-page report, which was later sent to the White House, CIA, NSA, and Pentagon for analysis.

The event was labelled as one of the most credible military UFO encounters, and also became the subject of an Iranian film. Retired General Parviz Jafari testified about it publicly at the 2007 National Press Club conference in Washington, D.C.

On September 16, 1994, 60 children at the Ariel school in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, claimed they saw a hovering craft and strange creatures with black eyes in the school yard during recess.

Many described receiving a telepathic message warning humanity about harming the planet. The mass sighting drew international attention when Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack traveled to Africa to interview the children, later calling it one of the most credible UFO encounters ever.

Decades on, some witnesses remain visibly shaken, recalling trauma and vivid memories. However, the case continues to stand out as one of the largest collective sightings in modern history.

On April 24, 1964, Socorro police officer Lonnie Zamora witnessed a speeding vehicle when he heard a roar and saw a bluish-orange flame in the sky. Through investigation, he discovered an egg-shaped craft perched in an arroyo, flanked by two figures in white coveralls.

As Zamora came closer to the object within 150 years, the object lifted off with a roar and disappeared. It left behind scorch marks, indentations in the ground, and burned vegetation.

The Air Force took this case seriously under Project Blue Book, officially classifying it as ‘unexplained' after finding no evidence of a hoax.

Despite advanced aerospace technology and decades of investigation, these cases stubbornly resist ordinary explanation.

What singles them out is not a lack of skepticism but an abundance of credible data – diverse witnesses, physical traces, and repeated failure by authorities ot solve the mystery.

These cases remain the gold standard for UFO phenomena amidst growing government transparency and international interest. They raise unanswerable questions today, as when these UFOs first breached our skies.

Stefan Michalak, a mechanic and amateur geologist, faced the most extraordinary incident of his life. He encountered a strange disc-shaped craft near Falcon Lake, Manitoba. However, the moment he approached it, Michalak was burned by a blast of hot gas through a grid-like vent. The blast left a grid pattern of burns on his chest and stomach.

While Michalak was the only witness, many others, including RCMP officers, doctors, US Air Force, and Canadian authorities, investigated the incident. The soil, clothing, and metal samples from the site tested radioactive.

Michalak's encounter went on to become a national sensation, documented as one of Canada's most famous, unexplained UFO encounters.

Often dubbed as Britain's Roswell, the Rendlesham Forest Incident became one of the U.K.'s most famous UFO cases, also garnering acclaim worldwide. In late December 1980, US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge saw strange lights descending into the forest.

The officials entered the woods and stumbled upon a metallic, glowing object. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, they witnessed flashing lights, hovering star-like objects, and recorded radiation readings.

Halt filed a memo and made a real-time audio recording during their investigation, now famously known as the ‘Halt Tape'. The officials also discovered that the radiation levels were ten times the normal background level during tests.

On October 4, 1967, residents in the village of Shag Harbor noticed strange orange lights in the night sky. Five teenagers witnessed these lights fluctuating in sequence, suddenly diving at a 45-degree angle toward the water's surface.

Surprisingly, the lights didn't sink into the water but seemed floating on it. A joint Navy, RCMP(Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and Coast Guard underwater search ensued after the residents reported this incident as an air crash.

However, the concerned authorities found no traces of a crashed aircraft. The Rescue Coordination Center later confirmed this fact, and the case was referred to as a UFO in the Government of Canada documents. To date, it remains one of Canada's most celebrated UFO cases.

Thousands of residents across Phoenix and other locations across Arizona were baffled when they witnessed a huge V-shaped UFO pass the night sky on March 13, 1997. People from various locations reported seeing the UFO moving silently across the sky.

About two hours later, the US Air Force dropped military flares in the sky, with rumors stating this was an attempt to cover up and discredit the UFO incident that occurred earlier in the evening.

Former Arizona Governor Fife Symington III later said, “I can say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I'd ever seen. And it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares don't fly in formation.”

During the 30th and 31st March in 1990, hundreds of residents across the Wallonia region of Belgium witnessed a strange, triangular formation of lights moving across the night sky. Many eyewitnesses described these craft-like objects as having three bright lights at each vertex and a central, red, pulsating light.

The Belgian Air Force used two F-16 fighter jets to intercept these objects, but the pilots couldn't make visual contact with the objects. The reason was that these unidentified objects descended from high altitudes of over 10,000 feet to as low as 500 feet in seconds.

The government was forced to acknowledge the anomalies officially, despite the lack of logical explanations regarding the sightings.

On April 6, 1966, more than 200 students and several teachers in the Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a grey, saucer-shaped object that was about twice the size of a family car. The mysterious craft hovered around the school for approximately 20 minutes, descending into a nearby field.

A few Australian skeptics tried dismissing the object as an experimental military aircraft. Still, the Air Force reported that they were not in the airspace at the time of the incident. Others tried to dismiss it as a massive balloon that happened to hover around the school.

In the aftermath, a few men in dark suits arrived at the school, warning eyewitnesses to never speak about the incident again.

On September 19, 1976, two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom II jets scrambled to intercept a luminous unidentified object over Tehran. Both jets saw their weapons and communications systems go haywire when they closed on the object. The functionality came back to normal only when they withdrew from the object.

Hundreds of civilians, including pilots, military officials, and ground observers across Tehran, witnessed this phenomenon. The US Defence Intelligence Agency compiled a four-page report, which was later sent to the White House, CIA, NSA, and Pentagon for analysis.

The event was labelled as one of the most credible military UFO encounters, and also became the subject of an Iranian film. Retired General Parviz Jafari testified about it publicly at the 2007 National Press Club conference in Washington, D.C.

On September 16, 1994, 60 children at the Ariel school in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, claimed they saw a hovering craft and strange creatures with black eyes in the school yard during recess.

Many described receiving a telepathic message warning humanity about harming the planet. The mass sighting drew international attention when Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack traveled to Africa to interview the children, later calling it one of the most credible UFO encounters ever.

Decades on, some witnesses remain visibly shaken, recalling trauma and vivid memories. However, the case continues to stand out as one of the largest collective sightings in modern history.

On April 24, 1964, Socorro police officer Lonnie Zamora witnessed a speeding vehicle when he heard a roar and saw a bluish-orange flame in the sky. Through investigation, he discovered an egg-shaped craft perched in an arroyo, flanked by two figures in white coveralls.

As Zamora came closer to the object within 150 years, the object lifted off with a roar and disappeared. It left behind scorch marks, indentations in the ground, and burned vegetation.

The Air Force took this case seriously under Project Blue Book, officially classifying it as ‘unexplained' after finding no evidence of a hoax.

Despite advanced aerospace technology and decades of investigation, these cases stubbornly resist ordinary explanation.

What singles them out is not a lack of skepticism but an abundance of credible data – diverse witnesses, physical traces, and repeated failure by authorities ot solve the mystery.

These cases remain the gold standard for UFO phenomena amidst growing government transparency and international interest. They raise unanswerable questions today, as when these UFOs first breached our skies.

Russia, even after the end of hostilities against Ukraine, will continue its information and psychological operations. The enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army,  stated Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.

"The next challenges we must be ready for after the fighting ends are how to protect our informational, humanitarian, historical, and value-based frontiers. Because even if one day the guns fall silent, the enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army, and this war will definitely continue," Yusov warned.

He emphasized that history often becomes intertwined with geopolitics, posing a significant challenge for Ukraine. According to Yusov, Russia's war against Ukraine has shown that the Geneva Conventions and international security mechanisms are ineffective.

"Our duty is to make them effective. This can be achieved through systematic informational work: exposing the truth, countering Russian propaganda, and documenting the war crimes of the aggressor state," he added.

In March, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, emphasized that Russia is expanding its PSYOPS units to influence Western countries. In particular, Moscow seeks to sow disappointment in NATO and promote the idea that cooperation with Russia is possible.

NASA has recently presented a statement that has caused great anticipation in the scientific and astronomical fields. Far from focusing on the Red Planet, this time the American space agency has turned its attention to another celestial body. Researchers have made progress regarding the possible existence of extraterrestrial life on a planet other than Mars, which changes ideas about where to search for life beyond Earth.

The surprising news has centered around Ceres, the dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. NASA has confirmed that this small planet shows clear signs of having had favorable conditions for life billions of years ago. It is important to note that, although it is not a large planet, Ceres has proven to contain chemical and energetic elements that could have supported simple organisms in a distant past.

The most recent study, published last August 20 and led by researcher Sam Courville, has produced surprising results. Scientists have used advanced thermal and chemical models to simulate the interior evolution of the dwarf planet over an extensive period. The data indicate that Ceres's subsurface had hot water and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, elements linked to environments favorable for microbial life on Earth.

These findings have not come in isolation, since in 2018 NASA's Dawn mission confirmed the presence of frozen water and salts on Ceres's surface. The brightest areas detected on the dwarf planet are the result of saline deposits, clear signs of hydrothermal activity that expelled liquids from the interior. Therefore, the existence of a continuous flow of hot fluids supports the hypothesis of an environment capable of sustaining life.

Sam Courville himself has explained that, on Earth, the mixture of hot water of underground origin with other compounds in the ocean creates an ideal ecosystem for microorganisms. This way, scientists firmly believe that Ceres could have had similar conditions in its history, which broadens the perspective of where to search for life beyond our planet. This approach opens new avenues for future explorations and space missions dedicated to confirming or ruling out the existence of extraterrestrial organisms.

Ceres is a cold and dry dwarf planet, where current conditions prevent the existence of liquid water. Its interior still generates some heat due to radioactive decay, but it is not enough to keep habitable environments on the surface. Thus, although today it is an inhospitable world, its past could have been very different.

This new focus on Ceres challenges the traditional search for extraterrestrial life centered on Mars and other larger planets. The evidence gathered so far suggests that even smaller bodies can harbor the necessary conditions for the existence of life. Thus, NASA and other scientific institutions will intensify their efforts to study these lesser-known worlds, seeking clues that could answer one of humanity's deepest questions.

Check for daily updates on your sun sign

Moon phases, seasons, and other current happenings

I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway.

On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights.

I was most impressed by the Nebula reviews on the Apple Store, where the popular pick has collected 160,000+ ratings with an overall 4.6-star rating. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past?

Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. (FYI, some people might refer to asknebula reviews due to the brand's domain! Don't worry—they're the same company!)

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. It's transaction-based with various payment options available. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more.

The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. 

Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Before you select which person you'd like to chat with, you can view their profile with a breakdown of their years of experience, number of consultations, user reviews, and an overall rating out of five stars. You'll also see their cost per minute.

The Nebula app is free to download, while the website is free to visit. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience. 

When you sign up, you get a free 3-day trial, but it's important to know that you'll start getting charged for your subscription once the trial ends. Choose a weekly subscription for $7.99 per week, a monthly subscription for $39.99, or an annual subscription for $49.99.

While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose.

In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience.

When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc.).

From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings.

Horoscopes

The Horoscopes tab is where you'll find the most in-depth information on your own. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute!). 

Per its name, this is also the tab where you'll find your personalized horoscope for today, yesterday, tomorrow, the week, the month, or the year. In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. 

Similarly, the weekly horoscope will highlight your focus of the week and your monthly horoscope will highlight a focus of the month (e.g. ‘reflect and flow'), along with favorable days and challenging days for the month. 

The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms).

If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. 

Psychics

The Psychics tab is fairly straight forward. This is where you'll head if you want to start a one-on-one chat with a psychic. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc.).

If you start a chat with someone, your chat will live in the Chatroom tab. Otherwise, that tab will be empty.

Compatibility

The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Your own details will already be entered in there, but you'll need to add your partner (or potential partner or friend or family member!) and input their birth date, time, and place. 

Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. 

Readings

Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips.

My Nebula Astrology Review

The astrology side of the Nebula stood out to me immediately. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me. 

I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) has the exact same prediction for the day, week, year, etc. 

That's what I really love about Nebula. Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. It's not just about your birth month and date; it's about what year, month, day, and time you were born, and where. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. 

I also loved that I could actually see my full birth chart in detail. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. You can keep things high-level, or continue clicking through each element to learn more and more. I think I spent a full hour in the app the first time I opened it, and I was in the horoscopes tab the entire time.

After that first day, I continued to come back daily to read my horoscope. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day.

I also played around with the Compatibility tab, as I'd like to think any normal 30-something might. I entered my current partner's details and then followed up with everyone I've ever dated and all my best friends and family members. And yes, I even tested it with people I don't get along with so well. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on.

My Nebula Psychic Review

The one-on-one psychic chats were my second favorite part of the Nebula app, but I still appreciated the option. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom.

There are pros and cons to each! The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info.

I chatted with a few different psychics for my Nebula readings, and I loved that I was able to see a lot of detail about each person before I started a conversation. I also really appreciated the vast array of options and how quickly each person responded. Plus, there were always a few hundred other options to choose from!

The one-stop-shop nature of the Nebula platform makes it a great option for just about anyone who is interested in spirituality and astrology. It's a fun and insightful tool for astrology enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a generic daily horoscope. Nebula is also a great option for beginners who are curious about tarot, astrology, numerology, and psychic readings and don't know where to begin. 

In particular, if you prefer chat-based communication, Nebula psychic readings are definitely worth checking out.

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

The final verdict? Nebula surpassed my expectations. I love the daily horoscopes and the detailed astrology insights it provides, with guidance that genuinely feels aligned. If you're looking for an all-in-one spirituality app that's easy to use and can improve your daily life, I recommend giving this one a try.

PAN-India star Prabhas will soon head to Greece to shoot the pending songs of The Raja Saab. After wrapping up this romantic horror entertainer, the actor will move on to Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Spirit. It is well known that Prabhas plays a cop in this big-ticket film, while Animal fame Triptii Dimri plays the female lead.

Bollywood Hungama has now made a surprising claim about the Prabhas starrer in its recent report. The media outlet described Sandeep Vanga's directorial as an eerie supernatural thriller on the lines of M. Night Shyamalan's films. Earlier, many reports suggested that Spirit would be an intense action drama revolving around a cop who goes after an international crime syndicate, but this latest claim is completely contradictory.

Fans are now wondering why the actor would take up another horror film immediately after The Raja Saab. Pranay Reddy Vanga, in association with T-Series, will bankroll the project, while Harshavardhan Rameshwar will compose the music.
