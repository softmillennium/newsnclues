Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. “Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.” “Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. “Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday. Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.” Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela's government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military's presence near the country. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador's notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. On September 2, an appeals court ruled that the Trump administration could not use the 18th century-era law to expedite removals of people it accused of being Tren de Aragua members.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move would make Florida the first state to end a longstanding – and constitutionally upheld – practice of requiring certain vaccines for school students. The state health department will immediately move to end all non-statutory mandates in the state, Ladapo said at a news conference. Ron DeSantis, who was also at the event, said state lawmakers would then look into developing a legislative package to end any remaining mandates. All 50 states have had school immunization requirements since the beginning of the 1980s, with incoming kindergartners needing shots to protect against diseases including measles, polio and tetanus. Required vaccine coverage among US kindergartners dips again, new CDC data shows All states allow medical exemptions from these school vaccine mandates, and most also allow for exemptions due to personal or religious beliefs. Florida's school vaccine exemption rate last school year– about 5% – was higher than the national average, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, and nearly all were for nonmedical reasons. “We are concerned that today's announcement will put children in Florida public schools at higher risk for getting sick, which will have a ripple effect across our communities,” Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. Close contact makes it easy for contagious diseases to spread quickly,” she said. “When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun. When children are sick and miss school caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.” This is a breaking news story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was hardly a subtle attempt to project power. China showed off air-, sea- and land-launched nuclear weapons in its parade on Wednesday, a triad intended to demonstrate that Beijing's long-term aspiration is to match US military might. Also on display were large underwater torpedo-like drones, intended to threaten western warships, as well as anti-drone lasers and four-legged “robot wolves”, all designed to be noticed, regardless of their actual military effectiveness. China's Xinhua news agency said it was the first time Beijing had presented its nuclear triad, weapons it said were “China's strategic ‘ace' power to safeguard the country's sovereignty and nation's dignity”. They included four new DF-61 intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles, each carried on 16 wheel trucks. The newly presented missile's range was roughly estimated at 7,500 miles based on its predecessor, the DL-41 – enough to reach Washington from Beijing. China's nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country's: it has an estimated 600 warheads, which is increasing at a rate of 100 a year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Its goal is to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to Washington, though even at that point Beijing's arsenal would be smaller than that of the US or Russia, both of which have more than 5,000 warheads in their stocks. Other novel weapons shown off included two models of extra-large underwater drones, measuring 18 to 20 metres, including the AJX002, carried on specially elongated eight-wheeled trucks, part of a strategic weapons programme. Their size means they are vastly different to the small sea drones that Ukraine has used in swarms to knock out vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet, and their capabilities are less than clear. Two types of laser air defence weapons were displayed, one for ships and one based on land, a cheaper means of fending off drones that western militaries are already hoping to use. Britain plans to fit four warships with a DragonFire laser from 2027, to better protect the vessels from drones used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. A handful of spindly four-legged land drones called robot wolves also attracted attention. However, if they could march, they were not allowed to, and instead were mounted on the back of other moving vehicles. At a glance they appeared no more sophisticated than the growing number of land drones appearing on the battlefields of Ukraine, as remotely controlled fighters or trucks to rescue the wounded, though China's industrial capacity is such that a viable product could probably be made in vast numbers and possibly supplied to Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jocelyn Solis-Moreira is a freelance health and science journalist based in New York. There's nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one's family, even just for a few minutes. The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones. This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study's senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. All this scrolling is messing with people's health. “We're just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.” The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media. How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture. Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn't ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we're evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said. While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them. “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn't use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.” Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Setting a timer can be helpful if you're prone to mindless scrolling. Pasricha also recommended checking in with yourself after two TikTok videos to see whether you're having a productive toilet session. If the magic isn't happening, it's better to get up and try again later than to sit and wait on the toilet bowl. Ghanta explained it best: There are many things in life we're rushing to get through, and we often say to slow down and take time to smell the roses.

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Many people incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison's West Compound are confined in cells so small they can touch the ceiling and both walls with their arms outstretched, according to a new report released on Tuesday by the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson. The Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment. New Jersey State Prison, a maximum security prison in Trenton, the state's capital, holds more than 1,300 people across its three compounds, North, South, and West. Investigators found that West Compound prison cells, with the exception of one wing, “are very small.” Cells in the solitary confinement unit, which the Department of Corrections has named the Restorative Housing Unit, “are shockingly small,” measuring four feet by seven feet. The New Jersey Administrative Code requires that county jail cells have 35 square feet of unencumbered floor space in single-occupancy cells, but there are no minimum requirements for the size of prison cells, according to the report. Cells in only one wing of West Compound meet the county jail requirement. Residents also have no privacy while showering, which has led them to bathe with their underwear on. “[T]he West Compound does not have enclosed shower stalls that offer any modesty or privacy while bathing,” the report says. New Jersey is one of the country's fastest warming states, but there is no air conditioning in West Compound's housing units. This past summer, the state was hit with numerous heat waves. More than 30 years later, in 1952, another committee advised the state's then-governor to build a new prison according to “standards of modern penology.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children in Florida will no longer be required to receive vaccines against preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio and hepatitis, said Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, on Wednesday in a speech during which he likened vaccine mandates to “slavery”. Ladapo, hand-picked for the role by Ron DeSantis, Florida's Republican governor, is a long-time skeptic of the benefit of vaccines, and has previously been accused of peddling “scientific nonsense” by public health advocates. In his announcement on Wednesday, at a press conference in Tampa hosted by DeSantis, he said that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed, and that he expected the move would receive the blessing “of God”. “Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” said Ladapo, who altered data in a 2022 study about Covid-19 vaccines in an attempt to exaggerate the risk to young men who received one. “People have a right to make their own decisions. Ladapo condemned lockdowns and vaccination requirements during the coronavirus pandemic as a time “when crazy things did happen”, and said that growing skepticism of vaccines were “reflections of God's light against the darkness of tyranny and oppression”. Formerly affiliated with the controversial ultra-conservative America's Frontline Doctors group, Ladapo has long railed against Covid-19 vaccines. In 2023, he urged Florida residents to ignore public health advice and reject mRNA booster shots that he falsely claimed had not been tested on humans. Several of his other positions on public health issues, such as promoting the removal of fluoride from drinking water and urging parents to reject measles vaccines for their children, have been called “dangerous” and a “disservice to Florida residents”. The governor drew allegations of racism in 2023 when the state introduced a new education curriculum teaching that the “full truth” of America's history with slavery is that it was beneficial to those enslaved. Florida's department of health currently has strict requirements for immunizations that must be given during childhood, which are posted to its website. Routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13m deaths among children born in the US between 1994 and 2023, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report published last year. Ladapo gave no details or timeline for the proposed repeal, but said his department would work with lawmakers and the DeSantis administration to make it happen. And I am telling you right now that the moral side is so simple.” Florida's plan drew praise from Robert W Malone, a conservative physician and prominent anti-vaxxer appointed by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to his new advisory committee on immunization practices that replaced the independent panel he fired. “Go Joe!” Malone said in a post to X, shortly after another tweet in which he said he spoke to Ladapo on Tuesday and called him “a measured scientist – who is on fire to change the system for the better”. It will drive down immunization rates and open the door to outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors and vulnerable Floridians at risk,” she said in a statement. David Jolly, a former Republican congressman for Florida who is running as a Democrat to succeed DeSantis as governor when he is termed out in 2027, posted to X that he believed Ladapo's tenure could be limited. Hopefully Byron Donalds or Paul Renner would do the same,” he wrote, referring to two high-profile Florida Republicans who have announced their candidacies. If Florida abolishes [its mandate], it would be the first in recent times to do so,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, who specializes in vaccines law and policy. She noted that Idaho attempted to end school mandates in April, but ended up carving out exceptions for existing mandates – effectively rendering that part of the law moot – after pushback from advocates. “I would also add that one reason all states adopted them is that evidence showed school mandates reduce and prevent outbreaks. If Florida does this, it's creating an unfortunate natural experiment with its children as guinea pigs,” Reiss said. The Florida department of health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the program should wind down, speaking at a press conference in Mississauga, Ont. “Why aren't employers offering jobs to Canadian kids first? Why are they shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage labour?” he told reporters at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Wednesday morning. “We know why a foreign-owned mega-chain wants to be greedy – it's good for their corporate profits – but our immigration system doesn't exist to pad their bottom line,” Mr. Poilievre said. “That's why the government should immediately stop issuing new TFW permits, and end this wage-suppressing, opportunity-stealing program.” The TFW program has been dogged in controversy for decades, largely due to allegations of worker abuse by employers. The government determines if employers are eligible to hire foreign labour by evaluating Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) applications – a document employers fill in to justify why they are unable to find local workers for the job. Ottawa has since tightened eligibility criteria in line with a policy goal of reducing the overall number of temporary residents in the country. Federal government data shows that in the first half of 2025, 105,195 work permits were issued to workers entering Canada through the TFW program. “When I talk to businesses around the country, particularly in Quebec but elsewhere in the country, their number one issue is tariffs, and their number two issue is access to temporary foreign workers,” Mr. Carney said. “We have many parts of Canada – particularly in rural and remote communities – with very few available entry-level workers for jobs on which local people depend,” said Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, in a post on X. In particular, these groups disapprove of the closed work permit aspect of the program, which ties a worker's ability to work in Canada to a single employer. This design, critics say, increases a worker's dependence on the employer because they are unable to move jobs easily in instances of exploitation. In November of 2024, a parliamentary committee on citizenship and immigration recommended that Ottawa get rid of the closed work permit system entirely, and introduce regional or sector-specific work permits that would define sectors broadly, and provide workers with access to a wide range of employers. The work permit, which would be issued for two years, would allow workers to move between employers in the same sector as long as they have a new job offer. Syed Hussan, executive director of Migrant Rights Network, told The Globe that shutting down the program and creating a standalone temporary immigration stream for agricultural workers would still leave many temporary foreign workers in the country, because a significant number of TFWs work in agriculture. In 2024, for example, roughly 78,000 foreign workers worked in agriculture, according to data from Statistics Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the total number of TFWs. If Pierre Poilievre really wants to end exploitation, he would create a path to permanent residency for temporary foreign workers who are stuck in a cycle of exploitation,” Mr. Hussan said. In a recent note, Bank of Montreal chief economist Doug Porter said the rising youth jobless rate is related to the “extreme growth” in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds who have come to Canada as international students. “Unsurprisingly, when the youth population swells, it tends to drive up the youth jobless rate relative to others,” he wrote. Instead, he pointed to weak economic conditions and a sharp reduction in job vacancies that are making it tougher for people to secure employment. With reports from Nojoud Al Mallees and Matt Lundy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the airheaded lead actress of the faux blockbuster, a junky piece of Hollywood nothingness titled Midnight Velocity, yammers on about reincarnation and the joys of “working with Keanu,” Johansson's character lets loose a wry, sad smile, and quickly exits in the hopes of finding a more spiritually fulfilling environment. For a few years, it might have been tempting to view that scene as a cruelly prescient peek into the arc of Johansson's own career. No longer the emerging starlet of such small, art-minded fare as Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation or Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, Johansson has become the world's biggest name brand. With US$15-billion in box-office sales to her credit, the actress is now history's highest-grossing movie star – and all thanks to such empty-calorie spectacles (Jurassic World Rebirth, eight separate Marvel movies) that are not all that far removed from the likes of Midnight Velocity. Johansson in a scene from 2025's Jurassic World: RebirthJasin Boland/The Associated Press Yet instead of playing it easy, the actress seems stubbornly determined to use her megawatt fame, and attendant paydays, to keep as much distance between herself and any Midnight Velocity-like fate. Even more daring: Johansson didn't try to find a role in it for herself, instead choosing to focus entirely on the filmmaking. “Honestly, it probably would have made financing it so much easier to have my name and face on the poster, but it would have been very, very hard to do both,” the actress says in an interview a few weeks ahead of TIFF. “I look at other actors who also direct, like Bradley Cooper and Robert Redford, and I have so much more respect for that choice. Johansson, pictured at TIFF in 2019, says she has a new respect for actors who also direct: 'Just the stamina of it. But once Eleanor mistakenly attends a Holocaust survivors' group at her local Jewish community centre, she falls into a rabbit hole of well-intentioned but damning deception, ultimately misappropriating Bessie's history as a survivor as her own life story. The drama that follows is deliberately messy and complex, its characters wrestling with grief, loneliness and, most of all, the lingering stains of history. So, not exactly the kind of box-office-friendly material that Johansson is used to. But for the filmmaker, whose star power helped lift Tory Kamen's screenplay out of the development hell that it had been stuck in for years, Eleanor's story spoke not only to her artistic ambitions, but her own personal history. “I grew up with my grandmother, and her mother only spoke Yiddish to her, so then my grandmother understood more Yiddish than she spoke, but she did speak it to us. It was a part of her makeup, her character,” recalls Johansson, who grew up in Manhattan's predominantly Jewish Upper East Side neighbourhood of Yorkville, the same area where Eleanor takes place. On directing actor June Squibb (above) in Eleanor the Great, Johansson says: 'June is incredible – she has so much energy and stamina. But these neighbourhoods that had real specific cultural imprints on them are not there any more.” (The fact that both Delancey and Eleanor have scenes involving deep discussion regarding kosher dills is surely no coincidence.) “I watched Crossing Delancey about 100 times growing up, but I love so many New York movies – Moonstruck, Living out Loud – where the city is not quite a character but there's just such specificity to the neighbourhoods and the characters,” Johansson says. “This movie is very much like my version of New York.” More than any shared cultural geography, though, Johansson's family tree suggests deep roots in the heart of Kamen's screenplay. These losses seem to reverberate deeply for Johansson, who has noted that she rarely cries while reading scripts – with the exception of this project, and Taika Waititi's screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, which also pivoted around the persecution of Jews in the Second World War (a film that earned the star an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress). “But I also found the theme of forgiveness to be incredibly touching. To that end, Johansson and her creative partners sought collaboration with the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation, which Steven Spielberg founded following the production of 1993's Schindler's List to preserve and share Holocaust survivor stories. “They helped us craft Bessie's story so that it was plausible and in a respectful way, and they gave us so much information about all the movement of people in that horrible time, like just physically moving and separating families from one another,” Johansson says, noting that she also cast real-life Jewish survivors to play members of Eleanor's support group. “It was important to get their input and feel like we were honouring the survivor stories. Any and all support was needed given that – unlike the months, sometimes years of preparation that one Johansson's Marvel movies receives – the director had to get Eleanor the Great up and running in a narrow window of time. That might be a typical challenge for any lower-budget production, but it wasn't especially easy when the star of your film was on the cusp of turning 95 years old. “June is incredible – she has so much energy and stamina. It never was an issue of her willingness to do the work. Even with some of her mobility issues, she was completely prepared, dedicated, passionate. I never thought to ask, ‘Is June up for making it? However Eleanor the Great's TIFF launch goes next week – its world premiere at Cannes this past spring was one of the film festival's most sought-after tickets, with a horde of hopeful, soggy moviegoers being turned away from the door during one rainy afternoon – it feels clear that Johansson won't be asking herself whether she's pursued the wrong line of work. Unless her next inevitable sequel is titled something like Jurassic World: Midnight Velocity. Eleanor the Great premieres at TIFF on Sept. 8, with additional screenings Sept. 9 and 12. It's tempting to include Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, another film in which Johansson is more supporting than lead, but her haunting, auditory-only performance in Spike Jonze's eerie AI romantic drama is its own sort of spectral presence, lost in a world not of its making. One of French filmmaker Luc Besson's last great gifts to cinema before he became semi-cancelled is this truly unpredictable riff on Johansson's Black Widow work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. More than the millions of memes it inspired, Johansson's standout scene with Adam Driver in which their unhappy couple trade insults contains so many raw truths that it feels like the cinematic equivalent of an open scab. Only an outsider director such as Jonathan Glazer could fully grasp and then weaponize Johansson's magazine-cover-ready beauty in such a terrifying, entrancing manner. We might never know what Bill Murray's movie star Bob whispers to Johansson's deeply unhappy college grad Charlotte in the final moments of Coppola's now-certified classic. But that won't stop us from thinking about just how the two got to such a poignant point, and why its emotional potency still lingers today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron's approval rating has fallen to its lowest point since his election in 2017, according to the results of a poll by the sociological service Verian for Le Figaro Magazine. Eighty percent of the polled respondents do not trust him, and another 5% of those surveyed found it difficult to answer. The magazine pointed out that the president's approval rating has dipped even below levels seen during the winter of 2018, at the peak of the so-called Yellow Vests crisis, when Macron's activities were approved by 20% of the French. As for the level of confidence in French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, it has dropped to 14%, while 82% opposed his policies. Another 4% declined to express their opinion on this issue. The survey was conducted via an online questionnaire involving 1,000 people over the age of 18. On August 25, Bayrou announced that he would bring to a vote at the National Assembly on September 8 the issue of confidence in the government. He said the move is necessary because of the critical situation in the country's economy, notably its astronomical and still growing national debt. According to him, "France's public debt is increasing by 12 million euros every hour" and has already reached 3.4 trillion euros. Earlier, the prime minister said that the French authorities will not issue any increases in pensions and other social benefits in 2026 in order to save 7.1 billion euros and curtail the growth of the national debt.</p>

TOKYO, September 3. /TASS/. Japan suspects that Russia and China may establish a new world order as it views Beijing's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Victory over Japanese Aggression as a symbol of divisions deepening globally, senior Japanese diplomats told Kyodo.

"China and Russia are seeking to lead a new world order," the Japanese news agency quoted an official at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying. Another high-ranking Japanese diplomat called the parade that was held in Beijing earlier on Wednesday "a symbol of global divisions" amid world instability caused by the policy course pursued by the administration of US President Donald Trump and its trade tariffs.

However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry highlighted the absence of the South Korean president from festivities in Beijing, even though he attended similar events a decade ago. Meanwhile, Japan's MFA described as unexpected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to China, since Tokyo believed that a rift was widening between Beijing and Pyongyang over the latter's rapprochement with Moscow in recent years. Also, the Japanese MFA stressed it would monitor how the situation develops and how it may impact the international community.

A military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War was held today on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Alongside Xi Jinping, Putin and Kim Jong Un, the heads of state and government from 24 other countries attended the event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This old Soviet joke, born in the 1980s, captured the absurdity of that final Cold War decade: endless ideological cannon fire, nuclear arsenals on hair-trigger alert, and proxy wars fought on the margins. Across the ocean, the White House was run by a former actor, blunt and self-confident, with a taste for gallows humor. When Ronald Reagan quipped during a sound check in 1984 that he had “signed legislation outlawing Russia forever” and that “bombing begins in five minutes,” the off-air joke was truer to the spirit of the times than any prepared speech. The official Soviet slogan was “the struggle for peace.” In Russian, it carried a deliberate ambiguity – both a promise to preserve peace and an assertion of global control. By the 1980s it had lost all meaning, becoming a cliché mouthed without conviction. Yet history has a way of circling back. By the late 1980s, both superpowers were tired. Leadership changes in Moscow – above all, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise – triggered the most dramatic shift in world affairs since 1945. Their aim was to end confrontation and build a “new world order.” In reality, Washington and Moscow understood that phrase very differently. That struggle for peace was, in Western terms, a success: the military threat receded, the Cold War ended, and the United States emerged as global hegemon. Four decades later, the cycle has turned. The Alaska meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in August 2025 carried faint echoes of Reagan and Gorbachev's first encounters. Then, as now, two leaders with little mutual understanding recognized the need to keep talking. Then, as now, the personal factor mattered – the chemistry between two men who respected each other's strength. Reagan and Gorbachev were unwitting midwives of the liberal order. Now it is the United States, not Russia, that shows fatigue with a world order it once dominated. The demand for change comes above all from within America itself, just as it came from Soviet society in the 1980s. Trump consciously borrows Reagan's slogan of “peace through strength.” In English it is straightforward; in Russian the phrase can also mean “peace maintained reluctantly, against one's will.” Both shades of meaning suit Trump. He makes no secret of his obsession with winning the Nobel Peace Prize, a vanity project that nevertheless reflects a real instinct: his method of diplomacy is raw pressure, even threats, until a deal is struck. Trump's ambition is to roll globalization back and replace it with what he sees as a stronger America – not isolationist, but a magnet pulling in advantage from all directions. To achieve that, he too needs a world order – different from Reagan's, but just as central to his sense of national interest. Where Trump sees America first, Putin sees the necessity of reshaping the global order itself – of ending the period of US dominance and forcing a multipolar settlement. To him, the issue of world order is not cosmetic but existential. For years, analysts proclaimed that China would replace both as the defining rival. Yet the dialogue between Trump and Putin, however fraught, once again is setting the tone of global politics. The pace is quicker than 40 years ago. The war is not cold but hot, and there are no long pauses between meetings. Reagan closed the Cold War on Washington's terms, crowning America as sole superpower. Trump and Putin are bringing that period to an end. The unipolar era is finished, even if its defenders in Brussels or Washington cannot yet admit it. In the first, peace meant ending confrontation and disarming rivalry. In the second, peace means preventing one power from dictating terms to all others. The fight for peace, once again, risks leaving no stone standing. The Cold War ended with Reagan's victory and Gorbachev's surrender. This time there will be no surrender, only a reshaping of the stage. The United States is still strong, but it is no longer willing or able to bear the costs of global hegemony. Other powers – Russia, China, and others – are strong enough to insist on their place. The struggle for peace is back, and like its predecessor it will define an era. But this time the script is different: it will not end with one side dictating terms, but with a new balance hammered out by force and necessity. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's parliament passed in the first reading on Sept. 3 a draft law to legalize the country's virtual assets market and set out rules for taxation, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. Despite its popularity, the market remains largely unregulated, with billions of dollars in annual transactions going untaxed. The bill defines virtual assets as digital property that exists through blockchain technology. In the first year after the law comes into effect, withdrawals converted into traditional currency would be taxed at a preferential 5% rate. Zhelezniak said further amendments will be introduced before the bill's second reading. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. It's Zelensky's eighth visit to Paris since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. "We will put more there if they want," U.S. President Donald Trump said during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that tighter sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to shift toward a diplomatic solution to end the war. "If Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow," Vladimir Putin told journalists during his briefing in Beijing. The offer may also be made available to those already serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said. The statement came in apparent reaction to an investigation published by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who claimed that at least Hr 200 million (nearly $5 million) were embezzled in last year's fortification contracts. Russia's male life expectancy is just 67 years, while most of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle is of similar age.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DARIA KALENIUK is Executive Director of the Anticorruption Action Center, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization, and Co-Founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory. OLENA HALUSHKA is a Board Member at the Anticorruption Action Center and Co-Founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory. It is why he avoided making unacceptable concessions to U.S. President Donald Trump in his latest visit to the White House. Defending against Russia's unlawful aggression is not the only way that Ukrainians fight for their future. Lately, Ukraine's people have also had to pressure their government in matters of domestic politics. During two whirlwind weeks in July, Zelensky's administration moved to strip two of the country's key anticorruption institutions, the National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), of their independence. On July 21, security services and the office of the prosecutor general conducted searches, all without court warrants, of more than 50 sites linked to NABU investigators, claiming these raids were “an operation to neutralize Russian influence in the agency,” but they presented little evidence of such influence to the public afterward. The next day, parliament adopted a law, which Zelensky immediately signed, granting the country's politically appointed prosecutor general control over all NABU investigations—an authority that had been turned over to the independent SAPO in 2016. In effect, the moves set back Ukraine's anticorruption reforms by a decade. They perceived Zelensky's swift attack on these institutions as an assault on the country's anticorruption project and on the EU accession process, in which the formation of NABU and SAPO are important steps. Their message was clear: Ukrainians would not allow backsliding on democratic, transparent governance, even—or especially—amid a brutal war. Authority was restored to NABU and SAPO by the end of July. Protracted war makes Ukrainian democracy vulnerable, but the public's democratic instincts are deeply embedded. They understand that fighting off corruption is essential to ensuring Ukraine's independent future. In addition to weakening Ukrainian democracy from within, corruption drains the Ukrainian armed forces of resources and presents Russia with ways to meddle in the country's internal politics. Russia cannot conquer Ukraine militarily, so it is placing its hope in an eventual political victory in which a fragmented Ukrainian society cannot resist when future Moscow-aligned politicians attempt to gain power. Only by fortifying its own democratic institutions can Ukraine deny Russia the control it seeks. Such reforms block channels for Russian influence and keep Ukraine on the path to integration into the European Union and NATO—memberships that will be Ukraine's only credible security guarantee. Years of polling data show that the fight against corruption has consistently been among Ukrainians' top priorities, and Zelensky's anticorruption pledges played a large part in winning him the presidency in 2019. The country succeeded in translating public opinion into policy thanks to a combination of internal and external pressures, known as the “sandwich approach.” On one side, Ukrainian civil society relentlessly advocated for reforms and monitored their implementation. Together, they empowered reformers within the government to overcome bureaucratic inertia and resistance from entrenched interests to effect meaningful change. Since 2014, Ukraine built a comprehensive anticorruption infrastructure that few other emerging democracies can match. The United States, the United Kingdom, the EU, and EU member states such as Denmark shared best practices, provided technical assistance and training for institutional capacity building, and sent rule-of-law experts to participate in panels that assessed candidates for top posts and submitted shortlists for government approval. Public procurement processes also moved online, ensuring transparency and access to records. Those agencies were fully controlled by the president, and they used their authority primarily to charge local village council heads with corruption or to go after the president's political enemies. When Yanukovych was ousted, no existing institution had the capacity and will to investigate high-level corruption within his circle. But after SAPO became fully operational in 2016, Ukraine's anticorruption machinery came to life. Between then and today, 71 members of parliament have been served with corruption-related criminal charges—including legislators belonging to the ruling parties during Zelensky's presidency and that of his predecessor, President Petro Poroshenko. Many of them were caught red-handed accepting bribes and sentenced to prison. NABU and SAPO have launched joint investigations with foreign law enforcement, too, giving them new tools to use in the fight against corruption—including the ability to freeze international assets. Proving their independence and resolve, NABU and SAPO have gone after some of the most powerful individuals in Ukraine, even after the full-scale Russian invasion began. The subjects of their investigations have included the former head of the Supreme Court, Vsevolod Kniazev, who was caught taking a bribe worth $2.7 million; the current head of Ukraine's antitrust agency, Pavlo Kyrylenko, who was charged with illicit enrichment and failure to declare his assets; and oligarchic networks connected to PrivatBank, whose former owners were found by a British court to have stolen nearly $2 billion before the bank was nationalized in 2016. After the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine's external partners let up on their anticorruption demands, worried about weakening the country during wartime. They successfully pushed for several notable changes over the past few years. Earlier that year, a journalistic investigation that revealed the defense ministry was purchasing food for the army at inflated prices compelled the parliament to pass a law to ensure transparency in nonlethal defense procurements. Those efforts culminated in June and July, when the anticorruption agencies announced criminal charges against former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, searched the German home of former Deputy Head of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma, and started looking into Zelensky's former business partner and close associate Timur Mindich. Shabunin was charged with allegedly evading military service, even though he had voluntarily enlisted in the military in the early days of the full-scale war and between September 2022 and February 2023 had carried out a commander's order assigning him to work at the National Agency for Corruption Prevention, a government institution. But Zelensky's inner circle failed to foresee that thousands of young Ukrainians, not just NGOs, deeply care about good governance, democratic procedures, and independent state institutions. Following the public outcry, EU leaders started issuing statements warning that the new law curtailing NABU's authority would jeopardize Ukraine's EU accession. As a result, the president had no choice but to retreat. Yet the attacks on NABU and SAPO have not stopped entirely. The NABU investigator Ruslan Magamedrasulov, along with his father, was held in pretrial detention on unsubstantiated charges of conspiring to do business with Russia. During an August 1 press conference with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin disparaged Ukraine's anticorruption institutions as having “zero efficiency.” This wasn't the only time these agencies have been in Putin's sights; he first mentioned them publicly days before launching the full-scale invasion in 2022. He is fixated on these agencies for a reason. Strong, independent institutions are a serious obstacle to Russia's imperial ambition to subjugate Ukraine, because they close the channels through which Moscow has historically projected influence and attempted to weaken its neighbor from within. By ensuring accountability and transparency, Ukraine reduces the vulnerabilities that Russia could exploit. Fighting corruption is thus a vital part of the wider war. They know that corruption is a threat to national security. It leaves the country more exposed to Russian influence. Anticorruption efforts have already delivered hard cash for Ukraine's defense. The agencies' work to ensure accountability in weapons procurement has borne fruit, too. In early August, for example, NABU and SAPO exposed a criminal group of political, military, and business figures that had misappropriated funds allocated by local authorities for the purchase of drones and electronic warfare systems. But Ukrainians cannot contain corruption on their own. Kyiv, of course, primarily needs modern weapons, delivered in the quantities necessary to win; investment in the domestic defense industry, to ensure sustainable military capacity; and stronger sanctions to crush Russia's war machine, not just contain it. As part of the EU accession process, which links progress to specific reforms, they should push Ukraine to uphold and protect judicial reforms and anticorruption infrastructure. These bodies are essential to maintaining checks and balances, especially in wartime. They have shown that even an enemy as large and menacing as Russia can be deterred, that governance reforms can move forward during wartime, and that a committed public can encourage leaders to stand their ground on the world stage while also keeping them accountable for malpractice at home. If Ukraine's partners want to see the country prevail, they must insist on the high standards of governance and accountability that Ukrainian society itself demands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We are preparing important bilateral decisions that will strengthen the defense capabilities of our countries," Shmyhal wrote. According to Ukraine's defense chief, Healey's trip is focused on coordinating priorities for the upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in the Ramstein format, scheduled for Sept. 9 in London, and on advancing joint defense projects. The Ramstein summit will bring together Ukraine's allies to discuss further military support, though the agenda has not yet been disclosed. The U.K. is expected to play a key role in shaping new security guarantees for Ukraine as Western leaders weigh frameworks for a potential ceasefire and longer-term defense commitments. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that tighter sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to shift toward a diplomatic solution to end the war. "If Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow," Vladimir Putin told journalists during his briefing in Beijing. The offer may also be made available to those already serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said. The statement came in apparent reaction to an investigation published by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who claimed that at least Hr 200 million (nearly $5 million) were embezzled in last year's fortification contracts. Russia's male life expectancy is just 67 years, while most of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle is of similar age. Russia launched a wave of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight on Sept. 3, killing at least one person and injuring five, officials reported. According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 502 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with 16 Kalibr and eight Kh-101 cruise missiles overnight. "I would like to note that your warriors fought bravely and displayed heroism. We will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and the families of your servicemen," Putin told Kim Jong Un during a bilateral meeting in Beijing. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Denmark on Sept. 3 to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and take part in the Nordic-Baltic Eight summit.</p>

Training sessions for registered volunteers have entered the final stretch, while municipalities hosting training camps for overseas teams are preparing to give incoming athletes a warm welcome. “It's a long-awaited event and many spectators will be there,” said Nobuyuki Taguchi, a 46-year-old company employee from Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture. He made the cut with a one-in-three chance of being accepted. His job is to check tickets at the gates. He created his own list of potential questions and answers to be ready to cope with various inquiries from spectators and gathered information about participating athletes online. His first volunteer experience was at the Tokyo Olympics, where he was assigned to be a guide at the beach volleyball venue. He was looking forward to interacting with visitors from Japan and abroad. However, the Games ended up being spectator-free due to the pandemic, and Taguchi's duty was changed to guide athletes. While he cherished the memories of being thanked by the athletes, Taguchi regretted not being able to connect with spectators. “I want to hear lots of ‘thank yous,'” he said. About 3,400 volunteers signed up for the volunteer program, according to a local organizing committee. The volunteers received training on basic things, such as the event schedule, and then moved on to specific duties from Aug. 25. Many had previously volunteered at the Tokyo Games, like Taguchi. Meanwhile, local governments hosting training camps for national teams are also looking forward to interacting with the athletes. Training locations were decided through direct negotiations between national teams and local governments hosting them. One such case is Gifu Prefecture, which will host Canada's training camp. The aim this time, however, is to “create many opportunities for direct interactions,” a prefectural government official said. A welcoming reception for the Canadian team is scheduled for Sunday, and the team's coaches will instruct students from athletics clubs at local junior high and high schools on Tuesday. They are practicing under the instruction of a professional vocalist who has sung national anthems at international competitions. Misato, Saitama Prefecture, will host the Greek team. The municipality launched a crowdfunding campaign in May to cover the costs of renting training equipment for the athletes and exchange events, raising about ¥4.8 million, close to its target, in three months. “We hope it will be a good opportunity for children to discover their dreams or goals,” a city official said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. What little opportunity still exists for realizing progress toward a durable agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians—one that would serve both parties' interests—is fast fading. Political and physical barriers to compromise will soon pass a tipping point. The country has never been in a better position to address the strategic challenge posed by Palestinian nationalism, which will require a response with political as well as military dimensions. Although Israel has a friend in the White House who is prepared to back it in important ways, long-term U.S. and European support for Israel is not guaranteed, especially if even more Americans and Europeans come to view it as a pariah state denying rights to others. It will either need to make a sincere bid for compromise and peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians or risk losing the international support that its long-term well-being requires. That having a state of their own would be good for the Palestinians goes without saying. But it would also be good for Israel; indeed, helping to bring about a Palestinian state has the potential to serve Israel just as much as it would serve others. Hamas's opposition to peace was and is more fundamental, because it would require acceptance of the Jewish state as a permanent part of the region. More than five million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza continue to live under Israel's control rather their own. And it has become far more difficult to reach a diplomatic outcome comparable to what the Palestinian leadership rejected in the past. There are now many more obstacles to peace—in particular the some 140 Israeli government–authorized settlements in the West Bank (and another 200 unauthorized outposts) that are home to more than 500,000 Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, which relies on the support of what can be described as far-right religious nationalists, has both reflected and accelerated this shift. Many Israelis and their supporters around the world—even those angry with Netanyahu's conduct in the war and with what many see as an assault on Israeli democracy—now strongly oppose a Palestinian state, fearing that it would become a base from which armed factions would mount operations. Some argue that a two-state solution would whet rather than satisfy Palestinian political ambitions. Others oppose a Palestinian state not just for these reasons but also because they eye Gaza and the West Bank for Jewish settlement. And for understandable reasons: at best, it is on life support. Still, a two-state solution is not yet dead and buried. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians would be better off with a viable, independent, sovereign state inhabited by Palestinians and run by them—but one premised on conditions that would preclude it from posing a security threat to Israel. A Palestinian state, rather than providing a base for terror, would be more likely to reduce it in ways that the Israel Defense Forces cannot. That is because terrorists can now act with near impunity, as they are not responsible for any territory or economy and have no citizens to answer to. By contrast, the government of a Palestinian state would face the military and economic consequences of any attacks it authorized on Israel, which would be acts of war rather than terrorism, and of unauthorized attacks that occurred from within its borders, which a sovereign government is expected to prevent. This reality should motivate a responsible government—one not run by Hamas—to act in constructive ways while providing Israel recourse if Palestinian leaders proved unable or unwilling to meet their international obligations. Israel enjoyed international support for such recourse in the immediate aftermath of October 7. Arab states could comfortably sell normalized relations with Israel to their citizens if they could point to a path for Palestinian statehood. Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has made clear that it is Israel's unwillingness to restart diplomacy predicated on the prospect of a two-state outcome that holds him back from pursuing closer ties with Israel. Similarly, a Palestinian state would enhance the stability of Israel's neighbors, above all Jordan, because satisfying the call for such an entity would relieve pressure on the Jordanian monarchy, which has long been willing to live in peace with Israel but would face domestic instability were an influx of Palestinians to enter the country and upset its demographic and political balance. Reducing the salience of the Palestinian issue would also allow Israel's national security establishment to focus on other pressing threats, above all those posed by Iran. A separate Palestinian state would also be good for Israel's identity and internal cohesion. There are some two million Arab citizens of Israel, some of whom could be radicalized if Israel continues to frustrate Palestinian political ambitions and treat Palestinians so harshly. Even more fundamentally, a Palestinian state would free Israel from having to choose between being a democracy and being a Jewish state: granting five million Palestinians equal rights would threaten the latter, while denying them such rights would threaten the former. It would reduce the threat of economic sanctions from Europe and stem the growing alienation of many Americans, including younger American Jews—a trend that over time could even jeopardize U.S. military support for Israel. Israeli openness on this matter might also reduce anti-Semitism globally. Last but most pressing, support in principle for a Palestinian state would offer Israel a pathway out of Gaza and to getting the remaining hostages back. As the British learned in Northern Ireland, radical groups cannot be defeated with military force alone. They must also be marginalized politically, by making available a diplomatic path that offers more promise than continued violence. The immediate diplomatic focus, therefore, should be modest, given political realities both in Israel and among Palestinians. For those who still favor a two-state solution, the objective for the immediate future should be to preserve the possibility of more ambitious diplomacy and create conditions that would give such diplomacy a chance of one day succeeding. Regarding the former, governments ought to eschew calling for Palestinian self-determination. A Palestinian state must be created in tandem with Israel. There is too much history and not enough territory to do it any other way. Another form of unilateralism to be avoided is the declaration from concerned outsiders—namely Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom—of their intention to recognize a Palestinian state this fall if there is no cease-fire in Gaza. Although these powers view their actions as helpful, in practice they are anything but. The Israelis and the Palestinians must reach an accommodation, and Palestinians must internalize that a state of their own, if Israel is to allow it, cannot be delivered by others without compromise on their part. Here, the onus falls on the United States, because politics in Israel—born of governing coalitions, demographic changes, and reactions to events such as October 7—have developed in such a way that Israel, left to its own devices, will not exercise restraint. What would add teeth to such a stance (something this and previous U.S. administrations have largely resisted doing) would be a message from Washington that, going forward, Israel will not be able to count on the United States to use its veto in the UN Security Council to protect Israel from all economic and diplomatic sanctions if it ignores U.S. preferences. Washington could also impose higher tariffs on Israel if it continues to undermine what limited prospects remain for a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, the United States, European countries, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab governments should press not just for an end to the war in Gaza and for the replacement of Israeli occupation forces with an Arab and Palestinian stabilization force; those governments should also put forward a public vision for a larger diplomatic process. What would be required here is nothing less than a long-term commitment to nation building—or, more precisely, state building. Ideally, this would encourage the emergence of a more moderate Palestinian leadership willing to speak and act in ways that reassured a majority of Israelis, which in turn might encourage the emergence of a more moderate Israeli leadership. What comes to mind is the impact of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's outreach to Israelis just four years after Egypt attacked Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, which persuaded Israelis that they had a partner whose cooperation would justify the evacuation of settlements and the return of territory that Israel had gained in 1967. The precise terms of a Palestinian state would be addressed and negotiated further down the road by a new generation of Israeli and Palestinian leaders. It is impossible to describe a path such as the one outlined above with optimism, given where the parties involved are now and how they got there. One is U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees himself as a peacemaker and who finds himself in a position to be one here. Trump is popular in Israel, and he has the support of many American Jews who define themselves as staunchly pro-Israel. In some respects, Trump's position calls to mind that of U.S. President Richard Nixon. Much the same holds for Trump when it comes to Israel. And no Democrat is likely to make hay with the argument that Trump would be selling out Israel by pressuring it—because so many in the Democratic Party want him to do just that. Several governments have already done so, and Saudi Arabia is prepared to move forward. Then there is the New York Declaration—the result of a UN conference chaired by Saudi Arabia and France on the two-state solution in late July—which among other things includes a call for Hamas to end its rule in Gaza and to hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. Finally, there is the fluid political situation in Israel. Most important, it will require that the Palestinians demonstrate in word and action that they are prepared to live in peace with Israel. It is, of course, possible that Israel will not have a diplomatic partner in the Palestinians, who are deeply divided politically. To be sure, Israel would still have to contend with the many internal consequences associated with having more than five million Palestinians living under its control. It would also have to approach Palestinians in a far more humane and responsible way than it has recently in both Gaza and the West Bank. But it would be in an improved situation all the same. Whatever its risks and shortcomings, a two-state solution would leave Israel better off than the alternatives. Israel would forever face terrorism from a people who felt they had nothing to lose. A one-state solution, in which Palestinians became Israeli citizens, would threaten Israel's Jewishness, democratic rule, or both. Abba Eban, Israel's erudite foreign minister at the time of the country's 1967 and 1973 conflicts with its Arab neighbors, once famously said that when it comes to making peace, the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. But today the dictum applies to Israel, as well. Never in the country's history has Israel been more secure from external threat. Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest Arab country, and one that enjoys a unique status in the Islamic world, has signaled its readiness to normalize ties if Israel demonstrates a willingness to address Palestinian national demands under reasonable conditions. And Israel has a staunch friend in the White House. The United States should make good on its legacy of being Israel's closest friend. Policymakers and American citizens should consider that what is deemed today to constitute a pro-Israel stance could well be judged differently by history.
