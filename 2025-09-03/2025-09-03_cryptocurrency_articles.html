                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With bitcoin BTC$112,205.65 stuck just above $110,000 and ether (ETH) consolidating after hitting fresh records, Solana SOL$209.69 has emerged as a standout performer in the crypto market recently. Such flows could be long-term as corporate investors look for large, liquid projects to hold, Gorev added, naming SOL alongside with XRP XRP$2.8584 as the "next interesting market ideas." Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, tipped SOL to replicate ether's turnaround earlier this year. He pointed to Ethereum's resurgence after stablecoin adoption, strong ETF inflows and the relentless bid from digital asset treasuries, or DATs, helped ETH rally nearly 200% since April. The first U.S.-listed Solana ETF launched in July, but it was futures-based. Several asset managers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have filed for spot products with decisions due later this year, Dorman said. Meanwhile, at least three Solana-focused DATs are raising funds that could channel up to $2.65 billion into SOL over the next month, he added. At only one-fifth of ETH's market capitalization, SOL's price could be even more reactive to the flows if they materialize. "SOL might be the most obvious long right now," Dorman said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trimont LLC, a heavyweight in commercial real estate servicing with $730 billion in managed loans, has started using JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) Kinexys blockchain network to process payments in minutesrather than the typical two-day turnaround. The milestone came in August, marking Trimont's first use of Kinexys, and CEO Bill Sexton says broader rollout is already underway. The system automatically identifies incoming payments, checks for sufficiency, and disburses funds to lendersno more manual chasing, no more delays. Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. That may sound like operational plumbing, but in fixed-income and real estate finance, time is cash. Kinexyswhich launched in 2019 and currently handles $3 billion in daily volumesis still tiny compared to JPMorgan's $10 trillion payments footprint, but it's gaining traction as programmable money becomes more than just whiteboard theory. JPMorgan enabled smart-condition payments in 2023, allowing real-world transactions to execute even outside banking hours. Programmable payments are one of the innovations that blockchain and digital currencies bring to the digitization of money, said Kinexys co-head Naveen Mallela. Trimont's move may be the early innings of something bigger: large-scale money flows shifting to blockchain rails, not because of crypto hype, but because the infrastructure finally works. For investors watching the intersection of real estate, enterprise software, and digital financethis could be a tipping point worth circling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin bulls are trying to get back into the driver's seat by pushing the price above $112,500. Bitcoin made a strong comeback, confirming that dip buyers were present at lower levels; higher levels could continue to attract sellers. Select altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, indicating a positive sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $112,500 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls are trying to extend the recovery. The relief rally attracted buying in spot BTC exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, which recorded $332.7 million in net inflows, according to SoSoValue data. A positive sign for the crypto bulls is that gold (XAU) made a new high above $3,500 (per ounce) on Tuesday. History shows that BTC follows gold with a lag. BTC's median rise following gold's new all-time high is 30% at three months, and 225% at 12 months. If history repeats, BTC could rally to the $135,000 to $145,000 zone by early December. However, September's weak seasonality is a risk for the bulls in the near term. Network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that BTC plunges 100% of the time between Sept. 16 and Sept. 23, with a typical decline of 5%. What are the critical resistance levels to watch out for in BTC and the major altcoins? BTC rose back above the breakdown level of $110,530 on Tuesday, indicating solid demand at lower levels. Such a move suggests that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may then attempt a rally toward $124,474. If bears want to retain the advantage, they will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA and swiftly pull the Bitcoin price below $107,255. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,500 and, after that, to $4,664. Sellers will try to defend the zone between $4,664 and $4,956 because a break above it could resume the uptrend toward the next target objective of $5,662. The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($2.93), which is sloping down. The XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a break and close below $2.73. That could start a downward move to $2.20. The XRP price may then rally toward $3.40, signaling that the pair may remain stuck between $2.73 and $3.66 for a while. If the price turns up and breaks above $869, it suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. Solana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($197) on Tuesday, signaling that the positive sentiment remains intact. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $218 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.21 support but are struggling to push the price above the moving averages. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could slump to $0.19 and then to $0.16. That suggests the Dogecoin price may oscillate inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days. Cardano (ADA) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern for a few days, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies. Sellers are expected to mount a vigorous defense at the downtrend line, but if the bulls prevail, the Cardano price could rise to $0.96 and later to $1.02. That is a critical level for the bulls to defend because a break below the channel may sink the price to $0.68. Related: Classic XRP price chart pattern targets $5 as spot ETF reality draws closer If they manage to do that, the pair could march toward $26 and then $27. Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned up from the uptrend line on Tuesday, but the bears are likely to sell at higher levels. A break and close below the uptrend line invalidates the bullish ascending triangle pattern. That may pull the Hyperliquid price to $40 and subsequently to the solid support at $35.51. Contrary to this assumption, if the price maintains above $45.50, it suggests that the bulls are buying on dips. This is a crucial level to watch out for because a close above $49.88 opens the gates for a rally to the pattern target of $64.25. The SUI/USDT pair could then plummet to $2.80.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dominance has retreated from its 62% peak to 55%, marking one of our favorite metrics for gauging market rotation dynamics and suggesting early signs of capital flowing into alts. Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin's market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap, serving as a key indicator of whether investors are favoring Bitcoin's "safe haven" status or seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. This 700 basis point decline from the cycle peak is an encouraging setup for altcoins heading into the fourth quarter, with Ethereum and Solana showing early signs of renewed interest as institutional and retail capital begin to rotate into alternative assets. Digital asset treasures (DATs) are headlining this push for Solana and Ethereum with multiple teams working to raise capital and buy up assets through a publicly traded entity. From the 2021/2022 cycle, Bitcoin dominance fell below 40%, suggesting there is significant runway for altcoin rallies if market conditions continue to favor risk assets. The current 55% level positions the market in a transitional phase where altcoins can begin establishing momentum without requiring extreme speculative fervor. However, a critical factor to monitor will be whether altcoins can capture genuine spot market demand, rather than primarily benefiting from derivatives-driven momentum. With substantial institutional capital potentially flowing into digital asset treasuries and ETF products, the question remains whether this buying power will translate into direct token purchases that drive sustainable price appreciation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (“GENIUS”) Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. That same push is showing up in the patent world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles. Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain patents. The claims at issue relate to “securely storing data across a network in a multi-dimensional distributed database” in order to “process[] license contracts, including computing proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian addresses.” In the Examiner's view, the invention simply used “a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea.” The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging that the claims involved an abstract idea because “[i]t is well settled that commercial interactions involving payment transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human activity.” Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based on 35 U.S.C. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader emerging technology space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turkey's central bank has issued a ‘call for participation' for companies in the finance and technology sectors to ‘enrich' its ongoing explorations into the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The central bank is welcoming project applications across five areas of interest: tokenisation, programmable payments, user-sovereign identity (also known as self-sovereign identity), interoperability with existing systems, and ‘machine-to-machine payment scenarios.' Project applications can be submitted under one or more of the categories. Organisations can apply with a maximum of three projects. RELATED ARTICLE Turkish central bank progresses ‘digital lira' tests – a news story (10 January 2023) on a previous milestone on the central bank's CBDC journey – see below The TCMB is already relatively well progressed in its CBDC explorations – which it refers to as the ‘Digital Turkish Lira Project'. The Digital Turkish Lira Project's first phase focused on retail payments. Pilot tests continued in 2023 and a 63-page ‘Digital Turkish Lira First Phase Evaluation Report' was published (Turkish language – a 64-page English-language version was subsequently published). The second phase is now ongoing is focused on ‘develop[ing] projects encompassing new use cases, in addition to ongoing studies in technology, economics and law, and to enrich the Digital Turkish Lira Project ecosystem with additional participation.' The central bank says it wants companies ‘to develop exemplary scenarios based on the categories and criteria outlined in the Call document, develop innovative projects based on these scenarios, and collaborate on them.' At a global level, CBDCs increasingly seem to be in the shadow of an alternative, and increasingly popular, type of digital currency – stablecoins, which are issued by private companies (that said, the US state of Wyoming last month made government fintech history by issuing the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US). A Bank for International Settlements (BIS)'s survey about central banks' CBDC activities during 2024 (published last month – August 2025) found that, of 93 central banks surveyed, 85 were exploring either a retail CBDC (for general population use), a wholesale CBDC (for interbank use) or both. But none of the few CBDCs currently ‘live' globally are proving popular. A 2023 Presidential Annual Programme (Turkish language), published by the Presidency Strategy and Budget directorate in October 2022, included mention of CBDC. It stated that integration of a CBDC with ‘identity' and central bank-operated instant payment system FAST ‘within the scope of research and development studies will be completed'. The country has a population of about 85.5 million people.</p>

L'azienda punta inoltre a generare ricavi aggiuntivi tramite la gestione del tesoro crypto, distribuendo i profitti tra azionisti e detentori degli NFT. Vaycaychella (OTC:VAYK) ha anunciado la reactivación de su estrategia cripto para monetizar inmuebles históricos valorados en $10-20 millones mediante NFT y la gestión de un tesoro en criptomonedas. La compañía planea renovar propiedades históricas para alquileres de corta duración y tokenizar su valor cultural. La empresa también busca generar ingresos adicionales a través de la gestión del tesoro cripto, repartiendo las ganancias entre accionistas y poseedores de NFT. Vaycaychella (OTC:VAYK)는 NFT와 암호화폐 자금 관리로 1,000만~2,000만 달러 규모의 역사적 랜드마크를 수익화하는 암호화 전략을 재개한다고 발표했습니다. 회사는 역사적 건물을 단기 임대용으로 리노베이션하고 그 문화적 가치를 토큰화할 계획입니다. 첫 번째 프로젝트는 애틀랜타에 있는 Rufus Rose House로, 감정가가 $250만입니다. VAYK의 NFT 전략은 리노베이션의 독점 시각 자료로 뒷받침되는 토큰과 1박 무료 숙박을 제공하는 것을 포함합니다. Vaycaychella (OTC:VAYK) a annoncé la relance de sa stratégie crypto visant à monétiser des sites historiques évalués entre 10 et 20 millions de dollars via des NFT et la gestion d'une trésorerie crypto. L'entreprise vise également à générer des revenus supplémentaires grâce à la gestion de la trésorerie crypto, en partageant les bénéfices entre actionnaires et détenteurs de NFT. Vaycaychella (OTC:VAYK) hat die Wiederaufnahme seiner Kryptowährungsstrategie angekündigt, mit der historische Immobilien im Wert von $10–20 Millionen durch NFTs und Krypto-Treasury-Management monetarisiert werden sollen. This strategy is part of the company's comprehensive business plan to offer a one-stop service solution for the $64 billion short-term rental industry. "We have always been pioneers in exploring the potential of applying cryptocurrency strategies to daily business operations," stated Jason Armstrong, CEO of Vaycaychella. "In March 2022, the previous management acquired Definancial, Inc., a technology firm developing cryptocurrency exchange solutions. After the new management team took over in 2024, we planned to release crypto-based Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on our newly acquired rights to a $2.5 million property, which is a nationally registered historic landmark. However, the NFT market was at a low point, and we had to postpone our cryptocurrency business." "Now is the time to launch it," declared Armstrong. The concept is to leverage the unique and fungible cultural value of historic landmark buildings while renovating these buildings into boutique short-term rentals (such as Airbnb). The company will sell NFT tokens, each minted using unique visual records of the renovation process of the historic landmarks, with a bonus feature of a one-night free stay at these buildings after they are renovated into Airbnb properties. Once monetized, they will not only benefit the NFT holders but also may generate significant revenue for current shareholders." Armstrong projected that the NFT and its linked crypto treasury account would become operational in a few months. To create a free account, please fill out the form below.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The crypto markets are booming, but the most recent wave of enthusiasm isn't just from small-time traders or dabblers curious about memecoins. Longtime crypto venture capitalists Electric Capital and Paradigm led the fundraising round. Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of Ethereum, and the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to developing the protocol, also helped fund Etherealize with an initial grant. As the Trump administration ushers in a new era of pro-crypto regulation, traditional financial institutions have started to more publicly explore blockchain technology. Big banks are considering launching their own stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. And asset managers are putting financial products on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. The Etherealize CEO isn't speaking just as a crypto booster—but as a veteran of traditional finance who's spent years at Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. “There aren't institutional builders that are willing to go through and walk through all of their processes and pain points,” he said. In August 2024, Raman received a grant from Ethereum cofounder Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation to talk with a swath of Wall Street executives about if and how financial institutions wanted to use Ethereum. “We were going in, making sure the market wanted Ethereum.” “The regulatory pendulum can only swing so far,” Ryan said. In other words, he anticipates that the permissive regulatory regime under Trump will eventually subside. Instead of just advocating for Ethereum, they're building out products and infrastructure that financial institutions can use to streamline what Raman calls “Stone Age technology.” While the Etherealize CEO declined to give specifics, he said they were focused on tokenizing, or putting in blockchain wrappers for, financial assets like mortgages, credit, and other fixed-income products—among other projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Galaxy Digital has started offering investors the option to tokenize their stock. The crypto-finance and data center company said investors can tokenize their shares through Superstate, a fintech startup in its venture portfolio. This process allows shares to be legally represented on-chain while still carrying the same rights and protections as traditional stock. The company's leadership said they want to do more than just talk about blockchain's potential. Instead, they are actively moving stock trading onto blockchain rails. Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research, said the company wants to push things forward rather than wait for regulators to give them a green light. These benefits include 24-hour trading, faster settlement, and the ability to use peer-to-peer transactions. Tokenization has been discussed for years, but many firms held back due to unclear rules. The biggest roadblock is Automated Market Makers, which are blockchain-based trading engines. Regulators have not yet set rules for how these can operate with securities. As a result, Galaxy's tokenized shares can be traded directly between investors but cannot yet be bought and sold on demand in a fully open market. Other companies have experimented with tokenized assets, but most used synthetic derivatives rather than real shares. Robinhood (HOOD) introduced U.S. stock tokens in Europe, and Kraken added tokenized trading on Ethereum. It gives holders direct ownership rights, making the tokens legally equal to their regular stock. Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said this step is a milestone that the entire industry can learn from. Galaxy Digital stock (TSE:GLXY) carries a Strong Buy consensus, based on 11 Wall Street analyst ratings over the past three months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Ripple's $1.3 trillion ODL network and SEC victory paved the way for the first XRP ETF, unlocking $8 billion in institutional capital and CBDC partnerships. - Experts recommend dollar-cost averaging and legal safeguards for XRP investors, emphasizing its dual utility as a stable infrastructure asset and high-risk/high-reward play. In 2025, XRP has emerged as a linchpin in the evolution of global digital finance, driven by Ripple's infrastructure dominance, regulatory breakthroughs, and strategic CBDC partnerships. As central banks and institutions accelerate their transition to tokenized assets, XRP's role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance is becoming increasingly critical. This analysis explores how XRP's unique positioning—coupled with expert investment strategies—positions it as a cornerstone for long-term wealth creation in the next phase of digital finance. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service has processed $1.3 trillion in cross-border payments through 300+ institutional partners in 2025, leveraging XRP's 3–5 second settlement times and near-zero fees to outperform legacy systems like SWIFT [1]. The ETF's anticipated launch is projected to unlock $8 billion in institutional capital inflows, further solidifying XRP's role in global financial infrastructure. Ripple's adaptability is also evident in its CBDC-related initiatives. SWIFT's Q3 2025 interoperability tests with the XRP Ledger demonstrated its potential as a complementary layer for tokenized assets, including U.S. Treasuries and gold [1]. Meanwhile, partnerships with the Republic of Palau and Bhutan to pilot digital currency projects highlight XRP's growing appeal as a scalable, energy-efficient solution for cross-border interoperability [3]. With over 100 countries exploring CBDCs, Ripple's technology is uniquely positioned to address the scalability and efficiency challenges of the next-generation financial system. While competitors like Google Cloud's Universal Ledger (GCUL) focus on permissioned enterprise integration, XRP's decentralized model and established network of partnerships offer broader institutional appeal [1]. GCUL's closed architecture, though tailored for corporate clients, lacks the open protocol flexibility that enables XRP to serve as a universal bridge for both fiat and tokenized assets. Ripple's expansion into stablecoins, tokenized securities, and RWA platforms further cements its role in the evolving digital finance ecosystem [1]. Retail investor sentiment for XRP in 2025 is cautiously optimistic, with the token trading around $2.77 as of September 2025. DeepSeek AI's projection of a $5 target by late 2025 adds to the bullish narrative, driven by XRP's breakout from a five-month consolidation pattern [3]. Historical market cycles also suggest a potential rally in October 2025, aligning with seasonal trends and regulatory momentum [4]. Experts emphasize proactive wealth protection and strategic planning for XRP investors. Jake Claver, a crypto adviser for ultra-wealthy clients, recommends establishing legal, tax, and security structures before profits materialize. For retail investors, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) remains a core strategy to mitigate XRP's price swings. XRP's strategic positioning in the global CBDC ecosystem—bolstered by regulatory clarity, infrastructure dominance, and institutional adoption—makes it a compelling asset for long-term wealth creation. For investors, a balanced approach that combines technical analysis, regulatory foresight, and proactive wealth management will be key to navigating this dynamic landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roblox Lawsuit Reveals Wider Pattern of Digital Predators Grooming Kids and the Urgent Need for a Multi-Front Strategy to End It In an era where children are increasingly connected to technology, the need to protect their online safety has never been more urgent. In North Carolina, a 10-year-old girl became the victim of online exploitation through Roblox, one of the world's most popular gaming platforms. The case, now in Guilford County Superior Court, reveals a chilling reality: predators are leveraging gaming platforms, virtual currencies, and sophisticated grooming techniques to exploit children in ways that can escalate to human trafficking. It mirrors how modern offenders operate on youth-heavy platforms: establish trust, isolate by moving channels, and exploit, often with digital currency as the hook. Roblox designed its own AI-warning system, “Sentinel,” which submitted approximately 1,200 reports of potential child exploitation attempts to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the first half of 2025. Those steps matter, but at the family and school level, waiting for platforms to solve this alone leaves children exposed during the most vulnerable window: first contact to first image. Robux (or any platform currency) is potent with preteens: it feels legitimate and exciting, disguising the interaction as “play” or “trading.” That's why transaction-aware safety – flagging suspicious currency flows tied to minors and sudden new “friends” – should be a core platform signal. Litigation and Attorney General actions in multiple states underscore a broader reckoning: Another lawsuit alleging child sexploitation involving a 15-year-old boy was filed against Roblox in Clay County, Missouri. Youth-oriented platforms must be safe by default, not merely configurable with the right toggles because, too often, those toggles aren't set. Set the defaults to “safe” and keep them there We Can't Outsource Our Children's Safety School IT teams, tech companies, and legislators all matter, but none can cover the moment-to-moment interactions where most harm begins. Parents and local communities remain the first line of defense. The North Carolina case and others serve as a warning: If we wait for someone else to fix this, children will pay the price. A predictable grooming pipeline, a known leverage point (virtual currency), and identifiable signals provide us with the blueprint to prevent first contact, detect early, and respond quickly. The NCPTF is dedicated to supporting global law enforcement in cases involving missing, exploited, and trafficked children. Additionally, as a founding board member of Raven – the first and only 501(c)4 (nonprofit, social welfare) group focused on child exploitation in the United States – Metcalf has worked tirelessly to empower various agencies to safeguard children and preserve childhood. Metcalf is renowned for uniting experts across multiple disciplines – including legal strategy, open-source intelligence, geospatial analysis, and cryptocurrency – to enhance the effectiveness of global law enforcement efforts. His innovative approach has led to numerous recoveries and arrests worldwide, earning him recognition as a pioneer in integrating diverse intelligence disciplines to fight child exploitation and human trafficking. Previously, Metcalf served as Deputy Prosecuting Attorney at the Washington County Prosecutor's Office for over 13 years, where he gained extensive experience in legal prosecution and child protection. He also previously worked as a Federal Air Marshal with the Federal Air Marshal Service, contributing to national security and safety.</p>

In this analysis, CCN explains why Binance chose to delist these projects. We also examine whether the altcoins can mount a recovery, or if this decision ends their relevance in the market. The exchange confirmed that trading pairs for these tokens will be removed on Sept. 17. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Binance explained that it decided to delist them after a review showed the projects no longer meet the exchange's high standards and industry requirements. “Based on our most recent reviews, we have decided to delist and cease trading on all spot trading pairs for the following token(s) at 2025-09-17 03:00 (UTC): BakeryToken (BAKE). These declines highlight how quickly markets react when Binance pulls support for a token. But what's next for the altcoins after this unfortunate development? Built as a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain, BAKE enjoyed a strong run during the 2021 bull market, climbing to an all-time high of $8.48. Fast forward to today, and BAKE has lost 99% of its value amid fading demand. Technically, the daily chart shows a persistent downtrend since February, with the token posting lower highs and lower lows before forming a falling wedge. But in this case, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) has slipped into negative territory, pointing to stronger selling pressure. SLF is another token hit hard by Binance's delisting news. One year ago, the Self Chain token traded at an all-time high of $0.83. Today, it has collapsed by 95%, slipping to $0.040, a slight bounce from the new all-time low it touched earlier in the day. On the daily chart, SLF trades below a key resistance line. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has plunged to -0.52, signaling strong capital outflows and weak demand. At the same time, the Bollinger Bands (BB) have tightened, a sign that volatility is compressing and a big move could be imminent. The BB contraction suggests a breakout is looming. If buying pressure returns, SLF could slowly recover toward $0.19. Last on the list of altcoins caught in Binance's delisting sweep is HIFI. That doesn't necessarily mean a breakout is next. Instead, HIFI will likely consolidate between $0.074 and $0.10 in the near term. Crypto Pump.fun (PUMP) Price Rebounds 35% — Why the Decline May Have Run Its Course</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent. NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention. While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds. Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs. Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey. Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access. This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells. Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development. Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools. This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution. Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development. NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that helps businesses navigate this revolution. The evolution of NFT smart contracts shows us one thing: innovation thrives when technology meets trust. At their simplest, smart contracts are digital agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute once certain conditions are fulfilled, ensuring transparency and trust. Cryptocurrencies have evolved into more than just digital assets; they now represent innovation, decentralization, and global financial inclusion. Behind every thriving crypto business lies a structured lifecycle that transforms abstract ideas into functional, secure, and widely adopted platforms. From initial concepts to live market deployment, this lifecycle determines the credibility and success of a project. In the realm of cryptocurrency fundraising, successful projects require clear, transparent communication and a professional presentation of the project's goals, technical architecture, and value proposition. A white paper serves as the cornerstone for establishing credibility, building investor trust, and guiding decision-making. As crypto markets grow increasingly competitive, investors seek projects that showcase innovation while demonstrating meticulous planning and market understanding. White Paper Development services play a crucial role in crafting documents with precision, clarity, and persuasive impact, positioning projects for successful fundraising campaigns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is consulting on draft changes to how we handle data protection complaints. This will allow us to focus on cases where we can have the most impact and improve data protection compliance. People have a statutory right to lodge a data protection complaint with the ICO if they think there has been an infringement of their data protection rights under the UK GDPR. In 2024/25 this rose to 42,881 and current forecasts indicate that this could increase to somewhere between 45,000 and 55,000 if the current trend continues. We want to consider new ways of handling data protection complaints. The Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) places new requirements on organisations to have a complaints process specifically for data protection related issues. That means looking at our own approach to handling complaints. We are proposing changes to our processes to better support people who have experienced harm and focus our resources on those cases where we can have the biggest impact. This will allow us to identify trends or themes which may benefit from other types of regulatory action. The approach outlined in this consultation would ensure that every complaint contributes towards our understanding of an organisation's information rights practices, while allowing us to focus our resources on the most significant risks. It also strengthens our ability to identify systemic issues earlier. It reflects our ambition to be a strategic regulator – one that considers every complaint, responds proportionately and uses the insight gained to drive improvements in data protection practices. We need to do things differently and transforming our processes will enable us to target our resources to support people's information rights in a way that has a positive impact and addresses the areas that cause the greatest harm. You can respond to the consultation via our survey on Citizen Space. Section 3: Questions to assess the impact of our proposed approach. Please note that we are using the platform Citizen Space to gather this information. Please do not to share any information in your response which you would not be happy for us to make publicly available. Should we receive an FOI request for your response we will always seek to consult with you for your views on the disclosure of this information before any decision is made.

Data protection complaint handling approach – draft impact assessment About the ICO Equality Impact Assessment (Eqia) For Data Protection Transformation consultation PDF (304.07 KB) In response to the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) coming into force, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched public consultations to help shape final guidance. We have reprimanded South Yorkshire Police (SYP) after the force deleted over 96,000 pieces of body-worn video (BWV) evidence. ICO spokesperson clarifies how data protection law applies to facial recognition technology An investigator for the police complaints watchdog has pleaded guilty to unlawfully obtaining sensitive personal data. We have today published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely. We have fined Scottish charity Birthlink £18,000 after it destroyed approximately 4,800 personal records, up to ten percent of which may be irreplaceable. This year marks a significant milestone - 20 years since the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act came into force. The decision follows a hearing that took place from 19 to 21 May 2025. We are calling for views on a new enforcement approach that could unlock privacy-preserving alternatives to the dominant adtech business model.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This involved the illegal release of some 33,000 lines of gravely sensitive personal spreadsheet data which put almost 100,000 people – up to 25,000 Afghans applying for relocation to the UK as well as their family members, many of whom were also identified in the data – at grave risk of harm and may even have resulted in some of their deaths. However, despite details of this egregious and illegal exposure of data subjects being immediately required by law and subsequently coming into view, the ICO decided not to carry out any investigation and therefore not to take any enforcement action, such as issuing a fine, enforcement notice or even a mere reprimand. These failings point to the need for an in-depth independent investigation of UK data protection regulation, which should also explore the serious gap between the UK GDPR's promises and the ICO's hyper-discretionary and hyper-selective track-record and approach and what might be done to address this. What follows merely provides a partial indication of some of the particular issues which arise in relation to Afghan spreadsheet data breach itself. This post draws primarily on an ICO memorandum which seeks to summarise the ICO's involvement with the Afghan spreadsheet data breach and to provide a justification for the various decisions made between 17 August 2023 and 15 July 2025. It was entirely written after 15 July 2025 and was not able to draw on any “internal record of the ICO's actions and decision making regarding this data breach” as there is none. Moreover, no reasonable justification is provided for it even post-hoc. Similarly, although it is argued that any “written notes” would have “likely necessitated the inclusion of information which was classified as Secret or Top Secret”, its statement that this rendered the ICO “unable” to take such notes is again contradicted by its express acknowledgment that this would merely have created “additional handling difficulties”. Any such difficulties must be considered part of the ICO's normal terrain given its legal mandate to ensure independent supervision even in highly sensitive contexts, such as those involving national security, which are also precisely the contexts that often raise the most serious data protection concerns. It is also striking that the memorandum clearly reveals that these sorts of concerns did not prevent the MoD responding to enquiries on this matter to ICO email addresses. Failure to Notify within 72 Hours and Effect of Super-Injunction Three weeks passed until an (unnamed) ICO official attended an 8 September 2023 meeting where he was served with the 1 September 2023 super-injunction and, according to the memorandum, provided with “an overview of what was known by MoD at that time”. Unfortunately, it remains unclear when a full Article 33(1) notification was carried out, if at all. The ICO's lack of forensic engagement must be related to a decision made on 5 December 2023 – apparently after just one further meeting with the MoD – that it was not “in a position to independently investigate the incident”. This decision was by made by Stephen Bonner, Deputy Commissioner (Regulatory Supervision), and was briefed “at a high level” to the Information Commissioner John Edwards who apparently did not demur or seek further information. The ICO is not permitted to delegate this twin responsibility or tasks to the very controller under scrutiny as it is statutorily obliged to ensure that it “act with complete independence in performing [its] tasks” (UK GDPR, art 52). It is also “required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]) and it therefore follows that it must intervene when put on notice about a prima facie “clear breach” of data protection of a serious nature. Alongside other enforcement action, the ICO is explicitly required under Article 83 of the UK GDPR to “ensure that the imposition of administrative fines” is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” and Recital 148 authoritatively specifies that it should impose a fine on organisations (whether public or private) for any data protection breach which is not “minor”. Given the overarching requirement for “strong enforcement” (UK GDPR, Recital 7), Recital 148's interpretation is particularly imperative when other measures such as an enforcement notice is not forthcoming. Moreover, in December 2023 when handing down a £350k fine for a worryingly similar (although considerably less far-reaching) MoD data breach in 2021 (also involving Afghan relocations data), the Commissioner himself acknowledged that in relation to “breaches of data protection that are so egregious that they put people's lives at risk” it was “necessary for us at the ICO to apply the full sanctions of the law”. It is manifest, however, that the application of any, let alone full, legal sanctions is impossible if prima facie serious breaches of the law are not even subject to ICO investigation. The ICO's 5 December 2023 decision not to investigate resulted in it only taking part in meetings (including reviewing documentation) coordinated by the data controller itself and giving input at and around these. However, no evidence is provided of any such meeting taking place between 5 December 2023 and 26 June 2024. Moreover, following that latter meeting, Stephen Bonner made (but did not record) another critical decision which was that “no further action (‘NFA') was required at this time”. John Edwards was subsequently informed (although not until 19 September 2024) “at a high level” and “had no objection with the approach”. It is difficult to see how sufficient lines of inquiry could possibly have been pursued by this point to justify such an outcome and the memorandum anyway presents no evidence to suggest that this was anything other than a very serious breach which positively required action on the part of ICO. Nevertheless, approximately a third of the memorandum (pp. Some of this merely repeat claims relating to the super-injunction and the information classification which have been considered and rejected above. Thus, it claims as an argument against regulatory action that the ICO was “already investigating and taking regulatory action against the MoD for a separate data breach” which resulted in the December 2023 £350k fine. However, as explicitly specified in Article 83(2)(e) of the UKGDPR and in the ICO's own guidance, “relevant previous infringements by the controller” (or, in the Information Commissioner's words “a similar breach”) are peremptorily established as an aggravating rather than a mitigating factor for regulatory action. The memorandum also seeks to assert that the ICO had formed an understanding that the spreadsheet failure was “a one-off occurrence following a failure to following [sic] usual checks, rather than reflecting a wider culture of non-compliance”. However, this patently clashes with positive knowledge of the other egregious data breach (also involving Afghan relocation application data) and information which has subsequently become available through a freedom of information request showing there have been 49 separate data breaches at this MoD unit over the past four years including seven which were serious enough to be notified to ICO. The memorandum briefly summarises four further meetings at the MoD after 26 June 2024 involving ICO as well as related MoD-ICO interactions. It is clear from this that a range of relevant matters concerning both the breach itself and changes to data practices were discussed and explored. Nevertheless, none of this appears to have involved a forensic investigation by the ICO itself of the actual breach (including whether even the intended release – which involved the unencrypted permanent disclosure of highly sensitive personal data about 150 individuals to a number of third parties – was itself lawful). There was also no suggestion of any potential regulatory sanction for the manifest serious failures (which is unsurprising given the No Further Action decision already made) and it is clear that the MoD itself were far from always being promptly forthcoming. For example, enquiries made at the 26 June 2024 meeting remained unanswered until an email on 8 October 2024 and certain queries raised at the 6 May 2025 meeting remained unanswered until 10 July 2025 (just 5 days before the super-injunction was lifted). As a result of both its scale and acute sensitivity (which involved risks to life and perhaps even death), the MoD's Afghan spreadsheet data breach was one of the most egregious in UK history. This event also exposed acute failings in UK data protection supervision. The ICO's failure to engage in any enforcement action in response to such an egregious breach is impossible to square with its duty (which has been acknowledged by the Information Commissioner himself) “to apply the full sanctions of the law” in such cases. However, beyond even this, it is now clear that the ICO did not mount any independent investigation into this matter and that it did not maintain any contemporaneous record of its decisions. The absence of an ICO investigation and contemporaneous record-keeping is at even greater variance with its obligation to demonstrably discharge its “responsibility for ensuring that the [UK] GDPR is fully enforced for all due diligence” (at [112]). Although aberrant from the perspective of UK GDPR standards, this outcome is sadly consonant with the accelerating trends towards hyper-discretion and hyper-selection in UK data protection regulation. Other major data breaches, such as the 2023 one which continues to impact the British Library (much less serious but also raising far few complexities in terms of investigation), have also not been fully investigated or sanctioned. Moreover, the ICO's Annual Report 2024/25 revealed that the ICO carried out only 43 UK GDPR investigations in the past year (an 85% reduction on 2023-24), issued just 2 UK GDPR fines (compared to >250 in both Germany and Spain) and served no UK GDPR enforcement notices at all. These facts expose the need for an in-depth, thorough and independent investigation into the state of UK data protection regulation, including an examination of what might be done to reverse its current lack of consistent and robust results for data subjects and the public at large.
