                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House lawmakers are reviewing new legislation that would codify distinct protections for whistleblowers who disclose information about any use of U.S. government funding to study “unidentified anomalous phenomenon material” — or matter associated with objects observed in air, space, or sea domains that cannot be immediately explained. From UFOs to modern and transmedium UAP, the government has a complicated history in terms of its handling of reports about craft that appear to transcend the capabilities of existing technology, and records documenting related incidents. The UAP Whistleblower Protection Act, introduced last week by Reps. Tim Burchett (R-TN) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), marks the latest move by lawmakers to help shield people who want to share information with Congress but fear retaliation — and motivate more of them to come forward. A member of Burchett's team told DefenseScoop in an email that the bill is identical to legislation put forward in November during Congress' last session. This version of the bill was referred to the House committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Armed Services, and Intelligence for consideration. Burchett and Luna are among a small cadre of policymakers who have been steadily prioritizing whistleblower hearings, public engagement sessions and other legislative efforts to promote more accountability and disclosure from the intelligence community, Department of Defense and other agencies regarding UAP. On Wednesday, Luna announced a hearing on “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” that's officially set for Sept. 9. Recurring transparency concerns and the effectiveness of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) are among several topics that will be up for discussion. The panel of four witnesses testifying will include two Air Force veterans — Jeffrey Nuccetelli and Dylan Borland. “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety,” Luna said in a statement.</p>

Now, Jackie Gleason's legendary estate in New York‘s picturesque Hudson Valley—better known as the Mothership—has reemerged for sale at $5.5 million with Corcoran's Heidi Henshaw. Gleason, famously fascinated with UFOs and metaphysical theory, dreamed up the circular home that embodied futuristic ambition while showcasing old-fashioned craftsmanship.

It took five years and a reported $650,000, partly underwritten by Gleason's bosses at CBS, before the Mothership was completed in 1959. Many original details, including built-in cabinetry, closets, and bespoke furnishings, remain intact. Gleason's late-night soirées reportedly drew the likes of Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and even President Richard Nixon. Yet the Mothership also offers serenity, seclusion, and an intimate connection to the natural world, with panoramic views of its wooded 8.6-acre setting just an hour north of Manhattan.

By reinforcing protections for whistleblowers, the bill aims to foster an environment where federal employees feel safe to speak out about wasteful or questionable government spending, particularly in connection with UAP-related projects. If passed, this bill could result in increased reporting of UAP-related activities by federal employees due to improved protections against retaliation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (WABC) -- "The Conjuring" universe comes to a close with one final spine-chilling case. Based on real life events, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as Ed and Lorraine Warren in "The Conjuring: Last Rites." For more than a decade, they brought the characters to life. It's not just about saving a family. But when the Smearle family becomes the target of a vengeful demon with a decades old grudge, Ed and Lorraine are forced back into action. "For us, for me, what just makes this and for everyone, what will make this the ultimate is that this isn't just any old demon that the Warrens are dealing with. Like, we're dealing with something really sordid, that's got a score to settle with these particular two," Farmiga said. "Like, this demon has had a history with the Warrens. It's got a bone to pick. You know, we're not just dealing with some random evil that's just like after random souls. This demon has a personal vendetta against these two. So, the stakes are higher than they've ever been." "Early on, it was every case that Lorraine took on and what it did to her emotionally, physically. And so you're always weighing the cost of these cases. "So when we come back to it, because we'll all be different and the fears will all be different and all of that. They have heard their share of interesting stories over the years from people who associate the stars with this franchise. "I mean, we picked Lorraine's brain when she was alive, and, and, you know, we were friends with her and we would visit with her before every conjuring. And we would just, I mean, you know, we would hear after story after story. We would hear tapes, you know, that Tony Spear would play for us," Farmiga said. "And it's just ludicrous what went down from, like, the smells they would encounter to the audio that they would encounter, and it's just outlandish. And it's like one of those things where there's so many crazy stories. "People will jokingly, you know, say I need you to come over and I'm dumb enough to probably think that I could handle it and it helped them. Let's just hope no one has to find out. * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Send it to Eyewitness News using the form below. If attaching a video or photo, terms of use apply.</p>

Despite making many scary movies over his career, The Conjuring: Last Rites director Michael Chaves says he was never really a big believer in the supernatural, that is, until he had his first paranormal experience whilst filming the new horror movie. And I was, honestly, mostly, entirely a skeptic before shooting this movie," says Chaves to GamesRadar+. The director added that he and his family were staying at an "old vicarage" at the time of filming, which is the name given to a house where a vicar lives or once lived, as provided by the church. "So my daughter one day showed me a picture on her iPad," continues Chaves. However, Chaves didn't remain a skeptic for long. "So everyone leaves to see a show. I wouldn't be surprised, 300 years old. This was, like, you know, super old Harry Potter house. It's totally quiet, and I hear voices. In a bid to find out who was talking, Chaves says he turned off the TV and looked outside, around the house, to find the culprit. Went through every room in the house, and there was, like, no one there, but literally, the spookiest experience I ever had," adds Chaves. However, with a decade of making horror films under his belt, it seems fitting that the Warrens' final on-screen outing would bring Chaves' first ghostly encounter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The psychic medium, 34, and his wife Alexa, 27, are expecting their third baby together, announcing the exciting news exclusively with PEOPLE. The expectant mother is currently 18 weeks pregnant and expecting their new addition in February 2026. Fraser, who already shares sons Rowan, 5 months, and Royce, 3, with his wife, tells PEOPLE that the news of a third child is a dream come true. "I have seen God working in serious ways, and it's amazing to now witness it happening in my own life," he says. Echoing her husband's sentiments, Alexa says that while they've always wanted three children, she "didn't think it would come so quickly." "Having children has been such an exciting chapter together, and although we're in the thick of it, the love in our house is overflowing." "At first, I was scared, anxious, and overwhelmed. I'm the type of person who likes everything planned and thought out," he explains. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The soon-to-be dad of three shares that he's already thought about some of the more practical things that come with having another baby, like whether the car is big enough or if there's enough room at the dining room table. "I've learned that nobody wrote the book on parenting," he says. What felt unexpected at first quickly became the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Now I'm embracing this moment fully and have been in complete bliss ever since.” The couple will soon have three children under 5, and Alexa tells PEOPLE that although they have been busy, they've "never been so fulfilled." "Yes, there are fingerprints everywhere, Goldfish in our couch cushions, and little feet running everywhere, but we wouldn't want it any other way," she shares. "The boys are already growing so fast, so we are taking in every minute, and we can't wait to give them yet another sibling this next year.</p>

Unexplained aerial phenomena, commonly branded as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) and more recently as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), remain one of history's most enduring enigmas. While most sightings are dismissed as misidentifications or atmospheric oddities, a select few stand apart – defying scientific and governmental scrutiny and leaving behind more questions than answers. These are cases with solid physical evidence, radar confirmation, or witnessed by military and aviation professionals. Let's delve into the 11 most compelling UFO sightings across the globe – incidents with documentation, official investigation, and mysteries that have persisted for decades despite analysis. In November 2004, off the coast of San Diego, multiple US Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz Strike Group spotted a white object resembling a Tic Tac breath mint, maneuvering in ways that defied aerodynamics. It had rapid acceleration, abrupt stops, instant turns – with no visible propulsion. Commander David Fravor, a primary witness, described the object's physics-defying movement as “not like anything I'd ever seen”. Japanese Airlines cargo pilot Kenju Terauchi, a veteran aviator, observed a strange phenomenon in the skies of Alaska while flying the JAL Flight 1628. Alongside his team, he encountered three UFOs for nearly fifty minutes. While the case garnered global acclaim, Captain Terauchi was demoted to a desk job for 'embarrassing' the airline, only to be reinstated later. The FAA briefing was officially buried, but Callahan retained evidence, later sharing it publicly as one of the strongest radar-verified UFO cases in history. Stefan Michalak, a mechanic and amateur geologist, faced the most extraordinary incident of his life. He encountered a strange disc-shaped craft near Falcon Lake, Manitoba. The blast left a grid pattern of burns on his chest and stomach. While Michalak was the only witness, many others, including RCMP officers, doctors, US Air Force, and Canadian authorities, investigated the incident. Michalak's encounter went on to become a national sensation, documented as one of Canada's most famous, unexplained UFO encounters. In late December 1980, US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge saw strange lights descending into the forest. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, they witnessed flashing lights, hovering star-like objects, and recorded radiation readings. Five teenagers witnessed these lights fluctuating in sequence, suddenly diving at a 45-degree angle toward the water's surface. A joint Navy, RCMP(Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and Coast Guard underwater search ensued after the residents reported this incident as an air crash. However, the concerned authorities found no traces of a crashed aircraft. To date, it remains one of Canada's most celebrated UFO cases. Thousands of residents across Phoenix and other locations across Arizona were baffled when they witnessed a huge V-shaped UFO pass the night sky on March 13, 1997. Former Arizona Governor Fife Symington III later said, “I can say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I'd ever seen. Many eyewitnesses described these craft-like objects as having three bright lights at each vertex and a central, red, pulsating light. The reason was that these unidentified objects descended from high altitudes of over 10,000 feet to as low as 500 feet in seconds. On April 6, 1966, more than 200 students and several teachers in the Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a grey, saucer-shaped object that was about twice the size of a family car. A few Australian skeptics tried dismissing the object as an experimental military aircraft. On September 19, 1976, two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom II jets scrambled to intercept a luminous unidentified object over Tehran. Both jets saw their weapons and communications systems go haywire when they closed on the object. Hundreds of civilians, including pilots, military officials, and ground observers across Tehran, witnessed this phenomenon. The US Defence Intelligence Agency compiled a four-page report, which was later sent to the White House, CIA, NSA, and Pentagon for analysis. Retired General Parviz Jafari testified about it publicly at the 2007 National Press Club conference in Washington, D.C. On September 16, 1994, 60 children at the Ariel school in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, claimed they saw a hovering craft and strange creatures with black eyes in the school yard during recess. Many described receiving a telepathic message warning humanity about harming the planet. Decades on, some witnesses remain visibly shaken, recalling trauma and vivid memories. It left behind scorch marks, indentations in the ground, and burned vegetation. The Air Force took this case seriously under Project Blue Book, officially classifying it as ‘unexplained' after finding no evidence of a hoax. Despite advanced aerospace technology and decades of investigation, these cases stubbornly resist ordinary explanation. What singles them out is not a lack of skepticism but an abundance of credible data – diverse witnesses, physical traces, and repeated failure by authorities ot solve the mystery. These cases remain the gold standard for UFO phenomena amidst growing government transparency and international interest. They raise unanswerable questions today, as when these UFOs first breached our skies. He has written in the sports and technology domains respectively.

Russia, even after the end of hostilities against Ukraine, will continue its information and psychological operations. The enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army,  stated Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.

"The next challenges we must be ready for after the fighting ends are how to protect our informational, humanitarian, historical, and value-based frontiers. Because even if one day the guns fall silent, the enemy is already preparing a PSYOPS army, and this war will definitely continue," Yusov warned.

He emphasized that history often becomes intertwined with geopolitics, posing a significant challenge for Ukraine. According to Yusov, Russia's war against Ukraine has shown that the Geneva Conventions and international security mechanisms are ineffective.

"Our duty is to make them effective. This can be achieved through systematic informational work: exposing the truth, countering Russian propaganda, and documenting the war crimes of the aggressor state," he added.

In March, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, emphasized that Russia is expanding its PSYOPS units to influence Western countries. In particular, Moscow seeks to sow disappointment in NATO and promote the idea that cooperation with Russia is possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Far from focusing on the Red Planet, this time the American space agency has turned its attention to another celestial body. Researchers have made progress regarding the possible existence of extraterrestrial life on a planet other than Mars, which changes ideas about where to search for life beyond Earth. NASA has confirmed that this small planet shows clear signs of having had favorable conditions for life billions of years ago. It is important to note that, although it is not a large planet, Ceres has proven to contain chemical and energetic elements that could have supported simple organisms in a distant past. The most recent study, published last August 20 and led by researcher Sam Courville, has produced surprising results. Scientists have used advanced thermal and chemical models to simulate the interior evolution of the dwarf planet over an extensive period. The data indicate that Ceres's subsurface had hot water and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, elements linked to environments favorable for microbial life on Earth. These findings have not come in isolation, since in 2018 NASA's Dawn mission confirmed the presence of frozen water and salts on Ceres's surface. Sam Courville himself has explained that, on Earth, the mixture of hot water of underground origin with other compounds in the ocean creates an ideal ecosystem for microorganisms. This way, scientists firmly believe that Ceres could have had similar conditions in its history, which broadens the perspective of where to search for life beyond our planet. This approach opens new avenues for future explorations and space missions dedicated to confirming or ruling out the existence of extraterrestrial organisms. Ceres is a cold and dry dwarf planet, where current conditions prevent the existence of liquid water. Its interior still generates some heat due to radioactive decay, but it is not enough to keep habitable environments on the surface. Thus, although today it is an inhospitable world, its past could have been very different. Thus, NASA and other scientific institutions will intensify their efforts to study these lesser-known worlds, seeking clues that could answer one of humanity's deepest questions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check for daily updates on your sun sign I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway. On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past? Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more. The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience. While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose. In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience. When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc. From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute! In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms). If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc. The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me. I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom. There are pros and cons to each! The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info. I also really appreciated the vast array of options and how quickly each person responded. Plus, there were always a few hundred other options to choose from! The one-stop-shop nature of the Nebula platform makes it a great option for just about anyone who is interested in spirituality and astrology. It's a fun and insightful tool for astrology enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a generic daily horoscope. Nebula is also a great option for beginners who are curious about tarot, astrology, numerology, and psychic readings and don't know where to begin. In particular, if you prefer chat-based communication, Nebula psychic readings are definitely worth checking out. I love the daily horoscopes and the detailed astrology insights it provides, with guidance that genuinely feels aligned. If you're looking for an all-in-one spirituality app that's easy to use and can improve your daily life, I recommend giving this one a try. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

PAN-India star Prabhas will soon head to Greece to shoot the pending songs of The Raja Saab. After wrapping up this romantic horror entertainer, the actor will move on to Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Spirit. It is well known that Prabhas plays a cop in this big-ticket film, while Animal fame Triptii Dimri plays the female lead.

Bollywood Hungama has now made a surprising claim about the Prabhas starrer in its recent report. The media outlet described Sandeep Vanga's directorial as an eerie supernatural thriller on the lines of M. Night Shyamalan's films. Earlier, many reports suggested that Spirit would be an intense action drama revolving around a cop who goes after an international crime syndicate, but this latest claim is completely contradictory.

Fans are now wondering why the actor would take up another horror film immediately after The Raja Saab. Pranay Reddy Vanga, in association with T-Series, will bankroll the project, while Harshavardhan Rameshwar will compose the music.</p>
