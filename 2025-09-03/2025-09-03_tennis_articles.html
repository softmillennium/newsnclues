                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years after reaching his first major semi-final at the US Open in 2021, Felix Auger-Aliassime is once again into the last four in New York, this time thanks to an inspired comeback against eighth seed Alex de Minaur on Wednesday afternoon. On the verge of falling two sets back, the free-hitting Canadian won an absorbing 85-minute second set to draw level, then held his nerve under pressure to claim a gritty 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5, 7-6(4) victory after four hours, 10 minutes. Awaiting Auger-Aliassime in his second major semi-final is either defending champion Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti, while De Minaur slips to 0-6 in Grand Slam quarter-finals. “It was just a lot of nerves today during the whole match, it wasn't pretty at all times, but that's what Grand Slam matches are,” said Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview. “Somedays you won't feel your best but I was willing to dig deep and do everything I can to stand here right now. It's been an amazing tournament so far. It's not over, there's some tennis to play and the biggest challenges are yet to come, but that's what I live for.” Auger-Aliassime had raised hopes of a Nitto ATP Finals berth by winning titles in Adelaide and Montpellier through the opening two months of the year and, after a mid-season struggle, he has thrust himself firmly back into the conversation. With his deep run in New York, which includes a third-round win over third seed Alexander Zverev, Auger-Aliassime is up eight spots to 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK—Rest and relaxation typically aren't associated with the US Open, but Jessica Pegula is making an exception.Start with her results in Flushing Meadows: She's played five matches, and they've all ended in straight sets. The most recent, a 6-3, 6-3 victory over 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, lasted a tidy hour and 26 minutes—her second-longest match of the tournament.Beyond her efficiency on the court, Pegula has probably rested as much as possible off it.

The US Open is inarguably busy as ever, with its main draw now stretching 15 days.© Fred Mullane/Camerawork USA, Inc. Pegula wasn't a fan of the US Open's decision to add a third day to the first round, but she made the most of it, winning her night match 6-0, 6-4—earning her two days off, highly unusual during a major. Even this seen-it-all veteran was unsure how she'd spend her tonnage of idle time.“It's a little bit different than I'm used to, so I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do tomorrow—whether I take the day off and chill, or want to practice, or keep it low key,” Pegula told me afterward in an exclusive chat. “Two days off, I've never had to do that before. It's a little weird.”As our conversation in a hallway by the entrance to Arthur Ashe Stadium continued, Sunday turned to Monday.“With the late finish, though, I think it's kind of nice that I don't have to worry too much about feeling that I only have a day to recover.”High seeds, particularly if they're American, are desirable attractions for US Open tournament officials. They often headline night sessions in Ashe or, during the first three rounds, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Pegula hasn't played under the lights since that opening Sunday, enabling her to develop a routine while colleagues deal with uncertain start times and bizarre sleep patterns. “It's a little bit different than I'm used to, so I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do tomorrow—whether I take the day off and chill, or want to practice, or keep it low key,” Pegula told me afterward in an exclusive chat. “Two days off, I've never had to do that before.

Pegula hasn't played under the lights since that opening Sunday, enabling her to develop a routine while colleagues deal with uncertain start times and bizarre sleep patterns. “I think it helps when you can get into a rhythm,” Pegula told Tennis Channel's Jon Wertheim on Tuesday, after reaching her second Grand Slam singles semifinal. It's nice, during the day, everyone's in a good mood and happy. She'll head into Thursday's (night) semifinal with a full day of rest, unlike, say, Iga Swiatek or Amanda Anisimova, who play on Wednesday.Of course, so will her opponent, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka—who got some unlikely rest of her own with Marketa Vondrouosova's sudden withdrawal. “Always great to have similar schedules from day to day,” Mark Knowles, one of Pegula's two coaches, shared with me over text.

Mark Knowles, along with fellow coach Mark Merklein, has been a regular inside Arthur Ashe Stadium the past two US Opens. The three most recent Sabalenka vs. Pegula matches, all in the last 13 months, have been giant hard-court finals: at Cincinnati and the US Open last year, and in Miami earlier this year.And like all seven of Sabalenka's wins over Pegula in their nine meetings, they ended in straight sets.Pegula last stood across the net from Sabalenka during Fan Week, after competing in the mixed doubles. She decided to cut their cold and windy practice short, describing it as “terrible.” Then she went to an escape room in the city with friends, and enjoyed a couple of beverages.

Two weeks later, she's back in the final four.She will surely try something different this encounter, but it may be more mental than tactical. It may be more…relaxing.“Instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly,” Pegula said in her press conference on Tuesday, “enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final, and I'm playing the best player in the world.”She echoed a similar sentiment to Wertheim: “Back myself, and know that I can play good tennis. That I'm a great player.”The 31-year-old has reminded us of that this US Open—a tournament where, after eight months of globetrotting and grinding tennis, any advantage helps. Physically, she comes into her latest Sabalenka showdown with plenty in the tank. She will surely try something different this encounter, but it may be more mental than tactical.

And she was at my last two matches 🫶🏼 https://t.co/WaSRBvFlkW (Usually tight-lipped about her family, the Buffalo native made another reveal in our conversation, when I asked her about HBO's latest season of Hard Knocks, featuring her beloved Bills: “People say my dad's in it a lot—he's pretty funny, which is true,” Pegula says with a laugh. “Maybe that's kind of why I don't want to watch, because it's like, a little embarrassing.”)If Pegula is to overcome Sabalenka, the US Open would be a fitting venue. It was here, last year, that she snapped a six-match losing streak in Grand Slam singles quarterfinals. 1, Swiatek.Referencing the pressure-filled moment, Knowles asks me after a Pegula practice at Indian Wells in March: “She embraced it, right?”“She hadn't gotten past the quarterfinal stage—which, by the way, millions of players would sign up for. Victory seemed unlikely when Pegula trailed 6-1, 2-0 and faced break point. But out of position, she sprinted to get her racquet on a Muchova forehand with a defensive stab, and the Czech overcooked the volley. It was the match's turning point.“For me, that was probably a greater victory, because that showed true adversity,” Knowles recalls. “As I told her the minute she walked off the court—and I've been around a long time—99 percent of players would have just said, my run's come to an end.“She was able to dig deep.

A word that keeps surrounding Pegula this season is “challenges.” When I asked her what success at this US Open is, way back on Sunday, August 24, she said, “it's dealing with the challenges, the ups and downs.” When she won a WTA 250 in Austin in early March, she thanked Knowles in her champion's speech for “accepting the challenges every single day.”A week later at the BNP Paribas Open, I asked Knowles what he thought Pegula meant by that. He gave a remarkable answer:“It's always fascinating when you work with great athletes, and she's one of those. I understand all the stuff that goes into it. I was taken aback at how hard she works—pretty impressive—but there's also a balance there.“I think with any coach, when they start working with a player, you want to hear from the player, you want to see how they react, how they deal with pressure, all the different things, and then you want to ingratiate your own philosophy. So it's about trying to make our relationship, and the same with (fellow coach) Mark Merklein. We're in tandem, we're a full team, we're all on the same page, which I think helps a lot.“What's important for Jess, like all great champions, is they demand a lot of themselves. If there wasn't, everyone would be doing it.” A week later at the BNP Paribas Open, I asked Knowles what he thought Pegula meant by that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has been a lot of talk of a Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz final at the US Open this fortnight. 2 have met in the past two major championship matches, with their previous five clashes on Tour coming in title deciders. However, one man keen to block out the Sinner-Alcaraz noise and spoil the party is Novak Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major. The 38-year-old Serbian defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets on Tuesday night to set a semi-final meeting against Alcaraz. I'm going to try to mess up the plans of most of the people,” Djokovic said. But they are playing the best tennis of any players here. “But I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court. I don't think anybody does really when they play them, but particularly not me. I put myself in another semi-final of a Grand Slam this year. I have been very consistent, most consistent on Slams this season and that's what I said at the beginning of the year, where I would like to perform my best tennis and make the best results. Djokovic has advanced to the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025, losing to Sinner at Roland Garros and Wimbledon and retiring against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open. The four-time US Open champion is chasing his first major since he won in Flushing Meadows in 2023 and might have to go through both Alcaraz and Sinner if he is to end his two-year wait. Sinner – who meets Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals – and Alcaraz have won the past seven majors between them. Having defeated Fritz in three hours and 27 minutes, Djokovic is hoping to be ready to go by the time he walks back onto Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday. He leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. I tell you that,” Djokovic said cracking a smile. The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed. I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion. It's just that I'm not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days. But I'm going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that.” The seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, up three spots to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, improved to 11-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the American. He's going to take his forehands and punish you. I was just trying to survive, just trying to stay in the rally, make him play,” said Djokovic, who is 31-9 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I think it was good for me that he wasn't making a lot of first serves in the first couple of sets. Then, all of a sudden, it was so much more difficult for me to stay in his service games. But then, you know, I think in important moments in the fourth I served well, mixed it up, came to the net as well…. Djokovic is now tied with Jimmy Connors for the most semi-final appearances (14) in tournament history. He won the US Open in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2023.

But with the exception of the serve—and even there it's close—Djokovic does all of those things a little better than Fritz. And while Fritz had more aces and won a higher percentage of his first-serve points, Djokovic was the more clutch server: He saved 11 of 13 break points, while Fritz saved five of nine.All of this meant that Fritz faced a difficult tactical question: Should he use his pace to try to end the points quickly, knowing that Djokovic is a rock from the backcourt? It got him closer than he's been in the past, but still short of victory.

While the American settled down soon after, he never got that break back. The match's first inflection point came with Djokovic serving at 5-4. Five times he faced a break point, and five times he saved it, each with an aggressive play.“In many of my service games I was just trying to stay alive, fight for every ball,” Djokovic said.

It was fortunately coming on my side, end of the fourth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic was tested by Taylor Fritz on Tuesday at the US Open, but managed to navigate the key moments and capitalise on the American's missed opportunities to continue his quest for a record-extending 25th major crown. The 38-year-old, who has lifted the trophy in New York four times, dispatched last year's finalist 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 to extend his perfect Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Fritz to 11-0. "Incredibly close match," Djokovic said in his on-court interview. I think for most of the second and third set, he was a better player. In these kind of matches, a few points decide the winner." After below-par performances in the early rounds and several visits from the physio during those matches, Djokovic has played into form throughout this fortnight and will next face rival Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster semi-final clash. Friday will mark their first encounter at Flushing Meadows. Djokovic was clutch in big moments against Fritz, including when the Serbian served for the opener at 5-3, a game in which the American held five break points, but was unable to convert.That theme continued throughout the night. Fritz again had three consecutive break points when Djokovic served for the second set at 5-4. The Serbian, visibly irritated, had to contend not just with Fritz's pressure, but also a restless New York crowd. Fans roared when he missed first serves, and their agitation grew when Djokovic pleaded chair umpire Damien Dumusois for more crowd control.Fritz began to swing more freely off his forehand and started to hold the advantage in longer rallies, but a sloppy game at 4-5 in the fourth set cost him a chance at a decider. "That last game was nerve-wracking," said Djokovic, who is third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, only behind Alcaraz and second-placed Jannik Sinner. "Tough one for Taylor to finish with a double fault, he didn't deserve that, but a great fight and a great tournament for him.“I didn't feel like I was dominating today from the back of the court. In many of my service games, I was just trying to stay alive, fight for every ball. He was aggressive, staying close to the line. At the end of the day, winning matters and I'm really proud of the fight that I put in and I wear my heart on my sleeve always for this sport. Djokovic explained in his on-court interview that it was dedicated to his daughter, Tara, who was celebrating her eighth birthday. Djokovic is now tied with Jimmy Connors for the most semi-final appearances (14) in tournament history. He won the US Open in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2023. Djokovic has reached the semi-finals at all four majors this season, marking the seventh time in his career that he has achieved that feat. He holds a 31-9 season record, according to the Infosys Win/Loss Index.

But also, I had a lot of chances to play a lot of matches here, which is what I would desperately need to get better. I saw myself improving so much with every match I was playing.”Off the court for 16 months, Williams made a valiant return to action at 45 years old this summer, winning her first singles match since 2023 at the Mubadala Citi DC Open and pushing two-time semifinalist Karolina Muchova to three sets in the first round of this year's US Open. “Yeah, I think that it's all great feedback.

Despite the disappointing exit, Williams rebounded in doubles with Fernandez, a 2021 singles runner-up. In their first tournament as a pair, they upset No. 6 seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez en route to the last eight, where they ultimately fell to top seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.“In a lot of ways, we just ran out of time,” Williams said. I blame myself for a lot of it. I think with a few matches I could have been a stronger partner today.”The five-time Wimbledon champion has been reluctant to commit to more tournament after the US Open swing, blaming her ambivalence towards long flights as she seemingly ruled out the upcoming Asian Swing and even the 2026 Australian Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach. Update: Venus and Leylah Fernandez's doubles run ended on Tuesday with a 6-1, 6-2 loss to the top-seeded team of Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. Sadly, Serena never showed up at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, but we know she was locked in at home. Venus Williams called her sister out and requested her presence in New York after reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open doubles draw, alongside partner Leylah Fernandez, on Monday. "She's given us advice, and we just need her in the box," the 45-year-old icon said in her on-court interview after the pair's impressive 6-3, 6-4 win over 12th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai. "So my message is, 'Serena you need to show up.'" Asked later what kind of advice the 23-time Grand Slam singles champ had for her sister -- whom she won 14 major doubles titles with, don't forget -- Venus said Serena is a motivator, and she can hardly contain her nervousness watching them on TV. They're all at home, just really on our side." But if Serena is going to coach them, Venus prefers that she do so in Queens, not from a distance. "If she came, it would be a dream for both of us, and we'd have her on the court coaching," Venus said. It's been quite an interesting tournament for Williams, who lost in the revamped mixed doubles event before dropping her first-round match to now-quarterfinalist Karolina Muchova. But Williams decided to stick around in New York a bit longer, accepting a wild card into the doubles draw with Fernandez. They've torn the house down in Louis Armstrong Stadium since playing their first match last Thursday, winning three straight without dropping a set and becoming one of the more delightful stories of the tournament. We all know about Venus' doubles pedigree, and Fernandez -- a former US Open singles finalist in Flushing Meadows -- is also a former French Open doubles finalist. They'll face their stiffest test on Tuesday, again in Louis Armstrong Stadium (their happy place), against the top-ranked doubles players in the world, Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. Hopefully Serena will be in the house to give them an extra boost. Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach.</p>
