Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out. Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position. “Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”. Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end. “There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fred Vasseur on supporting Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort Aston Martin had an up and down weekend in Zandvoort, at times looking set to be McLaren's closest challengers but also enduring two separate car rebuilds. As a result, getting both cars home in the points can count as a success – even if one driver seemed happier than the other. Having started P10, he dropped down the order after a poor getaway and soon found himself stuck in a queue of cars. As such, he missed out on a cheap stop under the Safety Car, but still picked up a handful of places as others came in for more tyres. And yeah, some of the cars that finished in front of us, I think they were significantly slower than us… [like] the Haas [cars], so we lost maybe an opportunity.” But their pace faded on Saturday as others began to turn up their engines, and so the Spaniard only managed P10 on the grid. That, coupled with his poor start, is where his race ultimately came undone – but recovering to eighth at the flag is still a decent result. As for Lance Stroll, he managed to come home seventh despite starting from P19 on the grid and making contact with Gabriel Bortoleto in the early stages. That moment ended up being a blessing in disguise, as the team brought him in for a very early pit stop. It was a good recovery from his lowly grid slot, and just reward for his team, who had had to rebuild his car not once but twice thanks to crashes in FP2 and Qualifying. But they need to be wary of the recovering Racing Bulls, who are just two points behind now thanks to Isack Hadjar's maiden podium.</p>

Having held his position at the start, the 20-year-old kept both Charles Leclerc and George Russell at bay during various points, and when Lando Norris ahead retired in the closing stages, it allowed Hadjar to become the youngest Frenchman to claim a Formula 1 rostrum. "The Safety Car came and that gave us a relatively straightforward stop on to the hard tyre and from then it would have been a run to the end and we had the pace, we were pulling away. So fourth was actually pretty comfortable, which is lovely to say." While Hadjar was able to claim an unexpected result, team mate Liam Lawson was left frustratingly outside the points after a collision with Carlos Sainz when running seventh and on course for his fifth points finish of the season. He was doing well, he got a great start," said Permane, with Racing Bulls now seventh and only 20 points behind Williams in the Teams' Championship in fifth. "I don't know where he would have finished, I guess he would have finished with the Mercedes had he not been taken out by Carlos. These things happen, he'll come back strong and we can expect him to be back in Monza fighting."</p>

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Ferrari's weekend to forget in Zandvoort

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.
