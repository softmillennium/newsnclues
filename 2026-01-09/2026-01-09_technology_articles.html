                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Gates had a front-row seat for the rise of AI, from his longtime work at Microsoft to early demonstrations of key breakthroughs from OpenAI that illustrated the technology's potential. Now he's urging the rest of us to get ready. Likening the situation to his pre-COVID warnings about pandemic preparedness, Gates writes in his annual “Year Ahead” letter Friday morning that the world needs to act before AI's disruptions become unmanageable. But he says that AI's potential to transform healthcare, climate adaptation, and education remains enormous, if we can navigate the risks. “I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.” But he adds that we'll need to be “deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed” — and that governments, not just markets, will have to lead AI implementation. He says AI makes software developers “at least twice as efficient,” and that disruption is spreading. Gates cautions that if we don't limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in hitting the world's poorest people hardest, and even in the best case, temperatures will keep rising. Stepping outside AI, Gates calls this the thing he's “most upset about.” Deaths for children under 5 years old rose from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025, the first increase this century, which he traced to cuts in aid from rich countries. Gates predicts AI will soon give poor farmers “better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.” The Gates Foundation has committed $1.4 billion to help farmers facing extreme weather. He says he uses AI “to better understand my own health,” and sees a future where high-quality medical advice is available to every patient and provider around the clock. AI is now the Gates Foundation's biggest bet in education. Personalized learning powered by AI is “now the biggest focus of the Gates Foundation's spending on education.” Gates says he's seen it working firsthand in New Jersey and believes it will be “game changing” at scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. TerraPower, a Bill Gates-backed next-gen nuclear company, on Friday announced a deal with Meta to build up to eight small modular reactors in the U.S. with the first coming online as soon as 2032. Tech companies have been aggressively pursuing new clean energy solutions as they race to build power-hungry data centers that support burgeoning AI services. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO, said in a statement. Meta in June signed a deal with Constellation that supports the relicensing and extends the operations of its nuclear plant in Illinois. “Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, in a statement. Three Democratic senators last month sent letters to Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and three data center firms informing them of an investigation into their effects on residential power bills. TerraPower is currently building its first commercial reactor in Kemmerer, Wyo., and plans to start splitting atoms by 2030. In December, the company said it completed a key regulatory milestone, passing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff's final safety evaluation for its permit. Its Natrium reactor includes technology from TerraPower and GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy. In June TerraPower disclosed $650 million in new funding from Gates, who helped start TerraPower, as well as the venture arm of chip giant NVIDIA. It previously raised more than $1 billion, including investments from Gates as well as South Korea-based SK Inc. and SK Innovation, according to PitchBook. TerraPower has additionally been awarded roughly $2 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates paid his ex-wife Melinda French Gates nearly $8 billion as part of the settlement from the former couple's 2021 divorce. The $7.88 billion payout was revealed in new tax filings and first reported by The New York Times in its DealBook Newsletter on Friday. She left the philanthropic organization with $12.5 billion for her own initiatives as part of her divorce agreement with Gates, and said at the time that she would commit that money to her work “on behalf of women and families.” Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation was established in 2022, a year after the divorce. It's also possible that the missing amount “was not given to a charitable foundation, but to an entity, such as French Gates's limited-liability company, Pivotal Ventures, that does not file a tax return,” the Times reported. Gates is 13th on the Forbes Billionaire List with a net worth of $108 billion. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S. Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways. Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they'll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It's a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta's deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio. As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup's Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta's order. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours. The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, Elon Musk's social media platform X added the lightest of restrictions on its AI chatbot Grok following backlash over the AI tool being used to alter users' photos on X to generate sexually degrading deepfakes of women and children. The chatbot now appears to users from generating or editing images when they tag Grok in an X post, unless they're a premium subscriber. “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” the Grok chatbot, which is not the same as a spokesperson, posted Thursday on X in response to a user. However, as The Verge first pointed out, that statement isn't entirely true. Since late last month, some X users have been using Grok to generate sexualized images from photos posted by other users on the platform without their consent, including images involving minors. A social media and deepfake researcher found that Grok generated about 6,700 sexually suggestive or nudifying images per hour over a 24-hour period in early January, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Sen. Ron Wyden told Gizmodo that AI chatbots are not covered under Section 230, a law that shields online platforms from liability for illegal conduct by users. “As I've said before, AI chatbots are not protected by Section 230 for content they generate, and companies should be held fully responsible for the criminal and harmful results of that content. States must step in to hold X and Musk accountable if Trump's DOJ won't,” Wyden said. This isn't the first time Grok has caused problems for X. And these controversies don't appear to be helping the company's bottom line. While it may seem bizarre that Musk hasn't taken stronger action to address the controversies, none of it appears to have slowed investor enthusiasm. xAI announced this week that it raised $20 billion in its most recent funding round. Contacted for comment, xAI responded to Gizmodo with an email saying, “Legacy Media Lies.” X, meanwhile, pointed to a statement it posted on January 3. “We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary,” the company's Safety account posted on X. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Follow along with Gizmodo as we check out all the latest gadget announcements from the year's biggest, most-packed tech event, CES 2026. It would be deeply embarrassing if the law has to go into effect before X acts. One X user had Grok put a bikini on an image of her dead body. They might not move quickly, but autonomous movement matters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bill introduced in the Washington state Legislature would ban employers from requiring or pressuring workers to be microchipped, a practice lawmakers want to prohibit before it ever becomes an issue. While there's no known instance of an employer seeking such action, Thomas told GeekWire the bill is a preemptive move. “We are getting out ahead of the problem because the practice of requiring these chips is too dangerous to wait for it to show up in Washington,” she said Thursday via email. The Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs reported that internationally, more than 50,000 people have elected to receive microchip implants to serve as their swipe keys, credit cards, and more. The organization noted that the technology is especially popular in Sweden, where chip implants are more widely accepted for gym access, e-tickets on transit systems, and to store emergency contact information. HB 2303 would add a new section to Chapter 49.44 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), titled “Violations — Prohibited Practices.” The chapter serves as a catch-all for labor regulations that define and prohibit specific unfair or illegal activities by employers, employees, and labor representatives. The legislation is similar to laws passed in Arkansas, California, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, Indiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Its law prohibits people from voluntarily electing to receive such markers in Nevada. Thomas said she believes companies will eventually pitch the technology to their employees by telling them it's more convenient and easier — you don't have to worry about forgetting your work access badge, etc. “Many times convenience causes people to view things too narrowly and they don't see the big picture,” she said. The Carnegie Council also reported on the privacy, data security, and health safety concerns that microchips present, including from technologists who worry about IoT vulnerabilities in sensors and network architecture that could be exploited by hackers. Elon Musk wants to ramp up production of his Neuralink brain‑computer interface chips in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday morning, the Grok account on X started responding to some users' requests with a message saying that image generation and editing are “currently limited to paying subscribers.” The message also includes a link pushing people toward the social media platform's $395 annual subscription tier. British prime minister Keir Starmer has not ruled out banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.” Neither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED's inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, X and Grok remain available in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts. “We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say. A WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed. On Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok's stand-alone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos, including celebrities and other real people. “I was able to generate a video with sexually explicit content without any restriction from an unverified account,” they say. While WIRED's test of image generation using Grok on X using a free account did not allow any images to be created, using a free account on Grok's app and website still generated images. But it has also been criticized as a minimal step that acts as a band-aid to the real harms caused by nonconsensual intimate imagery. “While limiting AI image generation to paid users may marginally reduce volume and improve traceability, the abuse has not been stopped. It has simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm.” “While it may allow X to share information with law enforcement about perpetrators, it doesn't address the fundamental issue of the model's capabilities and alignment,” says Henry Ajder, a deepfake expert who has tracked harmful uses of the technology for years. They could have disabled the Grok application to generate pornographic videos.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's AI company has restricted Grok's controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription. Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok's image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone's picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week. The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India's communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia. The firm, which employs approximately hundreds of people across five offices — three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. — has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z's history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don't really align with the firm's preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia's largest sovereign funds. But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump's November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration — not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. This matters because a16z's current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” — a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies). Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there's less visibility into those numbers. Horowitz frames a16z's mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.” What's certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money — $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stranger Things‘ Upside Down was always a mysterious place—but fans were certain of a few key things. In season five we learned the Upside Down functions as a wormhole connecting Earth to the Abyss, and it's from that angry realm that the monsters actually originated. So fans wondered: where were all the demo-beasts when Mike, Nancy, Will, and company barged into their homeworld in the big finale? It's not the most vexing question to linger after “The Rightside Up,” but it does feel like something that should be addressed. And so having them sit there and really explore that—to me, the writers' room is so fascinating, because you see them thinking,” director Martina Radwan said. “I love that they were so sure about the Demogorgons in the final Abyss—except Ross was like, ‘Mmm, maybe there's some fatigue, Demogorgon fatigue.' And you're like, “Oh, OK—so this is not the last conversation. No Demos in the Pain Tree should have been the documentary title, but alas, it's called One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. A new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump's first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification. Although efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality around such laws are up for debate. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn't like it—that's exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.” Utah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it's the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah's earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. “Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. Critics argue that age verification has never been about protecting children but rather scrubbing porn from the internet. Sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub have brought platform-dependent sex work into the mainstream, but they have also made it easier to police adult entertainers and consumers. As more states begin to implement added tariffs on sex work, creators will bear the brunt of the new laws more than anyone. A government tax on speech limits that right to those who can afford it.” Pornhub, which is currently blocked in Utah and Alabama, did not respond to a request for comment. Today, young people regularly access NSFW content via social media, on platforms like X and Snap. Last year, a survey by the UK's Office of the Children's Commissioner reported that 59 percent of minors are being exposed to porn by accident, primarily via social media, up from 38 percent in 2023. In Alabama, as would be the case with Utah, revenue raised by the tax is being used for behavioral health services, including prevention, treatment, and recovery support for young people. Some scientific studies suggest that adolescent exposure to porn increases rates of depression, low self-esteem, and normalized violence, but health professionals have never reached a consensus on the matter. With lawmakers working to reframe the issue around underage harm, Stabile says it's critical to remember that adult content isn't different from any other kind of protected speech, noting that content-specific taxes on speech have repeatedly been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional censorship. Adult businesses already pay taxes on the income they earn, just as every other business does.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Created in just six months, it was meant to correct a rare genetic mutation that was causing toxic ammonia to build up in his small body. Now, a new startup called Aurora Therapeutics, cofounded by gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna, is aiming to scale such treatments to many more patients with rare diseases. Aurora plans to take advantage of a new regulatory pathway announced by Food and Drug Administration officials Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad in the fall. The new program, called the “plausible mechanism pathway,” allows the FDA to approve personalized treatments for rare and fatal diseases based on data from just a handful of patients, according to Makary and Prasad in a New England Journal of Medicine article. For drug trials of rare diseases, it's difficult to recruit that many patients because so few people have the disease. “Once a manufacturer has demonstrated success with several consecutive patients with different bespoke therapies, the FDA will move toward granting marketing authorization for the product,” Makary and Prasad say in their article. Drug companies will then be able to use data from those patients to get similar drugs approved that are based on the same underlying technology. That is key for Aurora, which will initially focus on treating a metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria, or PKU, that's screened for at birth. Patients with PKU must eat a highly restrictive low-protein diet. “There are a lot of patients that could benefit from this therapy. But the problem is, you have many, many mutations—over a thousand—that cause this disease,” says Edward Kaye, CEO of Aurora Therapeutics and a pediatric neurologist. The guide RNA is like a car's GPS—it goes where it's programmed to go. In the case of baby KJ, scientists built a guide RNA to target his specific genetic mutation. Previously, the FDA would have considered every version a totally new drug, each requiring its own clinical trial. But now, Aurora will be able to use the same technology platform to treat many mutations that cause PKU with less regulatory red tape. Kaye says the company will use base editing, a more precise form of Crispr, and will have a standardized process to streamline the design and manufacturing of its therapies. “We are very much about no mutation left behind,” says Fyodor Urnov, Aurora's cofounder and a genome editing scientist at UC Berkeley. The Innovative Genomics Institute will continue to create bespoke gene-editing therapies for children with very rare diseases, while a trial at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, where baby KJ was treated, will test the same type of gene editor used in KJ's therapy in a group of similar disorders. He says establishing Aurora was necessary so that these treatments can eventually be available to many more patients. So far, there is only one approved drug on the market that uses Crispr technology. Called Casgevy, it debuted in December 2023 at $2.2 million to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, a related blood disorder. “We are finally at a place where Crispr on demand has had all the technical problems worked out,” Urnov says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aurora Therapeutics' first target is the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU. Yet so far, there's been only one gene-editing drug approved. It's been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease. So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Aurora's first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU. Instead, Aurora's goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that's responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US. “We can't have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora's cofounder and sits on its board. In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people. “I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we're getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn't it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial. Though it didn't target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.” Each time a new patient appears, he says, they'll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that's tuned to fix that child's particular genetic problem. Musunuru, who isn't involved with Aurora, does not think the company's plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don't see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.” Instead, what's occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.” While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.” The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

In June, according to Ross's testimony, he led a team seeking to apprehend a man named Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, who was on an administrative warrant for being in the United States without authorization. Because the man's home was across from a school and immigration agents had no authority to enter his home, Ross testified, they instead trailed him in unmarked vehicles. Muñoz-Guatemala's attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment. According to the December testimony and a New York Times account of an FBI agent's affidavit associated with the case, Ross approached Muñoz-Guatemala and asked him to roll down his window and open his door. Ross, who testified that he had been driving an unmarked vehicle, was dressed in ranger green and gray, and wore his badge on his belt, broke the driver's side back window and reached into the vehicle, at which point Muñoz-Guatemala pulled away. Muñoz-Guatemala continued to drive and succeeded in shaking Ross from the car. Video of the incident appears to show a federal agent firing shots into Good's vehicle as she attempted to leave the scene. At Thursday's White House press briefing, vice president JD Vance answered questions about the incident, and his responses included numerous identifying details about Ross, mainly relating to his interaction with Muñoz-Guatemala. “That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg,” said Vance, “so you think maybe he is a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?” Department of Homeland Security secretary Kirsti Noem has repeatedly described Good's actions as an intentional act of “domestic terrorism.” An FBI investigation into Good's killing is ongoing. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED in a statement that the department is “not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.” McLaughlin added that federal immigration agents “are under constant threat from violent agitators” because of “doxxing” and that the Minnesota Star Tribune, which first published Ross' name, “should delete their story immediately.” According to Ross' December testimony, he served in the Indiana National Guard and was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 as a machine gunner on a patrol truck, then joined Border Patrol in 2007 after finishing college, working near El Paso, Texas. “I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he testified. “I'm also a field intelligence officer, and I am a member of the SWAT team, the St. Paul Special Response Team.” In his testimony, Ross said that he had made hundreds of vehicle stops in his career and generally described people who attempt to flee. In court, Eric Newmark, who was representing Muñoz-Guatemala, noted that even government lawyers hadn't previously heard this assertion. I think he said it for a particular reason”—allegedly to show that Muñoz-Guatemala was aware that he was being apprehended by law enforcement and not attacked by a masked carjacker. A prosecutor in the case conceded that the claim was “grounds for impeachment” against Ross because he “did not previously say that—as far I know.” “I believe it's—it seems to be something that some ​​people just—just say to—to stall,” he testified. “I believe a lot of time people are on the phone and they're waiting for people to get—to show up, especially with our line of work.
