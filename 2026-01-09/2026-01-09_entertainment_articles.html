                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not new to note that the fortunes of America's movie theaters rest, pretty precariously, on a thick, greasy cloud of popcorn, soda, and nacho cheese dip; as the U.S. box office has seemingly plateaued in its recovery from the COVID-19 shutdowns over the last few years, theaters have had to lean more and more heavily on concessions in order to make ends meet. Even with that understanding, though, we'll admit to a bit of shock at a planned promotion that theater chain Cinemark is rolling out for this year's “National Popcorn Day,” set by the food advertising minds that cook this kind of thing up for January 18 and 19. The company's marketing has its own language for it, but if it's all the same to you, we're going to just go ahead and keep thinking of the promotion like this: Welcome, one and, all, to the “Fuck it, bring your own goddamn bucket” plan! As noted by THR, this is the second consecutive year that Cinemark has run the FIBYOGBP, in which consumers—and the word has rarely felt more apt—are invited, for that 48-hour period, to bring in any container they like, up to 400 fluid ounces, and get it filled with popcorn for just five bucks. The twist this year (and it's a powerful one, to our mind) is that the chain has now gone one step further and struck a promotional deal with hardware company Lowe's: If you show up with a 5 gallon bucket that you bought at Lowe's, that can also be filled, netting you an extra 250 ounces of indigestion, kernels-in-teeth, and the looming specter of heart disease. The THR piece employs the phrase “Food-grade bucket liners will be available upon request,” which is the kind of thing that's going to haunt us almost as much as 5 full gallons of popcorn are bound to haunt our large intestines in the months and years to come. Meanwhile, it's also noted that non-bucket-owners—i.e., chumps—will still be able to buy a 200-ounce “XL” popcorn for the same price, if your FIBYOGBP FOMO isn't too intense at the thought of leaving all that hot, slick salted corn on the table. Oh, and the promotion doesn't require a ticket purchase, so no reason to stay put: Wander America's decaying malls and crumbling streets with your big ol' paint bucket of popcorn clutched in your greasy mitts, fending off birds and raccoons as you go! Food-grade bucket liners are available on request!

Between Sisu and Ready Or Not 2, the world of John Wick is finding common cause with the influence of Quentin Tarantino. And there's no shortage of comedic kung fu, ironic bloodletting, and stylish hotel rooms in the first trailer for They Will Kill You. Produced by It sibilings Andy and Barbara Muschietti and directed by Kirill Sokolov, the Russian action-comedy filmmaker behind Why Don't You Just Die, the trailer makes no attempt to hide its influences before veering off in its own Satanic course. Still, while it may take people a second to realize that this isn't the trailer for Ready Or Not: Here I Come, it still gives Zazie Beetz, the Bullet Train star who's no stranger to this type of thing, an excuse to square off against Patricia Arquette, Tom Felton, and Heather Graham.

﻿

Here's the logline:

A young woman must survive the night at the Virgil, a demonic cult's mysterious and twisted death-trap of a lair, before becoming their next offering in a uniquely brazen, big screen battle of epic kills and wickedly dark humor.

They Will Kill You opens in theaters on March 25, 2026.

There comes a time in everyone's life when they have to plan and host a glitzy movie awards show, and for me, that time came earlier this week when I — in my role as chair of the New York Film Critics Circle —emceed this year's NYFCC awards dinner at Tao Downtown in Manhattan. In addition to corralling luminaries like Ben Stiller, Lupita Nyong'o, and Mikhail Baryshnikov to present the awards to our winners, my responsibilities also included kicking things off with some introductory remarks about the evening's purpose. Related Stories ‘A Private Life' Review: Jodie Foster Delights (in French!) as a Therapist Who Will Do Anything but Go to Therapy Herself Barbara Loden Beyond ‘Wanda': An Upcoming Film and Lecture Series Provides a Tantalizing Look at What Might Have Been As anyone familiar with my work knows all too well, it's a lot more comfortable for me to ramble on for thousands of words than it is to be concise, and so the only way I could steady myself in a situation as nerve-wracking as this one was to hold half of Hollywood hostage for a long, long speech about the relationship between critics and filmmakers. Just to make sure that I can never repress the memory, I've conveniently been provided with a picture of the exact moment that happened: My name is David Ehrlich, and it's my great pleasure and profound anxiety to welcome you to the 91st New York Film Critics Circle Awards. You would never know it from my Victorian skin pallor, a physique that makes Marty Supreme look like The Smashing Machine, or from the fact that I own the entire Criterion Collection despite living paycheck-to-paycheck, but I am indeed a film critic; to my wonderful mother, who is in the room tonight, I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. If it's any consolation, mom, had I become a doctor or a lawyer I would never have been able to lend you a heavily watermarked For Your Consideration DVD of Brendan Fraser's fish-out-of-water drama “Rental Family,” so at least there's something you can still brag about to your friends. Of course, we are not here this evening to discuss my disappointments as a human being — there are truly so many different spaces on the internet where you can do that on your own time. But this is my time, for better or worse, and I'm afraid to say that I'm going to drag it out for another 10 to 12 minutes;  like several of our winners tonight, I simply don't know how to do anything short, but my promise to you is that this won't be the worst thing that's ever happened in this country on January 6th. Many of the year's best movies and performances were unexpected in one respect or another. After firmly establishing herself as one of the great comedic talents of her generation, Rose Byrne blew us all away with her nerve-shredding dramatic performance in “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.” After 13 years of absence following her unforgettable 2011 narrative film “The Loneliest Planet,” Julia Loktev returned with a monumental documentary about the last independent journalists in Russia. And after several decades of shamelessly appealing to the masses with multiplex slop like “Phantom Thread,” “Inherent Vice,” and “There Will Be Blood,” Paul Thomas Anderson finally made something for the critics. Well done, Paul, thank you for throwing us a bone at last. Cinema as a medium has always been defined by its persistence: the persistent illusion of motion that allows a quick succession of still images to assume the quality of a dream, the persistent hold that it maintains over our imaginations in the face of invasive new technologies, and the persistent faith that it projects onto the power of communal experiences, even at a time when reality itself is being siloed into a series of discrete echo chambers  (shoutout to “Eddington”). I'm reminded of that persistence as I reflect on a year of tumult, loss, and potentially catastrophic self-destruction within the film community. This doesn't feel like the right time to elaborate on that last point, but — on a completely unrelated note — I would like to congratulate Netflix and Warner Bros. for combining to win almost half of our awards tonight. In 2025, we lost David Lynch, Robert Redford, and Souleymane Cissé. Yes, “My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow” is five-and-a-half hours long and filled with some of the ugliest and most upsetting things you'll ever see on screen, but neither of those factors stopped “Wicked: For Good” from grossing more than $500 million, and so I can't fathom why they would be such dealbreakers for Julia Loktev. And yet, this was also a year that epitomized cinema's tradition of persistence. Specifically, the persistence of historical memory, as we saw in films like “It Was Just an Accident,” “The Secret Agent,” and, in its own way, the elegiacally quotidian baseball drama “Eephus,” whose writer/director, Carson Lund, has worked as a critic himself, and has actually reviewed the work of some of our other winners tonight. Try as I might, it's hard to be all doom and gloom about a year that gave us the single most unstoppable movie soundtrack since “Saturday Night Fever,” two Bronstein family classics, and “a few small beers” for good measure. So while it may seem a bit “rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic” to get dressed up and celebrate film in the growing shadow of technocratic greed, unabated genocide, and the AI-generated perversion of image-making itself, I don't think it's wholly unimportant that the movies of 2025 were really, really fucking great. Or that we are gathering here tonight to acknowledge them as such in the face of these imperiled times. That is what the New York Film Critics Circle has done through thick and thin for the last 91 years, which some might choose to see as a remarkable display of persistence in its own right. We bravely gave our awards during periods of strife as painful and varied as World War II, the Great Recession, and the Isiah Thomas era of the New York Knicks, and I don't think it's a coincidence that all of those things ended on our watch. Perhaps I'm giving critics too much credit for our role in shaping modern history, and in shaping the art that it's produced. Then again, perhaps the rest of you aren't giving us enough. That film critics and filmmakers depend on each other is self-evident, but I think that critics are unfairly often seen as the barnacles rather than the whales. Much as I enjoyed “Eephus,” we all know that movie was really just 99 minutes of under-employed character actors standing around on a field until Nick Schager called it “a new sports-movie classic, as sneakily effective as the pitch which gives it its title.” Beautifully shot as it was by our Best Cinematography winner Autumn Durald Arkapaw, “Sinners” was really just an IMAX-sized version of that sex dream we've all had about Michael B. Jordan trying to bite himself, at least until Kelli Weston hailed it as “a dynamic testament to Ryan Coogler's populist impulses, his proclivity for grandiose portraiture, and his unerring insistence that no one who embraces the American project may escape its grotesque transformations.” “The Secret Agent” was just a thrilling and deeply felt display of the movies' ability to manufacture a meaningful history of their own — an unforgettable argument that cinema can be even more valuable as a vehicle for exhuming the truth than it is as a tool for burying it — until David Sims wrote on his Letterboxd that it “whips ass.” That was the entire review. Of course, determining the exact nature of the relationship between critics and artists has become a recurring theme at this dinner, as any number of chairs have taken the opportunity to lament the fact that critics and artists are spiritually aligned but also somehow irreconcilable; that we're both fighting against the common enemy of mediocrity, but are fated to do so while facing directly towards each other from separate and unequal vantage points. It was just a few years ago that the great Alison Willmore stood at this very podium and quoted the art critic Peter Schjeldahl, who said that “Closeness is impossible between an artist and a critic. But with all due respect to the late Mr. Schjeldahl, who belonged to a different and more clearly demarcated era, as the once-monolithic film industry continues to shrink into a glorified niche, it's become increasingly undeniable that artists and critics ARE the audience for each other's respective work. Whether it's streaming executives who insist that going to the movies is an outmoded practice (despite the overwhelming data that young audiences are the most AMC-friendly demographic), or movie theaters that refuse to mask their screens, or AI evangelists who preach that grotesquely Frankensteining stolen work into a soulless chimera of some kind is a worthy replacement for the magic of motion pictures, the viewing public has never been so aggressively conditioned to expect less — to surrender more, to put convenience before fulfillment, to be passively sated rather than actively engaged. And in the shadow of such enshittification, it's never been more obvious that film without critics would be as doomed as critics without film. Perhaps even more importantly, no one would reward us either. And everyone in this room, whatever their discipline, is someone who gives a shit. Love it or hate it, “Marty Supreme” is not the kind of movie that someone makes by accident while trying to churn out content. By the same token, Richard Brody got so mad when the latest Wes Anderson movie failed to win any prizes this year that he beat a fellow NYFCC member to death with a bagel, and is only here tonight because critic-on-critic violence is legally considered to be a victimless crime. Which brings us to the purpose of tonight's dinner. Maybe this is as close as critics and artists are ever likely to ever get — sitting at different tables in the same oversized pan-Asian restaurant in front of a giant Quan Yin statue that Adrien Brody so confidently misidentified as Shiva last year. But, contrary to Peter Scheldahl's words, a night like tonight reminds me that it's not what critics and artists want from each other, but what we give to each other that matters. Yes, we give you awards in return for you giving us things to write about, but really, what we give to each other are reasons to continue giving a shit about the things we love, and the courage to insist that the things we love are still capable of giving us something meaningful in return.

No intellectual property is ever really gone forever in Hollywood, and a new Peacock series is preparing to breathe some new life into a cult classic from 1989. Joe Dante's “The ‘Burbs” was ahead of its time, lampooning the monotony of American suburbia and the darkness that sometimes hides beneath it with a story about a young couple (Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher) who encounter a Satanic cult in their otherwise unremarkable neighborhood. Related Stories 2026 PGA Awards Nominations Include ‘One Battle,' ‘Sinners,' ‘F1,' ‘Weapons,' and More ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty' Creator Jenny Han Shares Takeaways from Her Summer of Success Per an official synopsis, Peacock's “The ‘Burbs” follows “a young couple who have reluctantly relocated to the husband's childhood home. Their world is upended when a new neighbor moves in across the street, bringing old secrets of the cul-de-sac to light, and new deadly threats shatter the illusion of their quiet little neighborhood.” The series sees Keke Palmer and Jack Whitehall stepping into the lead roles (though they're not playing the same characters as Hanks and Fisher), flanked by a supporting cast that includes Julia Duffy, Paula Pell, Mark Proksch, and Kapil Talwalkar. The limited series hails from creator Celeste Hughey, who has writing and producing experience on shows such as “Palm Royale” and “Dead to Me.” Executive producers include Seth MacFarlane, Brian Grazer, and Dana Olsen, who wrote the original film. “The ‘Burbs” was named one of IndieWire's most anticipated TV series of 2026, with our film critic Ben Travers explaining that fans have two reasons to be excited about the show. “Two good reasons: You loved the original film (starring Tom Hanks) and believe its premise is well-suited for a modern interpretation,” Travers wrote. And with a supporting cast including Paula Pell and Mark Proksch, she may have found one funny enough to earn her skills.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heated Rivalry creator Jacob Tierney is flustered when he joins our Zoom call, pacing around under a clear blue sky. That's so on-the-nose!” he declares, gesturing at his gray concert T-shirt. It doesn't take long for him to get over that and start gushing about Michael Stipe and Co., though. “I would actually physically fight somebody over them,” he adds, laughing. Good thing he has a whole pack of hot hockey players in his corner — or, at least, that's what they play on TV. Tierney's HBO drama exploded at the end of 2025, an adaptation of a popular book series by Rachel Reid that follows a pair of hockey players as they go from rivals to something steamier — a secret romance. The show premiered on Canadian subscription service Crave in late November, and after getting picked up by Max, it barreled into the public consciousness like a hockey player… doing hockey player things. Stars Hudson Williams (who plays shy Canadian Shane Hollander) and Connor Storrie (in the role of brooding Russian Ilya Rozanov) were suddenly everywhere — a dizzying turn from waiting tables and sparse IMDB pages. The show's soundtrack — a mix of early-to-mid aughts nostalgia — has also found a foothold in the zeitgeist, giving artists like t.a.t.u and Wolf Parade sizable streaming bumps even decades after their songs originally dropped. “I've never made TV the normal way,” he says. [Wolf Parade's 2005 track] ‘I'll Believe in Anything' was so built into the show — I wanted to clear it before we even started filming. That's kind of like an indicator of how music is crucial to the way that I like to tell stories.” No, the [songs] just happened to largely be from a playlist I made,” he says. “It's the music of my early 20s.” His stars, who are currently in that age range, immersed themselves in the soundtrack, despite not really knowing any of the artists of Tierney's youth. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time “They made me feel really old,” he says. And they're like, ‘Oh yeah, we watched that on Sesame Street.' Age matters aside, Tierney has been overwhelmed by musicians' reactions to the show; artists like Miley Cyrus have already been vying to soundtrack season two. “It's been crazy who has reached out, because there's a bunch of people that I shouldn't even say who have DMed to me,” Tierney says, sadly declining to elaborate. '” But that doesn't mean he's abandoning those aughtie faves. As the hype for Heated Rivalry continues to grow — composer Peter Peter dropped two tracks for the soundtrack, “Rivalry” and “It's You” Friday — Tierney broke down his favorite needle drops from the cultural phenomenon. Tierney sees this track as the theme song for hockey player Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) and his boyfriend, Kip (Robbie G.K.). That was a big, hugely important needle drop for me, because I also wanted to use it multiple times. I wanted to make it like Scott's subconscious. That's what I want for him and Kip. Needle drops, to me, are so important, because they do trigger a subconscious reaction. Hudson Williams Teases ‘External Battle' in ‘Heated Rivalry' Season 2 Even Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper Can't Stop Talking About ‘Heated Rivalry' These Steamy Sports Books Promise a Similarly Happy Ending I was at an Arcade Fire show and they were the openers. Oh, my God, I love this band so much.” In the early 2000s, I was talking to Spencer [Krug] on and off about scoring something else. “My Moon, My Man” opens episode four when there's a massive, long montage of the boys texting and fucking, being in love and being apart from each other. And “Sealion” is in episode one when Ilya is going to see Shane for the first time in the hotel, and he runs into his mother in the elevator. Just play it twice.” That's how much I love this song. And “Sealion” — I just felt like it had the right nervous energy song for that moment. Boys getting ready to meet for the first time. There's something kind of propulsive about it. This French track scores a scene in which Hollander dates actress Rose Landry (Sophie Nélisse). I love this for Rose, and I love this for that montage in episode four where Ilya is looking at all of this press coverage of Shane and his new girlfriend. It felt exactly like the right cheeky, cute, poppy earworm. I believe that my Apple Music told me it was the song I listened to the most last year. Heated Rivalry's de facto “Running Up That Hill” moment, this mix of the original and remix serves to underscore the agony of hidden love.

I did not think I could afford it, but as soon as we put it in, I was like, “Oh, we need this.” I liked the idea of doing a song and then a cover of it, and then found that Harrison cover. And I was like, “Oh, God, we've got to make this work, because these two songs together are really doing the heavy lifting.” I don't mind telling you, it took a lot of figuring out how to make that work, not just financially, but content-wise. My friend Michelle Mylet, who was on Letterkenny, she sent me that song. And I was like, “Yes, please.” I didn't want to let people think we've forgotten about being horny.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The creator of the hit dystopian series said he compares crafting each season to making an album: "What haven't we done yet, and what tone am I looking for?" The hit dystopian series is returning for an eighth season. Netflix confirmed the news on Friday by releasing a transcript of a conversation with Brooker, in which he beamed about the show's three Golden Globe nominations. The seventh edition of Brooker's dystopian anthology series immediately topped Netflix charts upon its April 2025 release, accruing 10.6 million views in its first full week on the platform. The episodes landed Brooker a nomination for best television limited series, anthology series or motion picture made for television, as well as performance nods for stars Rashida Jones and Paul Giamatti in episodes Common People and Eulogy, respectively. Amid Brooker's analysis on how season seven was crafted and which spine-chilling sci-fi moments still linger in his mind, he also discussed the future of Black Mirror, telling the streamer: “Well, luckily it does have a future, so I can confirm that Black Mirror will return, just in time for reality to catch up with it. That chunk of my brain has already been activated and is whirring away.” When asked about his describing each season as an individual album and what kind of tune the next one will be, Brooker responded: “It's a useful thought experiment when approaching a new story. … Where does this track come on the album, and what musical direction are we going to go into?' [It's] very unlikely you'll ever see a Black Mirror hoedown.” In an August, 2025 conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Brooker said he's got “plenty more Black Mirror stories ready to go.” Brooker also teased a little about his new, untitled Netflix series, which he said is a “profoundly serious crime thriller” and “very much not Black Mirror.” “There's definitely something I'm not saying about it at the moment just yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Bryan introduces With Heaven on Top, his first album since mid-2024, with a spoken-word story of a Manhattan apartment in the winter, a fire, and the New York Fire Department dousing him with water that runs down his back, down the floor, and ultimately downstream and to the ocean. The 25-track record finds Bryan, one of country music's most successful and most polarizing figures, seeking to embody the person in that story. Now that With Heaven on Top is out, fans and social media lurkers alike are working overtime to assess how successful Bryan was in his quest. Here are our five takeaways from the record to help move that process along. He played a limited number of stadium shows — plus a pair of blowout weekends in Dublin and London — but nothing like the schedule he kept during 2024's Quittin' Time Tour. But he spent a long stretch of time off the grid for the first time in his career, and just about all of With Heaven on Top came from it. He all but spells this out in “Anyways” as he laments the difference in his life between the summers of 2024 and 2025. I'm gonna go and make them scenes.” It's hard not to hear this album as a collection of life experiences that led Bryan to such a turnabout. When he sings “I've been working on myself all fall. Certainly, there are moments when Bryan picks at those wounds. Along the same lines, though, Bryan does not go overboard with tunes about his new love and wife, Samantha Leonard. 'Cause she likes romance, good sex, music and ruling the world,” still goes a long way toward covering those particular bases in Bryan's life. Bryan released a snippet of “Bad News” on social media in October. The lyric “ICE is gonna come bust down your door, try and build a house no one builds no more,” directly referenced the ongoing crackdown by the federal government and set off a fresh round of chatter over Bryan's intentions. Well, now that the song has dropped, it's political. Marilyn Manson Accuser Seeks Revival of Claims Based on New California Law Zach Bryan's New Album ‘With Heaven on Top' Is Here Messy Breakups and That ICE Song: 5 Takeaways From Zach Bryan's New Album Bruno Mars Is Feeling Himself in New ‘I Just Might' Video All the Tours We Can't Wait to See in 2026 Zach Bryan's New Album ‘With Heaven on Top' Is Here Zach Bryan Marries Girlfriend Samantha Leonard in Private Ceremony Zach Bryan Will Play Stadiums Around the World in 2026 No single artist shoulders more credit for ushering in the era of stripped-down, lyrics-first country music than Bryan — or more blame for the endless debates over “authenticity” that followed. If there's anything new to the sound, it's an obvious influence from Bruce Springsteen. He sings about his late mother in “DeAnn's Denim.” He sings about his Oklahoma home in roughly a quarter of the songs, name-checking Rogers County and the Red River, and references Oklahoma's Turnpike Troubadours — one of Bryan's favorite bands — in a passing mention of “Kansas City Southern” for those listening close enough to hear it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every week, Pitchfork offers a run-down of significant new releases available on streaming services. (All releases featured here are independently selected by our editors. With each album serving as one big swing above home plate, Dry Cleaning use their third LP, Secret Love, to confirm they've got one of the most consistent batting averages in modern post-punk. The South London quartet allows each member to lean closer to the forefront and show off their sleek form, from Florence Shaw's crisp deadpan quips in “Cruise Ship Designer” to Lewis Maynard's polished, wooden-like bass tone across “Hit My Head All Day.” Produced by Cate Le Bon and composed by the band inside studios owned by Jeff Tweedy and Gilla Band, Secret Love would be a return to form, but Dry Cleaning never fell out of shape in the first place. It's been a long time since French Montana and Max B launched their Coke Wave mixtape series—17 years, to be exact. Now that Max B has been released from prison following a 16-year-long sentence, the close friends and collaborators have picked up where they left off in the form of Coke Wave 3.5: Narcos. Everyone in Winged Wheel knows their grouping doesn't make sense, least of all geographically; hence why members of Sonic Youth, Tyvek, Matchess, and more turned to remote file-trading from their different abodes to pull it off. All six members of the band—Whitney Johnson, Cory Plump, Matthew J. Rolin, Steve Shelley, Lonnie Slack, and Fred Thomas—poke and prod one another to keep their sound evolving through experimental indie rock, post-punk, krautrock, and beyond, often refining arrangements after tracking the music itself. Their third album, Desert So Green, is more aggressive than last year's Big Hotel, yet it's arguably the best jumping-off point for their discography, welcoming new listeners into the fold to see where and how they get where they're going. We're barely a week into 2026 and Zach Bryan is already having one of his most memorable years. Following a New Year's Eve marriage ceremony in Spain, the country star has dropped his sixth full-length album, With Heaven on Top. On the whole, it sounds like it cuts straight to the heart and strips away frilly layers – more or less in line with its rural, pond-side cover art. Exactly 25 years into their long career as one of England's consistently charting rock bands, the Cribs are not only still going strong, but know the strongest currency is hooks with simple immediacy. Welcome their ninth album and its winking title, Selling a Vibe, which shoots the band's guitar riffs through a sunny filter, giving listeners their daily vitamins in the form of bubbly earworms like “Never the Same” and “Summer Seizures.” Produced by former Chairlift musician Patrick Wimberly, Selling a Vibe embraces its pop construction, relaxed attitudes, and desire to readjust the Cribs' rock status to leave room for a softer peace of mind. Let's Eat Grandma spent nearly a decade making surreal synth-pop. Now, under the moniker Jenny on Holiday, Jenny Hollingworth peels off as one half of that duo to release her own solo debut, Quicksand Heart. Drawing inspiration from Prefab Sprout, the Replacements, and Cyndi Lauper, Jenny on Holiday uses her expressive vocals to stamp an impression on life's flickering moments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount/18Hz's Primate rang up $1.4M from both Thursday night showtimes and previous previews. Triple note on that Gerard Butler movie: Canada isn't going this weekend. Primate and Greenland 2 were forecast to make $8M-$10M heading into this weekend. Despite the entry of two older-male-skewing titles, Avatar: Fire and Ash is expected to hold on to No. The James Cameron-directed threequel grossed $2.5M yesterday, ending its third week at $55M for a running cume of $321.2M. The Johannes Roberts-directed, Walter Hamada-produced $24M Primate opens today in 2,964 locations. Internationally, the film opens this week in 26 markets including Mexico. That 90% fresh Rotten Tomatoes critics score has simmered down to 78% fresh, which is still notable for an R-rated horror movie. Oz Perkins' The Monkey last year had a 77% certified fresh RT score in reviews. Speaking of which, Primate‘s previews are about $500K shy of Monkey‘s $1.9M (which turned into a $5.8M Friday/previews and $14M opening). The first Greenland was 77% certified fresh with audiences during the pandemic (remember, it only got a PVOD play), and Part 2 is lower at 59%. Elevation will be releasing the sequel in Canada as PVOD via Amazon. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Avatar 3 continues to lag way behind 2, and I think it's mostly due to it being an inferior product. Still, way ahead of last year's Marvel movies. From Disney's POV, there's too much money on the table to walk away. But when we get Avatar 4, it may be a while and it may not be directed by James Cameron. The maker's of Greenland were probably hoping recent news would boost grosses. Uh, the studio gets back only 25-45% of ticket sales from overseas and 50-55% domestically. There is no way Avatar 4 and 5 are getting made. As someone who would really like to see 4 and 5, I have to say that I agree with you. There is no way to justify two more $400m movies. The fourth one might be able to eek out a profit, but the 5th one would be one of the biggest money losers of all time, surpassed only by Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning. You don't understand the biz, bro: Avatar 4 also would pump up 3 other Avatar movies plus theme parks etc. They missed out on a lot of money by releasing on Dec 19th which allowed only 2 weekends in 2025 and the 3rd in 2026 as people were going back to work and prepping for school to start back up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the day that Warner Bros. Discovery‘s board announced its rejection of Paramount‘s latest bid, the David Ellison-led conglomerate took its argument to Capitol Hill. In a letter filed with a House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday, Paramount's chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, wrote to lawmakers that the Netflix–WBD combination was “presumptively unlawful.” Delrahim wrote that Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery assets was “presumptively unlawful,” arguing that it would “further cement its dominance in streaming video on demand.” A frequent point made during the hearing was that much will depend on how the government ultimately defines the relative market, i.e. whether Netflix competes in a narrow world of subscription streaming for premium content, or a much wider landscape that includes YouTube and social media. Delrahim said that the broader market definition was “tortured and absurd” and something that “no serious regulator would ever accept.” He wrote, “It asserts, for example, that free, user-generated videos on YouTube and TikTok should be considered an adequate substitute for premium produced content available on Netflix or HBO Max. This is what some call ‘psychedelic antitrust' — it has no ground in market or legal reality.” Delrahim led the Justice Department's antitrust division during Donald Trump's first term. The Wrap first reported on the filing, which was made with little fanfare as attention focused on what may be Paramount's next step as it seeks to win a hostile bid for all of WBD. Congressional lawmakers have oversight over the Justice Department, but no direct authority in whether the transaction is approved or rejected. The regulatory review also will include European regulators and state attorneys general. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Two things: 1) The idea that merging Netflix and HBO Max would give them some huge market share is mostly nonsense, based on the idea that that would be combining two completely different groups of people when in reality there would be a huge amount of overlap and it probably wouldn't even increase their market share by very much. 2) Did they use AI for writing that letter? Given that the quote acts like it's a thing people say, “psychedelic antitrust” literally seems like an AI hallucination or something; it finds nothing on Google other than articles about this. Then the lawmakers should be good to go.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Connor Storrie had one of those days that can only happen for a Hollywood star. His Wednesday began early with a high-profile stop at SAG-AFTRA headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard where he teamed with Abbott Elementary's Janelle James to announce the nominees for The Actor Awards. Standing at a podium inside the Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Theater, he delivered a line that nailed his star-is-born arc thanks to a role as smoldering Russian hockey star Ilya Rozanov in Jacob Tierney's Heated Rivalry: “Eight months ago, I was literally waiting tables, so this is pretty wild. Now, instead of reading specials, I am reading nominations,” he said in a moment that went viral for encapsulating the meteoric rise with only six episodes. After facing a crush of press in a Dolce & Gabbana suit and Hublot watch, he exited SAG-AFTRA flanked by his team of publicists from Shelter PR en route to a meeting with another new roster of reps on his side — a team of power agents at CAA. By night, Storrie, then in a black satin Giuliva Heritage ensemble with a watch and diamonds by Chanel, landed on the cobblestone driveway at Chateau Marmont for Chanel's Coco Crush campaign launch celebration, headlined by Gracie Abrams and performer Lily Allen. But it was clear early on in the intimate evening that amid a sea of singers, artists and actors, it was Storrie stealing all the stares. “Everyone wants to meet you,” Tessa Thompson confirmed, microphone in hand, while addressing Chanel-clad dinner guests as Storrie looked on and blushed. For proof of just how high the fever for the Heated Rivalry phenom is, look no further than Instagram. It would be an overwhelming day for the most veteran of stars, but Storrie, 25, was calm, cool and beaming throughout. Rather than stay glued to his phone, he clutched a pack of blue American Spirits while focusing on conversations or Allen's mesmerizing performance of three songs off the critically acclaimed West End Girl about the dissolution of her marriage to David Harbour. “I just keep moving and be mindful about where I'm putting my attention,” Storrie told me about his laser focus amid a demanding schedule that includes reading new scripts from CAA, shepherding an experimental film he shot on an iPhone and juggling the demands of newfound stardom. I ran into him at both events Wednesday and asked how he's holding up. It's been so much that I honestly don't have time to really process or think about it, which I think is kind of healthy. I try to stay off of comments and too much online stuff because our algorithms, especially now, are so geared toward whatever you intake that if you go online, it could just be all me. I wrote about you signing CAA this week. Have you thought about want to do next or what this year looks like? A big part of my career and what I want to do right now with the show is I write and direct myself. I'm in the middle of doing an iPhone feature, this super indie kind of Sean Baker-esque film because I'm making it on an iPhone. I just want to develop as a filmmaker, too, alongside Heated Rivalry. I consider myself somewhat of a character actor in the sense that I really like to transform, as seen on the show. I'm just talking to people and feeling it out. I'm very big on vibes too, because I think that even though you want to work with the best of the best or have parts that are ideally really cool, at the end of the day, it comes down to vibe. It's really about meeting people and seeing if you're on the same creative wavelength. Me and Hudson before this weren't even nothing, but we just had such a good rapport with each other and Jacob. I was going to say, when have you had the time? I have a lot of plane time coming up. You've said that you just dreamed of being able to do the work but there's a lot around it now. We were doing things every single day from Nov. 19 until Dec. 20. I had a little break for the holidays. To be honest with you, I just really try to center myself on the creative projects that I'm actively writing. I'm doing this iPhone feature that I've also been trying to tackle on top of doing all of this. I have a few events in the next few nights and the days leading up, from like 7 a.m. until 4 p.m., so I'm shooting my movie, going home, getting ready and then going to whatever meetings or events I have. Having something active to do is what makes it doable. Seeing you this morning and then again tonight, I'm thinking about style since it was Dolce & Gabbana in the morning and now you're here at Chanel. Is there an overall Connor Storrie style strategy with your stylist James Yardley? Fashion was never really on my mind before getting into this world. I was never a car guy and then the first time you get in a really nice car, you're like, “Oh, I get why people pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a nice car.” It's kind of the same thing with clothes. Getting to wear designer clothes, you're like, “Oh, I understand why people spend the money if they have it.” Nice things are nice and it feels good and sexy to be in nice things. Speaking of nice things, you're going to the Golden Globes as a presenter and it's cool that you and Hudson Williams get to do it together. I'm excited that Nikki Glaser is doing it. In between seeing you, I saw some clips online of the sheer pandemonium outside Jimmy Fallon today when Hudson arrived. The fandom is so proud and protective of you guys. One of the reports that came out stated that you had already signed on for three years, which led people online to speculate if you were getting paid enough or getting a bonus. To be honest, I have a lawyer and a business manger now, so I have someone who kind of gets to do the deals for me. My mom said something really interesting, like, “With you starting to do well in your career that you always wanted to do,” she said, “I feel this massive weight lifted off of me or a sense of relief.” She feels that part of her purpose in life or her life's journey or calling was to support me in this. Now that it's gaining momentum, she said, “I feel this sense of relief for myself.” That made me cry. See below for views inside Storrie's Wednesday in L.A.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin McGarry, who plays Nathan Grant, shared some intriguing teasers about what lies ahead during a recent podcast appearance. McGarry revealed that the wildfire will impact this entire season of “When Calls the Heart.” In addition, the actor shared, he is confident everybody will be satisfied with how it is wrapped up. McGarry chatted with the podcasters behind “Hallmark Mysteries & More,” “Suspenders Unbuttoned,” and others during a group December 22 podcast. It was mentioned that during The Hallmark Christmas Experience, fellow “When Calls the Heart” star Jack Wagner provided a teaser that drew attention. Apparently, Wagner told fans that the character of Nathan would “really command more of the scenes throughout the season.” McGarry admitted he thought it was a very nice thing for Wagner to say. According to McGarry, this emergence of a more commanding Nathan begins during the episode airing on January 11. “We really get to see him specifically in episode two kind of step into this leader role where he is kind of leading the pack in the rescue,” McGarry explained. As viewers know, his daughter, Allie is out there, but so are others from Hope Valley. Luckily, it sounds as if everybody escapes relatively unharmed. However, that doesn't mean there's not more to come regarding the wildfire. He explained, “Sometimes stories get wrapped up pretty quickly, and they kind of feel unfinished and you wanna dive into it more.” In resolving the who and why questions behind the fire, everybody gets to do that deep dive. This sends an arc that affects every character right up until the final effort.” However, he did share that once answers emerge, “It's sad. Ultimately, McGarry foreshadowed, “The town really comes together to solve a massive problem and doing so everyone grows a little bit in certain ways.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman says she never agreed to let the Puerto Rican megastar include her voice on the songs "Solo de Mi" and "EoO." Bad Bunny has been sued by a woman who claims her voice is sampled on two hit songs from the Puerto Rican megastar without permission. The lawsuit, filed on Monday (Jan. 5) in Puerto Rico, alleges that Tainaly Serrano Rivera can be heard speaking on both “Solo de Mi,” a 2018 song off Bad Bunny's debut album X 100pre, as well as the track “EoO” from his latest No. Rivera is now suing for violations of Puerto Rico's right of publicity statute and seeking $16 million in damages from Bad Bunny (Benito Martínez Ocasio), La Paciencia (Roberto Rosado) and the star's record label Rimas Entertainment. According to the lawsuit, Bad Bunny and his collaborators improperly used Rivera's voice not just in the commercial releases of “Solo de Mi” and “EoO” — which hit No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively — but also in performances during his record-breaking San Juan residency last year. Rivera is represented in the case by attorneys Jose Marxuach Fagot and Joanna Bocanegra Ocasio. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
