At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? RFK Jr.'s new dietary guidelines ignore his own government's findings on the harms of alcohol. The US government now vaguely, in effect, says just don't drink too much. As part of the new federal dietary guidelines released this week, the Trump administration eliminated the previous specific recommended limits on alcohol consumption — two drinks or less per day for men and one drink for women. Now, the new guidelines say “consume less alcohol for better health. (It maintained the prior guidance discouraging a few certain groups — pregnant women and people who have a history of alcohol abuse — from drinking at all.) It's a major change that defies a growing public health consensus that people should drink as little alcohol as possible, because no amount of drinking is actually safe. A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health. To justify the change, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who oversees the Medicare and Medicaid programs, argued that there was no scientific evidence to justify specific limits on drinking alcohol. “The general move away from two glasses for men, one glass for women — there was never really good data to support that quantity of alcohol consumption,” he added. But instead, Oz and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have handed the alcohol industry a long-sought win in its battle against public health critics. For the whole sordid saga, you can check out our feature story from September. But here is a brief recap: In early 2022, the Biden administration launched the Alcohol Intake & Health Study, a new report on alcohol and its health effects to inform the next dietary guidelines due in 2025, a response to the increasing evidence that no amount of alcohol is safe. The World Health Organization had made such a declaration in 2023; in the US, more than 170,000 people die every year from alcohol-related causes. In response to this pressure, Congress approved in fall 2023 an alternate study to be overseen by the National Academies of Science and Medicine. Congressional hearings held by the lawmakers, who represented states where alcohol is a major industry, and letters they sent to the Department of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden on behalf of their constituents framed the original report as a witch hunt against alcohol. Nonetheless, both studies were undertaken, and their respective authors got to work. In December 2024, the National Academies report came out and stated that, with some very important limitations, the health effects of alcohol were marginal. But a draft version of the Alcohol Intake & Health Study was posted in January 2025, shortly before the end of the Biden administration, and it came to very different conclusions, as I wrote recently: They broke out their findings by different drinking levels — from one drink per day to three — and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. They decided to squash its public release, as I reported last fall, even as they claimed it would be taken into consideration for the forthcoming dietary guidelines. There was such a furor over that decision that even the authors of the National Academies report later published a commentary in the journal JAMA to make clear that their study should not be over-interpreted to justify more drinking or eliminating limits on drinking alcohol. Nevertheless, that is exactly what happened in the new dietary guidelines — a policy victory cheered by beer, wine, and liquor manufacturers. Oz must have thrown back a few cocktails for breakfast before making that comment,” Mike Marshall, president and CEO of the US Alcohol Policy Alliance, told me. “The federal government's own report, the Alcohol Intake & Health study, made it clear that there is overwhelming evidence that reducing consumption to less than 2 drinks per day dramatically reduces the chance of dying due to alcohol. What your favorite TikTok influencer gets right — and wrong — about this widespread concern. But thanks to new innovations, it's actually never been cheaper. The ability to actually change your life is a very modern kind of progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• US oversight in Venezuela: The US Senate yesterday advanced a measure to limit Trump's war powers in Venezuela as the country faces an uncertain future. “I have invited the current president of Venezuela so that we can act together in this objective,” he said. Some context: US President Donald Trump has previously said the US military campaign against Venezuela was aimed at fighting drug trafficking, and has repeatedly threatened to carry out operations against traffickers in Colombia, too, which Petro has opposed. On Wednesday, US tensions with Colombia seemingly eased after Trump spoke with Petro and invited him to meet at the White House in the “near future” ET), eight people had been released, including five Spanish citizens, whom CNN has reported on previously. Romero shared the list of eight individuals on his X account. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa is not yet on the list, but Romero said he is expected to be among those released. Opposition leader weighs in: Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo González wrote on X today that he held a call with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, in which he emphasized that the release of prisoners must be verified and “cannot be selective.” Members of the Trump administration told US lawmakers that they also made it clear to Venezuela it must release political prisoners, among other demands following the US capture of ousted leader Nicolás Maduro, a source previously told CNN. This post has been updated with González's comments on X and additional background. See how the country's oil infrastructure is mapped out below: President Donald Trump's announcement this morning that Big Oil will invest “at least” $100 billion in Venezuela has caught at least some in the industry by surprise. “We have no idea where this $100 billion figure is coming from,” one industry source told CNN. It could be that Trump is throwing this number out there to pressure the industry.” Trump is scheduled to meet with executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and other companies later today as part of his mission to revive Venezuela's battered oil industry. However, oil executives are reluctant to invest aggressively in Venezuela for a range of reasons, including security, rule of law and sanctions concerns. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum described the recent statements made by her US counterpart, Donald Trump, about possible ground attacks on cartels as the US president's “way of communicating” and said that, if necessary, they will speak with him “to strengthen coordination.” “Because of the statements President Trump has made in recent days, which we consider part of his communication style, I asked Foreign Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente yesterday to make direct contact with the Secretary of State and, if necessary, speak with President Trump to strengthen coordination,” Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference. “We've eliminated 97% of the drugs coming in by water, and now we're going to start attacking them on land, in relation to the cartels,” Trump said on Fox News. A US State Department team traveled to Venezuela on Friday for the first time since the ouster of Nicolás Maduro, according to a US official. A senior State Department official said Monday the department was “making preparations to allow for a reopening” of its embassy in Venezuela “should the president make that decision.” Former diplomats said that a lack of US presence on the ground would pose a challenge to rebuilding and ensuring accountability in Venezuela. President Donald Trump has said he wants to see US oil companies reopen their operations in the country and help with its rebuilding. The Olina tanker was sailing near Venezuela under a Timor-Leste flag, according to Marine Traffic. The White House said earlier this week that President Donald Trump was “not afraid” to continue seizing sanctioned oil tankers despite concerns that it could ratchet up tensions with Russia and China. “He's going to enforce our policy that's best for the United States of America,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday. President Donald Trump has no public events today, but he will be meeting with some top administration members and oil executives. Trump will then head to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. President Donald Trump is meeting with more than a dozen oil executives at the White House today as part of his effort to convince the energy companies to invest in rebuilding Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been leading the Trump administration's strategy toward Caracas; Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has already met with some oil executives this week; and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will join the president for the meeting, a White House official said. “Following the announcement of President Trump's historic energy deal with Venezuela, American oil companies will come to the White House to discuss investment opportunities that will restore Venezuelan oil infrastructure,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CNN. President Donald Trump said earlier today that he had canceled a “previously expected” second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the country's cooperation with the United States. It comes nearly a week after he ordered a military operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is currently in US custody along with his wife Cilia Flores. Shortly after that military operation, Trump said in a news conference, “We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so. … We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not.” “Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,” he added. Trump went on to say that Venezuela was “releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of ‘Seeking Peace,'” adding, “This is a very important and smart gesture.” President Donald Trump said Thursday that his administration will soon begin actions to target cartels on land, following the operation to capture Venezuela's leader to face drug trafficking charges and months of strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. “We've knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water, and we are gonna start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels,” Trump said on Fox News. CNN has reached out to the White House for additional information. Trump earlier this week said he had asked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum if she wanted the US military's help in rooting out drug cartels, warning that “Mexico has to get their act together.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE -A Meta logo is shown on a video screen at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, Calif., April 29, 2025. Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes. The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year. Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed. The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035. Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant in Pennsylvania. The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio to support Meta's data centers in the region. The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia said Friday it has used the new Oreshnik ballistic missile along with other weapons in a massive strike on Ukraine. This photo provided by the Ukrainian Security Service on Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, shows a fragment believed to be a part of a Russian Oreshnik intermediate range hypersonic ballistic missile that hit the Lviv region. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in a large-scale overnight attack, officials said Friday, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful, new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv's NATO allies. Europe's leaders condemned the attack as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and the European Union's top foreign policy envoy said Russian President Vladimir Putin's reply to diplomacy was “more missiles and destruction.” It comes as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow, which has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said four people were killed and at least 25 wounded in Kyiv as apartment buildings were struck overnight. Those killed included an emergency medical aid worker, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko. Four doctors and one police officer were injured while responding to the attacks, authorities said. About half of snowy Kyiv's apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — were left without heat amid daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit), Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Ukraine says it has proof Russia's latest barrage included an Oreshnik ballistic missile. Municipal services restored power and heat to public facilities, including hospitals and maternity wards, using portable boiler units, he said The attack damaged the Qatari Embassy in Kyiv, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who noted that Qatar has played a key role in mediating the exchange of prisoners of war. He called for a “clear response” from the international community, particularly from the U.S., which he said Russia takes seriously. Putin's attacks are brutal, they're cynical,” said U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, who was visiting Kyiv and noted the Russian drones were aimed at residential blocks. It was fired from Russia's Kapustin Yar test range near the Caspian Sea in southwestern Russia and targeted civilian infrastructure, investigators said. Russia's Defense Ministry said the attack was a retaliation to what Moscow claimed was a Ukrainian drone strike on one of Putin's residences last month. Both Trump and Ukraine rejected the Russian claim. Moscow didn't say where the Oreshnik hit, but Russian media and military bloggers said it targeted an underground natural gas storage facility in the Lviv region. Western military aid flows to Ukraine from a supply hub in Poland just across the border. Putin has previously said the Oreshnik streaks to its target at Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and is immune to any missile defense system. Several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack, according to Putin, who has warned the West that Russia could use it against allies of Kyiv that allow it to strike inside Russia with longer-range missiles. Analysts say it gives Russia a new element of psychological warfare, unnerving Ukrainians and intimidating Western countries that aid Ukraine. We demand strong responses to Russia's reckless actions,” he said in a post on X. EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the Oreshnik launch was “meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.” “Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction,” Kallas wrote on social media. Several districts in Kyiv were hit in the overnight attack, according to Tkachenko, the city's military administration chief. Dmytro Karpenko's windows were shattered in the attack on Kyiv. “What Russia is doing, of course, shows that they do not want peace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of protesters marched down one of Minneapolis' major thoroughfares Thursday night to voice outrage over Wednesday's shooting of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Hundreds gathered outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday in protest after authorities said federal immigration officers shot and wounded two people in a vehicle outside a hospital. Federal officials claim an immigration agent, who has not been identified, acted in self-defense when shooting and killing a Minneapolis driver. A Chicago law professor offers context on when lethal force is legally justified. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he's dismayed that the FBI and Justice Department have blocked the state out of the investigation into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer's fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) Moriarty said that although her office has collaborated effectively with the FBI in past cases, she is concerned by the Trump administration's decision to bar state and local agencies from playing any role in the investigation into Wednesday's killing of Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Moriarty said she isn't sure what legal outcome the evidence her office receives from the public might produce. Moriarty also said that her office would offer a link for the public to submit videos that captured the fatal shooting. The prosecutor's news conference came as another round of protests were planned for Friday in Minneapolis over the Good's killing and a day after federal immigration officers shot and wounded two people in Portland, Oregon. Hundreds of people protesting the Wednesday shooting of Renee Good marched in freezing rain Thursday night down one of Minneapolis' major thoroughfares, chanting “ICE out now!” and holding signs saying, “Killer ice off our streets.” The day began with a charged demonstration outside of a federal facility that is serving as a hub for the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Authorities erected barricades outside the facility Friday. City workers, meanwhile, removed barricades made of old Christmas trees and other debris that had been blocking the streets near where the ICE officer shot Good as she tried to drive away. The shooting in Portland, Oregon, took place outside a hospital Thursday afternoon. A man and woman, identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Venezuela nationals Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, were shot inside a vehicle, and their conditions were not immediately known. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the city council called on ICE to end all operations in the city until a full investigation is completed. Hundreds protested Thursday night at a local ICE building. Just as it did following Good's shooting, DHS defended the actions of the officers in Portland, saying it occurred after a Venezuelan man with alleged gang ties and who was involved in a recent shooting tried to “weaponize” his vehicle to hit the officers. AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is generating more protests and another shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have repeatedly characterized the Minneapolis shooting as an act of self-defense and cast Good as a villain, suggesting she used her vehicle as a weapon to attack the officer who shot her. But state and local officials and protesters rejected that characterization, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying video recordings show the self-defense argument is “garbage.” The government is also shifting immigration officers to Minneapolis from sweeps in Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. This represents a pivot, as the Louisiana crackdown that began in December had been expected to last into February. Her death — at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since Trump took office — has resonated far beyond Minneapolis, as protests happening in other places, including Texas, California, Detroit and Missouri. In Washington, D.C., on Thursday, a woman held a sign that said, “Stop Trump's Gestapo,” as hundreds of people marched to the White House. A day before Moriarty called on the public to help her office investigate Good's killing, the Minnesota agency that investigates officer-involved shootings said it was told that the FBI and U.S. Justice Department would not work with it, effectively ending any role for the state to determine if crimes were committed. Noem said the state has no jurisdiction. Tim Walz demanded that the state be allowed to take part, repeatedly emphasizing that it would be “very difficult for Minnesotans” to accept that an investigation excluding the state could be fair. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop. The federal agent who fatally shot Good is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and ICE, according to records obtained by AP. Noem has not publicly named him, but a Homeland Security spokesperson said her description of his injuries last summer refers to an incident in Bloomington, Minnesota, in which court documents identify him as Jonathan Ross. Ross got his arm stuck in the window of a vehicle whose driver was fleeing arrest on an immigration violation. Attempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not successful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. officials are building a case that ongoing measles outbreaks in South Carolina and other states are unrelated to last year's major outbreak in Texas, as it tries to retain its status of having eliminated the disease after recording the highest number of confirmed infections in three decades. To be considered measles-free by the World Health Organization, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer. A large outbreak of measles in Texas kicked off 2025 in January and spread to several states, followed by large outbreaks along the Arizona-Utah border and in South Carolina that continue to cause infections. As a measles outbreak burns through South Carolina, not enough people are getting vaccinated In November, the Pan American Health Organization - part of the WHO - determined that Canada had lost its measles elimination status after nearly three decades due to its failure to curb a year-long outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease. PAHO this year will evaluate U.S. measles data, which involves 2,065 confirmed cases, to see if it can keep the measles elimination status it has had since 2000. State public health officials have used traditional methods of interviewing infected individuals to identify chains of transmission, as well as comparing the viral genotype - a section of the virus' DNA - to see if cases are related. That still may not be sufficient to link cases in a large outbreak, experts said. Kelly Oakeson, who leads next-generation sequencing at the Utah Public Health Laboratory, said none of the patients interviewed in Utah mentioned travel to Texas or contact with people from Texas, but many gave incomplete information. “We don't think there is a direct link,” he said in an email, adding that the state has been working with CDC, Texas and Arizona to characterize transmission patterns. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been analyzing the entire genetic code of virus samples to determine if the outbreaks are related, a newer technique that has not traditionally been used to assess measles transmission. In a December 5 post on X, CDC Acting Director Jim O'Neill said there was no epidemiological evidence linking the Texas outbreak and the ongoing cases in South Carolina. A U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman confirmed that the CDC has found no epidemiological evidence linking ongoing outbreaks to Texas, but said many recent U.S. cases share the same genotype and have no known source of infection, “which could indicate ongoing domestic transmission.” “No cases linked the two outbreaks in any clear way,” said Brewer, who chairs an independent committee that will analyze the U.S. data and make a report to PAHO on whether it agrees with the U.S. assessment. There are many gaps in epidemiological knowledge in the U.S. outbreaks and not all cases are identified or reported, said Johns Hopkins' Moss, so you can miss cases linking two outbreaks. That could lead scientists to incorrectly conclude that two viruses are different when it was just a sampling problem, Moss said. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former CDC director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who quit in August over concerns about U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said PAHO will make the call based on the evidence it receives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? As President Donald Trump settles into his last term, his approval ratings sinking ever lower, an urgent new question has begun to coalesce at the center of MAGA: Would the movement survive without Trump's force of personality? What kind of person has the juice to lead it besides Trump? While the question remains unanswered, a new archetype has abruptly acquired stature among the MAGA faithful, an archetype that is in some ways a photographic negative of crass, mud-slinging, macho Trump. As Erika Kirk strives to take over her husband's legacy at Turning Point USA, and Marjorie Taylor Greene remakes her image amid her retirement from the House of Representatives, both are building their image around the idea of a Christian woman who is notable for her godliness, grace, and mercy. Erika Kirk rocketed to political stardom at the September memorial service for her late husband, Charlie Kirk, when she publicly forgave his assassin. Trump, speaking immediately after Kirk, made a point of saying in response that he hated his enemies and would never forgive them. While Trump has profited from his alliance with the Christian right, he's never embodied any of the movement's traditional virtues. Kirk, outlets declared, showed what Christian forgiveness really could look like. “The most admirable aspects of religion — mercy, charity, grace and contemplation — were found in Mrs. Kirk's words, not Mr. Trump's,” wrote Zaid Jilani for the New York Times. “I can only pray that today's Christian right finds more inspiration in her than him.” “With her powers of communication, moving story, and personal connection, Erika Kirk could end up the next Billy Graham. A post on the r/Christianity subreddit described Kirk as “a new archetype of the conservative Christian woman: graceful, media-savvy, intellectually aligned, and unapologetically committed to a vision of biblical womanhood that is both traditional and powerfully public.” The question, the poster added, wasn't “if she will become a major leader, but how quickly.” “It just shows where his heart is,” Greene said. “And that's the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.” Inspired, Greene reportedly texted a friend, “I wanted to be more like Christ.” She has since publicly apologized for “taking part in the toxic politics,” while remaining vague about what parts of her behavior she actually feels the need to apologize for. As religious studies scholar Katherine Kelaidis has written for Vox, the forgiving Christian woman is a familiar archetype within faith narratives, going back to the medieval concept of the forgiving queen who intercedes with a vengeful king. “It was also a model that allowed for women to have a significant public role while not transgressing normative ideas of femininity. Say, for example, Erika Kirk becoming the CEO of Turning Point USA.” Yet the fact that both Kirk and Greene have made a point of adopting this image during moments of transition in their image suggests — without making any claims as to the sincerity of their faith — that they have both made the calculation that MAGA wants a change from Trump as the movement develops beyond his presidency. That their threat to Trump's power is real can perhaps be seen through the backlash both Greene and Kirk have faced as they make their moves. As Erika Kirk spends ever more time in public, a narrative has begun to brew that she is using her husband's death opportunistically to climb the political ladder. “Everyone grieves differently,” someone will post, or “Normal widows: ‘I miss my husband. Trump, meanwhile, has dubbed Greene “Marjorie ‘Traitor' Greene.“ She has never cultivated many congressional allies outside the MAGA faithful, and now she's isolated even from them. “I'm, like, radioactive” on both sides of the political aisle, Greene told the New York Times, adding that she plans to retire from politics for good. The central question about MAGA since its emergence as a force in American politics has been: Is the movement simply a cult of personality built around Donald Trump and his whims? If the movement embraces and elevates a figure whose image is built in opposition to Trump's, we may finally have an answer to that question. Is the internet really worse than it used to be, or are some of us just getting older? Why young women are opting out of dating and embracing singlehood.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “second wave of attacks” was not publicly known, and it is currently unknown when they were supposed to have occurred. The impetus for Trump's decision appears to be Venezuela's release of political prisoners. “Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of ‘Seeking Peace,'” Trump said in his post. “This is a very important and smart gesture.” Venezuela's interim government announced it would free an “important number” of political prisoners held under the former Maduro regime, the Washington Examiner previously reported. “In order to contribute and collaborate in the effort that all of us must make for national unity and peaceful coexistence, the Bolivarian government, together with the institutions of the state, has decided to free an important number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals,” Rodriguez said on Thursday. Trump expressed optimism about the joint efforts in rebuilding Venezuela so far, stating that the interim administration and the U.S. are “working well together.” He then stated that it was due to these acceptable cooperative efforts that he decided to call off the previously unknown strikes. “Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled [sic] the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes.” He also added that oil corporations would be investing over $100 billion into new initiatives in Venezuela. “At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL, all of whom I will be meeting with today at The White House,” Trump added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Somewhere between what had been a previously unimaginable football commute from Pasadena, California, to Bloomington, Indiana, the first day of January bled into the second. One door had not, per the cliché, closed. Yet, as the Hoosiers flew home, another door had, in fact, opened. And so while his players slept, his fanbase celebrated and a semifinal game loomed, Curt Cignetti went into the office and met with recruits to talk about the next season. Meanwhile, in Oxford, Mississippi, an equally giddy and slightly more vindictive fanbase had all of about 30 minutes to celebrate their team's win. Then the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, leaving Ole Miss fans to wonder if their offensive coachmen might turn back into mice. Or, more accurately, in this case, rats. Jilted by Lane Kiffin, Ole Miss nonetheless beat Georgia in the Sugar Bowl but Pete Golding, the new man in charge, wasn't quite sure which of his coaches would be coming with him to prep for a semifinal date with Miami and who was making the short ride across the bayou to Baton Rouge. As it turned out, Joe Cox and George McDonald abandoned ship. The tight ends coach and wide receivers coach joined Kiffin, allowing the Rebels to go on without them. “Do they want to be here?” Golding said of his former co-workers. While all of this was going on across the country, retro recruits (also known as high school seniors) were saying goodbye to their families, their pals and their proms. Early college enrollment beckoned, even if high school graduation hadn't yet happened. They needed to get a jump on things to stake their claim on a roster, even if the same coaches who months earlier promised them the moon and the stars were currently recruiting over them by entertaining guys in the portal. And in ordinary academic buildings and offices tucked up in the corners of the athletic department, university registrars and academic advisors were setting their hair on fire, trying to figure out how to approve transcripts and shoehorn new students into classes that were already full. The college football calendar is a mess. But rather than merely try to undo what's been done, perhaps it's time to figure out what the point of it all is. Not only how college football got into this quagmire, but also if anyone is actually benefiting from it all. “What I'll say is … it has made football teams and it's made coaches and players better at handling chaos,'' Oregon head coach Dan Lanning said. If you untangle the mess that is now college football's January and try to figure out where it all got sideways, it might be wise to go back to 1991. That's when Georgia quarterback Eric Zeier decided to enroll in college a semester before graduating from high school. An exemplary student, Zeier took advantage of a dual enrollment program and made the jump from Marietta to Athens. It was, however, easy to write Zeier off as an exception, not a norm, until a  decade later, Maurice Clarett did the same at Ohio State. Clarett intentionally doubled down on classes in his junior season and took classes in the summer, all with the idea of jumpstarting his college progression. By 2007, Florida brought nine kids in early and Clemson five more. Coaches could evaluate their whole team during spring ball, rather than wait to sort out starting rotations in the fall. This year, 32 players will get an early jump on college at USC. Trevor Lawrence enrolled at Clemson in January 2018 and started that September. Arch Manning enrolled at Texas in January 2023. Carter Smith arrived at Indiana in January 2022. An athletic offensive lineman who not only starred in the trenches but led his volleyball team to a state semifinal and 20 wins as a junior, he left Olentangy Liberty after his football season and went to Bloomington in January. A few months later, his high school volleyball team won the state title. “That wasn't the greatest,'' he says now. But Smith insists he would do it all over again. “It really opened my eyes to how much more of the game I needed to learn,'' he said. “If you decide to come early, that's a big step in your career. Smith wound up redshirting his freshman season. A great player is great only until the next even greater player comes along at his position. Given the chance to grow a linebacker over time or plug in an experienced older one right now, coaches are going old every time. There are only 105 spots on a college football roster, and little time to waste in a win-now culture. Consequently, while an early enrollment may show a player's commitment to the program, there is no promise that said commitment will be returned. In January 2024, Parker Livingstone, a Texas native who long dreamed of wearing the burnt orange, happily left his high school for Austin. He wound up redshirting as a freshman but became a starter this year for the Longhorns, catching 29 passes from his roommate Arch Manning. “Never in a million years did I think I would be going into the portal looking for a new home,'' he wrote on his Instagram post. “Some things are out of my control. Two days later, Texas brought Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman to campus for a visit. Oregon started its winter semester on Monday. College football players are still, by definition at least, students. Except at most schools, spring classes not only start before the portal begins, but the deadlines to drop or add classes are usually well before January 16. “It is,''  says Kyle Ross, the executive director of NACADA, a not-for-profit that offers networking for academic advisors, “a lift.'' A state school move to another state school is fairly uncomplicated, with most courses already scrubbed and articulated into the system. “But with what's being asked with football transfers, it can be as tight as 24 hours or less. Approving transfer credits, though, is only the beginning. By the time most football players are looking to transfer, regular students have long since crafted their new schedule. Here's why college football fans around the country are taking their shirts off on Saturdays An administrator at one Power 5 school who asked not to be named told CNN Sports that faculty at their institution had been asked to hold as many as 70 spots for possible new football players. “Miracles can happen and mountains, I know, have been moved, but it's not easy.'' No doubt few are concerned about such things as academic success, but Ross is. He worries about students enrolling in an 11-week class three weeks after it started. “That, I know, creates even more frustration for the faculty,'' he said. “They allow someone into their class, but they're thinking to themselves, ‘I really shouldn't be letting them in now. I'm only setting them up for failure. This is, of course, what started the current round of handwringing and – as usual – Lane Kiffin got the sport boiling. He not only went through a messy divorce with Ole Miss, exiting just as the Rebels started their playoff march; he doubled down by then making it clear he expected the assistants who were joining him at LSU to choose portal recruiting over semifinal coaching. James Madison's Bob Chesney is the new UCLA head coach; he didn't leave for Westwood until after the Dukes lost. Oregon's offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator both accepted head coaching jobs elsewhere – Will Stein at Kentucky and Tosh Lupoi at Cal. “The timing isn't perfect,'' Lanning said of his staff's fluidity, “but it's been done before.” It is certainly not ideal that coaches have to split time between recruiting and game prep at such a critical part of the season, but that's hardly new. College basketball coaches routinely fly out on the heels of an afternoon practice to scout a recruit, and zip back the next day. “For me, it's been a philosophy of take the calendar, what fits best for us, how can we work the calendar to be an advantage to us in how we run our program,'' Minnesota's PJ Fleck told the New York Times six years ago. “For us, it's all about getting a jump-start on next year.''</p>

Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway joins ‘America's Newsroom' to break down divisions within the Democratic Party as leaders search for a new direction. FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic National Committee filed a Supreme Court amicus brief Thursday seeking to counter the Republican Party in a major election law case this year — setting the stage for a high-stakes court clash that could determine the fate of millions of mail-in ballots nationwide. The Supreme Court agreed in November to take up the case, Watson v. Republican National Committee, which centers on states' ability to count mail-in ballots that are received within five days of an election. At issue is a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee and Mississippi GOP in 2024, which seeks to overturn a state voting law that allows for the counting of late-arriving mail-in ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day, so long as they arrive within five business days of the election. The RNC and state GOP have argued that they break with federal voting laws — a point vehemently disputed by other states and the DNC. In the amicus brief, provided exclusively to Fox News Digital, lawyers for the party urged the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court ruling handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, noting the dozens of states that currently allow mail-in ballots to be counted, so long as they are postmarked before, or on Election Day. "Throughout this Nation's history, the term 'election' has been universally understood to refer to the voters' act of choosing an officeholder—not to the later administrative acts of receiving or counting ballots," the DNC said in its amicus brief. In their amicus brief, lawyers for the DNC emphasized the widespread use of mail-in ballots by many voters, including by seniors, voters with disabilities or members of the military. "If the Supreme Court rules for the RNC, voters around the country will be disenfranchised by mail delays, and key protections for military and overseas voters could be eliminated," they noted in a press release sent alongside the brief. "Republicans' continued assault on mail-in voting is an attack on our democracy and is wholly un-American," DNC Chairman Ken Martin told Fox News Digital in a statement. "Donald Trump and the RNC want to limit the rights of voters because they know that when more eligible voters make their voices heard, Republicans lose," he added. "Voting by mail is safe, secure, and empowers voters who would otherwise struggle reaching a ballot box, including seniors and people with disabilities, members of the military and their families, and working families who are unable to take the day off to vote." Mississippi's attorney general appealed the case to the Supreme Court in June after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in 2024 that the state's mail-in ballot laws violated federal law, ruling that all mail-in ballots must be cast and received by Election Day in order to be legally counted. The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/J. Critics also noted that the timing of a possible ruling could wreak havoc on the 2026 midterm elections, primarily for voters that live overseas, including members of the military. They argued that upending the ruling before an election could yield "chaos and suspicions of impropriety," especially if "thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election."

It is early December 2025, and McMahon has just kicked off a 50-state “History Rocks!” barnstorm in Pennsylvania as part of an effort to engage with schoolchildren across the country about civics as well as instilling the aspirations of patriotism. McMahon said in an interview with the Washington Examiner after her first of three events that the entire effort is a way to engage with young people to explain the importance and joy of patriotism, “as well as to draw us all together to enjoy our shared understanding of America's founding principles.” McMahon, who was also making stops in Delaware and New Jersey as part of this trip, said the experience of working with the pre-K through fifth grade children on this day has already inspired her. McMahon, who was brought up in the South and started her school day with the Pledge of Allegiance and the Lord's Prayer, said she was stunned to find out in her new home state of Connecticut that there was no Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem to open her granddaughter's high school graduation ceremony. “I was so struck by that,” she said. “And so then I went back to find out a little bit about just schools in Greenwich, Connecticut. So when Flag Day approached last June, she had the Education Department get approval ahead of time to distribute little flags for the children to have. “And I thought, ‘Wow, I really believe that they don't love their country because they don't know their country, or at least they haven't really been immersed in the history of the country, what our country has gone through, how it's evolved, and what a special place this is. Her second stop of the day was in Delaware at St. Georges Technical High School, the first vocational technical high school she has visited in her role as the education secretary. “I've been to community colleges, but this was the first 9-12 technology school that I've attended,” she said, adding that as part of her tour, she had her finger pricked by the students studying to be surgical technicians. I said, ‘I'd be very happy with just a finger prick today, thank you very much,'” she said, laughing. “I was talking an 11th grader that he said that when he graduated, he would have a certificate to go on into a professional position in a hospital as a tech person, and he was so thrilled to be able to have the opportunity to start a job, to start earning a living, which would help pay if he wanted to then expand his career,” she said. Part of what she discussed at St. Georges was that its students are considered highly skilled and really sought after in the community once they graduate. “In fact, a local Ford dealership donated a F-150 truck to the automotive repair class, and they will hire every student that passes through that course that works on the F-150,” she said. “They said the skills gap is so profound that they can't train students fast enough to meet the demand.” That skills gap was one of the comments she made to President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting in December 2025. “I think that we're at a national emergency point with education in general in our country, but if we look at the skilled workforce, if we want to bring all of this technology and this manufacturing and all back to our country, we have to focus on training our skilled labor force,” McMahon said of her conversation with Trump. Our culture is changing on that thought process, she said, “and that is really key now to understanding the fastest growing group of millionaires in the country are our skilled workforce.” While in the Pennsylvania State Capitol, McMahon met with Republican legislators to talk about giving states control of educational programming by dismantling the U.S. Department of Education. In terms of Cabinet-level agencies, the Education Department is a relative newcomer. At its inception, it was, in fact, called the Department of Education during President Andrew Johnson's administration when he signed legislation creating it. However, its mission was to collect information and gather statistics. Social strife in the 1960s, along with massive government expansion under President Lyndon Johnson, led to a rallying cry for the federal government to have a larger hand in the education of American children. In October 1979, Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act, and the department, as we now know it, began operations in May 1980. American public education was turned on its head by school boards and teachers unions with prolonged shutdowns, remote learning, masking, and many school districts not reopening for an entire year. All of which led to not just a distinct lag in students' academic performances, but also emotional damage, as students have struggled to reconnect after the dramatic extended shutdowns. During his campaign for a second term, Trump pledged to shut down the Education Department. Several weeks after he was sworn in last year, he signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the department. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) told her not long ago. and most of everyone's hands in the room went up,” she recounted. “He said, ‘Well, imagine that, we all graduated from high school and there was no Department of Education. We've tried and, I think, with the best of intentions.” “You just can't dictate it through a bureaucracy,” she said. McMahon said they have started moving things out of the Education Department on what she calls a proof-of-concept basis. “So our first one that we signed was with the Department of Labor, where we moved about 12 employees from the Department of Education over to the Department of Labor.” The overall supervision of employees is with an Education Department supervisor, but they will now work in conjunction with a designated group of employees from the Labor Department to integrate education and labor. “After a period of time when we believe we have done that successfully, then we will want to ask Congress to codify and make that move permanent,” she said, adding that is the larger goal. McMahon has told every member of Congress whom she has had an opportunity to talk to that this is not a back-of-the-napkin, willy-nilly program. McMahon noted that the Labor Department has a more developed system for the distribution of grants that are awarded. “Our system at the Department of Education could best be described as being held together by bubble gum and rubber bands, so over at the Department of Labor, we've been able to utilize their system and already distribute grants,” she said. “So why would we try to reinvent the wheel at the Department of Education when we can blend in and move things that were always in other agencies and not in the Department of Education and have them operate with greater expertise and more efficiency?” McMahon concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Outrage in Minneapolis: Protesters are rallying a few blocks from the street where an ICE agent fatally shot a Minneapolis woman. Tim Walz has authorized the state's National Guard to support local law enforcement. • Scrutiny over investigation: Amid calls for a transparent investigation, the FBI has taken over the probe, with a Minnesota agency saying it has been blocked from accessing key materials. View CNN's video analysis of the incident here. Two people are hospitalized after they were shot by federal agents, the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement. It is not immediately clear what their conditions are. Today at 2:18 p.m. PT, Portland police officers responded to the 10200 block of Southeast Main Street for a report of a shooting, the release said. Officers confirmed federal agents had been involved in the shooting, they said. At 2:24 p.m., officers responded to a man and a woman who had been shot near Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, where they were transported to the hospital, the release said. It is not immediately clear why the different locations were reported. “We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for further information. This post has been updated with additional information. Across the street from a growing memorial where Renee Nicole Good's SUV came to rest, Francesca Taylor is still processing what she saw Wednesday. At first, Taylor didn't know who was shot or whether the person would survive.“Once I could see inside the vehicle, I knew there was no chance she was alive. And that was just a really devastating feeling to see the blood of a dead woman from my front porch,” she said. Taylor describes her neighborhood as artsy and eclectic, with friendly, welcoming neighbors. As people lay flowers and chant in honor of the 37-year-old mother of three who was killed, one woman is handing out warm tea to strangers. “It's a really sad day,” the woman shared. “I'm just trying to be sad with other people that I love and people that I don't love yet, but might figure out a way to love.” A few blocks away from where a woman was shot and killed by an ICE agent yesterday, a energized crowd of people has gathered protesting the presence of the agency in the city. They are packed tightly on a street corner holding signs, banners and flags. One large banner in the front appears to have a picture of President Donald Trump on it. The Department of Homeland Security is not naming the ICE agent who fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis yesterday, but did provide a little more background on the agent's experience. The agent has over 10 years of experience as an ICE Deportation Officer and is on the agency's Special Response Team, which requires 30 hours of tryouts to be considered, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. To qualify for the team, agents are required to participate in a basic operator course, maintain expert marksman qualification on all issued firearms, and have ongoing training in specialized skills like “breaching techniques, perimeter control, advanced firearms training, hostage rescue, and more,” she said. The video below walks through them, showing nuance in what happened. What took place prior to the shooting remains unclear. What took place prior to the shooting remains unclear. Demonstrators have started to gather at the scene of the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent ahead of a planned protest, aerial video from CNN affiliate KARE showed. The protest is slated to begin at 5:30 p.m. CT. People in Minnesota have the right to protest in wake of the fatal ICE shooting of Renee Nicole Good but should do so safely and lawfully to avoid creating hazards, threatening safety or disrupting emergency services, said the state's department of public safety. The agency outlined a list of lawful ways to “express your views,” including gathering in public areas where pedestrians are allowed, marching or walking — though not on roadways — as well as engaging in chants and speeches and displaying signs. “We encourage Minnesotans to rely on official information from local sources as they make plans,” the department said. The Minnesota National Guard is on standby “out of an abundance of caution” as people protest in the city a day after an ICE agent there shot and killed a US citizen, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tim Walz authorized the state's National Guard to help support local law enforcement. “Making sure that folks are demonstrating peacefully is incredibly important. She said so far the demonstrations have been peaceful, but emphasized that she understands people are demonstrating because they are angry. “We all saw with our own eyes video footage from, you know, multiple vantage points, and now Donald Trump and Kristi Noem are trying to spin this tale that somehow that's not exactly what happened,” she said. Flanagan said the administration's argument that ICE is in cities to make people safer is “complete and utter baloney.” She echoed other local officials in calling for ICE to leave the state. “They should leave us alone because all we have seen is that they have caused chaos and terror in our communities,” she said. Asked if she believes that ICE should be abolished, Flanagan didn't answer directly, but said that “how they are acting right now is unconstitutional.” The lieutenant governor said the “current model” of the agency should be “thrown out.” This post has been updated with additional comments from Flanagan. As law enforcement deployed some kind of crowd repellant, protesters began running away. Smoke or gas can be seen in the air. This post has been updated with additional details from our team covering the protest. Tim Walz has authorized the state's National Guard to help support local law enforcement as tensions have risen in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Renee Good. The National Guard will help protect critical infrastructure and maintain public safety, a news release from Walzs' office said. “They remain ready in the event they are needed to help keep the peace, ensure public safety, and allow for peaceful demonstrations.” He also thanked Minnesotans as they have “met this moment,” adding “we have every reason to believe that peace will hold.” This post has been updated with additional information. “It feels a little like you're choking in your chest, and it feels like you're trying to catch your breath. It's a burning sensation in your nostrils as well,” she described. The situation flared after a caravan of cars carrying Border Patrol agents arrived and agitated protesters, many of whom are already angry. Homeland Security's assistant secretary  called yesterday — when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman — “a heavy day.” She said the same officer involved in yesterday's fatal shooting was also the subject of another recent violent incident. She said the officer was dragged for 50 yards, had to get 33 stitches and “clung onto his life.” She went on to maintain that shooting victim Renee Nicole Good, 37, “was stalking agents all day long” and “impeding our law enforcement” before the officer “had to fire a defensive shot.” McLaughlin said officers then “immediately got medics” and an ambulance to the scene. Protesters gathered at the Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis today scuffled with a lone demonstrator showing support for ICE this afternoon. Standing with federal agents — and US Border Patrol behind him — the man was holding an American flag and a bullhorn. Protesters were also yelling back, telling him he, too, was an immigrant on stolen land, and that ICE wasn't helping him, either. Do not give them your attention,” the person said. Another pro-ICE counterprotester also joined him at one point. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which prosecutes crime in the Minneapolis area, said it is “exploring all options to ensure a state level investigation can continue” after the FBI rescinded its cooperation agreement. “We are speaking to our local partners on paths forward that will allow us to review the investigation and be transparent in our decision making.” Aidan Perzana woke up yesterday to the sound of honking and whistles in his Minneapolis neighborhood — a sign that ICE agents were in the area. What happened next has caused outrage and protests to sweep across the city today. He said his neighbor heard that the driver was getting conflicting orders from the agents: Some telling her to move her car, some telling her to get out of the vehicle. When a third man approached the car and started pulling the door handle, Good backed up and changed directions, Perzana said. Good's car crashed off the road after she was shot. In the minutes before emergency responders arrived, Perzana said agents “didn't pull her out of the car or anything. Here's a roundup of our reporting from the Twin Cities, where CNN teams have been watching protests since this morning: CNN's Alisha Ebrahimji, Holly Yan, Brian Abel, Victor Ramirez, Karina Tsui, Rebekah Riess, Priscilla Alvarez and Boney Kapp contributed to this report. General policy within Immigration and Customs Enforcement is to not chase vehicles or fire at them unless there is imminent danger, said John Amaya, a former deputy chief of staff for the agency during the Obama administration. Agents are also trained to be aware of other people around them in these situations to avoid harming them, Amaya added. “I have heard from a number of career professionals within the agency that one of their concerns before any of this ever happened was that these people were not going to be trained properly, they were going to be thrown into the field and collectively thrown into operations that they have no business conducting because they're not trained for crowd control,” he said. “That someone was going to end up shot, either a citizen, either a migrant, someone from the press, some other innocent bystander, or another fellow agent,” Amaya said. While the ICE agent who shot Good was experienced, Amaya emphasized agents are not trained in crowd control or to interact with residents, which makes certain interactions “a recipe for disaster.” And until some policies change, it's going to happen again,” he said. The ICE officer who shot and killed a Minnesota woman as she was driving forward in her SUV Wednesday was dragged more than 50 yards in a separate incident over the summer, when he became trapped in a vehicle during an arrest, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN. Munoz-Guatemala was later arrested after driving a mile further. Vice President JD Vance addressed the incident at a news conference today, saying it “led to over 30 stitches and very serious injuries to his legs.” The same ICE officer was seen in video yesterday walking around the back side of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good's vehicle toward the front as another officer pulled on Good's car door. The officer walked in front of Good's car before she began driving forward. We've been receiving updates on yesterday's fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis from both state and federal authorities, whose descriptions of the incident have differed significantly at times. If you're just joining us, here's a recap of the comments from officials so far: CNN's Alisha Ebrahimji, Holly Yan, Brian Abel, Victor Ramirez, Karina Tsui, Rebekah Riess, Priscilla Alvarez and Boney Kapp contributed to this report. The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it was ramping up its investigations in Minneapolis. “We will not be impeded from ending the FRAUD that has ABUSED our nation's generosity. Context: Earlier this week, DHS said its agents were in Minnesota conducting a large scale investigation on fraud allegations at day care centers and other places.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner held a press conference on Thursday and issued a stark warning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Krasner told ICE officers who are in his city, or planning to come to his city, to “get the F out of here” if they were coming to “commit crimes.” Krasner's press conference was in response to the death of Renee Good, who was shot after seemingly driving her car into an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this week. Because Donald Trump cannot pardon you for a state court conviction.” Krasner added that if any federal law enforcement officer committed a crime in his city, they would indeed face jail time. “Do you hear me, ICE agents?” Krasner said. Krasner's words were the latest in his rebuke of President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts throughout the country. In the past, Krasner has regularly objected to the deployment of National Guard troops in cities throughout the United States and has been an ardent critic of Trump, frequently calling him a “fascist” and a “Nazi” and often comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Krasner did specify that his comments were not for all law enforcement officers, but rather for those who allegedly break the law. “There are honest, decent, moral law enforcement officers by the bushel. “This is for any one of your colleagues who thinks they are above the law.”</p>

Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on lawmakers considering guardrails for college sports spending on ‘Special Report.' The Miami Hurricanes are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, coming away with a narrow victory over Ole Miss, 31-27, in an all-time postseason contest. But Miami will do so on their home turf, with the National Championship Game being played at Hard Rock Stadium – the site of their home games. The game began slowly for both teams, with only Miami getting on the scoreboard in the first quarter with a field goal on their 13-play opening drive. Charmar Brown of the Miami (FL) Hurricanes celebrates a run in the first quarter of the 2025 College Football Playoff Semifinal at State Farm Stadium on Jan. 8, 2026 in Glendale, Arizona. But this game was back and forth for quite some time, including the ensuing Hurricanes drive as quarterback Carson Beck led the way on a 15-play touchdown series with a CharMar Brown rushing score from four yards out. The game was deadlocked at 10 apiece when Beck decided to air it out to Keelan Marion, and it was worth the risk. Marion made the grab for a 52-yard touchdown to help Miami go up 17-13 at halftime. The third quarter was an odd one for both squads, as their opening drives resulted in a missed field goal apiece. There was no absence of electric plays when it mattered most in the final 15 minutes, as Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss got his team downfield enough to take a 19-17 lead with a field goal. With a 24-19 lead and five minutes left to play in the game, Chambliss and the Rebels' offense had quite enough time to retake the lead. He did just that, finding trusty tight end Dae'Quan Wright for 24 yards to send the Rebels faithful ballistic. Ole Miss wanted to go for two in hopes of making it a three-point lead, and Chambliss came through again, finding a wide open Caleb Odom for the key score. On a crucial third-and-10 just inside field goal range, Beck was confident with his pass to Marion to get well within range. Another pass to Marion made it first-and-goal, and it was clear Miami wasn't trying to force overtime. How fitting was it that Beck, scanning the field, found a seam to his left and just sprinted for the colored paint to score the game-winner with 18 seconds left. But things got fascinating at the end, with Ole Miss going 40 yards in just a few seconds to set up a Hail Mary for the win. In the box score, Beck was 23-of-37 for 268 yards with his two passing touchdowns and an interception. Marion was a key player in the victory with seven catches for 114 yards, while Mark Fletcher Jr. set the tone in the ground game with 133 yards rushing on 22 carries. Toney also tallied 81 receiving yards for Miami. For Ole Miss, Chambliss also went 23-of-37 for 277 yards with his touchdown to Wright, who finished with 64 yards on three grabs. De'Zhaun Stribling was five for 77 through the air, while Lacy rushed for 103 yards on 11 carries.

The Missouri Attorney General's Office announced Wednesday that a Chinese national was arrested last month after allegedly photographing two U.S. Air Force bases and its military equipment, including B-2 Spirit stealth bombers. While Qu was initially arrested by immigration authorities, he was later released due to a lack of detention space and was given an immigration removal proceeding scheduled for 2027, officials said. The attorney's office said investigators first caught Wu on Dec. 2 near Whiteman Air Force Base, home to the military's B‑2 Spirit stealth bomber fleet, an exceptionally sensitive asset due to its nuclear and stealth capabilities. After initially receiving a warning, Wu reportedly returned the following day. Authorities then arrested Wu, who was allegedly found in possession of 18 photos and videos of the base. He also admitted to taking photos of another U.S. Air Force base, officials said, without naming the second location. He faces one count of taking photographs of a vital military installation and military equipment without authorization. Officials said that on Dec. 2, a suspicious minivan with a Massachusetts license plate was reported near the perimeter of Whiteman Air Force Base. Patrol officers then found Wu, who said he was there to observe the B‑2 Spirit aircraft, and informed him that he was not permitted to take photographs or record video of the military installation. Agents reportedly found Wu again, who admitted to taking videos of the B‑2 Spirit aircraft and numerous photographs of the base, including its perimeter fencing, a gate and military equipment. Wu handed over his phone, which contained 18 images and videos, and admitted to authorities that he photographed another U.S. Air Force base and its aircraft, officials said. According to court documents, Wu is a Chinese national who illegally entered the United States on June 22, 2023, near Nogales, Arizona, but was released after promising to attend immigration removal proceedings scheduled for Feb. 9, 2027, officials said. A fleet of B-2 Spirit stealth bombers are seen on a runway at Whiteman Air Force Base. If convicted, Wu could face up to one year in federal prison. The case was investigated by the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Air Force Security Forces and Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations, officials said.
