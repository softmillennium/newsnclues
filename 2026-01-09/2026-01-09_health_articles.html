                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zaida Álvarez Pinto, Principal Investigator at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), has been awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant, one of the most prestigious and competitive sources of funding in the European Union. This research grant, awarded by the European Research Council (ERC) supports excellent scientists and scholars at the career stage where they are consolidating their independent research teams to pursue their most promising scientific ideas. She later moved to Northwestern University (USA), where she continued her work first as a Postdoctoral Researcher and subsequently as an Assistant Professor. In 2022, she returned to IBEC through a Ramón y Cajal fellowship, and just two years later, she was appointed Junior Group Leader. She currently leads the Biomaterials for Neural Regeneration group as a Ramón y Cajal Researcher. The project to be developed with this new funding is named Engineered Humanized Spinal Cord Construct for Advancing Health and Disease Research (SPINECRAFT). Current laboratory models of the central nervous system (CNS) struggle to replicate its extraordinary complexity, limiting progress in understanding neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Traditional 2D cultures, 3D organoids and animal models fall short of capturing the intricate structure and dynamic function of the CNS, slowing advances in neuroscience. By combining advanced imaging, computational modelling, bioprinting and innovative bioinks, researchers will fabricate a high-fidelity model populated with human neural and vascular cells. This platform will not only enable detailed studies of spinal cord biology but also integrate patient-derived cells to recreate disease-specific environments, such as those seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With SPINECRAFT, we expect to generate a high-fidelity human model that will allow us to study disease mechanisms with unprecedented resolution and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies. This ambitious approach represents a paradigm shift in CNS research. This strategic investment positions IBEC at the forefront of 4D human spinal cord modelling, accelerating the transformative potential of SPINECRAFT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breastfeeding may lower mothers' later life risks of depression and anxiety for up to 10 years after pregnancy, suggest the findings of an observational study,  BMJ Open' page">published in the open access journal BMJ Open. To find out, they tracked the breastfeeding behaviour and health of 168 second time mothers who were originally part of the Analysis of the data showed that women experiencing depression and anxiety at 10 years after pregnancy were less likely to have breastfed and had shorter durations of any or exclusive breastfeeding over their lifetime. Each week of lifetime exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a 2% lower likelihood of reporting depression and anxiety, after accounting for potentially influential factors, including alcohol intake. This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, associations only can be relied upon. Nevertheless, the team wrote: "We suggest there also may be a protective effect of successful breastfeeding on postpartum depression and anxiety, which in turn lowers the risk of maternal depression and anxiety in the longer term." They said: "The likelihood is that the association is multifactorial, as many socioeconomic and cultural factors influence both breastfeeding and mental health. Additionally, women with a prior history of depression and anxiety are at risk of lower breastfeeding success, compounding the association." They said: "We know that improving breastfeeding rates and duration can improve mothers' lifetime health outcomes in terms of less diabetes and heart disease and reduces at population level disease burden with resultant significant healthcare savings. "The possibility that breastfeeding could further reduce the huge burden of depression on individuals, families, healthcare systems and economies only adds to the argument for policymakers to further promote breastfeeding."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Specialty laboratories provide advanced capabilities beyond routine diagnostics, positioning them at the forefront of infectious disease research and development. The strength of these laboratories lies in their potential to provide a multifaceted approach, integrating molecular, virology, and immunology techniques to deliver comprehensive insights for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine development, and translational research. Cell culture is a key foundation for drug screening, viral propagation, and physiologically relevant modelling, complementing immunological and genomic analyses. This ensures high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, allowing their users to perform accurate immune profiling, pathogen detection, and functional characterization. Single-modality testing is typically unable to capture the complexity of infectious diseases due to pathogens' capacity for rapid evolution. Specialty labs combine viral infectivity assays, genomic analysis, immune response profiling, and cell culture systems to: This suite of tools is ideally suited to biomarker discovery, vaccine research, diagnostics development, and Phase I–III clinical trials. This suite of tools is suitable for research on respiratory pathogens, antiviral drug development, and emerging infectious disease programs. The suite of tools is ideally suited to vaccine development, infectious disease research, immunogenicity studies, and cardiometabolic biomarker analysis. There are several tangible benefits to working with a specialty laboratory that offers multifaceted capabilities. For example, the laboratory can provide comprehensive insights across pathogen detection, infectivity, and immune response, as well as help to expedite drug and vaccine development. Defensible, high-quality data is available for regulatory submissions, with global standardization made possible via powerful automation and LIMS integration. Specialty laboratories like hVIVO will continue to be at the forefront of innovation, integrating these diverse and highly beneficial technologies into validated workflow designs to better ensure resilience against evolving pathogens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's covered in graffiti, with aluminum cans and trash dotting the parking lot. It sits on a street with other empty lots and decayed buildings — symbols of the lasting devastation this neighborhood, one of the city's poorest, has endured since Hurricane Katrina. But inside, the store is a welcoming oasis. Twinkly string lights adorn racks of donated clothing. Curtains cordon off one side of the room, where there's a stage for musicians and a neon sign depicting roller skates for weekly free skate nights. Bingler is a waiter and bartender in the city who founded a mutual-aid organization called the Greater New Orleans Caring Collective. On Monday evenings, volunteers from other community organizations show up — some used to set up in the parking lot before Bingler opened the store. They offer free testing for sexually transmitted infections, basic medical care, hot meals, and sterile syringes and other supplies for people who use drugs. Although it's been open for a few years now, the space has become even more crucial to this community in recent months, with the Trump administration slashing funding for many social service organizations and taking an aggressive approach to homelessness and drug use. Nationally, it has called for people who use drugs to be forced into treatment. It has decried harm reduction — practices that public health experts say keep people who use drugs safe and alive but that critics say promote illegal drug use. The community space in New Orleans — named the Fred Hampton Free Store after the famous Black Panther activist known for bringing together diverse groups to fight for social reforms — aims to be a haven among this sea of changes. It's simply neighbors helping neighbors, he said, tearing up and adding, "It's a really beautiful thing to be able to share all this space." All items inside are provided by people or organizations in the community. Bingler said one time a local hotel undergoing renovations donated 50 flat-screen TVs. On nights the store is open, often more than 100 people visit, Bingler said. One fall evening, dozens of people browsed for free clothing and over-the-counter medications. Others sat on the grass outside, chatting while keeping an eye on their bicycles or grocery carts full of possessions. James Beshears stopped by the harm reduction group in the parking lot to get sterile supplies he uses to inject heroin and fentanyl. Street drugs were cheaper than treatment, he said. But until he can find affordable care, places like the free store keep him going. Another man in the parking lot was waiting for the arrival of Aquil Bey, a paramedic and former Green Beret well known for helping people overcome obstacles to getting health care. "I've got stage 4 kidney disease," the man said, adding that he was scheduled for treatments at a hospital but was struggling to get there. "Do me a favor," Bey said as he unloaded folding tables and medical equipment from his car. "When our team gets here, come and see us. Bey is the founder of Freestanding Communities, a volunteer-run organization that provides free basic medical care and referrals for people who are homeless, using drugs, or part of other vulnerable communities. That day, Bey and his team connected the man needing kidney disease treatment to reduced-cost transit programs. They also did blood pressure and blood sugar checks for anyone who wanted them, cleaned infected wounds, and called clinics to make appointments for patients without phones. A man with a leg injury mentioned he was sleeping on the concrete floor of an abandoned naval base. Bey noticed the free store's furniture section had a mattress. "We're just trying to find all these barriers" that people face and "find ways to fix them," Bey said. Fed up with discrimination from doctors who blamed him for his addiction, Wiltz said, he was reluctant to go to any treatment facility. Lights dimmed and music blared — a reminder that this was not your everyday clinic or community center. Bey continued consulting with a patient who had gout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health officials are recommending diet and exercise as alternatives to heavily advertised weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound, advice experts say is unrealistic. “Of course he tried eating well and everything, but now with the medications, it's better  -  a 100% change," said Wilmer Cardenas of Santa Clara, who said his husband lost about 100 pounds over about two years using GLP-1s covered by Medi-Cal, California's version of Medicaid. California joined several other states in restricting an option they say is no longer affordable as they confront soaring pharmaceutical costs and steep Medicaid cuts under the Trump administration, among other financial pressures. Despite negotiated price reductions announced in November that the White House said would make the drugs available at a "dramatically lower cost to taxpayers" and enable Medicaid to cover them, states are going ahead with the cuts, which providers say may undermine patients' health. "It will be quite negative for our patients" because data shows people typically regain weight after stopping the drugs, said Diana Thiara, medical director of the University of California-San Francisco Weight Management Program. While California, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina stopped covering adult GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity on Jan. 1, they continue to cover the drugs for other health issues, such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin are planning or considering restrictions, according to KFF's most recent survey. Josh Stein reinstated it in December, bowing to court orders despite a lingering budget shortfall. "As more details become available for the Administration's agreements, we will see how state Medicaid responds." California projected its costs to cover GLP-1s for weight loss would have more than quadrupled over four years to nearly $800 million annually if it didn't end Medi-Cal coverage for that use. Medi-Cal has covered weight loss drugs since 2006, but use of GLP-1s soared only in recent years. The California Department of Health Care Services could not readily provide a breakdown of whether the drugs were for weight loss or other conditions. California's cut is written into the state's budget law. California officials would not say how much it could save under the TrumpRx plan, citing federal and state restrictions on disclosing rebate information. Health providers don't expect the Trump administration's negotiated price cuts to make much difference to consumers, because pharmaceutical companies already offer some discounts. "The out-of-pocket costs will still be very cost-prohibitive for most, especially individuals with Medicaid insurance," Thiara said. New Hampshire is among the other states that ended their coverage Jan. 1. Officials with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. About 1 in 8 adults are now taking a GLP-1 drug for obesity, disease, or both, up 6 percentage points from May 2024, according to KFF poll results released in November. California health officials said Medi-Cal members and their health care providers should consider "other treatment options that can support weight loss, such as diet changes, increased activity or exercise, and counseling." That echoes advice from the New Hampshire Medicaid program. California Department of Health Care Services spokesperson Tessa Outhyse said in an email that the official advice to try those other approaches now "is not meant to dismiss any past efforts, but to encourage Medi-Cal members to take a renewed, proactive, and medically supported approach with their healthcare provider that may appropriately include these additional options." "We definitely want patients to do their part with the diet and exercise, but unfortunately, and from a practical standpoint, that itself frequently is not enough,” Hong said, adding that usually by the time patients see doctors they have already failed at achieving results through those means. Hong understands why Medicaid programs, as well as private providers, want to cut back on covering the drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars per patient per year. A school of medical thought supports patients' gradually ending their use, but Hong said obesity is generally considered a chronic condition that requires indefinite treatment. “Once they reach their target weight, a lot of people will try to see whether or not they can wean off," Hong said. "We do see a lot of patients  -  when they try to get off, unfortunately, then the weight comes back." Medi-Cal members under age 21 remain covered for purposes including weight loss, California officials said, citing a federal requirement. Medi-Cal members are able to keep their GLP-1 coverage if they can demonstrate it is medically necessary for purposes other than weight loss, the department said. Another option is new pills to treat obesity, which will be cheaper than their injectable counterparts. While Cardenas said his husband, Jeffer Jimenez, 37, uses GLP-1s primarily for weight loss, Jimenez's prescription is for his diabetes, so the couple hoped to continue receiving coverage through Medi-Cal. “He tried a thousand medications, pills, natural teas, exercise program, but it doesn't work like the injections,” Cardenas said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new UCLA study reveals that a widely used federal hospital safety metric is fundamentally flawed when applied to emergency stroke care, potentially creating incentives that may discourage hospitals from performing lifesaving procedures for the sickest patients. The research, published in the Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery, examined Patient Safety Indicator 04 (PSI 04), a "failure-to-rescue" measure developed by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to track deaths following treatable complications in surgical patients. The study analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample covering 73,580 stroke thrombectomy procedures between 2016-2019, along with detailed reviews of consecutive cases at UCLA. While stating the metric is appropriate for elective procedures performed on relatively healthy patients, the study found the metric is inappropriate for endovascular thrombectomy, an emergency procedure to remove blood clots in stroke patients who are already gravely ill upon admission. This metric was designed to identify preventable deaths, but when applied to emergency stroke care, it's flagging unavoidable complications of severe strokes rather than problems with the procedure itself. Dr. Melissa Marie Reider-Demer, the study's first author and UCLA Health DNP PSI 04 is triggered when patients develop any of five complications after a procedure (pneumonia, blood clots, sepsis, shock/cardiac arrest, or gastrointestinal bleeding) and subsequently die in the hospital. The metric is used nationally for public reporting, hospital quality ratings and pay-for-performance programs by Medicare and influential organizations like the Leapfrog Group. At UCLA's Comprehensive Stroke Center, researchers examined every thrombectomy case flagged by PSI 04 between 2016-2018. "We're essentially penalizing hospitals for trying to save patients who are already dying from stroke," Dr. Reider-Demer said. "These procedures give severely affected patients their only chance at survival or functional recovery, but the current metric makes it look like the hospitals are providing poor care." The researchers warn that inappropriate safety metrics can create harmful incentives. Previous research has shown that public reporting of surgical mortality rates led some heart surgeons to cherry-pick healthier patients to protect their performance ratings, limiting access for the sickest patients who need care most. "There's a real concern that hospitals might be discouraged from performing thrombectomy on the most severe stroke patients, or that stroke centers with high volumes of critically ill patients could be unfairly penalized in quality ratings and reimbursement," said Dr. Jeffrey Saver, the study's senior author and vice chair for Clinical Research and the Carol and James Collins Chair of the Department of Neurology at UCLA Health. This issue has become more pressing as recent clinical trials have expanded thrombectomy to patients with even larger strokes, who have high mortality rates even with intervention though still lower than without it. "This revision makes sense from a clinical perspective," Dr. Design limitations and unintended consequences of the AHRQ patient safety indicator for endovascular thrombectomy stroke care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last three decades, bringing with it an increase in weight-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. This public health crisis strains global healthcare systems and economies, but a new study co-led by investigators from Mass General Brigham could inform strategic programs to make GLP-1 medications part of the solution. Mass General Brigham researchers and collaborators from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health pooled data from 99 countries and 810,635 adults to determine how many people worldwide may benefit from GLP-1 use. They found more than one-in-four adults would be eligible for GLP-1s for weight management, with women, older individuals, and low- and middle-income countries among the most eligible. For so many decades, we told everyone the problem was you-you need to move more and eat less, then you won't struggle with this problem. GLP-1 receptor agonists have allowed us to really understand that biology is much more powerful than that, and 'eat less, move more' is just an oversimplified way to think about things." Jennifer Manne-Goehler, MD, ScD, co-senior author, physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Department of Medicine at Mass General Brigham The power and promise of GLP-1s has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), as they actively are working to make them standard, accessible mediations. But scaling up production and rolling out application of GLP-1s globally starts with one big question: Exactly how many people need them? "Given the steadily increasing prevalence of obesity, it's not surprising that our analysis found that more than one quarter of adults around the world may be eligible for this medication," said corresponding author Sang Gune K. Yoo, MD, who conducted this work as a research fellow in cardiology at WashU Medicine. "This medication has the potential to help many individuals, although further research is needed to better understand its long-term safety and sustainability. Access remains a major challenge as these medications are difficult to obtain in many settings. Most importantly, we must continue to invest in and develop effective non-pharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity, an area where substantial gaps remain." corresponding author Sang Gune K. Yoo, MD, who conducted this work as a research fellow in cardiology at WashU Medicine The researchers started with household health survey data collected from 99 countries between 2008 and 2021. Those that had a BMI of more than 30 or a BMI of more than 27 with additional hypertension, diabetes, or both, were deemed eligible for GLP-1 use. "These socioeconomic and gender eligibility percentiles are especially staggering," added Manne-Goehler. There are parts of the world where women can really benefit from these medicines, and it's our job to see through their implementation." "Global access to GLP-1s is a question of health equity," said co-lead author Felix Teufel, MD, from Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breastfeeding may lower mothers' later life risks of depression and anxiety for up to 10 years after pregnancy, suggest the findings of a small observational study, published in the open access journal BMJ Open. Breastfeeding is associated with lower risks of postnatal depression and anxiety, but it's not clear if these lowered risks might persist in the longer term, say the researchers. To find out, they tracked the breastfeeding behavior and health of 168 second time mothers who were originally part of the ROLO Longitudinal Birth Cohort Study for 10 years. At each check-up, the mothers completed a detailed health history questionnaire. This asked whether they had been diagnosed with, and treated for, depression/anxiety. They also provided information on potentially influential factors, including diet and physical activity levels. Nearly three quarters of the women (73%; 122) reported having breastfed at some point. More than a third (37.5%; 63) reported cumulative periods of breastfeeding adding up to at least 12 months. Twenty two (13%) of the women reported depression/anxiety at the 10-year check-up, with a further 35 (21%) reporting depression or anxiety at any time point. Those women reporting depression and anxiety at any time point differed only by age at the start of the study. Analysis of the data showed that women experiencing depression and anxiety 10 years after pregnancy were less likely to have breastfed and had shorter periods of any or exclusive breastfeeding over their lifetime. Each week of lifetime exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a 2% lower likelihood of reporting depression and anxiety, after accounting for potentially influential factors, including alcohol intake. And the researchers acknowledge that participants were relatively few in number, not ethnically or socially diverse, and that the study relied on personal recall rather than objective measures of depression/anxiety. Nevertheless, they write: "We suggest there also may be a protective effect of successful breastfeeding on postpartum depression and anxiety, which in turn lowers the risk of maternal depression and anxiety in the longer term." They explain: "The likelihood is that the association is multifactorial, as many socioeconomic and cultural factors influence both breastfeeding and mental health in addition to the impact of health history. Additionally, women with a prior history of depression and anxiety are at risk of lower breastfeeding success, compounding the association but in the reverse direction." They conclude: "We know that improving breastfeeding rates and duration can improve lifetime health outcomes, reducing population level disease burden and resulting in significant healthcare savings. "The possibility that breastfeeding could further reduce the huge burden of depression on individuals, families, healthcare systems and economies only adds to the argument for policymakers to improve breastfeeding support."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many treatments are available, the challenge lies in determining how well a medication or other sleep aid works in individual patients. Now a new study from the University of Maryland School of Medicine has found using real-time smartphone-based assessments can help to determine the effectiveness of sleep medications by detecting improvements in daytime insomnia symptoms including thinking, fatigue, and mood. Following a two-week course of treatment, this smartphone-based assessment approach detected treatment effects more powerfully than did traditional methods like recall questionnaires. The clinical trial involved 40 older adults ages 60 to 85 with chronic insomnia who were randomly assigned to take the sleep medication suvorexant or a placebo for 16 nights. Both groups used a smartphone app to record their daytime insomnia symptoms in real-time, four times per day throughout the study. Daytime symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances are core features of insomnia. We need to determine how well treatments improve daytime functioning, which patients report matters most. In this study we found that retrospective questionnaires failed to detect subtle treatment-related changes that were detected via the smartphone assessment." This is the first randomized controlled trial to incorporate a smartphone EMA as an outcome measure in a sleep-focused clinical trial. Leveraging wearables and smartphones for real-time, multimethod assessment should be considered in future studies that evaluate treatment for insomnia as well as other sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness that leads to prolonged sleep. "These findings address a critical gap in sleep disorders clinical care and research," said Dr. Wickwire. "When viewed as a complement to traditional approaches, EMA offers a sensitive and patient-centered way to measure treatment effects throughout the day, in real-time. Shuo Chen, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM, Avelino Verceles, MD, MS, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM, and University of Maryland graduate student Jingsong Zhou, MS were co-authors on this study. Funding for this study was supported in part by a research grant from the Investigator-Initiated Studies Program of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Inc. "This research underscores the potential for innovative digital tools to be used in conducting comparative effectiveness studies," said UMSOM Dean Mark T. Gladwin, MD, who is the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean at UMSOM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pioneering research led by Brazilians describes the immune system's reactions in detail in the first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant. The study demonstrates the feasibility of this type of graft but indicates that controlling initial rejection alone is insufficient. This is because even with immunosuppressants, continuous activation of innate immunity – the body's first line of defense, especially macrophages, which react to any threat – can compromise long-term survival. Through transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and spatial analyses, the scientists have determined that new strategies are necessary to achieve long-term survival and favorable clinical outcomes. They recommend combining therapies that target innate immunity with advanced genetic engineering in donor pigs. They also suggest preventing early T lymphocyte-mediated rejection and implementing more sensitive monitoring approaches. Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs, tissues, or cells from one animal species – mainly genetically modified pigs – to humans. In March 2024, the first living patient to receive a pig kidney was a 62-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease who underwent surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School in Boston. According to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, kidney transplants are in the highest demand in Brazil. Additionally, it is estimated that between 10 and 12 million Brazilians have some form of kidney disease, a figure that could rise as the population ages and the number of people with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity increases. In more severe cases, dialysis may be a temporary treatment option. Dialysis is an artificial process that removes waste and excess fluids from the body when the kidneys are not functioning properly. The results show that, for xenotransplantation to become a safe and lasting clinical option, controlling only adaptive immunity, as we traditionally do in transplants between humans, is insufficient. Specific strategies must also be developed to modulate the innate immune response and ensure the prolonged survival of xenogeneic grafts in humans," said Thiago Borges, a professor and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, as well as the corresponding author of the article, in an interview with Agência FAPESP. To comprehensively evaluate the response triggered by renal xenotransplantation, the researchers characterized the recipient's immune profile by cross-referencing information obtained from clinical analyses with information from proteomics and metabolomics, which includes sugars, lipids, amino acids, and other metabolites. They observed that, in the first week after surgery, the patient's body recognized the transplanted organ as "foreign" and activated cellular rejection, a specific type of defense conducted mainly by T lymphocytes. The study showed that although no more severe rejection (mediated by antibodies) occurred, the immune system remained partially active, especially in monocytes and macrophages. This reveals a central and hitherto underestimated role of innate immunity in xenotransplant rejection. This rejection was not detected through blood tests. Based on these results, the group suggests that levels of porcine donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) could serve as a potential biomarker for this issue. "We demonstrated that DNA fragments from the pig kidney circulating in the patient's blood can be used as a sensitive and noninvasive marker of rejection. Despite advances in treatment, the findings suggest that current treatments are still unable to fully control immune responses. This study was important because it provided a broad view of all the molecular and cellular changes that occurred during the transplant. This can help guide and improve the efficiency of immunosuppression." Nakaya is a professor at the University of São Paulo's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-USP) and receives support from FAPESP for the project "Integrative Biology Applied to Human Health." This project aims to develop innovative approaches to analyze epidemiological databases, map disease transmission hotspots, integrate transcriptome data with clinical and immunological information, and use machine learning to interpret and analyze microscopic images. He is also the principal investigator at the Center for Research on Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), a FAPESP Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center (RIDC). "Due to our work developing various analytical tools, including single-cell analysis, we were invited by Harvard researchers to work on the integrated multiomic analysis of these thousands of molecules," adds Nakaya, who has advocated for creating an advanced school specializing in this type of analysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at TU Graz have proven that espresso is a favourable alternative to the highly toxic and radioactive uranyl acetate in the analysis of biological samples. To ensure that the tissue structures of biological samples are easily recognisable under the electron microscope, they are treated with a staining agent. The standard staining agent for this is uranyl acetate. However, some laboratories are not allowed to use this highly toxic and radioactive substance for safety reasons. A research team at the Institute of Electron Microscopy and Nanoanalysis (FELMI-ZFE) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) has now found an environmentally friendly alternative: ordinary espresso. "I got the idea of using espresso as a staining agent from the circular dried stains in used coffee cups," says Claudia Mayrhofer, who is responsible for ultramicrotomy at the institute. During preparation, she cuts tissue samples into wafer-thin slices and fixes them onto sample holders. "Initial tests have shown that coffee stains biological samples and enhances contrasts," says Mayrhofer. Together with team leader Ilse Letofsky-Papst and graduate student Robert Zandonella, Claudia Mayrhofer investigated how well espresso performs in direct comparison with uranyl acetate. Under identical conditions, they treated ultra-thin sections of mitochondria with various staining agents and assessed the quality of the microscope images using special image analysis software. "Espresso provided comparatively very good contrast values, in some cases they were even better than with uranyl acetate," explains Claudia Mayrhofer. Ilse Letofsky-Papst concludes: "Our results show that coffee is a serious alternative to uranyl acetate. However, further investigations on different types of tissues are still required to enable a broad application in life science electron microscopy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition. Congress returned from its holiday break to the same question it faced in December: whether to extend covid-era premium subsidies for health plans sold under the Affordable Care Act. The expanded subsidies expired at the end of 2025, leaving more than 20 million Americans facing dramatically higher out-of-pocket costs for insurance. Meanwhile, the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Department of Health and Human Services announced an overhaul of the federal vaccine schedule for children, reducing the number of diseases for which vaccines are recommended from 17 to 11. Plus, for "extra credit" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read (or wrote) this week that they think you should read, too: Julie Rovner: KFF Health News' "Advertisements Promising Patients a 'Dream Body' With Minimal Risk Get Little Scrutiny," by Fred Schulte.
