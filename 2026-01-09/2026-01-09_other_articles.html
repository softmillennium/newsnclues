                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of delays and debate, the United States Congress has passed a NASA budget that omits any plan to retrieve several rock and soil samples collected and stored by the Perseverance Rover, including Martian rocks that may contain signs of past or present extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet. During that time, the cost for MSR has continued to rise, with 2024 estimates reaching $11 billion. Repeated threats from Congress to scrap the ambitious yet costly program altogether resulted in a new, stripped-down plan released in January 2025 that came closer to the original $7 billion estimate. Now, it appears even that plan was still too rich for the current administration's taste, resulting in its explicit exclusion from the new bill. As advocates of the MSR program try to regroup and seek other alternatives to bring the Martian rocks back to Earth to study, NASA's proposed $7.25 billion science budget offers some hope that a future mission may not be completely off the table. For example, the bill, which cuts roughly 1% from the 2025 budget, allocates $110 million for a “Mars Future Missions” program to continue developing the key technologies needed for any future sample-return mission. These include further development of landing systems that can survive the thin atmosphere during descent, which has proven challenging and costly for previous missions. Assuming the bill is signed into law, other missions that have waited patiently for MSR to run its course may see new signs of life. For example, recent discoveries on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and in the atmosphere of Venus have led to plans for missions to further explore those tantalizing findings. These include plans to explore potential subsurface oceans on Enceladus and Europa for extraterrestrial life. Groundbreaking New Study Reveals Origins of Intense Unexplained Phenomena Caused by Supermassive Black Holes In 2024, mission operators spotted a surface feature containing mineral deposits called “leopard spots” in a dry riverbed that leads to Jezero crater. NASA scientists note that on Earth, these types of leopard spots are often left by microbial organisms interacting with the rock, making the Chevaya Falls sample arguably the best candidate for containing signs of past life on Mars. Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said scientists eagerly await the opportunity to examine these samples in Earth labs equipped to determine if they do hold signs of extraterrestrial life. Elhman also pointed to the potential for other scientific discoveries that the dozens of samples gathered by Perseverance may hold. “A rock with a potential biosignature is awaiting return now, and other rocks hold breakthrough discoveries,” the UC Boulder scientist explained. “We'd really like to hear from NASA sooner than later that they will work with the community on a plan to get these samples,” Hamilton said.</p>

Aliens might actually be communicating with flashing lights – similar to fireflies here on Earth. Scientists at Cornell University say that the search for aliens is usually inspired by “human centric ideas” of what intelligence and technology look like. But they point out that humans aren't the only example of intelligent species communicating on Earth. That led scientists to look at fireflies, which communicate through light.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A peculiar metal shard that sparked UFO enthusiasts' imaginations as potential alien technology has been debunked by scientists. The metal shard had fascinated UFO enthusiasts, some speculating that it could be a piece of alien technology capable of levitation. However, after thorough analysis by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), scientists concluded that the metal was not extraterrestrial but instead an unusual alloy made on Earth. While its properties raised questions about possible alien technology, the shard was ultimately shown to have been created using materials and processes familiar to human manufacturing. The shard gained attention due to its alleged connection to the 1947 Roswell incident, where many believed that a UFO had crashed near Roswell, New Mexico. Initially, the metal seemed to exhibit unusual properties that could suggest an extraterrestrial origin. It was believed that the metal might be part of a device capable of reducing inertial mass, a technology that could allow for levitation. However, new findings have ruled out this hypothesis, showing the metal to be a product of Earthly manufacturing, reports Popular Mechanics. The team at ORNL tested the shard for signs of alien biosignatures and technosignatures, potential markers of extraterrestrial life or technology. What they found was a sample that matched the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead commonly found on Earth, ruling out the possibility that it was from beyond our planet. The magnesium in the sample was found to have undergone typical separation of lighter and heavier isotopes, likely caused by heat and mechanical stress during manufacturing processes. These findings led scientists to conclude that the shard likely originated from Earth, possibly linked to research into magnesium alloys used in the construction of aircraft after World War II. One of the more intriguing theories surrounding the metal was the idea that it could be part of a terahertz waveguide, a device capable of channeling electromagnetic waves to levitate objects. This hypothesis arose from the metal's unusual composition, which some believed could be used in advanced technology to manipulate energy. The bismuth was mixed with lead and was not in the required single-layer form, meaning it could not function as a waveguide to channel terahertz radiation.

Lavika Gupta, a resident of Gaur City Avenue-1, in central Noida, recently filed a police complaint against her husband and four in-laws, alleging that she was deceived when she agreed to marry her spouse in 2024. Among her accusations, the woman claims that she was promised a man with lush, healthy hair, but married a bald man wearing a wig.

According to the First Information Report (FIR) filed at Bisrakh police station, Lavika Gupta and Sanyam Jain were married on January 16, 2024. The wife claims that she was deceived at the time, with Jain and his family concealing various details about his physical appearance, education, and financial status.

“After the marriage, I also found that my husband had only passed Class 12, while his biodata showed that he had a BCom (Bachelor of Commerce) degree. He also lied that his income was Rs 18 lakh ($20,000). In this way, I was seriously defrauded.”

Gupta added that when she agreed to marry Sanyam, she was promised a man with “thick hair”, but she later learned that her spouse was bald and wearing a patch to conceal his lack of hair.

“The woman has also alleged that her husband assaulted her during a trip abroad and pressured her to bring marijuana from Thailand to India,” an officer from Bisrakh police station told journalists.

Hetty Chang reports for the NBC4 News at 4 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Police arrested the 57-year-old man, who they say may have been living inside a psychic business on La Palma Avenue just a few feet away from where the deadly assault took place. Stream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are. The business sits right across the street from Knott's Berry Farm and near a parking lot where there's a memorial for 29-year-old Elton Harrell. On Dec. 29, investigators say Harrell was assaulted and later died at the hospital from his injuries. This is always where we will come to see him now," said Cindy Salazar, a friend of Harrell. Harrell's mother, Barbara Campbell, says her son suffered from mental illness and was homeless. "Everyone loved my son, he was a good guy,"  said Campbell.

On Wednesday, authorities say they detained a woman and arrested 57-year-old Barney Lee on suspicion of murder. "It did appear they may be living in the location we are unsure." Harrell's loved ones say they still have a lot of unanswered questions, like why anyone would hurt him. "We're never going to be the same. I want to know why someone would take my son's life like he was nothing. He was somebody to us," said Campbell.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Stranger Things series finale left the fandom largely divided, with many wanting an episode that would deliver both a better final fight and more answers to our most burning questions. However, some fans were convinced that we haven't actually seen the final episode…that we would get a secret ninth episode to Season 5 that would drop on January 7. These fans are part of the Conformity Gate conspiracy, and now that the 7th came and went without any new episode, it's clear that these fans set themselves up for serious disappointment with a conspiracy theory that never made sense from the beginning. So, what the heck is “Conformity Gate,” and how does it tie to Stranger Things suddenly giving us a bonus episode? As you might imagine, the “evidence” for this theory was all circumstantial, though some of it is admittedly interesting. It's neat to consider, but Creel's hand pose isn't all that unique…it's really just holding his hands together. Isn't it far likelier that people sitting down at a long ceremony simply got comfy (like, what else do you do with your hands on a chair with no arms?) rather than Netflix spending half of its $80+ million episode on a fake ending? That same graduation scene features other circumstantial evidence, like someone holding up a blank yellow poster that you might expect to have, say, a student's name on it. But isn't it likelier that this was a sloppy production error, possibly even something they intended to fix in editing but forgot to do? When Henry Creel was recruiting children for his evil plan, he went by the name “Mr. However, WATZIT was a real game that was popular in the ‘80s, and it makes perfect sense for dorky Mike to have copies of this kicking around the same basement space where he and his friends play D&D. More sense, at least, than all of this being a complex illusion meant to fool fans and characters alike. Plus, this whole conspiracy theory falls apart once you realize that the biggest piece of ‘evidence” is a complete and total lie. The second major background detail that Conformity Gate believers point to is Mike's D&D books…they are all carefully arranged, and some are convinced they spell out the phrase “X a lie.” The theory goes that this is saying that what we saw in Dimension X was a lie, which would explain why the final fight against a cosmic god and his superpowered flunkie was over in just a few minutes. It would also hint that the real final battle is yet to come, possibly in a new Stranger Things episode dropping on January 7. However, this is a blatant lie, as you can tell from the image above. Conformity Gate believers love to share an image showing that a message is hidden in the D&D books that are arranged in this order: Max, Lucas, Will, Dustin, Mike. Previously, Netflix posted a weirdly cryptic teaser that read “Your future is on the way” and prominently featured this date. Fans convinced themselves this was the streamer hinting at a big reveal on that date, but now that no new Stranger Things episode dropped, it's now clear that Netflix was likely just doing advertising for its own shows (like the upcoming season of Bridgerton) rather than teasing us about more Stranger Things content. It seems clear that this entire conspiracy theory is just an outsized reaction to disappointment, giving fans a way to cope with a final episode that didn't really meet their expectations. Netflix wants to keep Stranger Things alive for future spinoffs, and the powers that be know quite well how such a fake-out would destroy everything the Duffer Brothers have built. Sadly, the brothers are ultimately responsible for this conspiracy blossoming in the first place…when you go out of your way to leave so much (from Vecna's motivations to Eleven's death) up to interpretation, you can't act surprised when millions of fans glom onto conspiracy theories.</p>
