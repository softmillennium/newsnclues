                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the last scheduled match in a United Cup tie, but as we've seen repeatedly this past week Down Under, mixed doubles is of the very first importance. On Friday night, the unheralded team of Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski defeated John-Patrick Smith and Storm Hunter 6-4, 6-0 to send Poland soaring past Australia 2-1 and into Saturday's semifinals against Team USA. Switzerland, sporting its own brand of mixed magic, takes on Belgium in the first semifinal at Sydney's Ken Rosewall Arena. Both Perth quarterfinals came down to the all-or-nothing co-ed challenge, a relatively rare phenomenon seen only in Grand Slams and the Olympics. Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison rallied from a set down to Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari to win 10-8 in a match-tiebreak. The Greek team was down 6-1 but reeled off five straight points to make it 6-all. So, yeah, I appreciate the whole team talking to us, pumping us up and seeing things that maybe we couldn't see on the court.” Stan Wawrinka, Switzerland's captain and singles player, was hoping to play at least one match with Bencic, but in his last season at the age of 40, Wawrinka made the decision to go with Paul. We can put different players on the court. Bencic and Paul have also won all three of their mixed doubles matches. Switzerland's Bencic, who became a mother in 2024, has played three singles matches and three mixed -- and won all six. It gives you a lot of confidence that you come out of the blocks pretty good and you already have so much play before the Australian Open, which is always very important.” Elise Mertens of Belgium has also won all three of her singles matches and is 1-1 playing with Zizou Bergs. She defeated two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova in the quarterfinals, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5, firing 12 aces. In over 1,400 career matches, they've only met once -- with Mertens winning a third-round match at the 2021 Australian Open, 6-2, 6-1. They were scheduled to meet last fall in Wuhan, but Mertens pulled out with a back injury. If it comes down to mixed doubles, both teams are talented. She's played two matches with Bergs and is looking comfortable. “We are growing as a team,” Mertens said. --Women's singles: Belinda Bencic vs. Elise Mertens--Men's singles: Stan Wawrinka vs. Zizou Bergs--Mixed doubles: Bencic and Jakub Paul vs. Mertens and Bergs Rest versus momentum -- which team has the advantage? The United States advanced to these semifinals on Wednesday and has enjoyed two off days but had to make the 4.5-hour cross-country flight from Perth to Sydney and navigate a three-hour time change. Poland played its quarterfinal in Sydney on Friday night and launches right into Saturday's tie with the United States -- in a rematch of last year's final. It's Poland's fourth straight year as a semifinalist. 4 players on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. Swiatek, three years older, won 11 of their first 12 encounters, but Gauff has taken the past three -- all in straight sets. A year ago, Gauff beat Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in a memorable United Cup match that saw Team USA win its second title in three years of the competition. “Last year I had a good match against her. Obviously we know each other's game pretty well with Coco. Taylor Fritz leads the head-to-head with Hubert Hurkacz, 4-2, including a win in last year's final. “Taylor, he's such a great player,” Hurkacz said. I mean, we played in the finals last year. Will try to be a bit better this year.” --Men's singles: Taylor Fritz vs. Hubert Hurkacz--Women's singles: Coco Gauff vs. Iga Swiatek--Mixed doubles: Gauff and Christian Harrison vs. Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski</p>

Swiatek dropped her respective singles matches to Jessica Pegula in 2023 and Coco Gauff last year, while Hurkacz twice came up short against Taylor Fritz.Revenge is on the table, with Gauff and Fritz running it back this week for the defending champions.“For sure it's a good match, like exciting for the fans I think. Obviously we know each other's game pretty well with Coco,” said Swiatek.“The key for me will be just to focus on myself, try to implement the stuff that I worked on during the pre-season and be brave with the decisions.

For sure I'm going to sit with Wim tomorrow and he will watch it and give me the tips. Hurkacz, who missed seven months of competition prior to making a winning return at this event, was similar in his sentiment.“It's going to be a fun challenge to play against him,” the two-time ATP Masters 1000 champion said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After his two-hour, 18 minute victory over Hubert Hurkacz to send the tie to a deciding mixed doubles, de Minaur did not front up for mixed with Storm Hunter, like he did when Australia needed the mixed point to beat Czechia Tuesday to advance through the group stages. Hunter teamed with John-Patrick Smith in a 6-4, 6-0 defeat to Jan Zielinski and Katarzyna Kawa. “He's been doing a lot of training in the off-season to get ready for five-set matches. We decided the best thing for his body moving forward was not to put his hand up to play mixed tonight. “Also, if you are that second match, to turn around straightaway and switch on. You just don't want to risk injury as well at certain times, especially the amount of moving he had to do tonight against a bloody quality player out there." De Minaur produced a heroic performance in the singles, saving nine break points across his first four service games before going on a streak of winning 21 consecutive points on serve through the late stages of the second set. He won 82 per cent of first serves for the match, a vast improvement from 55 per cent and eight double faults in a scrappy opening-tie loss to Casper Ruud earlier in the tournament. “I think what was a little bit strange for me was the amount of double-faults,” de Minaur said. Obviously that was what felt like an anomaly. “I'm very happy with my serving performance the following two matches, kind of showing all the work that I put in. Of course, if I can land first serves and play with a lot of first serves, it makes my life a whole lot easier. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poland has earned the chance to avenge last year's United Cup final loss to the United States after winning a decisive mixed doubles against Australia in Friday night's quarter-final in Sydney. After Iga Swiatek and Alex de Minaur claimed contrasting singles wins for their countries earlier in the evening, Jan Zielinski produced a masterclass with Katarzyna Kawa to seal Poland's victory with a 6-4, 6-0 win over John-Patrick Smith and Storm Hunter. Advancing to the semi-finals for the fourth consecutive year, Poland will get a shot at defending champion United States Saturday night when the singles match-ups – Swiatek against Coco Gauff and Hurkacz against Taylor Fritz - are a repeat of the 2025 final. Last year Gauff won 6-4, 6-4 while Hurkacz suffered a heartbreaking third-set tie-break loss to Fritz. In a dramatic tie Friday in front of a highly partisan Australian crowd, De Minaur produced one of the grittiest opening-set performances of his career Friday night in Sydney to set up a 6-4, 4-6 6-4 win over Hurkacz to send the last United Cup quarter-final to a deciding mixed doubles. 6 saved all nine break points he faced across his first four service games – including four in the second game of the match – to keep Australia alive after former World No. 1 Iga Swiatek brushed aside Aussie teen Maya Joint 6-1, 6-1. “Nights like these… these are just the best,” De Minaur said. It was a huge mental effort and we're still alive. I had some dark thoughts in my head.” Playing his first tournament since last year's grass season, Hurkcaz was near untouchable in his first three service games when he dropped just one point on serve. But growing increasingly frustrated by his inability to cash in on his chances in return games, his unforced error count ticked up in the closing stages of the set. But inspired by deafening roars from Aussie fans inside Ken Rosewall Arena, De Minaur went into lockdown mode with just two unforced errors in the final set en route to his eighth victory in 11 United Cup singles appearances. Earlier, Swiatek overpowered Australia rising star Joint, capturing a convincing 6-1, 6-1 win in just 57 minutes at the United Cup quarterfinals. 2's experience prevailed as the Swiatek earned her second career win over Joint: Swiatek won 6-0, 6-2 in the Seoul semifinals, a tournament she'd go on to win. Swiatek also earned her 15th singles win at the United Cup. “I got pretty confident at the end so for sure it was a good match.” Joint held serve to have an initial 1-0 lead, but after, the Swiatek show ensued. Swiatek won six straight games to win the first set with a breadstick in 26 minutes and had garnered “Iga” chants from her Polish supporters early on into the match. Her set point, a cross-court forehand winner that sped past an outstretched Joint, summed up the match best. Similarly, Swiatek recaptured the lead with a break, and didn't look back, en route to the double breadstick win. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karolina Muchova was able to put a stop to Elena Rybakina's 13-match win streak with a three-set victory in the Brisbane quarterfinals. But despite the two Top 20 players trading blows for more than two hours, this was tennis, not boxing, and there were no split decisions to determine the winner. Instead, Muchova definitively snapped Rybakina's 13-match winning streak and earned her first win over the former Wimbledon champion since 2019 with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory at Pat Rafter Arena. “I missed a few years in Australia that I didn't even come because of injury, so it's just great that I'm here and enjoying playing with my team and friends here.” 1 defeated Madison Keys 6-3, 6-3 a few hours later to secure her own spot in the final four. It marks Muchova's first WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz semifinal appearance since last February in Dubai. Talent has never been the issue for Muchova. The Czech has long been snakebit by injuries, but when she's healthy, or close to it, she's capable of giving anyone trouble. Rybakina escaped with timely serving, but her serve faltered at 2-all when a double fault on break point handed Muchova a 3-2 lead. She finished the first set with just five unforced errors to Rybakina's 18. It's hard to pinpoint why, but there's something undeniably pure about watching Sabalenka and Keys mash the heck out of the ball, point after point. Even on a day when neither was at her best, the sheer power on display -- forehand, backhand, first serve, it didn't matter -- was unmistakable. Despite Keys throwing everything at her, the Belarusian never blinked. After Keys held for a 3-2 lead, Sabalenka responded by reeling off four straight games to take the first set, closing it out with her trademark backhand down the line on her third set point. In the second set, Keys appeared to dial back the aggression after seven costly double faults in the opener, just as Sabalenka decided to crank hers up. Sabalenka took more risks on serve, firing five aces after hitting none in the first set, and pounced on Keys' increasingly conservative second serves. On one such occasion, Sabalenka vultured Key's second serve and crushed a forehand winner down the line for a 3-1 lead. “I was trying to put as much pressure as I can on her serve,” Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. I put so much pressure back on her because yeah, she's aggressive, but then I tried to put all that speed back at her.” Keys kept at it, though, breaking back for 3-2 and staying in the mix with several highlight-reel winners of her own. There aren't many players who have found consistent success against Sabalenka, but Muchova is one of them. Muchova leads the head-to-head 3-1, having won each of their last three meetings dating back to 2023. Their most recent meeting came in the 2024 Beijing quarterfinals, where Muchova won in three sets en route to the final. Coincidentally, that remains her most recent WTA final, but that could change if she manages to pull off the unthinkable and defeat the World No. Karolina Muchova was able to put a stop to Elena Rybakina's 13-match win streak with a three-set victory in the Brisbane quarterfinals.</p>

Kyrgios partnered long-time friend Thanasi Kokkinakis to an opening doubles win in Brisbane ahead of a 6-3, 6-4 defeat in singles to Aleksandar Kovacevic.In not pursuing the 128-player field at the season's first major, it further opened the door for 2014 champion Wawrinka to make one final appearance in his last season on tour. A few hours after Kyrgios' note went up, the Swiss was announced as the wild card recipient by the tournament.“This tournament means everything to me but I'd rather give my spot to someone who's ready to make their moment count,” added Kyrgios.
