                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New video that appears to show Renee Nicole Good in her car right before she was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis was posted Friday on social media by the site Alpha News. The 47-second-long video appears to have been taken by a phone held by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fired at the 37-year-old Good on Wednesday as she drove her SUV toward him. the agent apparently moans, as the Honda Pilot lurches by him. "F---ing bitch," the agent apparently mutters after firing at Good. Vice President JD Vance reposted the video on his X account. "Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense." Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other Democrats have disputed the claim that Good was trying to intentionally hit the ICE agent. Some observers have said Good, a mother of three, was trying to swerve around him after being approached by other ICE agents, who were directing her to get out of the SUV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT – Stellantis is scrapping its plug-in hybrid electric Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivan amid slowing EV sales, quality issues and weakened federal fuel economy requirements. The automaker on Friday said the decision to end production of the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica was a result of waning customer demand and the need to focus on "more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range‑extended vehicles." "Stellantis continually evaluates its product strategy to meet evolving customer needs and regulatory requirements. With customer demand shifting, Stellantis will phase out plug‑in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year," the company said in an emailed statement. In 2024, then-Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa — who is now CEO of Stellantis — said the SUV brand planned to sell 160,000 to 170,000 PHEVs that year, and the company said it represented 41% of U.S. PHEV sales. Aside from sales, Stellantis has been using PHEVs as a way to offset its production of gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs to attempt to meet federal fuel economy standards and avoid penalties. The goal has become less urgent been as the Trump administration eliminates or weakens aspects of those rules. Chrysler first introduced its PHEV minivan in 2016. Jeep debuted the Wrangler PHEV, which it called a "4xe," in 2020, followed by a Grand Cherokee version in 2021. PHEVs feature traditional internal combustion engines, but also have an all-electric range when charged like an EV. They have largely been viewed as a transitional technology from traditional vehicles to EVs; however, they are quite costly because of their two different propulsion systems. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf late last month told CNBC the brand was evaluating its electrification strategy since the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs and PHEVs in September. He said Jeep still had vehicles on the ground that it would continue to sell, but "all of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out, and what becomes steady state for 4xe and [battery] EVs in general." A Jeep spokeswoman said the brand will continue to offer all-electric SUVs such as the Wagoneer S and Recon, which was officially revealed late last year. We want to hear from you.

Major investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices. These mega landlords own only a tiny fraction of the overall US housing market, although they control a significantly larger share of single-family rental homes in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. They correctly predicted that home values and rents in many of the targeted areas would rise over time with population growth. When the pandemic hit in 2020, and interest rates dropped, investors again snapped up thousands of homes, particularly in cities across the South and Sun Belt. This sparked alarm in communities where individual homebuyers struggled to compete with all-cash offers from major investors.

Some major investors have shifted their business model to buying homes in bulk directly from homebuilders, rather than purchasing them one by one. "You're seeing this huge increase in debt costs to buy a home, and rents have softened mostly or been flat, and then with prospects of potentially declining home prices, or at least flat home prices, it's just tough," said Glenn Hull, CEO of SFR Analytics, which provides software and data tools to real estate investors and others. Researchers have found that mega landlords may have contributed to the rise in housing costs, particularly in areas where they're heavily concentrated. "The studies reviewed by GAO indicate that institutional investment may increase rents and home prices, particularly in places with high rates of institutional ownership," the GAO report said. "It is unclear whether institutional investors crowd out individual home buyers, and evidence about whether they behave differently than other landlords is thin," a 2023 report by the Brookings Institution found. "It's not a national story," said Jason Lewris, cofounder of Parcl Labs, which tracks institutional investors in housing. "If you look within those markets, it's a handful of zip codes." Much remains unknown about what kind of ban Trump intends to pursue. Trump said he would ban these investors "from buying more single-family homes," but it's not clear whether they would also be required to sell their current portfolios. A White House spokesman, Davis Ingle, said in an emailed statement, "President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs." Trump's proposed ban is part of a recent White House effort to address housing affordability concerns. Housing economists say that banning major investors from buying additional homes would do little to improve affordability. "Targeting a small subset of landlords without addressing underlying market conditions and policy gaps will not meaningfully improve the well-being of renters and prospective homebuyers," Jenny Schuetz, a former senior fellow focused on housing at the Brookings Institution, told the House Financial Services Committee during a 2022 hearing on corporate investors in residential real estate. That's in part because investors don't change the demand for or supply of housing. "Periods of rapid rent increases correspond to periods of greater household formation coupled with supply shortages, not institutional investor buyers," they added. "It is hard to argue that institutional rental operators drive up home prices over any reasonable period." Instead, economists argue that an undersupply of homes is the major underlying reason for rising prices. And when it comes to enforcing laws that protect tenants, including fair housing laws, it can be easier to prove a pattern of behavior by larger landlords, Fairweather said. If the federal government succeeds in passing a ban, enforcing it could be tricky. Large investors could break themselves up into smaller shell companies to avoid the prohibition, Lewris said. One alternative is to discourage the behavior by raising property taxes on homes owned by institutional investors, thereby making the practice less lucrative, Hull and Fairweather said. "In general, bans don't really work, because people find a way around them," Fairweather said, "but if you tax something, at least you get tax revenue out of it that could be used to support things like first-time homebuyer programs or building more affordable housing." Tenants tend to have far lower incomes and wealth than homebuyers. "The narrative today is that what my business does is wrong, that buying homes and renting them is a bad thing because I'm keeping people from buying homes," Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst, a single-family rental company heavily invested in the Sun Belt, said at the real estate conference ResiDay in November 2025. Instead, he argued, his firm helps its tenants live in homes that they couldn't afford a down payment for or wouldn't qualify for a mortgage to buy. Fairweather agreed that banning large landlords from owning single-family homes would mean fewer tenants could live in these wealthier neighborhoods.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York on Friday introduced a bill called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, which would bar federal elected officials, political appointees, Executive Branch employees, and congressional staff from making trades on prediction markets when they have nonpublic information related to the transaction, or might be able to obtain it via their official duties. 30 House Democrats are cosponsoring the bill, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Polymarket does not currently have significant restrictions or rules against insider trading. In fact, CEO Shayne Coplan has argued that insider trading via prediction markets can be a public good. "What's cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the market," Coplan said at an Axios Business event. Polymarket did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. By contrast, Kalshi — another major prediction market platform — has rules barring insider trading. The company also has safeguards in place to prevent insider trading. Earlier this week, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour endorsed Torres's bill. This isn't the first time that fears of insider trading have cropped up around a major Trump administration action. In April, as President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement caused a significant swing in the stock market, some administration officials and members of Congress made well-timed stock trades.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel stock climbed 7% Friday after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with President Donald Trump, continuing a rally that has seen the stock more than double since the U.S. took a stake in the chipmaker in August. "The United States Government is proud to be a Shareholder of Intel," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday following the meeting. Trump lauded Tan as "very successful" and touted the launch of Intel's recent chip that was "designed, built, and packaged right here in the U.S.A." Tan responded in an X post that he was honored and "delighted to have the full support and encouragement" of Trump and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. The CEO also noted that Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 3 CPU processors, its first major product built on Intel 18A, is now shipping out. In August, the White House negotiated an $8.9 billion investment in Intel, buying 433.3 million shares at $20.47 per share. That stake is now worth about $19 billion. A few weeks before the stake announcement, Trump said in a Truth Social post that Tan "is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately." "Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations," Cotton wrote in a press release. "Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations." Intel responded in a statement that the company, its board of directors and Tan are "deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests." "I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I've built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards," he said. Tan was appointed CEO in March 2025 amidst declining sales and company instability under Pat Gelsinger's leadership. We want to hear from you.

And at first, when my partner and I began our two years living full-time in a self-converted camper van, chasing mountains, cool climbing lines, and a cheaper, freer lifestyle, they felt true. Both have given us lessons in minimalism, self-reliance, and adaptation, but if I had to pick a favorite? The tiny house wins, even if it's not our ideal living situation.

At first, van life was everything social media promised it to be: sunsets from mountain overlooks, coffee brewed with the back doors flung open, and a different backyard every few days. We spent three months and nearly $10,000 — nearly half of which went toward our fully off-grid solar setup — converting it to something we could live in. We recouped our investment quickly, especially since we spent the following summer juggling several jobs while saving up to hit the road for an indefinite period. We only had three relatively large recurring monthly expenses: the $400 loan payment on the van itself, $150 in insurance, and an average of about $200 a month in fuel, depending on how much we drove. We utilized public land and the occasional Cracker Barrel parking lot for camping and boondocking, so we never spent a dime on campgrounds or RV parks. Factoring in food and a slim recreational budget (which we often never used), our monthly cost of living hovered under $1,000. The trade-off of free-wheeling, inexpensive living was everything else. First, there was the omnipresent stress of having everything you own in one compact wheeled thing that begs, "Steal me!" Nothing in van life was guaranteed, not even something as simple as having a safe place to sleep at night. I certainly don't miss the unique stress of trying to find a place to park and not knowing whether we would wake up surrounded by cops or cows or an angry farmer because following a county road after dark unwittingly led us onto private land — all things that happened to us during our two-year tenure on the road. Freedom, I learned, can feel a lot like instability. Though we practiced social distancing to the extreme, often spending weeks at a time parked in the middle of nowhere without encountering another soul, the second we pulled into a grocery-store parking lot with our out-of-state license plates for a biweekly supply restock, we were repeatedly given scornful looks and told to "stay home." When those pressures finally got to us, we hung up our van-lifer jackets and parked the van for good on a rented lot in front of a brand-new 400-square-foot tiny house. Suddenly, we had running water, electricity that didn't rely on a sunny day, and enough space to cook a full meal without bumping elbows. Our mortgage and lot rent combined cost double our van payment (which we were also still paying off). When adding the cost to furnish the house and buy a used vehicle to serve as our everyday all-season driver (a financial headache in its own right), our hard-earned reserves were quickly depleted. At the same time, the tiny home gave us a tenuous sense of belonging and stability we didn't realize we were missing. I won't say I don't miss the untethered freedom to simply drive to warmer climates when I'm shoveling snow from the driveway or the near-viscous silence of a desolate campsite in the mountains when I'm listening to our neighbors' dogs bark incessantly at 3 a.m. I love the quiet, simple mornings of waking up to water tanks that aren't frozen and being able to sit in my rocking chair with a cup of coffee, thinking about the art I want to make that day. Without a waking reality in between, the dream of perpetual motion becomes unspectacular.</p>

And we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels," Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired Thursday night. "The cartels are running Mexico, it's very sad to watch and see what's happened to that country," Trump said. Trump's comment comes less than a week after U.S. forces struck Venezuela and captured its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores. The Venezuelan government has said more than 100 people were killed in the military operation, which came after a monthslong pressure campaign against Maduro. A White House spokeswoman, when asked by CNBC about Trump's comment on Fox News, said, in an email, "The administration is reasserting and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere, control migration, and stop drug trafficking." "The President has many options at his disposal to continue to protect our homeland from illicit narcotics that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year,"  the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said. Trump previously floated the idea of executing attacks on Mexico. "Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in November when asked if he would consider military action across the southern border. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pushed back on Trump after that, saying there would be no U.S. military action in Mexico without her permission. This week, Sheinbaum condemned the U.S. capture of Maduro and reaffirmed her country's sovereignty. "It is necessary to reaffirm that in Mexico the people rule, and that we are a free and sovereign country— cooperation, yes; subordination and intervention, no," Sheinbaum said, according to Reuters. On Thursday, the Senate passed the first phase of a measure to block Trump from further military action in Venezuela. Five Senate Republicans voted in favor of the measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, indicating it has enough bipartisan support to clear a final vote. But she also said that further action would require congressional approval. "When the president raises the issue, as he has with not only Venezuela, but Greenland, of military force being used, then it does implicate the War Powers Act and Congress's constitutional role," Collins said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Humanoid robots shadowboxed, danced and pretended to run small shops. Singapore-based Sharpa displayed a robotic hand playing table tennis and dealing blackjack hands. Across Las Vegas, technology companies used the annual CES trade show to reveal their visions of the future and to loudly proclaim that physical artificial intelligence is poised for a breakout year. "The humanoid industry is riding on the work of the AI factories we're building for other AI stuff," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at a news conference on Tuesday. Nvidia, which last year became the world's most valuable company, announced a new version of its vision language models called Gr00t for humanoid robots that can turn sensor inputs into robot body control, as well as a version of its Cosmos model for robot reasoning and planning. Huang said he expects to see robots with some human-level capabilities this year. "I know how fast the technology is moving," he said. His company highlighted partnerships with the likes of Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar and LG. Science fiction writers have dreamed of this moment for decades. In "Star Wars," C-3PO helped Luke Skywalker save the galaxy. However, in real life, humanoids have so far been unable to demonstrate the intelligence or flexibility that would make them truly useful, a problem that's long eluded engineers. Then came generative AI with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. The same deep learning technology that underpins ChatGPT can be used to teach the robots how to walk, use a hand or fold laundry. In addition to Nvidia, fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm made splashy robot-related announcements at CES. On Monday, Google's DeepMind said it would work with Hyundai's Boston Dynamics, formerly a division of Google, to develop new AI models for its Atlas robot. McKinsey estimates that the market for what it calls general-purpose robotics could reach $370 billion by 2040, with top use cases including "warehouse logistics, light manufacturing, retail operations, agriculture, and healthcare." The Consumer Technology Association, which produces CES, hasn't said how many humanoid robot companies presented at this year's event, but CTA President Kinsey Fabrizio said the number of industrial and consumer robots at the show has been growing. AMD CEO Lisa Su on Monday revealed a new humanoid robot from Italy's Generative Bionics, a company that it's backing financially. The robot, Gene.01, is scheduled be deployed later this year in industrial environments like shipyards. Generative Robotics is using AMD's cloud-based graphics processing units to train and fine-tune its models. "This allows us to customize the next generation of the models on their GPUs," said Generative Robotics CEO Daniele Pucci. For now, robot chip sales are a small fraction of Nvidia's business, and AMD reports them as "embedded" sales, a term for industrial chips. But they see an opportunity to win business from a new crop of robot makers by offering them not just chips, but an entire software ecosystem to make development easier. "This is all about any of the major players establishing themselves as a one-stop shop for the robotics development community," Wood said. While the tech industry has become enamored with large language models in the generative AI boom, many robots are being enabled by vision language models. Along with Nvidia's VLM announcements at CES, Qualcomm showed off a new line of robot chips called Dragonwing that can use the company's VLMs. One particular area of excitement for Nvidia is medicine. The robot was described as a humanoid, but it didn't have legs. Rather, it had three arms, two for using tools and one that controlled a face-like module of cameras and sensors. Its sole function is to help doctors with spine surgery. Down the exhibit hall, Nvidia demonstrated a Chinese humanoid robot called Agibot that used a large language model to chat with attendees, though it had trouble standing on the conference center's plush carpets. In the demonstration, CLOiD, which is designed for the home, promised to make breakfast and took a wet towel from the presenter and stuck it in a washing machine. Experts are also worried about safety and the damage that could be caused by consumer robots. "Home is very unstructured," said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. "You can't plan for a child running into the robot or the robot running over a pet." Some of the first humanoid robots on the market could be more about fun and flash than productivity. China's Unitree Robotics displayed its $70,000 G1 robot at CES. Nvidia's Huang said this week that robots are having their "ChatGPT moment." Modar Alaoui, general partner at ALM Ventures, sees robots rapidly moving from novelty to reality. "The next generation is just going to grow up with these machines whether we accept it or not," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It could be the year Main Street's appetite for cryptocurrency exposure meaningfully grows. Although it's been two years since the first spot bitcoin ETFs began trading on U.S. exchanges, BlackRock's Jay Jacobs thinks they're a fairly new concept. "It's still so early," the firm's U.S. head of equity ETFs told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. "Many investors have still just been starting their educational journey around what is bitcoin, [and] how might it fit in a portfolio .… We see this still being very early days for bitcoin and ethereum." As of Thursday's market close, IBIT is down more than 3% in the past year. The weakness comes after bitcoin prices hit a record high of around $126,000 last October. It's now trading in the low $90,000 range. Meanwhile, ETHA is lower by almost 6%. Cryptocurrencies have gained a lot of traction recently, and part of what's driving that is the fact that large-scale asset managers including BlackRock have expanded options for traders to invest in them, using equity-like formats, including ETFs. "For many financial advisors, maybe they didn't have access to crypto before, or weren't able to buy IBIT before it was approved on their platforms," Jacobs said. But for those who have taken the plunge, VettaFi's Todd Rosenbluth says the asset class is instilling a sense of loyalty — despite bouts of volatility. "They're sticking with it, not necessarily selling out and looking for another alternative so quickly," Rosenbluth told CNBC in the same interview. Rosenbluth finds crypto investors are basically staying put despite the uncertainty. "It shows that investors that are moving into getting exposure to cryptocurrency through the ETF wrapper have some loyalty to the product, have confidence in the long-term trends," Rosenbluth said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump will meet Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolas Maduro. The CEOs of Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Shell and a representative from Chevron will attend, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. Representatives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon will also be there. Secertary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris  Wright, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are attending as well. ET meeting, an industry source told CNBC. Trump said in the immediate aftermath of Maduro's overthrow that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day(bpd)  in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. It will cost tens of billions of dollars to return Venezuelan production to its historic levels, Energy Secretary Wright said at a Goldman Sachs' conference in Miami Wednesday. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. The Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron. "Chevron is on the ground so we're getting daily updates," Wright told CNBC. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more," the energy secretary said. Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short- to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases. Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas. "The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. "I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook," Bessent said. The U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. "We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela," Wright said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products. "I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal," the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector. "In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner," Trump said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Friday announced agreements with three nuclear power providers, including one backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, as part of its efforts to secure necessary resources for its AI ambitions. The arrangements with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo, which are all working on nuclear power technologies, are for Meta's Prometheus supercluster computing system that's being built at a data center in New Albany, Ohio. Meta has said it expects Prometheus to come online sometime in 2026. In working with the three companies on energy production, Meta said the projects should add 6.6 gigawatts of power by 2035, exceeding the total demand of New Hampshire. "State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI," Meta policy chief Joel Kaplan said in a statement. The company said it will help fund Vistra's nuclear power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, extending the lifespan of those facilities and increasing their energy production. The other two companies' nuclear projects are still being developed. Meta expects the agreements to create "thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs." The deals mark the latest efforts by Meta to secure the energy needed to power its AI infrastructure as the company marches toward Zuckerberg's goal of developing superintelligence, a term used to describe AI that can greatly exceed the capabilities of humans on numerous tasks. Meta's megacap rivals are also looking to nuclear power to help fuel their AI work. Meta, Amazon and Google signed a pledge in March supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy production by 2050. In June, Meta announced a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy so it could purchase purchase nuclear power from the company's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois beginning in 2027. Meta's deal with TerraPower will provide funding for two of the energy company's nuclear projects that are under development and could begin generating power by 2032, according to Friday's announcement. Meta said it could obtain rights for more energy from up to six of TerraPower's other nuclear energy projects that are targeted for delivery by 2035. Meanwhile, Oklo's advanced nuclear technology campus is expected to come online as soon as 2030 in Pike County, Ohio, Meta said. OpenAI's Altman is one of Oklo's biggest investors, owning a 4.3% stake worth about $650 million as of Thursday's close, according to FactSet. Oklo went public in 2024 through a special purpose acquisition company that Altman co-founded. Altman stepped down as chairman of Oklo's board in April as a way to help the company secure more customers with companies that compete with OpenAI.

Intel shares rose 2% in extended trading on Thursday after Trump said he had "a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan" in a post on Truth Social. It was last seen 2.63% higher in early pre-market trading Friday. Other chip and AI-related names saw an uplift as investors digested Trump's post. "The United States Government is proud to be a Shareholder of Intel, and has already made, through its U.S.A. ownership position, Tens of Billions of Dollars for the American People — IN JUST FOUR MONTHS," Trump wrote. "We made a GREAT Deal, and so did Intel. The U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel through an $8.9 billion investment from the CHIPS and Science Act in August, which had otherwise been struggling. Intel's share price has risen 75% since the Trump administration announced its stake in the company, which also made the U.S. government its majority shareholder. Outside the U.S., European names ASML, which manufactures machines needed to make advanced computer chips, and ASMI, which makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, advanced 5.37% and 4.53% respectively on Friday. Elsewhere, memory chip firms also rallied at the start of the year as a core component to the training and running of artificial intelligence. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today U.S. President Donald Trump's ambitions around Greenland are rapidly gaining concrete form — that is, evolving from rhetoric into action. Mining company Amaroq told CNBC the White House has been having discussions with the firm over investing in its mining projects in Greenland. If it's a purely business transaction, that might not be unwelcome: Aaja Chemnitz, the member of parliament representing Greenland in the Danish Parliament, and chair of the Greenland Committee, told CNBC that the island is "open for business." Being open for business, however, does not mean welcoming a takeover bid. "It's been quite clear from the beginning that Greenland is not for sale and never will be," Chemnitz said. But that could be on the agenda for U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's planned meeting with Danish authorities next week. While the meeting was initiated by Denmark's foreign minister, Lokke Rasmussen, and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, Rubio will be looking to discuss how the U.S. can acquire the Arctic island. In the very hypothetical scenario — let's call it a thought experiment — that the U.S. buys Greenland, the island would be valued at nearly $2.8 trillion, according to a center-right U.S. think tank, though other parties put that figure lower. Rubio will also have to navigate thorny issues, such as dealing with Greenlander's desire for independence and Europe's response. As for other global powers, while Russia is conspicuously quiet — probably because it is more interested in seeing any division in NATO over this affair — China is keenly watching developments, having described itself as a "near-Arctic state" in 2018. Any transaction — or operation — on this scale will have global repercussions. Amaroq, which operates on the island, said the White House is talking to it about investment in its projects that extract or explore gold, gallium and other critical mineral deposits. Trump administration races to come up with Greenland takeover plan. Here are four key issues surrounding the meeting. The country's consumer price index rose 0.8% from a year earlier, as expected by a Reuters poll of economists. However, inflation was flat for 2025 as a whole. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose Thursday but the Nasdaq Composite slid as investors rotated out of tech. Lee Robinson, founder and chief investment officer of distressed debt investor Altana Wealth, captured returns of 30% in Venezuelan bonds after the U.S. attack on the country. Robinson said there's "more upside" to come. Can NATO defend itself — and is it willing to? Europe spent much of 2025 scrambling to bolster its defenses against Russia — but just a week into the new year, it's being forced to rethink security once again amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland. On Monday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned an American takeover of Greenland would spell the end of NATO. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 – including Denmark – are also members of the European Union, which has been working extensively to ensure Trump's administration continues its support for Ukraine.

Some US staff were told this week that they will not work for the new joint venture, called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Instead, they will work for a separate TikTok global entity that will remain under ByteDance's ownership, called TT Commerce & Global Services LLC. The change, outlined in a memo sent to impacted employees, includes workers who focus on US products that will remain tied to TikTok's global operations after the deal closes. In December, TikTok's CEO Shou Chew told staff those business lines would include "certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing."

TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the staffing change. Congress called out TikTok and China-based ByteDance in the law's text. President Donald Trump allowed the app to continue to operate last year via a series of executive orders as his administration worked with TikTok and prospective buyers on a potential deal. In September, the White House announced a deal had been reached, which Vice President JD Vance said would value TikTok US at around $14 billion.</p>
