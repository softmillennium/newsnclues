This story was originally published originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access. The Justice Department last fall began asking all 50 states for their voter rolls — massive lists containing significant identifying information on every registered voter in each state — and other election-related data. The Justice Department has said the effort is central to its mission of enforcing election law requiring states to regularly maintain voter lists by searching for and removing ineligible voters. The state included identifiable information about voters, including dates of birth, driver's license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, Pierce said. Experts and state officials around the country have raised concerns over the legality of the Justice Department's effort to obtain states' voter rolls and whether it could compromise voter privacy protections. The Justice Department has said it is entitled to the data under federal law, and withholding it interferes with its ability to exercise oversight and enforce federal election laws. The department has now sued 23 states and Washington, D.C., for declining to voluntarily turn over their voter rolls. Those states, which include some led by officials of both political parties, have generally argued that states are responsible for voter registration and are barred by state and federal law from sharing certain private information about voters. In an interview with “The Charlie Kirk Show” last month, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said 13 states, including Texas, had voluntarily agreed to turn over their voter rolls. DNC Chair Ken Martin said the turnover of such data is tantamount to a “big government power grab” and would invite privacy violations and could result in eligible voters being kicked off the rolls. The DNC, he said in a statement, “won't stand idly by as the Trump DOJ tries to get access to Texas voters' sensitive information.” Some election officials and voting rights watchdog groups have raised concerns about what the Justice Department intends to do with the information provided by the states, with some suggesting it may be used to create a national database of voters. The state has not yet released it. In a proposed memorandum of understanding sent to Wisconsin officials last month and publicly released by state officials, the Justice Department said that upon receiving the state's voter data, it would check the state's voter roll for “list maintenance issues, insufficiencies, anomalies or concerns.” The department would then notify the state and give it 45 days to correct any problems. In his letter to Nelson, Freeman identified two potential legal violations associated with some of those clauses, though acknowledged he didn't yet know whether Texas had signed such an agreement and asked for records. Freeman also wrote that federal law also bars states from doing systemic voter removals from the rolls within 90 days of a primary or general election. Because Texas has an upcoming March 3 primary, May 26 runoff and Nov. 3 general election, the state cannot conduct such list maintenance until after the runoff, Freeman wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran's government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in Tehran and other areas. Iranian state media broke its silence over the protests, alleging “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel set fires and sparked violence. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 42 people while more than 2,270 have been detained, Human Rights Activists News Agency said. “What turned the tide of the protests was former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi's calls for Iranians to take to the streets at 8pm on Thursday and Friday,” Washington Institute for Near East Policy senior fellow Holly Dagres said. “Per social media posts, it became clear that Iranians had delivered and were taking the call seriously to protest in order to oust the Islamic Republic.” Unfortunately, it also likely provided cover for security forces to kill protesters,” Dagres added. When the clock struck 8pm on Thursday, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. Thousands could be seen on the streets before all communication to Iran cut out. “Do not let the voices of my courageous compatriots be silenced.” Pahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call. His support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it is not clear whether that is support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Internet cut also appears to have taken Iran's state-run and semiofficial news agencies offline as well. US President Donald Trump on Friday said Washington was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran killed protesters, prompting Tehran to warn that intervention would destabilize the region. Protesters and security forces on Thursday clashed in several Iranian cities, with six people reported killed, the first deaths since the unrest escalated. Shopkeepers in Tehran on Sunday last week went on strike over high prices and economic stagnation, actions that have since spread into a protest movement that has swept into other parts of the country. If Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to Britain's King Charles III said he was “privileged and proud” to have known Schloss, who cofounded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice. “The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding Washington's military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears for Greenland, which Trump has repeatedly said he wants to annex, given its strategic location in the arctic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-government protests in Iran erupted for a thirteenth consecutive day on Friday, in a wave of nationwide unrest that marks the biggest challenge to the regime in years. Authorities cut off internet access and telephone lines on Thursday – the biggest night of nationwide demonstrations so far – leaving Iran largely cut off from the outside world. Rights groups said dozens of people have been killed since the protests began. US President Donald Trump has threatened to attack Iran if security forces respond with force. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has urged Trump to “focus on his own country” and blamed the US for inciting the protests. Concerns over inflation came to a head last week, when the prices of basic goods like cooking oil and chicken dramatically spiked overnight, with some products vanishing from shelves all together. People across more than 100 cities have participated in the demonstrations, which began nearly two weeks ago. Fueled by ethnic division and poverty, crowds set fire to the streets and chanted “Death to Khamenei,” directly challenging Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over the nation's religious and state affairs. Iranian state affiliated Fars news agency said 950 police forces and 60 personnel from the paramilitary Basij force have been injured in the protests mostly in confrontations with “rioters” in western provinces “equipped with firearms, grenades, and weapons.” At least 45 protesters, including eight children, have been killed since demonstrations began, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO (IHRNGO) reported Thursday. It said hundreds more have been injured and over 2,000 people detained. CNN could not independently verify the numbers of those killed and arrested, and Iranian state news organizations have sometimes reported individual deaths without reporting a comprehensive tally. “For more than 100 years of Iranian history, bazaaris have been key actors in all of Iran's major political movements. … Many observers do believe that the bazaaris are some of the most loyal to the Islamic Republic,” said Arang Keshavarzian, associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University and author of “Bazaar and State in Iran,” told CNN. Their role as a major political force has since become more symbolic, but the impact of fluctuations in currency on their business is what led them to spark the protests that have since turned deadly. Authorities have also sought to differentiate between economic protesters and those calling for regime change, branding the latter as “rioters” and foreign backed “mercenaries” while pledging a tougher crackdown against them. Two experts who spoke with CNN said the protests could lead to significant change. “These protests, whatever the outcome, will no doubt further damage an already fractured legitimacy for a state that I think is at the end of its life,” Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, told CNN's Eleni Giokos. This round of protests feels different from prior ones because of a sense of frustration and exhaustion among people in Iran, said Dina Esfandiary, Middle East lead for Bloomberg Economics. “It's reached a boiling point,” Esfandiary said. I really think there is going to be some change.” Masoud Pezeshkian was elected president in 2024, promoting a more pragmatic foreign policy, but his powers are limited, and Khamenei calls the shots on all major matters of state. “We should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,” Pezeshkian said in a televised speech Monday. Pezeshkian previously positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising economic relief through reduced government intervention in the currency market while also blaming US sanctions, corruption, and excessive money printing. At least some of the protesters appeared to be heeding his call. One of the slogans shouted by demonstrators Thursday was: “This is the last battle, Pahlavi will return,” according to video reviewed by CNN. People have tried different methods to air their views,” he added. Trump has warned Tehran of severe consequences if protesters are killed. “I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots … we're going to hit them very hard,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday. Just six months ago, Israel and the US launched attacks on Iran for the first time, with Trump raising the prospects of new attacks just last week, days after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a televised address marking his first public comments since the demonstrations started, Khamenei called on Trump to “focus on the problems of his own country.” “There are some agitators who want to please the American president by destroying public property. A united Iranian people will defeat all enemies,” he said. “The Islamic Republic will not back down in the face of those who are looking to destroy us,” Khamenei added. CNN's Kara Fox, Max Saltman, Adam Pourahmadi, Charlotte Reck and Aditi Sangal contributed reporting.</p>

NEW YORK, January 9. /TASS/. The US Southern Command has officially confirmed the seizure of the oil tanker Olina in its post on X, which included a video of the operation.

During the seizure, marines and sailors of the Southern Spear joint task force, acting in support of the US Department of Homeland Security, boarded the tanker Olina from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. The operation in the Caribbean Sea went smoothly.

The vessel was seized near the island of Trinidad (Republic of Trinidad and Tobago). According to Reuters, the tanker had previously made voyages to Venezuela under the flag of Timor-Leste.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pre-dawn assault on the Olina oil tanker was carried out by US marines and navy sailors in the Caribbean near Trinidad The US early on Friday boarded another oil tanker, the US military said, as part of efforts to target sanctions-busting vessels traveling to and from Venezuela. US forces were seen in video footage that officials posted online landing on the ship's deck as the vessel named Olina was seized in the Caribbean near Trinidad. The Trump administration has moved to control the distribution of Venezuela's oil products globally after its ousting and capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, less than a week ago from the capital city, Caracas, in a night-time raid which included airstrikes and US special forces deployed on the ground. The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, on X said the ship was seized in international waters and added: “As another ‘ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil, this vessel had departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces … The ghost fleets will not outrun justice.” “The vessel's AIS [location] tracker was last active 52 days ago in the Venezuelan EEZ, north-east of Curacao,” Vanguard, a British maritime risk management company, said separately. The Olina left Venezuela last week fully loaded with oil as part of a flotilla shortly after Maduro's capture on 3 January, and the vessel was returning fully loaded to Venezuela after the US blockade of Venezuelan oil exports, the industry source said. US government records show that the Olina was sanctioned for moving Russian oil under its prior name, Minerva M, and flagged in Panama. In July, the owner and manager of the ship on its registration was changed to a company in Hong Kong. The US government said it was part of the so-called shadow fleet of ships that sail with little regulation or known insurance. Since then, however, the ship has been running dark with its location beacon turned off.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's supreme leader has vowed that authorities will “not back down” in the face of a rapidly growing protest movement, setting the stage for an intensified violent crackdown on the second day of a nationwide internet shutdown. Another round of demonstrations was called for Friday night. In his first speech since demonstrations started on 28 December, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described protesters as “vandals” and “saboteurs”, and accused them of working on behalf of foreign agendas. Protesters are “ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy … because he said he would come to their aid”, Khamenei said – a reference to Donald Trump, who has threatened American intervention in Iran if authorities kill protesters. The US president, in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, suggested the supreme leader was preparing to flee Iran. The head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”. An internet blackout introduced on Thursday has sharply reduced the amount of information flowing out of the country. The Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baluch minority predominates, had been met with gunfire that wounded several people. Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, who had called for the protests on Thursday night, made another call for demonstrations to take place at 8pm (1600 GMT) on Friday. Protesters who went out on Thursday night said they were met with violence – part of what rights groups are calling an already brutal crackdown. I don't know how long the internet will be working but we are thousands on the streets and I fear I will wake up to hundreds of casualties.” At least 50 people have been killed in the violence surrounding protests, while more than 2,270 others have been detained, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency. State TV channels projected an air of normality, airing footage of pro-government demonstrations and insisting life went on as usual for most Iranians. The Iranian-owned Press TV reported that an Israeli spy cell was planning a “false-flag killing operation aimed at blaming the state for civilian deaths”. Speaking in Beirut on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, echoed claims of overseas interference. “The protests that are happening in Iran of course are different from protests in other countries because of US and Israeli interventions in the protests,” he said. “You need to look at all the statements from the US and Israel to see how they are interfering.” Understanding exactly what was happening in Iran and the true size of protests was difficult, with data and phone lines down. Hossein, a 22-year-old university student, said: “Since June, we have been trying several ways to find these ‘secret tunnels' that can route our messages outside the country. A group of us are able to still chat but I can see mobile lines are also getting disrupted.” A protester who responded to his call on Thursday night said that she believed that Pahlavi could assist with a transition to democracy. “We failed to unify under a strong opposition last time [2022] but we have learned our lessons,” said 46-year-old Mehnaz. “I am proud of each and every one of you who conquered the streets across Iran on Thursday night,” Pahlavi said in a post on X. Pahlavi's organisation also alleged that “tens of thousands” of security officers had signalled their intentions to defect via a platform it had set up, and that the organisation had been “inundated” by requests from officers. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International condemned on Friday what they said was authorities' use of force and mass arbitrary arrests. HRW has documented the deaths of 28 protesters who were shot by security forces between 31 December and 3 January, with instances of authorities using rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets. “We have so far documented many of the harrowing patterns of human rights violations that authorities have repeatedly committed during the previous rounds of protest crackdowns, including in November 2019, and the Woman, Life, Freedom pretests of 2022,” said Bahar Saba, a senior HRW researcher on Iran and Kuwait. The crackdown seemed only to harden protesters' resolve, many of whom described scenes of defiance, with rocks thrown at officers forcing them to retreat. Ali, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, said via text message: “Fuck them! We will burn their vans, the same that they use to drag our compatriots and kidnap our sisters from the streets. Another protester said unarmed protesters were confronting riot police, throwing rocks in response to bullets fired by officers. “They are vulgar and are saying we are in bed with the Israelis and Americans,” said Farzad, a 37-year-old mobile shop owner in the city of Rasht in northern Iran. It's them that have betrayed the very sense of being an Iranian.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko called on residents of the capital, if possible, to leave the city after a Russian attack on Jan. 9 left half of the city's apartment buildings without heating. As temperatures dropped below -10°C (14°F), Russia launched a mass attack on Ukraine overnight with 242 drones and 36 missiles, with Kyiv and its surrounding areas being the primary targets, the Air Force reported. The attack hit energy infrastructure facilities and multiple residential buildings in the capital, killing at least four people and injuring 19 others. The city is also facing water supply interruptions, with emergency power outages being introduced. Efforts to restore power and heating for residential homes in Kyiv is ongoing. If there is no heating supply, residents start using electricity to heat their homes, which, in turn, increases electricity consumption, the official added. "This is why, when the population is more, let's say spread across villages and other regions, there will be less pressure specifically in one city," Kolisnyk told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv, home to around 4 million people, has endured multiple of Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure since the start of the full-scale war in 2022. Over past months, Moscow has continued pounding energy facilities, with Ukrainian officials warning that Russia is attempting to shut down the energy grid region by region. In recent days, Russia has targeted regional capitals in the east and south, leaving Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts without power on the evening of Jan. 7. Russian forces also targeted critical infrastructure in the western Lviv Oblast overnight on Jan. 9, launching its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President fears Russia is ‘playing for time' rather than seeking Ukraine peace say White House sources Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with Vladimir Putin and sees him as a bigger obstacle to peace in Ukraine than Volodymyr Zelensky, according to sources. Another source said Mr Trump's found the Russians' “two steps forward, one step back” strategy in talks increasingly “tiresome”. However, several current and former Washington officials said the Trump administration's thinking was becoming more in line with the European view that Putin was playing for time. Mr Trump has blown hot and cold with both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war as he tries to make good on a campaign promise to secure peace. They point out that warm conversations between the two leaders were often followed by missile and drone attacks. He said: “Putin's sustained brutality, nefarious behaviour and game playing do not go unnoticed by the administration.” Right on cue, Putin's foreign ministry denounced the plans and said any Western troops deployments in Ukraine would be viewed as “legitimate targets”. Russia then fired an Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile at Lviv. Ukraine said it was a test for the transatlantic community. Mr Trump signalled his personal irritation with Putin during a recent press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Florida. A day later he contradicted Russian claims that Ukraine had targeted one of Putin's residences with drone. He told reporters on Air Force One: “I don't believe that strike happened. A former White House official said Mr Trump was also “emboldened” by the special forces raid to capture Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela. However, previous moves to get tough on Moscow have often been followed by a relaxing of pressure. He said: “I think this is an operational versus strategic question. He may push back harder on certain operational things but his strategic desire to end the Ukraine war quickly seems unchanged.” Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr Trump's aim remained the same.</p>

MOSCOW, January 9. /TASS/. In response to Kiev's attack on President Vladimir Putin's residence, Russian servicemen launched a massive strike, including with the Oreshnik missile, on critical Ukrainian targets, the Defense Ministry reported.

"In the early morning hours, in response to the terrorist attack by the Kiev regime on the residence of the Russian president in the Novgorod Region, carried out in the early morning hours of December 29, 2025, the Russian Armed Forces launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range land-and sea-based weapons, including the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, as well as strike drones against critical targets on the territory of Ukraine," the statement said.

According to the ministry, "the strike goals were achieved." "The targets were facilities for producing drones used in the terrorist attack, as well as energy infrastructure supporting the operation of Ukraine's military-industrial complex," the statement noted.

"Any terrorist acts by the criminal Ukrainian regime will continue to be met with a response," the ministry concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Syrian Defense Ministry has declared a ceasefire in three neighborhoods of Aleppo, the country's second-largest city, following clashes between government forces and Kurdish-led militias. The Aleppo security command has simultaneously imposed a curfew in several Kurdish-majority areas. Fighting between the army and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls large parts of northern and eastern Syria, began last week, forcing an estimated 100,000 people to flee their homes. On Thursday, government troops attempted to advance into Kurdish-held neighborhoods, while Damascus demanded the withdrawal of “militia groups.” The government blamed the SDF for “tensions and instability,” accusing the group of violating a previous accord. The SDF, in turn, blamed Damascus, asserting that the militias had withdrawn “openly and in a documented manner” months ago and handed control of the neighborhoods to government forces. Videos from Aleppo show heavy shelling and Syrian troops using drones against the SDF. Kurdish forces were seen ambushing government troops and firing sniper rifles and machine guns from high-rise buildings. The Syrian government reached a deal with Kurdish leaders in Aleppo in April granting them autonomy under Damascus' rule. A broader agreement, meant to reintegrate Kurdish-led civil and military structures into the central government by the end of 2025, has never been implemented; the two sides blame each other.
