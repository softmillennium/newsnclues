                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Government officials heard from scientists who said they need a larger role in the investigation into UFOs and other strange phenomena the government has been keeping secret. It's focused on UFOs (or UAPs, as they're now called) and what the government knows about these unusual sightings. They're pushing for the government to release more UAP data and for the development of better ways of detecting these unidentified objects. Former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo held up an unvetted photo of a UAP taken by a civilian pilot Thursday. Elizondo highlighted the uncertainty that military, commercial, and civilian aviators face when they witness and/or document UAPs in US airspace: 'Do they report it to the FAA? Dr Anna Brady-Estevez, a founding partner of American DeepTech, a technology investment firm, revealed that companies in the private sector are allegedly building new inventions based on alien systems. Brady-Estevez, who previously worked with NASA on space economic policy, said she had funded entrepreneurs who described their inventions as being inspired by UFOs. They were working on advanced communications,' the tech investor explained. 'I funded companies working on what the entrepreneurs later described as UAP-adjacent or UAP-inspired technologies,' Brady-Estevez added. She added that these inventors were not allowed to go into detail about their tech because of the classified nature of the research. Mike Gold, a former NASA associate administrator, revealed the amazing images sitting in the space agency's archives that have yet to be investigated as possible UAPs. Gold, the current president of civil and international space at tech company Redwire revealed several shocking images of unexplained phenomena that has been photographed by NASA on Mars and the moon. 'It's certainly worth the effort to investigate and we're not doing it!' The poll, conducted by NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ, surveyed 521 Republicans, 559 Democrats, 349 independents and 18 'other' voters. Republicans were also revealed to be more suspiscious than Democrats or Independants, with 48 percent saying the government hides UAP information. Intelligence community expert Christopher Mellon added on Thursday that the military has recently submitted roughly 1,800 reports involving UFOs in just the last few years. They add to a growing list of events that the US military have taken as serious threats to national security. There are dozens of unsolved cases going back to the 1960s that occurred over nuclear missile installations, Navy ships, and a desert in New Mexico. The FBI, CIA, and other government branches have spent years looking into these reports, but have yet to determine what the objects were and where they came from. In just the last few months, the skies over New Jersey were filled with unidentified aircraft and drones that required a formal response from both the Biden and Trump presidencies. Christopher Mellon, a national security expert who spent nearly 20 years in the US intelligence community, suggested that there is a massive coverup of data that would prove the extistence of UFOs visiting Earth. During his presentation at Thursday's hearing, Mellon revealed that the US government has some of the most powerful radar and satellite technology on Earth but has somehow never recorded any information about UAPs. 'Either we've spent billions of dollars on a system that's not performing as it should be... or it's simply so highly classified the information is not reaching AARO,' Mellon said. Mellon noted that the Solid State Phased Array Radar System is one of the most powerful sensor systems on the planet, which would be detected by any extraterrestrial civilization anywhere near Earth. Mellon called on the US Inspector General to look into the lack of reporting coming from key military radar posts regarding UFO sightings. This comes despite documented reports that the military has scrambled aircraft to follow UFOs they've detected near US airspace. Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral at Thursday's UFO hearing, says a secret military document was removed from his computer without his permission. Admiral Gallaudet said the classifed memo described the urgent need to address near-misses Navy pilots were having with UFOs. 'It didn't sit well with me,' Gallaudet said. Research physicist Dr Eric Davis said during Thursday's hearing that the US government has been operating a secret program that recovers crashed UFOs since the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. Since then, Davis claimed much of the technology recovered from these wrecks over the years has been secretly moved to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. All of this activity, Davis said, was being done without congressional oversight or approval, with project code names regularly changing every few years to cover up the Defense Department's actions. He previously said that examination of some materials recovered by the program failed to determine their source and led him to conclude, 'we couldn't make it ourselves.' A retired US Navy admiral slammed an alleged 'disinformation' campaign by the US intelligence community which he claimed was covering up military sightings of UFOs. Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral, spoke at Thursday's hearing, claiming that the Navy 'has a trove' of data on UFO sightings from pilots and other personnel who have spotted UAPs while on duty - much of which has not been officially released. Admiral Gallaudet publicly called on the White House to reveal this information and noted that he had just received reports from members of the Navy who had been involved in recent UFO sightings. He also compared the urgency needed on this topic to the current climate change emergency researchers are well funded to study in depth. During the hearing, Loeb referenced fragments of metal that he and his colleagues recovered from the Pacific Ocean in 2023. The remnants came from a meteor-like object that originated from 'interstellar space' and crashed off the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2014. Loeb has not ruled out the possibility that this object could have been an alien craft, or part of one. 'This is a historic discovery because it represents the first time that humans put their hand on materials from a large object that arrived to Earth from outside the solar system, he said at the time. Avi Loeb told Thursday's congressional hearing that 'there are objects in the sky that we don't understand' while explaining the need for increased funding for UFO detection. The Harvard astrophysicist added that he was upset with the lack of data available currently in terms of tracking objects flying over our skies. Loeb went to discuss the possibility of alien civilizations that could have developed long before humans developed into a modern society. Days before Thursday' hearing, the whistleblower behind a stunning report submitted to Congress - exposing what he claims is a secret Pentagon program tracking unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) - revealed his identity and says he fears for his future after speaking out. Matthew Brown, a former US national security official, publicly identified himself as the whistleblower on an episode of WEAPONIZED - a podcast released Tuesday that is hosted by investigative journalists and UFO experts Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp. One of today's main speakers is Avi Loeb, an Israeli-American astrophysicist at Harvard University. For years, Loeb has been a prominent advocate for more scientific investigation UAP sightings, hypothesizing that extraterrestrials have already visited Earth, and that we may have recovered physical evidence of their technologies. During the hearing, he plans to give a presentation advocating for more funding for UAP research and urging the US government to share 'any data or materials concerning what lies outside the solar system.' Months before Thursday's briefing, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official turned UFO whistleblower told Congress that there was proof of alien life being kept from the public. During his testimony back on November 14, 2024, he blasted the US intelligence community for 'excessive secrecy' of UAP reports that had lasted decades, adding that it was 'all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.' Elizondo resigned from his position, running the Pentagon's program to investigate UFO sightings to 10 years, and went public with what he knew in October 2017.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By framing Exercise Hammer Strike as a mix of innovation and technological modernisation, Pakistan army chief Syed Asim Munir Ahmed Shah is trying to project the image of a powerful general, top Indian intelligence sources have told CNN-News18. “It warns India against aggression while reassuring China of Pakistan's strategic utility." According to intelligence sources, this serves as a calculated psychological operation by the Pakistan army chief. “This exercise is to highlight cutting-edge weapon systems, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation technologies," a source said. “This signals Pakistan's ability to counter India's military edge: S-400 missiles and Rafale jets." Munir's statement, where he said, “Any misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response", reinforces nuclear ambiguity and conventional readiness and resembles India's Cold Start, said sources. Pakistan is showcasing niche technologies, likely Chinese-origin systems like HQ-9 SAMs and Wing Loong drones, they added. In this, they have shown the JF-17 Block III with Chinese AESA radars/PL-15 missiles, positioned to challenge India's Rafales. This is timed at heightened India-Pakistan tensions post-Pahalgam attack to preemptively counter Indian military posturing, sources stated. This distracts from domestic crises like economic collapse and political instability by redirecting focus to national security, they added. This exercise, according to them, counters India's global narrative of Pakistan as a terror sponsor by reframing the army as a professional, tech-savvy force. The presence of senior formations with him shows solidarity. Munir visited the Tilla Field Firing Ranges (TFFR) on Thursday to observe Exercise Hammer Strike— a high-intensity field training exercise conducted by the Pakistan army's Mangla Strike Corps, according to ISPR.</p>

Based on the Dark Horse comics, “Resident Alien” follows a crash-landed alien named Harry and his life on planet Earth. The fourth season starts with Harry (Alan Tudyk) and his baby Bridget stuck in prison on the Grey Moonbase, while a shape-shifting Alien called a Mantid (also Alan Tudyk) has taken over his body on Earth passing himself off as the real Harry Vanderspeigle. Harry manages to escape the Greys and arrives back on Earth for a showdown with the Mantid Alien, but soon finds he may not have what he needs to finish the job. Sheriff Mike (Corey Reynolds) and Deputy Liv (Elizabeth Bowen) attempt to solve some mysterious deaths in Patience that Sheriff Mike is beginning to think aren't caused by anything human.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With increasing trends like tarot card reading and astrology apps, psychic services are, once again, becoming a popular tool in mainstream culture. Between self-reflection, emotional guidance, and seeking clarity, plenty of people find these tools useful regardless of whether or not they believe that spirits are leading the charge. Let's say that tarot card reading is as much of a random draw as a poker game — that doesn't mean you can't get something useful from it. A significant portion of psychic reading centers on identifying clients' problems and helping them self-reflect to decide what to do. Ultimately, the cultural shift toward embracing mysticism has led to a focus on intuition, introspection, and seeking meaning when things are difficult. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Platforms like PsychicOz, Yes Psychic, and Fortune Psychics allow individuals to connect remotely with practitioners to self-reflect from the comfort of their couch. Whether it's relationship advice, career direction, or even a space to feel seen and heard, unjudged, psychic services offer comfort and introspection to many clients worldwide. Through a series of questions, emotional exploration prompts, and listening to gut feelings, many clients describe these services as “therapeutic” — just in an unconventional way that focuses on possibilities rather than certainty. Well, options like tarot cards, numerology, or mediumship focus on intuition and emotional resonance. Most people using these services aren't looking to find out what day they'll die or the eye color of their one true love. They're simply seeking personally meaningful guidance in a way that feels exciting and fun. Psychics and fortune-telling aren't new concepts in the slightest. These practices go all the way back to cultures like ancient Mesopotamia. From there, they made their way to 19th-century spiritualists and continued growing into the psychic practices available today. By nature, humans have always sought answers to the same questions, such as: “Who are we and why are we here?” Mysticism has long been a tool to help people answer those questions for themselves and humanity as a whole. The beauty of psychic services is their versatility. It doesn't matter whether or not you believe a tarot card is being hand-picked for you by the spirits or if you're using the practice as a means to ask yourself questions in a novel and entertaining way. Each person can decide for themselves to what extent they believe in mysticism. Naturally, not everyone believes in the usefulness or efficacy of psychic services. Scientific evidence is lacking, and some people warn against becoming over-reliant on unverified guidance. Yet, most aspects of life hinge on moderation. Is it healthy to seek out psychic readings for every decision you make? But that doesn't mean it can't be a helpful and intuitive tool to help people better understand themselves and their lives. At the end of the day, many psychic services aren't giving you advice: They're helping you connect with yourself to follow your own advice. Instead, they give people an opportunity to look within themselves for guidance. Sometimes, you just need a little nudge to listen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elway Explore the Psychic Toll of Warfare in Video for New Single “Laugh Track” Image design by Gene Bresler at Catch Light Digital. With 232 pages and an expanded 12″ by 12″ format, our biggest print issue yet celebrates the people, places, music, and art of our hometown, including cover features on David Lynch, Nipsey Hussle, Syd, and Phoebe Bridgers' Saddest Factory Records, plus Brian Wilson, Cuco, Ty Segall, Lord Huron, Remi Wolf, The Doors, the art of RISK, Taz, Estevan Oriol, Kii Arens, and Edward Colver, and so much more. Channeling Ziggy Stardust's glam transcendence, Will Toledo resurrects the album as a grandiose narrative vehicle while marking his valiant stride into the rock canon. The Erasure frontman works out something open and anthemic on his latest solo album, with producer Dave Audé adding subtler shades to his post-house pop mix. The Swedish post-punks' fourth album combines half-assed humor with half-assed performances, filling in the void left by guitar-centric punk with demented synth tinkering. It's that day and singular event which is the setting of this new song by Elway. Set to a video montage of presidents and political figures both pre- and post-Bush, both Democrat and Republican, as well as news footage of significant worldwide events, “Laugh Track”—the first single to be taken from Elway's forthcoming seventh album—explores the long-lasting ramifications of that day's events, as well as American imperialism in general. “The psychic toll of war is congenital,” explains frontman Tim Browne. “It is passed like a mutation through the generations in America. This song is about how I came to learn how endemic war is in our culture and it proposes, if not insists, for this utter madness to end with us.” It's no coincidence that this digitally released single—backed with an acoustic version of fan favorite “Better Whenever,” because Red Scare label owner Tobias Jeg doesn't like the idea of releasing lone tracks—is premiering here on May Day, given the label's (tongue-in-cheek) name and political leanings. “‘Laugh Track' is the first single from Elway's upcoming Nobody's Going to Heaven LP,” says Jeg, “and even though these soy boys are really frustrated with the current timeline, the new songs are secretly triumphant and affirmative.” The band will also be on tour later this month and will also be performing at this year's The Fest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But a microbial source of the signal from planet K2-18b would have interesting implications for evolution Recent reports claim that dimethyl sulfide detected on planet K2-18b indicates the presence of alilen life Belief in alien life, having been forever devoid of any empirical basis pro or con, has been free to enjoy cycles of fashion. Huygens' casual acceptance of extraterrestrial life remained the norm at least until HG Wells warned of its hazards, and even in 1952 the Astronomer Royal Harold Spencer Jones was happy to tell us that ‘it is almost certain that there is some form of vegetation on Mars.' Some still consider the origin of life on Earth to have been an extremely rare and improbable event on potentially habitable worlds. But probably a more common view, now that we know how abundant extrasolar and even somewhat Earthlike planets are, is that life of some kind might be fairly widespread in the universe, but that intelligent life – the sort that we purport to be – could be very rare. One argument for that view came from cosmologist Brandon Carter, who in 1983 pointed out a peculiar coincidence whereby the timescale for humans to evolve – around 4.6 billion years – is of the same order of magnitude as the span over which our planet will be habitable at all: in around 5 billion years' time the Earth will be fried by the ageing, swollen Sun before it wanes into a white dwarf.1 Carter inferred that it would normally take much longer for intelligent life to appear on a planet like ours, and that we are the result of one or two rare and improbable events required for such evolution: ‘hard steps' that usually preclude advanced, intelligent life but which will happen here and there throughout the cosmos. In this view, we're either alone or nearly so. Carter's hard-steps model has recently been challenged by a team who argue that the late arrival of humans need not imply our improbability, but might rather reflect the fact that the environmental conditions needed for big, complex life forms like us – not least, an oxygen-rich atmosphere to support our energy-hungry cells – can't evolve quickly from the inhospitable setting of the Hadean (Earth's oldest geologic eon).2 All this context adds intrigue to the recent claim by a team of astronomers at the University of Cambridge, UK, to have detected a potential ‘biosignature' – a compound that, on Earth, has only a biogenic natural source – on an extrasolar planet called K2-18b, 2.6 times the diameter of Earth and orbiting a red-dwarf star 124 light years away.3 They report the spectral signature of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in K2-18b's atmosphere, based on measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They said there is only a 0.3% chance of the signal being mere noise, but others have questioned that number. On Earth, DMS in the atmosphere is produced by marine plankton, and the Cambridge team says the compound has been considered a ‘robust biosignature' for planets like K2-18b, which is thought to have an ocean beneath an atmosphere rich in hydrogen. But an abiotic source of DMS has been reported from photochemical reactions involving hydrogen sulfide and methane.5 Some planetary scientists argue that it seems unlikely any putative biosignature gas in a planetary atmosphere can be considered compelling evidence for life, given how little we know about the geological conditions of any extrasolar planet. All the same, it's interesting to contemplate what a world with DMS-generating microbes might imply. On Earth, these are relatively recent: the metabolic pathway leading to DMS is thought to have appeared only around 250 million years ago.6 So it's a fairly sophisticated bit of biochemistry. Such life might then be supposed already to have completed some of Carter's hard steps – in which case they wouldn't look so hard after all. 6 HA Bullock, H Luo and WB Whitman, Front.
