                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal signed Wednesday does not commit the U.S. to any new weapons transfers, nor does it offer any explicit security guarantee. But, after months of Ukraine's stocks running low – no new U.S. military aid has been announced since Mr. Biden left office in January – it opens the door to a resumption of such help. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Bessent described the deal as “a total economic partnership. So there's the opportunity here for both sides to really win.” Writing on social media, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the pact “an important milestone in Ukraine–US strategic partnership aimed at strengthening Ukraine's economy and security.” While the agreement is hardly good news for Ukraine – which until now had been receiving U.S. and other Western military aid for free – it's a far better deal than the one Mr. Trump had tried to push on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February, when the two men publicly clashed in the Oval Office. When Mr. Zelensky balked, Mr. Trump lashed out, famously telling the Ukrainian President that he was being disrespectful and “gambling with World War Three.” That Mr. Zelensky was able to rebuild his relationship with Mr. Trump from that nadir is a substantive diplomatic accomplishment, even if the deal is one Ukraine would rather not have had to sign. This deal was never truly meant to be in Ukraine's interests. Trump needed it, yes, and so Ukraine had to play along,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, an associate professor of international relations at Mechnikov National University in Odesa. The signing of Wednesday's pact also suggests that Mr. Trump has assessed, correctly, that it's Mr. Putin, not Mr. Zelensky, who is the main obstacle to a peace deal – and the Nobel Peace Prize that Mr. Trump is said to crave. Opinion: The U.S. and Russia are both negotiating in bad faith “Trump has finally pressured [Ukraine] to pay for U.S. aid with mineral resources,” Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who now serves as deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said in remarks carried by the official TASS newswire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to signal the end of months of U.S.-mediated peace efforts, saying the timelines set by Mr. Trump were unrealistic. Mr. Trump initially vowed that he could end the war “in 24 hours,” then said he would give the process 100 days – a milestone that passed earlier this week. There are many questions and details that need to be resolved before the settlement,” Mr. Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday. Mr. Peskov said Russia's war aims – which include the demilitarization and official neutrality of Ukraine, in additional to Moscow's claim to have annexed five Ukrainian regions – remained unchanged from the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. He added that any peace deal needed to be agreed “with Ukraine, not the United States.” Tuesday night saw yet another Russian barrage of 170 drones and five ballistic missiles targeting Ukrainian cities. Two people were killed and 15 were injured when explosive drones struck a residential area in the port city of Odesa, and two others were killed in a Russian air strike on the battered frontline city of Myrnohrad, in the Donetsk region. Both sides fight on, knowing the tempestuous Mr. Trump could set yet another new direction at any time. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health officials in India are investigating reports that hundreds of children were served food that had contained a dead snake at a school last week. More 100 children who consumed the contaminated lunch meals fell ill in the town of Mokama, CNN affiliate CNN News 18 reported. At least two dozen students were hospitalized on April 24. A school cook dished out the meals after they had removed the snake remains, according to the country's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), citing local media. Some of the children showed symptoms of dizziness and vomiting, the commission said. The health scare sparked furor among villagers, who blocked a local highway in protest. The NHRC issued a two-week deadline to police in Bihar for a report on the incident, calling for an urgent update on the health status of the children. India runs the world's largest free school meal scheme, as a way of providing better nutrition and keeping children in education. In 2013, pesticides in such meals killed at least 23 students, prompting the government to improve safety standards. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky listens as South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa speaks at a joint press conference in Pretoria, South Africa, on April 24.PHILL MAGAKOE/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a long-anticipated mineral resources deal that could help Kyiv secure future military assistance, despite an apparent last-minute disagreement about its terms. The U.S. Treasury Department said late Wednesday afternoon that the two sides had agreed to establish a United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that would “accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery” from Russia's invasion while also recognizing “the significant financial and material support” that Washington has provided. The U.S. and Ukraine have announced an economic deal after a weekslong press by President Donald Trump on Ukraine compensate Washington for more billions in military and economic assistance to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.” He warned that anyone who “financed or supplied the Russian war machine” will be barred from profiting from Ukraine's reconstruction. It said the deal also did not provide security guarantees to Ukraine but contained language about long-term U.S. support for Kyiv. The news organization's sources said the profits would pay for future U.S. military aid to Kyiv rather than compensate Washington for past aid, as President Donald Trump had previously demanded. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the fund will receive half of royalties, licence fees and other payments related to natural resource projects in Ukraine. She framed it as tying the U.S. to Ukraine's future economic success. “This partnership represents the United States taking an economic stake in securing a free, peaceful and sovereign future for Ukraine,” she said. Separately on Wednesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A summary of the call released by Mr. Carney's office said the pair “agreed that a durable peace can only by achieved with Ukraine at the table,” seemingly a reference to previous American efforts to negotiate with Russia in Ukraine's absence. Before the deal closed on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent signalled that there had been some late disagreements over its details, even as Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was in Washington to finalize the accord. “The Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes. We're sure that they will reconsider that, and we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are,” he said at a televised White House cabinet meeting a few hours before closing the deal. Mr. Bessent did not specify what the sticking points were. (Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. had given aid worth US$350-billion to Ukraine. That deal fell apart after a Feb. 28 clash in the Oval Office between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump also blamed Mr. Zelensky for the fact that Russia had invaded his country. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky held a much calmer meeting last weekend on the sidelines of the Rome funeral for Pope Francis. Since then, Mr. Trump has softened his rhetoric toward Ukraine, and expressed stronger criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has rebuffed Mr. Trump‘s efforts to push the two sides toward a ceasefire. Mr. Trump has mused that Mr. Putin may be “tapping me along” and holding up a peace deal. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump explained his rationale for the deal: He felt that the U.S. should be getting something in return for helping Ukraine defend itself. “So I said, ‘well, we want something for our efforts beyond what you would think to be acceptable. “I think it‘s a sign of the increasing trust between both presidents,” Mr. Merezhko said. Mr. Trump has not authorized the delivery of any weapons or ammunition to Ukraine since taking office, leading to rising alarm in the Ukrainian military, which has relied on U.S. military support to hold back the Russian troops that currently control about 20 per cent of Ukraine. Mr. Trump once said he could deliver a ceasefire within 100 days of taking office – a milestone that passed on Tuesday with the war still raging. “Trump needs to show a victory for his 100 days in office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts are alarmed as department says it will alter vaccine testing methods and build new ‘surveillance systems' Health department officials released statements saying they could alter vaccine testing and build new “surveillance systems” on Wednesday, both of which have unnerved experts who view new placebo testing as potentially unethical. “All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”. The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems. Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation's most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for prolific misinformation. He also earned money by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers. Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post. Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. “No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he's asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit. Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be flagged to Kennedy's office. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an $11bn clawback in grants from states. Such trials would not be a normal part of routine updates.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shortly after the Trump administration took office, the State Department warned international scholars and students — people who had come to the U.S. to teach, conduct research and learn — that it planned to revoke visas based on allegations of antisemitism or for their purported support for groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. What happened was far more expansive — a sweeping termination of students' immigration status records in a Department of Homeland Security-managed database known as SEVIS (the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System), which left students and scholars — as well as their lawyers — with questions about their legal status while in the U.S. Those arrests came after a report from the news outlet Axios, which found the State Department had been using artificial intelligence in what it calls a “catch and revoke” mission to monitor foreign nationals, with particular attention to student visa holders. '” As more students heard updates on their statuses, it became clear that the intended targets went beyond political protesters. As of April 24, the news outlet Inside Higher Ed documented at least 1,800 students and scholars whose visa records in the SEVIS database were originally revoked. They attend or teach at a wide array of colleges and universities — ranging from public to private, from the Ivy League to art schools and small liberal arts programs. And, while some of those targeted may have been actively involved in pro-Palestinian organizing, others believe they lost their visas because of minor traffic infractions or other low-level offenses that appear on their record. In the hearing, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes urged government officials to share details over what they dubbed the “Student Criminal Alien Initiative.” Government officials described a program in which ICE, alongside contractors, ran the names of foreign students through a federal index that tracks interactions with law enforcement — including things like traffic arrests or charges that may have been dropped, if they were ever brought at all. But those public arguments fell apart when it came to individual legal cases. “Terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation.” Meanwhile, Justice Department lawyers, when pressed by Reyes in another case, were unable to answer questions about the student's legal status. “Either he's here legally or he's not here legally.” Historically, removing a visa for international students does not automatically lead to deportation orders or indicate that a person must leave the country. New York City-based immigration attorney Kaitlyn Amanda Box told Truthout that the more than 1 million international students currently in the U.S. typically begin the process of international study by applying to a school that is both accredited and certified to admit international students. Once accepted, the institution provides the student with an I-20 form that outlines their intended course of study and asks for basic biographical information. The State Department then vets everything and students are typically issued an F-1 visa (for study at an accredited college, university or language institute), a J-1 visa (for international student exchange programs) or an M-1 visa (for non-academic vocational training). Once issued, a visa is normally good for the duration of time it takes to complete a degree; international scholars are generally authorized to stay for five years. If a student's visa is revoked, Box says, “colleges and universities need to understand that this does not prohibit the student from attending classes or change their enrollment status.” In fact, she continues, “While a visa allows a noncitizen to enter the country, it does not control their status once they're here. If they leave to go home for a visit, though, because the original visa was revoked, they will need to apply for a new one. In an internal memo, the agency shared a new policy warning that students whose visas are revoked may also get their legal status canceled. In addition, Box said that following the April 25 pause, many questions remain unanswered. “No guidance has been promulgated so far to indicate what recourse, if any, people whose visas were canceled have,” Box told Truthout. This includes questions about whether or not those with revoked visas can continue to do paid work on campus. “Working in the U.S. could become an issue,” she said. “Some international students have on-campus jobs, and schools are unsure if they can still pay them. In addition, most international students want to spend additional time in the U.S. and complete an Optional Practical Training (OPT) program once they finish their degrees.” Until the Trump takeover, OPT allowed recent graduates an additional year during which they were permitted to complete an internship or work; STEM graduates were able to extend this for an additional 24 months. “But now,” Box said, “everyone is worried that they'll be unable to find a job or apprenticeship since mentors are afraid of negative consequences if they take someone on.” Not surprisingly, she reports that this is taking an emotional toll on visiting faculty and international students. “There is so much fear and panic,” she said. A small number are even self-deporting and hoping to finish their programs online.” Thiri, a doctoral student in theology from Southeast Asia who asked to be identified by first name only to avoid being targeted by the Trump administration, told Truthout that her anxiety ramped up shortly after the revocations began. “I know that my visa is vulnerable,” she said, “so I have provided hospitality to student protesters who need food or a place to stay. I have not gone to any demonstrations or rallies. “They're arresting people with green cards, so I am terrified. I'm worried that they won't let me return. Part of the problem is that college administrators don't have answers either. The Coalition for Action in Higher Education — a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), Faculty for Justice in Palestine, Scholars for Social Justice, Higher Education Labor United, the American Comparative Literature Association, the Debt Collective, Historians for Peace and Democracy and Jewish Voice for Peace — coordinated a nationwide Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17 that not only denounced the visa revocations, but also opposed efforts to restrict campus activism. Other schools have focused more narrowly on the visa issue. The American Council on Education and 15 other higher education associations requested a meeting with the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security in early April — as yet unscheduled — to demand “clarity” about the termination of student visas. Needless to say, there is a lot at stake. “These students conduct life-saving research, start businesses, and foster intellectual dynamism. The administration's recent actions concerning international students create a great deal of uncertainty on college campuses and could deter global talent from coming to the United States.” That talent, the American Council on Education estimates, is worth $43.8 billion a year and supports 375,000 U.S. jobs. International scholars are also fearful about their continued ability to teach, do research and collaborate with U.S.-based colleagues. The lawsuit was promulgated, she said, because so many AAUP members were reporting that their international colleagues were canceling papers, workshops and conferences due to fear of being deported. “Noncitizens feel that they are under scrutiny,” she said. What is particularly striking is that there is a confluence between Title VI investigations and attacks on preferred speech.” (Last month, 60 colleges throughout the country were notified that they were being investigated for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. People who write about foreign policy are obvious targets, she said, but the administration is also directing its animosity toward people who organize or write about gender, queer themes, climate change and race. The administration is offering a brazen and perverse vision of what society needs.” Since the lawsuit was filed, it has garnered significant support. Since 2013, 12 million international students have studied at American colleges and universities. By 2023, they accounted for 6 percent of domestic higher education enrollment. That said, some colleges are far more reliant on international students than others. But people are continuing to protest, and students are not backing down despite the Trump administration's use of tactics that represent the most autocratic regimes. These students have been so courageous and largely peaceful in their exercise of free speech. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies can now illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences. On March 14, President Donald Trump quietly rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for private sector employees on federal contracts. Executive Order 14026 was issued by former President Joe Biden in 2021. The Department of Labor (DOL) estimated that some 327,300 workers saw their wages go up, with an average wage increase of over $5,000 a year. “Because federally contracted work so often takes place in long racially segregated industries in states where corporate lobbyists and their lawmaker allies have unjustly suppressed wages, this action will also help begin to close the racial wealth gap,” noted National Employment Law Project (NELP) Executive Director Rebecca Dixon at the time. Trump's move could result in thousands of workers losing their pay increases, but its overall impact may be much more severe. A full overturning of the rule means that some federal contractors will return Obama-era wage of $13.30 an hour, but Trump could undo the minimum wage for these workers altogether, meaning that some contractors could make just $7.25 an hour in some states. “Lower-wage federal contractors include janitors who clean government buildings, food service workers on military bases, cashiers in gift shops in national parks and security guards protecting federal property,” Samantha Sanders, the Economic Policy Institute's director of government affairs and advocacy, told Truthout. “This pay cut is a blatant attack on these workers — everyday people all across the country trying to make rent, buy groceries, and support their families.” In other words, companies can illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences. Many workers technically have protections through labor laws like the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, which are supposed to require prevailing wages by certain federal contractors. However, these laws have not been updated to keep up with inflation and are largely inadequate in the current economy. As a Center for American Progress report points out, many of the market wages established by these laws are less than the $17.75 hourly wage that Trump just nixed. The Trump administration knows there is power (and thus protections) in a union, which is why it's trying to prohibit federal workers from organizing in any way. According to a report from Government Executive, the order could eradicate bargaining rights for about 67 percent of the federal workforce and for 75 percent of workers who currently belong to unions. “This administration's bullying tactics represent a clear threat not just to federal employees and their unions, but to every American who values democracy and the freedoms of speech and association,” said American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley after Trump announced the order. “Trump's threat to unions and working people across America is clear: fall in line or else.” The lawsuit aims to invalidate a large swath of union contracts. Elon Musk's so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) also effectively shut down the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), an independent federal agency tasked with resolving work stoppages. DOGE “basically decided to eliminate all but a few people from the agency,” an FMCS employee, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told The Guardian. “We don't know the final count but maybe a dozen left out of an agency that had almost 200 employees through last year…. It is shocking as the agency does not regulate and has always been non-controversial.” In yet another swipe against federal workers, Trump recently ended collective bargaining rights for nearly 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees. The TSA negotiated a seven-year labor agreement last year, which included the addition of parental bereavement leave and expanded shift trade options for workers. Thousands more could be facing unemployment, thanks to a rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on April 18. “Moving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as ‘Schedule Policy/Career,' and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,” Trump wrote on social media after the rule was announced. “If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job.” An economic analysis of the move suggests it could provide a raise for some 22 million people. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. “A $17 minimum wage by 2028 would generate $86 billion in higher wages for workers and would also benefit communities across the country,” explains the report. “Because underpaid workers spend much of their extra earnings, this injection of wages will help stimulate the economy and spur greater business activity and job growth.” Let me give you the downside, though: In California, they raised it up to a very high number, and your restaurants are going out of business all over the place. The population is shrinking, it's had a very negative impact. But there is a level at which you could do it, absolutely.” It's clear that Trump is no longer undecided on the issue. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the largest quarterly fall in sales since the Covid lockdowns of 2020, and comes as US measures of consumer confidence plummeted in March and April. The company, headquartered in Chicago, has been trying to boost consumer spending on its Big Macs and chicken McNuggets through the launch of a new “value” menu. Also on Thursday, GM, one of the “big three” Detroit carmakers, cut its profit guidance for the coming year, and cautioned that Trump's tariffs could cost it as much as $5bn (£3.8bn) in 2025. The move was designed to give a reprieve to US carmakers, after the domestic industry warned his strategy would increase costs for American manufacturers by tens of billions of dollars. Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will now not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, such as those on steel and aluminium. US carmakers will also be allowed to apply for temporary tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although the relief will be phased out over the next two years. Mary Barra, GM's chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders that the company now expected to make a pre-tax profit of between $10bn and $12bn this year, including a tariff exposure of between $4bn and $5bn. “We look forward to maintaining our strong dialogue with the administration on trade and other policies as they continue to evolve,” Barra wrote. Carmakers have been struggling to keep up with Trump's frequent changes to his plans for sweeping levies, which have also forced Stellantis – the owner of brands including Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat – and German manufacturer Mercedes to withdraw their financial guidance for the year as a result of the uncertainty around tariff policy. GM and the other two big Detroit carmakers, Stellantis and Ford, have significant manufacturing facilities in Mexico or Canada which serve the US market, prompting analysts to caution that the trio could be most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs. Under free trade agreements, which have been in place for decades, parts and cars can crisscross that border many times. Uncertainty and abrupt policy U-turns also appear to be weighing on US consumers, while other hospitality businesses including Starbucks, Domino's Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill have warned that Americans are cutting back on dining out. US consumer sentiment plunged by 32% to its lowest level since the 1990 recession between January and April, after the announcement of Trump's tariffs sparked fears of a global trade war. The index of consumer sentiment score is based on a monthly survey asking Americans about their financial outlook.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is causing concern within the White House over his unconventional approach to high-stakes diplomacy with Russia and Iran, the New York Post reported on April 30, citing unnamed sources. Witkoff, who has emerged as Trump's de facto personal envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and concurrently handles Middle East affairs, has participated in solo meetings with foreign leaders, bypassing typical diplomatic protocol, according to the report. According to New York Post sources, Witkoff has even used Kremlin translators during discussions with Putin — a breach of standard U.S. diplomatic practice. In contrast, Putin was joined by his aide Yuri Ushakov and Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev. Witkoff's posture has alarmed officials because he frequently echoes Putin's narratives while reportedly lacking a clear understanding of Ukraine's position. The role of special envoy for Ukraine remains assigned to Keith Kellogg. Following an April 11 meeting with Putin in St. Petersburg, Witkoff said discussions focused on a potential peace deal concerning "five territories." Though he did not name them explicitly, he appeared to reference Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, which Moscow claimed in 2022. He helped secure a two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that began shortly before Trump's inauguration but was not extended. "Steve Witkoff is simply someone Trump trusts," Alexandra Filippenko, a U.S.-Russia relations expert, told the Kyiv Independent. She noted their relationship dates back to the 1980s Manhattan real estate scene. Filippenko emphasized that Witkoff's prominent role in such sensitive negotiations, despite operating outside the State Department, remains "an unusual arrangement."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, May 1. Russian President Vladimir Putin has held a phone call with his UAE counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing Abu Dhabi's assistance in Russia-Ukraine prisoner swaps, the Kremlin press service said in a statement. The Russian leader commended the United Arab Emirates' assistance "in organizing the exchanges of detained persons." "Thanks to the efforts of the Emirati side, 246 Russian service members were able to return home on Easter's eve (April 19)," the statement reads. According to the Kremlin, "the leaders expressed satisfaction with the current level of Russian-Emirati relations, which are strategic in nature and continue to develop in the political, trade, economic and humanitarian fields." "This kind of close cooperation makes it possible to maintain dialogue even on the most sensitive international issues," the statement notes. Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan congratulated Putin and the people of Russia on the upcoming 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War. On Wednesday, Putin held a meeting with UAE Deputy Prime Minister Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Kremlin. Since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates has been assisting both sides in addressing humanitarian issues. Abu Dhabi is also actively involved in organizing prisoner exchanges.</p>

NEW YORK, May 1. /TASS/. By concluding a minerals deal with Kiev, Washington is seeking to demonstrate that it has economic interests in Ukraine, US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent told Fox News.

"He [US President Donald Trump] wants both sides to come to the table now by showing that the US has an economic interest in Ukraine," he said.

Bessent believes that the deal is "a signal to the Russian leadership."

"It's also a signal to the American people that we have a chance to participate, get some of our the funding and the weapons compensation," the secretary of the Treasury added.

Earlier in the day, Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Minister Yulia Sviridenko confirmed the signing of the minerals deal with the United States in a post on Facebook (banned in Russia, owned by the Meta corporation, recognized as extremist in Russia). According to the document, Ukraine will bring into the fund 50% of all incomes generated by new licenses for extracting minerals at new areas. The United States and Ukraine will have equal votes in managing the fund. The agreement envisages no direct Ukrainian liabilities to the United States.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. When Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987, the Chinese telecommunications company had a few thousand dollars in the bank and an eye on reverse-engineering advanced foreign technology. By 1994, Huawei was producing switching equipment, the hardware and software that form the basis of modern telecommunications, and Ren was taking a meeting with Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin. From that moment on, business and government have been partners in the mission to keep China's telecommunications secure. Beijing poured resources into Huawei and other Chinese companies, positioning them to outcompete foreign firms. So successful was this effort that by 2012, Huawei telecom gear had been deployed across rural America, covering the bases that house U.S. nuclear weapons. Huawei may not have been raking in profits from this venture, but for Beijing it was an intelligence coup. Although the United States began to push back on these efforts and eventually banned Huawei from U.S. networks in 2016, Huawei's successes have continued to mount. It is also poised to lead the next generation of networking—6G. The company's competitors accuse it, with some justification, of achieving this dominance through intellectual property theft, helped along by aggressive Chinese subsidies and a closed Chinese market. Today, only two non-Chinese firms remain capable of competing with Huawei on a global level: the Swedish firm Ericsson and the Finnish Nokia. This is not simply about Western firms' lost market share. That access would be valuable to Beijing at any time. Huawei has deployed its Smart City services—which can include street camera imaging; electricity, gas, and water meter data; and social media analysis—in more than 200 cities in 40 countries, from Singapore to Spain. The data sets this produces could be fed straight into Chinese AI models and made available to China's military and intelligence agencies, making Beijing not just a leader in telecommunications but the dominant player in the use of AI for public safety and national security. The recently exposed Salt Typhoon hacking operation, which targeted major U.S. telecommunications firms, also demonstrated China's determination to gain access to U.S. networks by any means necessary. U.S. President Donald Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden after him took steps to slow China's ascent to this commanding height. Both administrations tried, in particular, to address Huawei and other Chinese firms' cost advantage over their Western counterparts. Beijing will gain an even greater edge in telecommunications if international tensions and trade wars undermine cooperation among Western countries. In his second term, Trump must redouble U.S. efforts to compete, enhancing programs that are working, making hard choices about how to allocate the range of invisible waves that carry wireless signals such as radio, television, and phone data through the air, known as spectrum, and working with allies to finance research and development and technology deployments abroad. Apart from its support for research and development, Washington largely left the free market alone. In China, by contrast, the government and military treated leading telecommunications firms as national champions, powering their rise because their success bolstered Beijing's strategic aims. Huawei alone reportedly received $75 billion in government support between 2008 and 2018, which enabled it to gain market share by pricing products well below cost. By 2025, Ericsson and Nokia, even after acquiring their failing peers, were down to a combined 40 percent market share. Chinese firms account for an additional 40 percent of the global market. Today, the United States and Europe—home of both Ericsson and Nokia—are sitting on a shrinking base, as China continues to undercut their sales pitches by subsidizing Huawei deployments around the world. Although Huawei's global dominance in 5G has been slowed by U.S.-led sanctions and export controls, neither the United States' innovations nor those of its partners have threatened the competitiveness of its products. Given that Huawei's research and development budget is more than twice the size of its two next-largest Western competitors, the company is unlikely to lose its innovation advantage. The United States also began to encourage its allies, most notably the United Kingdom, to remove Huawei gear and work with trusted firms instead. But both parties have known for years that banning Chinese technology would not be enough. The United States and its partners would need to develop a cost-effective alternative that could compete with China's aggressively subsidized products. It needs to compete with China at scale, narrow the price gap between U.S. and Chinese technologies, and encourage wider adoption of trusted systems. The way to accomplish this is with incentives for technology innovation and joint financing for countries choosing between Chinese and non-Chinese technologies. Initial grants focused on funding large-scale interoperability testing of technologies that integrate hardware and software from different vendors. Over $140 million was awarded to U.S. and foreign firms and universities through this initiative, with a further $420 million in grants made available in May 2024. This was a good start, but future funding rounds must move much faster and focus on projects that commercialize new technologies, giving U.S. software companies greater incentives to enter the market. In particular, directing capital to the “cloudification” of network infrastructure—that is, subsidizing technology that creates virtual versions of specialized equipment—will pay dividends for U.S. industry, which excels at software development. When 5G technology was first introduced, China built 600,000 5G base stations in three months. It took the United States two years to build 100,000. By integrating artificial intelligence into telecommunications operations, companies could rapidly increase transmission speeds and network capacity, improving overall efficiency. Another important way to lower costs for U.S. firms is through tax policy. For example, Washington can encourage investment in digital infrastructure by allowing accelerated depreciation, a financial tool that enables companies to quickly lower the value of new assets and thus reduce their tax burden and free up investment funds. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included such a provision, but it was set up to last for only a limited time and the mechanism is already being phased out. Congress should now extend these types of tax incentives to a broad category of digital infrastructure equipment to maximize private-sector investment. Even after the United States implements these reforms, the cost of non-Chinese technologies will still undermine U.S. efforts to persuade other countries to avoid Chinese vendors. The alternative on offer must be technologically advanced and competitively priced. The United States therefore needs to cooperate with its partners on digital infrastructure financing. This model has worked before: under the East Micronesia Cable project, launched in 2022, Australia, Japan, and the United States have jointly contributed over $90 million to support secure, sustainable, and resilient telecommunications infrastructure in and between Pacific Islands countries. The two European heavyweights in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, are already well established in U.S. markets but need additional research and development support to be able to compete globally with Huawei. Japan and South Korea have smaller companies that could also compete if provided enough backing. A deal with Washington that covers R & D and financing for technology adaptation in third countries could help any or all of these partners lessen their companies' disadvantages relative to Chinese firms. China is ramping up its funding for these projects, and the United States and its partners must do the same. The bank still needs more flexibility to take on risk and offer competitive financing for 5G projects, but its recent efforts show promise. Already, $313 million has been approved to support 5G construction in India under a cofinancing agreement with Finland's export credit agency. With more collaboration of this kind, Washington can show the world that the United States and its partners are determined to offer compelling alternatives to China's subsidized vendors. The private sector has a role to play, too. Earlier this year, Google and the government of Chile announced the launch of Humboldt Cable, a subsea cable route connecting Chile to Australia via French Polynesia. A concerted effort by the United States and its allies to include private firms in their strategy can incentivize similar investments to keep far-flung parts of the world connected to Western technology, rather than reliant on companies that may be controlled by Beijing. Spectrum, which refers to the range of invisible energy waves used to carry information (such as television and WiFi) through the air, is a limited resource. Spectrum is vital for all kinds of data transfers, whether streaming movies or using drones to monitor infrastructure—in other words, it is not only the government that needs it. Instead, the government and private firms compete for access. This holds back U.S. technologies relative to their Chinese rivals. China's advantages in this area underpin its ambitions to control global networks and to reap military and strategic benefits from that control. Washington will now need to make hard choices to make portions of the Pentagon's spectrum available for commercial use, while ensuring that it preserves critical military and intelligence capabilities. U.S. companies would be better positioned to develop next-generation mobile technologies, initiating a virtuous cycle of innovation. The Pentagon should work with commercial firms to scale up the use of new spectrum-sharing technologies, licensing regimes, and AI-supported software to make networks smarter and more agile. This would enable government and commercial users to share spectrum more effectively than is possible today, which means the Defense Department could access spectrum when needed for infrequent but important missions, training, and testing. A pilot project initiated by the Biden administration has aimed to test these technologies at scale and in partnership with private firms. The Trump administration should quickly wrap up this pilot and accelerate the next steps of figuring out how spectrum sharing will be governed and putting rapid dispute-resolution processes in place. It will also give the private sector confidence that on-demand spectrum would be sufficiently reliable for commercial purposes. That confidence is key to making private-sector investment in digital infrastructure worthwhile. A China that dominates global digital networks would be able to surveil them at will. U.S. national security depends on the United States regaining its lead. Although the competition with China will be fierce, particularly because of Beijing's willingness to wield its economic clout to give its companies a crushing competitive advantage, Washington must engage. Technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, virtualization, and artificial intelligence will only become more important.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Donald Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda. Trump announced the far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. The 49-49 vote came weeks after the Senate approved a resolution that would have have thwarted Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the dismal economic numbers should be a “wakeup call” to Republicans. Wary of a rebuke to Trump, GOP leaders encouraged their conference not to vote for the resolution, even as many of them remain unconvinced about the tariffs. Vice President JD Vance attended a Senate GOP luncheon Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who assured senators that the administration is making progress toward trade deals with individual countries. Some Republicans argued that the vote was a political stunt. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he backs separate legislation by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley that would give Congress increased power over determining tariffs but would voted on the resolution, which he said is only about “making a point.” Texas Sen. John Cornyn said the vote shows that senators “believe that the President's policies deserve to be tried and see if they're successful.” “The only thing Donald Trump's tariffs have succeeded in is raising the odds of recession and sending markets into a tailspin,” said Schumer, D-N.Y. “Today, they have to choose – stick with Trump or stand with your states.” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it a “fake” emergency that Trump is using to impose his “on again, off again, red light, green light tariffs.” The tariffs “are pushing our economy off a cliff,” Warren said. Republicans held a procedural vote after the tied vote to ensure that Democrats could not bring the resolution up again, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters afterward. The Republican president has tried to reassure voters that his tariffs will not provoke a recession as his administration has focused on China, raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% even as he paused the others. “So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said on April 30 that he does not expect Washington to abandon peace efforts despite previous threats from the White House to do so. "The Ukrainians have already said they're willing to give up the land... not de jure, forever, but de facto because the Russians actually occupy it... That's what they're willing to go to, they told me that last week," Kellogg said in a television interview with Fox News. The U.S. has intensified efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. "I don't think so," Kellogg said when asked if the U.S. is ready to walk away from peace talks to end Russia's war against Ukraine. The U.S. has threatened to walk away from efforts to broker a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia if progress is not made. What they want... and what they have is a very comprehensive and permanent ceasefire that leads to a peace treaty. When I mean comprehensive, sea, air, land infrastructure for at least 30 days... It could build to an important peace initiative," Kellogg said. Kellogg noted a ceasefire should last at least 30 days, adding that it is what U.S. President Donald Trump believes should be done. That's what President Trump wants to do," Kellogg said. "I think it was a very positive discussion, in fact, what the Ukrainians told me was very constructive," Kellogg said. "People don't understand how violent this war has been. Soldiers alone, when you combine the Ukrainian and Russian soldiers killed and wounded, were over 1.2 million, that is an unheard of number," Kellogg said. U.S., U.K., German, French, and Ukrainian officials met in London on April 23 to discuss a path toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms. Zelensky has repeatedly called for a full 30-day ceasefire, saying on April 23, Ukraine insists on an "immediate, full, and unconditional ceasefire."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In early April, Goldman Sachs forecast significant challenges for the Chinese economy and labor market, citing high U.S. tariffs, declining exports to the United States, and a slowing global economy. U.S.-based economist Davy Wong said the impact may be larger because of the indirect effects on various businesses, including suppliers for export manufacturers, packaging companies, and logistics companies. “It could be between 30 million and 35 million jobs,” he told The Epoch Times, noting that the impact is “lethal” to China's industrial cities. The factory supplies materials to textile manufacturers in nearby Dongguan, a major hub for exporting consumer goods, including clothing and LED monitors. “They used to ship goods every day but not so much now. Lots of products were left in the warehouse,” Li said, noting that many U.S. orders were left stranded in containers at Shenzhen's Yantian container shipyard. Li noted that his factory, which also exports products to Japan and the UK, has been less significantly affected than those exporters working with U.S. clients. Lee, an employment agent in Anhui Province, one of China's major production bases of solar panels and electric cars, said he has seen a drastic change in the job market. “Many industries are in decline; lots of factories went bust,” he said. A few years ago, according to Lee, factories were actively hiring, and the average salary was 5,000 yuan (about $688) or more. Shenzhen is one of China's first-tier cities, attracting domestic migrant workers from smaller cities and rural areas who seek better job opportunities, higher wages, and improved living conditions. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's urban unemployment rate in March was 5.2 percent. The woman explained that she had changed jobs three times since 2022, successfully finding new positions in less than a week each time. However, she found it particularly challenging to do the same this year. In early April, the state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. drew attention after posting a comment on WeChat, boasting that it had received nearly 1.2 million resumes for 1,730 vacancies. After facing criticism for insensitivity toward young job seekers, the company deleted the post and announced plans to hire about 8,000 people. In Guangzhou, China's largest electronics manufacturing hub and home to several lucrative industries, Zhang, a 23-year-old computer hardware engineering graduate who moved to the city in March, said he was taken aback by how difficult it was to find a job. Zhang said he tried to get a job at an electronics factory, where 50 young candidates were competing for two vacancies. In Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, Chen has been job hunting for about six months. She's making ends meet by delivering take-out food using rented public bikes. It's tough to find employment in any industry this year, she said. I have no choice but to do the most basic jobs,” Chen said. In Guiyang, Guizhou Province, Yang, an economics undergraduate, became indebted after losing her job at a local government department a few months ago, as she has been unable to find other employment since. ”To avoid paying compensation, they cut my salary [to force me out instead of letting me go], but I couldn't accept it, so I left.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuela is demanding that a 2-year-old girl be returned to her family after the United States deported her parents and kept the toddler in government custody. The Venezuelan foreign ministry on Monday accused the US of “kidnapping” Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, saying she was separated from her mother as she was boarding a deportation flight back to Venezuela. It also said the girl's father, Maiker Espinoza-Escalona, had been deported earlier by the US to a notorious prison in El Salvador. “(The US) once again committed the extremely serious offense of separating families and removing a minor from her emotional environment and, in particular, from her biological mother,” read a statement from the Venezuelan government on Monday. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied it kidnapped the girl, arguing it was trying to protect her from her parents, whom it accused without evidence of being part of Tren de Aragua (TDA), a Venezuelan gang the US has designated a terror organization. The father believes he was accused of being a gang member because he has tattoos, but he denies they have anything to do with gangs, according to his sworn declaration filed in court in early March. CNN has asked Maikelys' mother, Yorely Escarleth Bernal Inciarte, about the allegation. In a Saturday statement, DHS said the toddler was removed from a deportation flight list “for her safety and welfare.” She remains in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and has been placed with a foster family, it added. Last week, three US citizen children — including a 4-year-old with metastatic cancer — were taken to Honduras with their undocumented mothers as the women were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It's unclear if Maikelys' mother was given the choice to be deported with her daughter. When asked for more information, DHS referred CNN to the statement it released on Saturday. CNN has also reached out to ORR for details on Maikelys' case. The toddler and her parents entered the US in May 2024 to seek asylum, according to a court document filed by legal advocacy groups. Maiker – who received a deportation order last July under the Biden administration – said in his declaration that he and his partner were put in immigration detention while their daughter was placed in the custody of ORR. Between October and March, the couple had weekly, in-person visits with their daughter, Maiker stated. On March 29, Maiker was sent to a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where DHS has transferred migrants, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. They said he was flown the following day to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison, which the US is using to detain hundreds of Venezuelan migrants it accuses of being violent gang members, though it hasn't provided strong evidence to back that claim. CNN has reached out to the Salvadoran government for more information on this case but has not yet received a response. Without providing evidence, it alleged in Saturday's statement that the father was a TDA lieutenant who oversaw various crimes including homicides and trafficking, and that the mother oversaw the recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and prostitution. Venezuela accused the US of violating international law and said it would take all legal and diplomatic measures to secure the girl's return. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on Venezuela's accusations. CNN's Caroll Alvarado, Mounira Elsamra and Ivonne Valdés contributed to this report</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The entire Trump economic agenda is about making it easier to do business in America, to create jobs in America, to hire American workers, and to build your factories here in America, not in China, or any other country,” Trump said. The president was flanked by high-tech displays, including an Anduril drone model, emphasizing his administration's push to rebuild American industry. More than a dozen executives on hand for the event touted their companies' recent commitments, totaling more than $2 trillion collectively and described as historic by the Trump administration, and sought to encourage more manufacturing development projects in the United States. Trump said his trade policies, which include 10 percent baseline tariffs on nations worldwide—and a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods—are spurring domestic manufacturing initiatives. Larry Culp, GE Aerospace chairman and CEO, said proposed reciprocal levies are “helping ensure that the U.S. aerospace industry, one of our biggest net exporters, continues to lead the world in innovation.” Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of Softbank, said during the event: “I tried to commit $100 billion, and President Trump said, ‘Oh Masa, go for more.' Other businesses are also moving operations onshore, according to administration officials. The capital influx is expected to generate more than 451,000 new jobs in high-paying sectors, she said. Trump has championed high-tech manufacturing developments, calling the domestic production of semiconductors and computer chips a matter of national security. “This industry is going to enable a whole bunch of other industries,” he said.</p>
