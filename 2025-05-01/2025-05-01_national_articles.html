                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, left, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hold a meeting with Ukrainian officials, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he's naming Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting national security adviser to replace Mike Waltz, whom he is nominating for United Nations ambassador. Trump announced the moves shortly after news broke that Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong were departing the administration, just weeks after it was revealed the adviser had added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. During a contentious exchange about deportations in his interview with ABC News' Terry Moran this week, President Donald Trump brought up — from his perspective — how Moran had gotten into the White House in the first place. In the real world of competitive journalism, things aren't always so simple. AP's Paul Wiseman, Annie D'Innocenzio and Christopher Rugaber wrote about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy as American businesses are starting to cancel their shipments from China. Here's some of their reporting to help answer your question: American businesses are cancelling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down to see what trade policy surprises President Donald Trump plans to spring on them next. The president's massive and unpredictable taxes on imports seem likely to mean emptier shelves and higher prices for American shoppers, perhaps within weeks. In the next few weeks, “you could start seeing shortages ... it's likely to be concentrated in categories where the U.S. is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and there aren't a lot of alternatives and certainly quick alternatives,” said Judah Levine, research director at the global freight-booking platform Freightos. Among them: furniture, baby products and plastic goods, including toys. Jay Foreman, CEO of toymaker Basic Fun, says “consumers will find Basic Fun toys in stores for a month or two but very quickly we will be out of stock and stock product will disappear from store shelves.” It's expected to be the initial version of the coming year's requested spending plan, a so-called skinny budget, of top-line figures with details still to come. Capitol Hill is bracing for proposed steep cuts that are likely to reflect Trump's Department of Government Efficiency zeroing out various programs. Federal budgets are often referred to as a statement of a president's values, as Congress, under its constitutional power, compiles the annual spending bills. It comes as Congress is already deep into drafting Trump's big bill of tax breaks and other spending cuts. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz gestures to Fox News host and President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, after speaking with her at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, March 19, 2025. “Our alliance is stronger than ever — especially in the face of the hypocrisy and moral decay that characterizes several UN institutions,” Danon said in a statement. “I am confident that we will work together to forge a clear path rooted in security, justice and accountability.” Davis, who has also previously served as ambassador to Belarus and deputy ambassador to NATO, replaces Bridget Brink at the helm of the Kyiv embassy. Brink announced she was leaving the post last month as the Trump administration pushed ahead with plans for Russia-Ukraine peace talks that many believed favored Moscow. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce was told by reporters that Trump named her boss, Rubio, as acting national security adviser. Trump said on social media Thursday that he was nominating outgoing national security adviser Mike Waltz as United Nations ambassador. “It is clear that I just heard this from you,” Bruce said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, and U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz speak with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. The announcement just weeks after it was revealed that Waltz added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. Rubio will also continue to serve as secretary of state. The president's threat comes after planned talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program were postponed. Trump wrote on social media Thursday that “All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” He said any country or person who buys those products from Iran will not be able to do business with the U.S. The threat came after Oman announced that talks scheduled for this coming weekend have been postponed. It's not the first time the Trump administration has faced a scathing order from a federal judge over its approach to deportation cases. Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia “should be shocking.” That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador in a different legal case.

Dan Patrick, former U.S. housing secretary Ben Carson and TV talk-show host Phil McGraw. The new Syrian authorities arrived in the U.S. last week to attend a series of meetings in Washington and New York as part of an effort to urge relief from harsh sanctions that were imposed by America and its allies after Assad's brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that spiraled into a civil war. In a statement released Wednesday, the State Department said while they do not discuss “private diplomatic conversations,” they continue to urge the interim authorities to “choose policies that will reinforce stability” for Syrians, “assure peace with Syria's neighbors,” while developing the war-torn country's economy. Addressing a National Day of Prayer Event in the White House Rose Garden, Trump vowed: “We're bringing back religion in our country” and doing so “quickly and strongly.” You'll be working too hard to try and make it,” he said if taxes rise. The Pentagon is seen from Air Force One as it flies over Washington, March 2, 2022. The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, most recently during World War II, when it was cited to intern Japanese-Americans. The proclamation triggered a flurry of litigation as the administration tried to ship migrants it claimed were gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. A sign is seen for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Thursday, Aug. 2, 2018, in Silver Spring, Md., on the FDA grounds. Social media users are falsely claiming that makers of COVID-19 vaccines can change up to 49% of the product's ingredients without FDA approval in certain circumstances. For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors. Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation. In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel move not yet made public. The National Security Council did not respond do a request for comment. “It was a good conversation,” Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing. “Even though there wasn't a specific agreement, the important thing is that we're working on it.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum gives her morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Sheinbaum, who said she and Trump spoke for 10 to 15 minutes Thursday morning, noted that the Trump administration had relaxed some of the tariffs on automobiles and auto parts this week, but said Mexico is still looking for a better deal for the automotive sector, as well as for steel and aluminum which face their own U.S. tariffs. The leaders agreed that their cabinet secretaries would continue negotiating. “It is a good sign that we continue advancing,” she said. Across continents, hundreds of thousands turned out for Thursday's rallies marking International Workers' Day, many united in anger over President Trump's agenda — from aggressive tariffs stoking fears of global economic turmoil to immigration crackdowns. In the United States, organizers framed this year's protests as a pushback against what they called a sweeping assault on labor protections, diversity initiatives and federal employees. In Germany, union leaders warned that extended workdays and rising anti-immigrant sentiment were dismantling labor protections. In Bern, Switzerland, thousands marched behind banners denouncing fascism and war — part of a wider backlash against the global surge of hard-right politics. Trump's evening remarks in Tuscaloosa will be the Republican president's first address to graduates in his second term and will come as he's been celebrating the first 100 days of his administration. The White House did not offer any details about Trump's planned message. Alabama, where Trump won a commanding 64% of the vote in 2024, is where he's staged a number of his trademark large rallies over the past decade. It also is where Trump showed early signs of strength in his first presidential campaign when he began filling stadiums for his rallies. Administration officials say they're seeking a permanent home at the State Department for a memorial honoring fallen staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Past presidents since John F. Kennedy argued that working for a more stable and prosperous world benefited U.S. security. It's being held in a temporary location, the agency said. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller says former Vice President Kamala Harris' criticism of Trump are a “great reminder to the American people of just how blessed we all are that the leader sitting in the Oval Office today is President Donald Trump and not President Kamala Harris.” Miller countered that, “The only things Americans want to hear from Kamala Harris is an apology” for less strict immigration policies and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said was “unforgivable.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “I think I speak for everyone at the White House, we encourage Kamala Harris to continue going out and do speaking engagements.” This combo shows Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, left, pictured in Tehran, Iran, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025 and Steve Witkoff, right, White House special envoy, pictured in Washington, Wednesday, March 19, 2025.

Mash'ems, from Basic Fun!, are displayed at the Toy Fair, in New York's Javits Center, Monday, March 3, 2025. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.” Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller insisted Thursday that the president was “making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with.” In a briefing with reporters, Miller said dolls made in the U.S. had higher quality standards than ones from China that he said could contain lead paint. “Yes, you'd probably be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,” Miller said. China's state broadcaster has claimed in a social media post that the Trump administration has been seeking contact with Beijing through multiple channels to start negotiations over tariffs. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters just after House Republicans narrowly approved their budget framework, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 10, 2025. There's trouble as House Republicans race to build Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, especially over its trillions in costs and potential Medicaid changes. Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, tax writing committee chairman Rep. Jason Smith and the chairman handling health programs, Brett Guthrie, are meeting with Trump. Trump's administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia. This new “best practices” report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19. “Our duty is to protect our nation's children — not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. “We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.” ▶ Read more about the Trump administration's stance on transgender health care In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, and President Donald Trump, talk as they attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Vatican, Saturday, April 26, 2025. After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a deal that's expected to give Washington access to the country's critical minerals and other natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia. The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government. It doesn't include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. To understand the Justice Department's struggles in representing President Trump's positions in court, look no further than a succession of losses last week that dealt a setback to the administration's agenda. In orders spanning different courthouses, judges blocked a White House plan to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, ruled the Republican administration violated a settlement agreement by deporting a man to El Salvador and halted directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs. That's on top of arguments in which two judges expressed misgivings to a Justice Department lawyer about the legality of Trump executive orders targeting major law firms and a department lawyer's accidental filing of an internal memo in court questioning the Trump administration's legal strategy to kill Manhattan's congestion toll — a blunder the Transportation Department called “legal malpractice.” Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday. The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day — mostly from China — is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook. The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech to sharply criticize Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor. In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said Wednesday she's inspired by Americans fighting Trump's agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood. Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November. In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar” and a “great candidate,” and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign. Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• New role for Waltz: President Donald Trump announced today that he's nominating Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser. Marco Rubio will now serve as secretary of state and interim national security adviser. Behind the scenes, White House officials describe intense pressure to produce trade deals as economic anxiety builds, sources tell CNN. Outgoing national security adviser Mike Waltz said he's “deeply honored” to continue serving President Donald Trump after the president announced today that he'd be nominating Waltz to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. Remember: Waltz had lost most of his influence in the West Wing in the wake of a scandal stemming from him inadvertently adding a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes. Crowds of protesters marched through downtown Los Angeles today, with several carrying signs urging the government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the US. President Donald Trump informed his outgoing national security adviser Michael Waltz that he was removing him from his role and nominating him as the US ambassador to the United Nations this morning, a White House official tells CNN. Hours later, Trump announced the move on Truth Social, as well as that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve in the national security adviser role on an interim basis. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce expressed confidence that Secretary of State Marco Rubio can handle his roles of both top US diplomat and interim national security adviser. Still, Bruce noted that there is always a team involved in government, calling the other State Department leadership “remarkable.” If anybody can do this, certainly the secretary, as I've gotten to know him, it would be Marco Rubio,” Bruce said. “We've seen him be at the White House several times a week. Reacting to CNN informing her of the news, Bruce noted that Rubio is a “man who, I think you all know, has worn several hats from day one” and “is someone who is well known by the president.” “The president makes perfect assessments about who would implement his agenda,” she said at a press briefing, noting she wasn't entirely surprised. President Donald Trump announced today that he's nominating Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser. Marco Rubio will now serve as both secretary of State and interim national security adviser, Trump said. “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.” Earlier today, CNN reported that Waltz was expected to depart from his post as national security adviser in the coming days, according to sources, the first major staff shakeup since the president took office in January. Waltz's job had been in limbo after it was made clear to him earlier this week that his time leading the NSC had come to an end, according to a source familiar with the matter. Waltz had been on shaky ground – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes. Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are also expected to depart, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear. It's not the first time Rubio has been suddenly asked to fill a vacancy in Trump's administration. In February, Trump dismissed National Archivist Colleen Shogan, later naming Rubio to fill the role. That same month, Trump named Rubio as acting administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) — an agency he's moving to shutter as part of the administration's efforts to cut down on spending. Henry Kissinger previously served as both secretary of State and national security adviser simultaneously under then-President Richard Nixon. Trump cycled through three national security advisers during his first administration. Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn was on the job for just 25 days. He was forced to resign less than a month after Trump's 2017 inauguration amid claims he misled the administration over his communications with Russia during the transition. McMaster was able to last longer in the role (over 13 months.) But after months of personal tension between him and Trump, the president announced McMaster's departure in a post on X in April of 2018. Trump had privately expressed irritation with McMaster stemming from differences in “personality and style,” a senior Republican source told CNN at the time. In the same tweet Trump made McMaster's ouster public, he announced who the next NSA would be: John Bolton, a then-Fox News analyst who had served as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush. The source said Trump no longer believed Bolton could advocate for his agenda. Bolton was out in April 2019, with him and Trump offering different views on whether he left voluntarily or was asked to resign. Senate Democrats announced today they are planning to force a vote on a resolution that would require the Trump administration to release a report detailing its efforts to comply with court orders on wrongful deportations to El Salvador, including a human rights report on the Central American country. If no report is produced within 30 days, the law specifies that all security assistance to El Salvador will be cut off,” Van Hollen said. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, told CNN she tried to raise concerns about national security adviser Mike Waltz directly with President Donald Trump during their April meeting in the Oval Office, which had already resulted in the dismissal of several other National Security Council members. Loomer was urging the removal of national security officials she viewed as insufficiently loyal, and said she planned to show Trump a 2016 campaign ad in which Waltz criticized him. Her intention was to demonstrate what she viewed as Waltz's blind spot in identifying unfaithful actors, given his own early opposition to Trump before becoming a supporter. “All of this boils down to a vetting crisis. Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to national security adviser Mike Waltz's expected ouster by saying President Donald Trump was firing the wrong national security official. But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz would not involve a Senate confirmation fight. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.” Most Americans are not too keen on the idea of Congress making major cuts to federal funding for Medicaid, according to a KFF poll released Thursday. Even a majority of Republicans feel that way, the poll found. The House committee that oversees Medicaid is expected to release more details next week. • Similarly, a majority of all three groups oppose federal funding reductions for Medicare, Social Security and to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, but fewer than half of Republicans oppose the reduction of federal funding for HIV prevention programs, premium subsidies for people buying Obamacare plans and research at universities and medical centers. • Those who identify as Make America Great Again supporters are split on Medicaid cuts, with 49% opposing a reduction. Like Republicans overall, fewer than half support federal funding for HIV prevention, Obamacare premium subsidies and research. President Donald Trump told a group attending a National Day of Prayer event at the White House that he'd just left “a really great meeting” where he was updated on his sweeping bill on taxes. Johnson called the meeting “very productive and engaging” in a statement today. While he did not say if the group made any final decisions on policy, he said they are waiting official details on the legislative effects of those policies. Yesterday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he plans to turn his attention on mustering congressional support for his party's tax bill. The uncertainty about the path forward comes as hardliners remain dug in on wanting at least $1.5 trillion in cuts and as swing district Republicans are beginning to acknowledge that goal may not be achievable if they want to protect coverage for Medicaid recipients in their state. CNN's Lauren Fox and Haley Talbot contributed to this reporting, which has been updated with comments from Johnson's office. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau have been floated to replace national security adviser Mike Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent pick, according to a source familiar with the talks. Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made. But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly. Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals. This post has been updated with more reporting on Waltz's possible replacements. Zelensky said he told Trump “about our readiness to conclude a deal” during the Vatican meeting. Remember: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and arranges for a joint investment fund that will pour money into Ukraine's natural resources. The pact features strong language on the war with Russia and is viewed as a way to further intertwine US economic interests with Ukraine's security needs, though it stops short of providing concrete security guarantees. US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas said Trump had unlawfully invoked the sweeping 18th century wartime authority to speed up some deportations. His decision means Trump cannot rely on the law to detain or deport any alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua within his district. The ruling is a significant blow to Trump's decision in March to invoke the act — a move that has faced numerous legal challenges and has been halted by several courts. Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said he was not given a heads up that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be leaving the Trump administration. “I had not heard about it until the middle of the hearing and so I really don't have anything to add at this point,” he told CNN after leaving a hearing for the panel. He would not answer when asked if he agrees with Democrats that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should also be held accountable and ousted over his involvement in the Signal chat scandal. It's his responsibility, but I also think Pete Hegseth needs to be fired as well.” Duckworth said she thinks Trump is forcing out Waltz to protect Hegseth and that upheavals in the administration will continue because “people are scared to do their jobs.” They don't trust that the secretary of defense knows how to manage classified information, and I think they're trying to get rid of this issue, but it is one of national security importance,” she said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he also wasn't aware of Waltz's reported departure, and he wouldn't weigh in on Hegseth when asked if the defense secretary should also be held accountable for the now-infamous Signal chat. This post has been updated with more reactions from lawmakers. President Donald Trump praised members of his Cabinet by name at the top of a speech in the Rose Garden today, starting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who he said was doing “a fantastic job.” He did not mention national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom CNN reported is expected to depart the administration. Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and others at the National Day of Prayer event. Democratic senators said today that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should be ousted from the Trump administration, responding to reporting that national security adviser Mike Waltz will leave his position in the coming days. “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly told CNN, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist in a group chat discussing strike plans was an “unfortunate mistake,” but the “most troubling” part of the incident was Hegseth “sharing incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.” I think they fired the wrong guy,” he said. “I'm frankly tired of hearing about Signal,” he said, praising the Trump administration for sending troops to the southern border and “putting terrorists back on their heels.” His job has been in limbo since it was made clear to Waltz earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with what happened. Waltz had been attempting to stay on and attended yesterday's Cabinet meeting, appeared on Fox News and showed up to the West Wing today. But Waltz has been on shaky ground and lost most of his influence in the West Wing after he inadvertently added the editor in chief of The Atlantic to a group chat about military strikes in March. Trump stood by his national security adviser at the time, but Waltz's standing never really recovered, according to four sources. He had also lost his standing with top aides inside the West Wing. Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he remained behind at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with Trump to a Michigan rally, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration. On China: “We're pleased to see that last week China pulled back a bunch of tariffs on US products, perhaps in a show of good faith,” Hassett said during the same interview. China's response, Hassett said, “shows we're very close to making the kind of progress we need to move the ball forward.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading negotiations with China, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is leading negotiations with other countries. Hassett said he's confident Bessent will help get the deal done, saying his work on the Ukraine minerals deal was another sign of his leadership. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that lower Treasury yields and slower inflation suggest the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates. Echoing Trump: Bessent's remarks come as President Donald Trump has recently publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, only softening his stance after advisers warned Trump that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The central bank is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting next week, according to futures, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Last year, the Fed lowered its key interest rate by a full percentage point. The US Chamber of Commerce is asking the Trump administration to provide American businesses with sweeping relief from sky-high tariffs to avoid causing an economic downturn and wiping out countless small businesses. In a letter to Trump officials, US Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark warned that ending US tariffs imposed this year “is critical given the negative impact recent tariffs are having on the US economy, employers and American families.” “We are deeply concerned that even if it only takes weeks or months to reach agreements, many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm,” Clark said in the Wednesday letter. “The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increase in tariff rates.” In order to “save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,” the chamber is requesting the administration immediately launch a tariff exclusion process. Additionally, the chamber wants the administration to provide “automatic” tariff exclusions for all products that can't be made in America or are not readily available from domestic sources such as on coffee, bananas, cocoa and certain minerals. The chamber is also asking for a process that would let businesses quickly get exclusions when they can demonstrate tariffs will kill jobs. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said he expects that next week, “cargo coming into Los Angeles will be down 35% compared for a year ago” in response to tariffs. “Many major retailers have told us they have about a six- to eight-week supply of inventory in their systems now,” Seroka said. “United States manufacturers and consumers alike will find difficult decisions in the weeks and months to come if policies don't change.” His comments come as some of the last cargo ships carrying Chinese goods without crippling tariffs are currently heading into US ports. Cargo on ships from China loaded after April 9 will carry with them the 145% tariff President Donald Trump slapped on goods from that nation last month. For many importers, it is too expensive to do business with China. Businesses are making a difficult choice: Continue selling products from China at more than double their previous prices or stop selling those products altogether. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka shares that the port expects a steep drop in shipping amid President Donald Trump's tariffs. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie will head to the White House this morning to meet with President Donald Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter. The meeting comes at a key time when congressional Republicans are working to cut a deal on Trump's first big legislative package. But in an interview on CNN, CEO Mary Barra said the company doesn't necessarily expect to pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of elevated prices. “We believe … pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” she told CNN's Erin Burnett today, although she added, “Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. The company does expect the higher tariff costs to eat into its earnings as it slashed its profit guidance for the year, as revealed in a letter to shareholders from Barra released early this morning. GM is the first major company to estimate, in dollars, how much President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs will cost it. Many others have walked back earnings forecasts because of the ensuing economic uncertainty. While GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest American automaker, with US sales of 2.7 million cars and trucks last year. The Trump Organization on Tuesday introduced the 80-floor Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, a $1 billion development where penthouses are going for $20 million. And yesterday, Qatari Diar, a real estate company owned by the natural gas-rich nation's sovereign wealth fund, signed an agreement with Dar Global to develop Trump International Golf Club, according to state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA). The 18-hole golf course will also include Trump-branded luxury villas. It is estimated the project will bring $2 billion in foreign investment into Qatar, QNA said. The president fostered close ties with Gulf Arab states during his first term, choosing Saudi Arabia for his first presidential visit in 2017. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order establishing a religious liberty commission this morning, a White House official confirmed, during a National Day of Prayer event in the Rose Garden that is scheduled at 11 a.m. “I will be creating a brand-new presidential commission on religious liberty. It's going to be a very big deal, which will work tirelessly to uphold this most fundamental right,” Trump said at the time, saying that “this sacred liberty” has been “threatened like never before.” Previously, Trump signed an executive order targeting “anti-Christian bias,” and he has established a faith office within the White House. That's significantly higher than the 64,789 job cuts announced last April. However, a large chunk (40,000 jobs) of last month's layoff count can be attributed to plans tied to two major employers: UPS and Intel. Earlier this week, UPS said it plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a previously announced plan to increase automation and trim its Amazon business. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel was expected to cut 20,000 workers. The company has not announced specific details for potential upcoming layoffs. There is a clear trend of economic uncertainty weighing on businesses, noted Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement and business coaching firm. “Generally, companies are citing the economy and new technology. The US Department of Health and Human Services this morning released a 400-page review of treatment for gender dysphoria in children but did not disclose who authored or reviewed the report. The report follows several actions by President Donald Trump's administration to halt gender-affirming treatment of transgender children and adolescents and cancel research about the transgender community. Contributors represent a wide range of political viewpoints and were chosen for their commitment to scientific principles,” HHS said in a news release about the review, adding that contributors' names are not initially being made public “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.” The document, which includes sections on evidence, ethical considerations, psychotherapy and “clinical realities,” focuses on treatment of gender dysphoria in youths, not adults. HHS said the review finds that science and evidence do not support “these drastic medical interventions for our nation's youth.” As of March, 27 states have enacted restrictions, meaning about 40% of trans youth live in a state with limited gender-affirming health care options, according to KFF, a health policy organization. More than 60% of the public opposes major cuts to health spending and staff at federal health agencies, according to a new poll from KFF. But more than three-quarters of participants say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, with even MAGA supporters closely divided on the issue. The most recent came on April 19 when crowds of people attended over 80 protests at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states to oppose what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education. In that short period, he has moved to upend the world order by cracking down on immigration and immigrants' rights; instituting tariffs that threaten global trade; dismantling the administrative state under the Department of Government Efficiency's slapdash cuts; rolling back protections for transgender people; and exercising executive power with disdain for checks and balances. In her first major address since leaving office, former Vice President and 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris blasted President Donald Trump's first 100 days, saying his agenda displays a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals. Harris also accused her former rival of setting off the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history through his tariffs, and warned that his conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he would nominate national security adviser Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, after widespread reports that Trump planned to oust him, in the first major staff shakeup since the president took office in January. “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.” Trump informed Waltz that he was removing him from his role as national security adviser and nominating him as UN ambassador Thursday morning, a White House official told CNN. Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are expected to depart their roles as well, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear. Rubio now fills four roles within the administration: secretary of state, national security adviser, national archivist and acting administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Waltz is heading to a potentially contentious confirmation fight in the Senate. That's in part why he never intervened early on to speed along the nomination of his first pick, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Trump also did not move quickly to pick a new person for the role, after Republicans' narrow House majority forced Stefanik to remain in Congress. Waltz had been on shaky ground within the administration – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes. Trump had considered firing him after the incident, but declined to do so because he didn't want to provide his enemies a perceived victory, and he hoped to avoid the type of chaos that colored his first administration. But while Trump stood by him at the time, Waltz's standing hadn't ever really recovered, according to four sources, and he lost clout with top aides inside the West Wing. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has privately been one of the officials most unimpressed with Waltz — even before the Signal fiasco. At 100 days into his second term, Trump no longer appears as concerned about the appearance of disorder. Waltz's influence internally had been waning for weeks, illustrated best by Trump's decision to dismiss several staffers from the National Security Council at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who told him they were disloyal. Loomer told CNN Thursday she had previously tried to raise concerns about Waltz directly with Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office, where Loomer was urging the removal of certain national security officials. Loomer said she had also targeted Wong, citing his past work for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Mark Halperin first reported the news of Waltz being pushed out. Before Trump announced his new plans for Waltz, Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to news of his ouster by saying Trump was going after the wrong national security official. “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist on the Signal chat was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.” But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his Defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz does not involve a Senate confirmation fight. Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.” Trump has expressed frustration with him on multiple fronts, including the Signal episode. “President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” one source said. Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he instead remained on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews.</p>

This combo shows Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, left, pictured in Tehran, Iran, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025 and Steve Witkoff, right, White House special envoy, pictured in Washington, Wednesday, March 19, 2025. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened sanctions on anyone who buys Iranian oil, a warning that came after planned talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program were postponed. Trump wrote on social media, “All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” He said any country or person who buys those products from Iran will not be able to do business with the United States “in any way, shape, or form.” It was unclear how Trump would implement such a ban as he threatened to levy secondary sanctions on nations that import Iranian oil. But his statement risked further escalating tensions with China — Iran's leading customer — at a time when the relationship is severely strained over the U.S. president's tariffs. Based on tanker tracking data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded in a report published last October that “China took nearly 90% of Iran's crude oil and condensate exports in 2023.” Trump has separately placed 145% tariffs on China as a way to raise federal revenues and rebalance global trade. Trump's social media threat came after Oman announced planned nuclear negotiations for this coming weekend had been postponed. Al-Busaidi, who has mediated the talks through three rounds so far, did not elaborate. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei issued a statement describing the talks as being “postponed at the request of Oman's foreign minister.” He said Iran remain committed to reaching ”a fair and lasting agreement.” Meanwhile, a person familiar with the U.S. negotiators said America “had never confirmed its participation” in a fourth round of talks in Rome. Rome will see the Vatican begin its conclave next week to pick a new pope after the death of Pope Francis. The negotiations have been led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The U.S. president with his threat on social media would be going after Iran's major economic resource. Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues an airstrike campaign, called “Operation Rough Rider,” that has been targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels, who long have been backed by Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth early Thursday warned Iran over the rebels. We know exactly what you are doing,” he wrote. Last Saturday's round of talks, which included experts drilling down into the details of a possible deal, also took place as an explosion rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the Trump administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz speaks during a television interview at the White House, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Washington.

President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, look on. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he's nominating his national security adviser Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador in a major shake-up of his national security team. The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve simultaneously as acting national security adviser while maintaining his position at the State Department. Trump announced the moves shortly after news broke that Waltz was leaving the administration, just weeks after it was revealed that he had added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Trump wrote on social media. “In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. There is precedent for the secretary of state to serve simultaneously as national security adviser. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles listen as President Donald Trump meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington. Trump's decision to move Waltz to the U.N. comes weeks after he pulled his pick for the job, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, from consideration. Stefanik went through a confirmation hearing, but her nomination was pulled in March because her vote to advance Trump's agenda remains crucial to Republicans in the House. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, had been targeting Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House adviser Stephen Miller listen as President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington. In his second term, the Republican president had been looking to avoid the tumult of his first four years in office, during which he cycled through four national security advisers, four White House chiefs of staff and two secretaries of state. The Signal chain episode also showed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop. Waltz had previously taken “full responsibility” for building the message chain and administration officials described the episode as a “mistake” but one that caused Americans no harm. Waltz maintained that he was not sure how Goldberg ended up in the messaging chain, and insisted he did not know the journalist. But the embattled national security adviser was also under siege from personalities such as Loomer, who had been complaining to administration officials that she had been excluded from the vetting process for National Security Council aides. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans, according to two people familiar with the matter Thursday. In her view, Waltz relied too much on “neocons” — referring to hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party — as well as others who Loomer argued were “not-MAGA-enough” types. As reports began to circulate that Waltz could be leaving the administration, Loomer appeared to take credit in a post on the social media site X, writing: “SCALP.” Loomer had taken a similar victory lap when several other NSC officials were dismissed last month one day after she met with Trump. Questions are also swirling around Hegseth and his role in the Signal chat. The Associated Press reported that Hegseth also bypassed Pentagon security protocols to set up an unsecured line for a personal computer in his office –- beside terminals where he was receiving classified information. The process, which proved to be difficult for a number of Trump's Cabinet picks, will give lawmakers, especially Democrats, the first chance to grill Waltz on his decision to share information about an imminent U.S. airstrike on Signal.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on President Trump withdrawing her bid for the U.N. ambassadorship, Columbia University's interim president resigning and Iran signaling openness to 'indirect' nuclear talks. President Donald Trump tapped former national security advisor Mike Waltz for his administration's ambassador to the United Nations after Waltz was ousted from the National Security Council office earlier Thursday. "From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" President Donald Trump tapped Mike Waltz for his administration's ambassador to the United Nations after Waltz was ousted from the National Security Council office earlier on Thursday. Trump added in his post that Rubio will simultaneously serve as his interim national security advisor after Waltz left the role on Thursday. In 1973, then-President Richard Nixon made a similar move when he named national security advisor Henry Kissinger to also serve as secretary of state, State Department records show. Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from their office on Thursday in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. Trump's announcement on naming Waltz as U.N. ambassador unfolded just hours after the news began circulating. The former national security advisor had been at the heart of the Signal chat leak debacle that unfolded in March, when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine was inadvertently added to a group chat with high-profile Trump officials such as Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. A handful of names had been floated for U.N. ambassador after Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., withdrew her nomination in March. Ahead of Trump tapping Waltz for the new administration role, a handful of names had been floated for U.N. ambassador after Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., withdrew her nomination in March, including David Friedman, former U.S. ambassador to Israel; Ellie Cohanim, former deputy special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism at the State Department under the first Trump administration; and special presidential envoy Richard Grenell. Grenell said he was a "hard no" on serving in the U.N. ambassador role ahead of Trump's announcement. Trump announced Stefanik as his original choice for the role in November 2024, just days after his successful election against former Vice President Kamala Harris. The New York congresswoman, however, pulled her nomination last month as concerns mounted in Trump's orbit that the GOP's slim majority in the House would grow smaller in her absence. Concerns grew ahead of two special House elections in Florida on April 2, which ultimately saw both Republicans victorious, but with significantly slimmer margins than their GOP predecessors in their previous elections. Stefank told Fox News' Sean Hannity in March that she bowed out of the confirmation process to serve as U.N. ambassador due to both the GOP's margin in the House combined with the need for her to help combat Democratic "corruption" in her home state of New York. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., bowed out of the confirmation process to serve as U.N. ambassador. "It was a combination of the New York corruption that we're seeing under Kathy Hochul, special elections and the House margin," Stefanik said on "Hannity" in March. It's tough to count these votes every day. He and I had multiple conversations today, and we are committed to delivering results on behalf of the American people. And as always, I'm committed to delivering results on behalf of my constituents," she added. President Donald Trump addresses the 74th U.N. General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 24, 2019. Trump announced on Truth Social that Stefanik withdrew her nomination to "remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength." "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added. During Trump's first administration, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former diplomat Kelly Craft served as U.N. ambassadors. President Donald Trump speaks in Emancipation Hall after his inauguration at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20. "I've always felt that the U.N. has tremendous potential," Trump said in February while signing the executive order that made cuts to U.S. involvement with U.N. groups. "A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should be settled, or at least we should have some help in settling them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in Texas found on Thursday that President Donald Trump did not meet the necessary criteria to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members, dealing a blow to the administration as it attempts to remove criminal illegal immigrants from the country quickly. Judge Fernando Rodriguez, a Trump appointee, said in an order that Trump could still deport Venezuelan migrants detained in southern Texas using other, more routine authorities. However, Rodriguez said the Alien Enemies Act, a powerful wartime law, was not an option. The decision stemmed from a lawsuit brought by three Venezuelan nationals represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, who said they were wrongly accused by the U.S. government of being members of Tren de Aragua and that they were at risk of imminent deportation to a foreign prison under the statute. Art Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner that the ruling was surprising given the historic amount of deference courts have given administrations when an invasion or threat exists, dating back to at least World War II. “Most American press outlets don't really understand Tren de Aragua, or they put it in the same bucket as MS-13,” Arthur said, noting the ways the gang has taken strongholds in parts of countries such as Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. “They'll take a more objective look at the case law and the limits of their own authority; they don't want to be overturned by the Supreme Court either,” Arthur added. Rodriguez also delivered another victory to the Venezuelan migrants. He agreed to class certification for all potential deportees in the Southern District of Texas, avoiding a situation in which each migrant would have to file their own petition to fight their removal. Arthur and other legal experts have said it is highly unlikely that these plaintiffs could justify turning this case into a class action. “You can't do class actions,” Arthur said. “Not everybody in that class is exactly the same … there should be individual cases.” The Department of Justice could file an appeal to Rodriguez's decision.</p>

National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from their office Thursday, in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. Fox News confirmed Thursday morning that Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, were ousted following a Signal chat leak debacle that unfolded in March, when the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine was inadvertently added to a group chat with high-profile Trump officials such as Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Just hours after news broke that Waltz would no longer serve in the National Security Council office, Trump announced on Truth Social that he nominated Waltz to serve as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., adding that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as the interim national security advisor. Similarly, then-President Richard Nixon in 1973 named then-national security advisor Henry Kissinger to simultaneously serve as secretary of state. Following the executive office shakeup, Fox News Digital took a look at who President Donald Trump could select to permanently fill the national security advisor role. National security advisor Mike Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from office on May 1, 2025 in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff greet each other at the Kremlin in Moscow on Friday, April 25. Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who has been a top U.S. negotiator with Russia amid its war against Ukraine, could be tapped for the open national security advisor position. Witkoff is a former real estate tycoon and longtime ally of Trump's whose focus under the Trump administration has been on negotiating with Russia for a peace deal in Ukraine, and negotiating with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Witkoff was notably credited with helping secure the reality of U.S. school teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison in February. Witkoff traveled to Moscow on April 25 as the White House reportedly extended its final offer to Russia as it continues waging a war against Ukraine that has raged since February 2022. "Ambassador Witkoff is in Russia to meet with President Putin as part of President Trump's efforts to make peace," an official with knowledge of the talks and visit told Fox News Digital at the end of April. Ukraine signed a deal with the U.S., allowing America access to the country's rare minerals as it continues to hash out a peace agreement. President Donald Trump could potentially tap Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany and former acting director of national intelligence under the first Trump administration, to take the national security role. Trump could potentially tap Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany and former acting director of national intelligence under the first Trump administration, to take the national security role. Grenell's name has been floated for other high-profile roles under the second Trump administration, such as a potential replacement for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations after Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik withdrew her name in March to retain her seat in the House. Grenell, however, said he was a "hard no" on serving in the U.N. ambassador role. President Donald Trump previously named Rep. Elise Stefanik as his pick for ambassador to the U.N. but announced on March 27 that she withdrew her nomination to "remain in Congress." Trump previously named Stefanik as his pick for ambassador to the U.N. but announced March 27 that she withdrew her nomination to "remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength." "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations." Stefanik is a fierce Trump ally, who notably grilled Ivy League college administrators from Penn and Harvard, her alma mater, in December 2023 regarding whether "calling for the genocide of Jews" violates the respective school's codes of conduct. Trump potentially selecting Stefanik as a replacement for Waltz, however, would leave the Republican House majority vulnerable to an even tighter margin if Stefanik left her New York seat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the Trump administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.

The new Syrian authorities arrived in the U.S. last week to attend a series of meetings in Washington and New York as part of an effort to urge relief from harsh sanctions that were imposed by America and its allies after Assad's brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that spiraled into a civil war. In a statement released Wednesday, the State Department said while they do not discuss “private diplomatic conversations,” they continue to urge the interim authorities to “choose policies that will reinforce stability” for Syrians, “assure peace with Syria's neighbors,” while developing the war-torn country's economy. Addressing a National Day of Prayer Event in the White House Rose Garden, Trump vowed: “We're bringing back religion in our country” and doing so “quickly and strongly.” You'll be working too hard to try and make it,” he said if taxes rise. The Pentagon is seen from Air Force One as it flies over Washington, March 2, 2022. The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, most recently during World War II, when it was cited to intern Japanese-Americans. The proclamation triggered a flurry of litigation as the administration tried to ship migrants it claimed were gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation. In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel move not yet made public. The National Security Council did not respond do a request for comment. “It was a good conversation,” Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing. “Even though there wasn't a specific agreement, the important thing is that we're working on it.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum gives her morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Sheinbaum, who said she and Trump spoke for 10 to 15 minutes Thursday morning, noted that the Trump administration had relaxed some of the tariffs on automobiles and auto parts this week, but said Mexico is still looking for a better deal for the automotive sector, as well as for steel and aluminum which face their own U.S. tariffs. The leaders agreed that their cabinet secretaries would continue negotiating. “It is a good sign that we continue advancing,” she said. Across continents, hundreds of thousands turned out for Thursday's rallies marking International Workers' Day, many united in anger over President Trump's agenda — from aggressive tariffs stoking fears of global economic turmoil to immigration crackdowns. In the United States, organizers framed this year's protests as a pushback against what they called a sweeping assault on labor protections, diversity initiatives and federal employees. In Germany, union leaders warned that extended workdays and rising anti-immigrant sentiment were dismantling labor protections. Trump's evening remarks in Tuscaloosa will be the Republican president's first address to graduates in his second term and will come as he's been celebrating the first 100 days of his administration. The White House did not offer any details about Trump's planned message. Alabama, where Trump won a commanding 64% of the vote in 2024, is where he's staged a number of his trademark large rallies over the past decade. Administration officials say they're seeking a permanent home at the State Department for a memorial honoring fallen staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Past presidents since John F. Kennedy argued that working for a more stable and prosperous world benefited U.S. security. It's being held in a temporary location, the agency said. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller says former Vice President Kamala Harris' criticism of Trump are a “great reminder to the American people of just how blessed we all are that the leader sitting in the Oval Office today is President Donald Trump and not President Kamala Harris.” Miller countered that, “The only things Americans want to hear from Kamala Harris is an apology” for less strict immigration policies and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said was “unforgivable.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “I think I speak for everyone at the White House, we encourage Kamala Harris to continue going out and do speaking engagements.” This combo shows Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, left, pictured in Tehran, Iran, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025 and Steve Witkoff, right, White House special envoy, pictured in Washington, Wednesday, March 19, 2025.

And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.” Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller insisted Thursday that the president was “making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with.” In a briefing with reporters, Miller said dolls made in the U.S. had higher quality standards than ones from China that he said could contain lead paint. “Yes, you'd probably be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,” Miller said. China's state broadcaster has claimed in a social media post that the Trump administration has been seeking contact with Beijing through multiple channels to start negotiations over tariffs. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters just after House Republicans narrowly approved their budget framework, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 10, 2025. There's trouble as House Republicans race to build Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, especially over its trillions in costs and potential Medicaid changes. Trump's administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia. This new “best practices” report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19. “Our duty is to protect our nation's children — not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. “We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.” ▶ Read more about the Trump administration's stance on transgender health care In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, and President Donald Trump, talk as they attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Vatican, Saturday, April 26, 2025. After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a deal that's expected to give Washington access to the country's critical minerals and other natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia. The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government. It doesn't include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. To understand the Justice Department's struggles in representing President Trump's positions in court, look no further than a succession of losses last week that dealt a setback to the administration's agenda. In orders spanning different courthouses, judges blocked a White House plan to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, ruled the Republican administration violated a settlement agreement by deporting a man to El Salvador and halted directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs. That's on top of arguments in which two judges expressed misgivings to a Justice Department lawyer about the legality of Trump executive orders targeting major law firms and a department lawyer's accidental filing of an internal memo in court questioning the Trump administration's legal strategy to kill Manhattan's congestion toll — a blunder the Transportation Department called “legal malpractice.” Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday. The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day — mostly from China — is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook. The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech to sharply criticize Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor. In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said Wednesday she's inspired by Americans fighting Trump's agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood. Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November. In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar” and a “great candidate,” and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign. Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waltz's job has been in limbo after it was made clear to him earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with the matter. Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are also expected to depart, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and even Secretary of State Marco Rubio have been floated to replace Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent replacement, according to a source familiar with the talks. Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made. But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly. Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals. Waltz had been on shaky ground – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes. Trump had considered firing him after the incident, but declined to do so because he didn't want to provide his enemies a perceived victory, and he hoped to avoid the type of chaos that colored his first administration. But while Trump stood by him at the time, Waltz's standing hadn't ever really recovered, according to four sources, and he lost clout with top aides inside the West Wing. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has privately been one of the officials most unimpressed with Waltz — even before the Signal fiasco. At 100 days into his second term, Trump no longer appears as concerned about the appearance of disorder. Multiple people familiar with the matter had increasingly described Waltz's potential ouster as a matter of “when, not if.” Mark Halperin first reported Waltz being pushed out. Watlz's influence internally had been waning for weeks, illustrated best by Trump's decision to dismiss several staffers from the National Security Council at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who told him they were disloyal. Loomer told CNN Thursday she had previously tried to raise concerns about Waltz directly with Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office, where Loomer was urging the removal of certain national security officials. Loomer said she had also targeted Wong, citing his past work for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist on Signal was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.” But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his Defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz would not involve a Senate confirmation fight. Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.” Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he instead remained on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. Asked about the impact of Waltz's dismissal, multiple foreign officials — including some from the Middle East — expressed apprehension about who would replace him. Trump has expressed frustration with him on multiple fronts, including the Signal episode. He was also irritated the Florida congressional race to replace Waltz was closer than expected, two sources familiar with the conversations told CNN. “President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” this source said.</p>

Behind the scenes, White House officials describe intense pressure to produce trade deals as economic anxiety builds, sources tell CNN. Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to national security adviser Mike Waltz's ouster by saying President Donald Trump was firing the wrong national security official. They believed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserved the boot more after he discussed bomb targets in Yemen in the Signal chat. But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.” Most Americans are not too keen on the idea of Congress making major cuts to federal funding for Medicaid, according to a KFF poll released Thursday. Even a majority of Republicans feel that way, the poll found. The House committee that oversees Medicaid is expected to release more details next week. • Similarly, a majority of all three groups oppose federal funding reductions for Medicare, Social Security and to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, but fewer than half of Republicans oppose the reduction of federal funding for HIV prevention programs, premium subsidies for people buying Obamacare plans and research at universities and medical centers. • Those who identify as Make America Great Again supporters are split on Medicaid cuts, with 49% opposing a reduction. Like Republicans overall, fewer than half support federal funding for HIV prevention, Obamacare premium subsidies and research. President Donald Trump told a group attending a National Day of Prayer event at the White House that he'd just left “a really great meeting” where he was updated on his sweeping bill on taxes. Yesterday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he plans to turn his attention on mustering congressional support for his party's tax bill. The uncertainty about the path forward comes as hardliners remain dug in on wanting at least $1.5 trillion in cuts and as swing district Republicans are beginning to acknowledge that goal may not be achievable if they want to protect coverage for Medicaid recipients in their state. CNN's Lauren Fox and Haley Talbot contributed to this reporting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau have been floated to replace national security adviser Mike Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent pick, according to a source familiar with the talks. Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made. But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly. Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals. This post has been updated with more reporting on Waltz's possible replacements. Zelensky said he told Trump “about our readiness to conclude a deal” during the Vatican meeting. Remember: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and arranges for a joint investment fund that will pour money into Ukraine's natural resources. The pact features strong language on the war with Russia and is viewed as a way to further intertwine US economic interests with Ukraine's security needs, though it stops short of providing concrete security guarantees. US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas said Trump had unlawfully invoked the sweeping 18th century wartime authority to speed up some deportations. His decision means Trump cannot rely on the law to detain or deport any alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua within his district. The ruling is a significant blow to Trump's decision in March to invoke the act — a move that has faced numerous legal challenges and has been halted by several courts. Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said he was not given a heads up that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be leaving the Trump administration. “I had not heard about it until the middle of the hearing and so I really don't have anything to add at this point,” he told CNN after leaving a hearing for the panel. He would not answer when asked if he agrees with Democrats that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should also be held accountable and ousted over his involvement in the Signal chat scandal. It's his responsibility, but I also think Pete Hegseth needs to be fired as well.” Duckworth said she thinks Trump is forcing out Waltz to protect Hegseth and that upheavals in the administration will continue because “people are scared to do their jobs.” They don't trust that the secretary of defense knows how to manage classified information, and I think they're trying to get rid of this issue, but it is one of national security importance,” she said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he also wasn't aware of Waltz's reported departure, and he wouldn't weigh in on Hegseth when asked if the defense secretary should also be held accountable for the now-infamous Signal chat. This post has been updated with more reactions from lawmakers. President Donald Trump praised members of his Cabinet by name at the top of a speech in the Rose Garden today, starting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who he said was doing “a fantastic job.” He did not mention national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom CNN reported is expected to depart the administration. Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and others at the National Day of Prayer event. Democratic senators said today that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should be ousted from the Trump administration, responding to reporting that national security adviser Mike Waltz will leave his position in the coming days. “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly told CNN, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist in a group chat discussing strike plans was an “unfortunate mistake,” but the “most troubling” part of the incident was Hegseth “sharing incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.” I think they fired the wrong guy,” he said. “I'm frankly tired of hearing about Signal,” he said, praising the Trump administration for sending troops to the southern border and “putting terrorists back on their heels.” His job has been in limbo since it was made clear to Waltz earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with what happened. Waltz had been attempting to stay on and attended yesterday's Cabinet meeting, appeared on Fox News and showed up to the West Wing today. But Waltz has been on shaky ground and lost most of his influence in the West Wing after he inadvertently added the editor in chief of The Atlantic to a group chat about military strikes in March. Trump stood by his national security adviser at the time, but Waltz's standing never really recovered, according to four sources. He had also lost his standing with top aides inside the West Wing. Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he remained behind at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with Trump to a Michigan rally, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration. On China: “We're pleased to see that last week China pulled back a bunch of tariffs on US products, perhaps in a show of good faith,” Hassett said during the same interview. China's response, Hassett said, “shows we're very close to making the kind of progress we need to move the ball forward.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading negotiations with China, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is leading negotiations with other countries. Hassett said he's confident Bessent will help get the deal done, saying his work on the Ukraine minerals deal was another sign of his leadership. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that lower Treasury yields and slower inflation suggest the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates. Echoing Trump: Bessent's remarks come as President Donald Trump has recently publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, only softening his stance after advisers warned Trump that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The central bank is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting next week, according to futures, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Last year, the Fed lowered its key interest rate by a full percentage point. The US Chamber of Commerce is asking the Trump administration to provide American businesses with sweeping relief from sky-high tariffs to avoid causing an economic downturn and wiping out countless small businesses. In a letter to Trump officials, US Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark warned that ending US tariffs imposed this year “is critical given the negative impact recent tariffs are having on the US economy, employers and American families.” “We are deeply concerned that even if it only takes weeks or months to reach agreements, many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm,” Clark said in the Wednesday letter. “The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increase in tariff rates.” In order to “save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,” the chamber is requesting the administration immediately launch a tariff exclusion process. Additionally, the chamber wants the administration to provide “automatic” tariff exclusions for all products that can't be made in America or are not readily available from domestic sources such as on coffee, bananas, cocoa and certain minerals. The chamber is also asking for a process that would let businesses quickly get exclusions when they can demonstrate tariffs will kill jobs. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said he expects that next week, “cargo coming into Los Angeles will be down 35% compared for a year ago” in response to tariffs. “Many major retailers have told us they have about a six- to eight-week supply of inventory in their systems now,” Seroka said. “United States manufacturers and consumers alike will find difficult decisions in the weeks and months to come if policies don't change.” His comments come as some of the last cargo ships carrying Chinese goods without crippling tariffs are currently heading into US ports. Cargo on ships from China loaded after April 9 will carry with them the 145% tariff President Donald Trump slapped on goods from that nation last month. For many importers, it is too expensive to do business with China. Businesses are making a difficult choice: Continue selling products from China at more than double their previous prices or stop selling those products altogether. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka shares that the port expects a steep drop in shipping amid President Donald Trump's tariffs. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie will head to the White House this morning to meet with President Donald Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter. The meeting comes at a key time when congressional Republicans are working to cut a deal on Trump's first big legislative package. But in an interview on CNN, CEO Mary Barra said the company doesn't necessarily expect to pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of elevated prices. “We believe … pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” she told CNN's Erin Burnett today, although she added, “Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. The company does expect the higher tariff costs to eat into its earnings as it slashed its profit guidance for the year, as revealed in a letter to shareholders from Barra released early this morning. GM is the first major company to estimate, in dollars, how much President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs will cost it. Many others have walked back earnings forecasts because of the ensuing economic uncertainty. While GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest American automaker, with US sales of 2.7 million cars and trucks last year. The Trump Organization on Tuesday introduced the 80-floor Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, a $1 billion development where penthouses are going for $20 million. And yesterday, Qatari Diar, a real estate company owned by the natural gas-rich nation's sovereign wealth fund, signed an agreement with Dar Global to develop Trump International Golf Club, according to state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA). The 18-hole golf course will also include Trump-branded luxury villas. It is estimated the project will bring $2 billion in foreign investment into Qatar, QNA said. The president fostered close ties with Gulf Arab states during his first term, choosing Saudi Arabia for his first presidential visit in 2017. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order establishing a religious liberty commission this morning, a White House official confirmed, during a National Day of Prayer event in the Rose Garden that is scheduled at 11 a.m. “I will be creating a brand-new presidential commission on religious liberty. It's going to be a very big deal, which will work tirelessly to uphold this most fundamental right,” Trump said at the time, saying that “this sacred liberty” has been “threatened like never before.” Previously, Trump signed an executive order targeting “anti-Christian bias,” and he has established a faith office within the White House. That's significantly higher than the 64,789 job cuts announced last April. However, a large chunk (40,000 jobs) of last month's layoff count can be attributed to plans tied to two major employers: UPS and Intel. Earlier this week, UPS said it plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a previously announced plan to increase automation and trim its Amazon business. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel was expected to cut 20,000 workers. The company has not announced specific details for potential upcoming layoffs. There is a clear trend of economic uncertainty weighing on businesses, noted Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement and business coaching firm. “Generally, companies are citing the economy and new technology. The US Department of Health and Human Services this morning released a 400-page review of treatment for gender dysphoria in children but did not disclose who authored or reviewed the report. The report follows several actions by President Donald Trump's administration to halt gender-affirming treatment of transgender children and adolescents and cancel research about the transgender community. Contributors represent a wide range of political viewpoints and were chosen for their commitment to scientific principles,” HHS said in a news release about the review, adding that contributors' names are not initially being made public “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.” The document, which includes sections on evidence, ethical considerations, psychotherapy and “clinical realities,” focuses on treatment of gender dysphoria in youths, not adults. HHS said the review finds that science and evidence do not support “these drastic medical interventions for our nation's youth.” As of March, 27 states have enacted restrictions, meaning about 40% of trans youth live in a state with limited gender-affirming health care options, according to KFF, a health policy organization. More than 60% of the public opposes major cuts to health spending and staff at federal health agencies, according to a new poll from KFF. But more than three-quarters of participants say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, with even MAGA supporters closely divided on the issue. Protests under the “50501” movement — short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement — in response to the Trump administration's flurry of moves over its first 100 days are set to take place across the country today for May Day. The most recent came on April 19 when crowds of people attended over 80 protests at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states to oppose what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education. In that short period, he has moved to upend the world order by cracking down on immigration and immigrants' rights; instituting tariffs that threaten global trade; dismantling the administrative state under the Department of Government Efficiency's slapdash cuts; rolling back protections for transgender people; and exercising executive power with disdain for checks and balances. In her first major address since leaving office, former Vice President and 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris blasted President Donald Trump's first 100 days, saying his agenda displays a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals. Harris also accused her former rival of setting off the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history through his tariffs, and warned that his conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis.</p>

FIRST ON FOX – President Donald Trump's former national security advisor is sounding the alarm about the Justice Department's proposal to break up Google's illegal monopoly on online search, saying in a letter to White House leaders that the government's proposal is overly broad and poses "drastic" and far-reaching national security risks. In a letter to the White House National Security Council, obtained by Fox News Digital, Trump's former national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, argued that the Biden-era DOJ framework is in "direct conflict" with Trump's policy priorities, and risks hobbling U.S. competition with China in a high-stakes race to develop new and advanced technology. "To prevail, the U.S. must maintain and expand its global leadership in key technologies." President Donald Trump's former national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, is seen next to a photo of the Google logo. The letter was sent to White House national security advisor Mike Waltz before he was ousted from his role Thursday along with his deputy, Alex Wong, in the wake of the Signal controversy earlier this year. It was not immediately clear who Trump planned to install as his replacement. A copy was also sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. News of the letter, first reported by Fox News Digital, comes as lawyers for the Justice Department and Google continue to spar in federal court over how far Google should go to break up what a judge ruled last year to be its illegal monopoly on online search. O'Brien in his letter said the plans proposed by the Biden-era DOJ would cripple Google's ability to compete or innovate on the global stage – undermining U.S. leadership on cutting-edge technologies, such as AI and quantum computing, in its race against China, and presenting grave new economic and national security risks. DOJ's Antitrust Division is "aggressively pursuing the misguided policies of the prior Biden Administration and its European-like approach to crippling our nation's largest and most robust technology companies," O'Brien said. "By ignoring their enormous value to our country's strength, the Antitrust Division is seeking, through draconian remedies, to import European-style regulatory restrictions and prohibitions at home here in the Google Search case." "Splitting Google into smaller companies and forfeiting its intellectual property would weaken U.S. competitiveness against the giant, state-backed Chinese tech companies, since, separated entities would lack the enormous resources needed," O'Brien said. "Experts in multiple fields critical to national security confirm these basic principles and loudly address the concern that handcuffing our high-tech powerhouses would undermine U.S. leadership and superiority in these key technologies, and risk ceding the world's technology leadership to China," he said. Google search display is seen on a mobile phone screen and computer. The letter comes as Google and the Justice Department continue to spar in federal court in a so-called "remedies hearing" to break up what U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled last summer was Google's illegal monopoly in the online search engine space. Justice Department lawyers said Google should be required to sell off its Chrome browser, share years of its consumer data with competitors, and potentially sell Android, Google's smartphone operating system. Their proposed framework also includes requirements that Google be required to disclose its consumer data and search information with other companies, including rivals located outside the U.S., for the next 10 years. They told the court these steps could also stop Google from obtaining a monopoly in the AI space – acknowledging that technology is going to evolve, and therefore remedies must "include the ability to evolve alongside it as well." Google has proposed a much narrower remedies plan, including options for shorter contracts with browser companies, like Apple and Mozilla; new contracts with Android, and other important steps they said would make the landscape more competitive. Google officials argue DOJ's proposal goes "miles beyond" the relief that was ordered by Judge Amit Mehta in August, and warned that the government's proposed framework would stifle competition, fail to regulate anticompetitive conduct, and hobble Google's ability to attract new investments or innovate in key areas like AI and quantum computing. Google CEO Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in a 2018 hearing on privacy security and data collection. If that happened, he said, it could all but kill the nearly $2 trillion company by giving its IP away to its competitors. O'Brien serves as the co-founder and partner emeritus of Larson LLP, a firm that has represented Google as special outside counsel in unrelated matters, though O'Brien himself has not been involved in any of those cases.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? All those rape myths Me Too was supposed to debunk are back. A few short years ago, Harvey Weinstein was widely considered the monster against which all other alleged sexual abusers were measured. As he begins his New York state retrial for a series of rape and sexual assault charges over a period of years, that consensus has broken. To see just how wide of a cultural swing we're in the midst of, observe the questions right-wing commentator Candace Owens and manosphere hero Joe Rogan — notable “just asking questions” provocateurs — have begun asking on Weinstein's behalf. Owens is in the midst of promoting “Harvey Speaks,” a series of jailhouse interviews with Weinstein which she promises will exonerate him. '” Rogan says Owens's series convinced him to change his mind on Weinstein. This high-profile support for Weinstein is part of a larger anti-Me Too, anti-feminist backlash that took off in earnest in 2023, arguably beginning with the Amber Heard-Johnny Depp domestic violence trial. The days in which America was transfixed by accusation after accusation of sexual violence committed by famous men are long over. Gone is the era in which it seemed possible that America was going to truly hold sexual predators accountable, regardless of their fame and power. In this moment, America is more often transfixed by the idea that those famous men aren't so bad after all — that maybe the women who accused them are simply lying. For Owens and Rogan to embrace even Harvey Weinstein signals a true sea change in the place the Me Too movement holds in American culture, and with it, a change in how we understand sexual violence. In the first days after Weinstein was accused, around 2017 and 2018, he was treated as a sort of boogeyman, a man whose crimes were so many and so monstrous that all the other sexual crimes coming to light around the same time paled in comparison. “He's no Weinstein,” commenters said of all the other accused men in those months: Louis C.K., Al Franken, Garrison Keillor. Over the next few years, as Weinstein faced jail time and the other men by and large did not, Weinstein became, as the feminist commenter Jessica Valenti wrote in 2022, a point of comparison next to which everyone else seemed not particularly bad. “Weinstein went to jail,” Valenti wrote, “so that when a woman complains about Louis CK winning a Grammy, men can scoff at her greedy overreach.” Weinstein is currently facing retrial in New York because his 2020 guilty verdict was thrown out on a procedural issue. He is still serving out a 16-year sentence he received after a 2022 guilty verdict in Los Angeles, but a not guilty verdict in the New York retrial would mean he would not have to serve any time on top of that LA sentence. As he waits for the current trial to make its way through the courts, he appears optimistic about Owens's efforts on his behalf. “I've never seen anything like it,” he told the New York Post. “The woman is going to be a superstar, and I have been around stars.” First, Owens incorrectly asserts that of the more than 80 women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, only three ended up bringing charges against him. By most standards, being legally charged with sexual assault against eight different women would be considered a lot, although in Weinstein's case, it does work out to around 10 percent of his public accusers. The standard of evidence in a criminal court is high for good reason: if you're going to take someone's freedom away from them, you should be absolutely certain that they committed a crime. The eight cases brought against Weinstein represent the eight cases that law enforcement was confident they could prove to that standard. The fact that the other 72 or so accusations against Weinstein never resulted in criminal charges doesn't mean that they're all false. It doesn't mean that they're all true, either. Owens's second major argument is that Weinstein's accusers continued to spend time with him and, in some cases, send him flirtatious messages after they say he attacked them. She contends that they were acting as “sugar babies,” engaging in a quid pro quo relationship with Weinstein in which they traded sexual favors for his professional support. It is true that many of the women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault continued to maintain friendly relationships after their attacks. In the case of Weinstein and his accusers, Weinstein held significant professional power over his alleged victims — and his reputation as a vindictive actor left little doubt that he would not hesitate to use it. He torpedoed the careers of women who rejected his advances. That includes Mira Sorvino, who said she was forced to stop acting in major studio films after she turned him down (director Peter Jackson confirmed he decided not to hire her after Weinstein advised him against it). We also know that Weinstein's machinations didn't stop with professional retaliation. As publication approached for the two bombshell news articles breaking the story of Weinstein's decades-long pattern of sexual assault, Weinstein hired private security agencies, including former Mossad spies, to collect compromising information on the women who were preparing to accuse them. None of the information or context I am laying out here is new. It meant a chance to explain why so many women hesitate to come forward and tell their stories, why so many women maintain relationships with their attackers, and why it's so hard to get a conviction on a rape case. She is asking very old ones and acting as though they weren't thoroughly answered the first time around. That she has been able to do so successfully with Weinstein and find an audience willing and eager to welcome her takes means things could get a lot worse for all the other victims of sexual assault out there: the ones whose attackers don't have 80 public accusations against them; whose attackers are, after all, no Weinstein. The informational ecosystem she is building is just one sign that the gains of Me Too are far more ephemeral than we had once hoped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, will leave their positions at the White House, according to multiple outlets. Waltz, 51, has been mired in controversy for several weeks. He admitted responsibility for accidentally and unknowingly adding a reporter to the now-infamous Signal group chat in which senior officials debated whether to begin a military campaign in the Middle East. “We are not going to respond to reporting from anonymous sources,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. It's unclear who will fill the vacancy Waltz is leaving, which was first reported by journalist Mark Halperin, though one name he floated was Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff has faced criticism himself, particularly for his approach to negotiating with the Kremlin. He has been accused of echoing Kremlin talking points. He also reportedly met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relying on Kremlin translators. “Nice guy, but a bumbling f***ing idiot,” an anonymous member of Trump's first administration told the New York Post. Trump did not fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat when it was first reported, standing behind Waltz, who accepted responsibility for adding Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who shared sensitive details of an impending military operation in the group chat. Following the Signal group chat leak, Loomer “exposed” several Trump administration staffers for alleged disloyalty and ties to foreign adversaries on X. Wong was among those she posted about. “Laura Loomer is a very good patriot,” Trump said at the time. When pressed on whether Loomer had “anything to do with the NSC aides who were ousted,” Trump replied, “No, not at all.” Loomer had publicly called for Trump to fire Waltz and Wong and took a victory lap on social media on Thursday. It's been reported that he shared those details in another group chat, including his brother, wife, and personal attorney.</p>

After nearly 30 years of waking up to his alarm clock at 3:30 a.m., "Fox & Friends" co-host Steve Doocy will finally be able to hit the snooze. The longtime host announced on "Fox & Friends" that "it's time for a change" that will allow him to spend more time with his growing family, while still continuing his hosting duties. "Suzanne Scott, the CEO of Fox News Media and a friend of mine for over 30 years, and I have been trying to figure out what a guy who's been getting up at 3:30 for two generations should do next. And Suzanne gave me a great option. To keep working on this show, just not every day." Doocy said he'll now host three days a week and will be based in Florida. He said he will be reporting "coast to coast," including from areas of the U.S. that don't get as much coverage. "When my kids were growing up, I never had breakfast with them," he said. "I was always here, Kathy did everything. But starting tomorrow, I'm going to have breakfast with my grandkids and my children whenever I can." President Donald Trump also shared a special message to Doocy, thanking him for his fair coverage through the years and congratulating him on the transition. President Donald Trump shares a congratulatory message to Steve Doocy. "I just want to congratulate you on your new and probably enhanced role," the president said. "I just think you're a fantastic guy. "It's the number one show in the business, and it's going to stay that way for a long time to come, and you were a big part of it," he continued. Doocy, who joined Fox News Channel at its inception in 1996 and began as ‘Fox & Friends' co-host two years later, said he will be taking some time off to spend with his children and grandchildren before kicking off his new role.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has moved to roll back food safety measures, endanger slaughterhouse workers, and more. President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been a gift to a sector of the economy that gets little attention but has enormous social and economic consequences: the US meat industry. While Congress and both Republican and Democratic administrations tend to do what meat companies want — in part because those companies tend to give a lot of money to politicians and intensively lobby them — Trump has been even friendlier than most. The ensuing trade war has reduced two of US agriculture's most important exports to China: pork and soybeans. In most other respects, though, the Trump administration has behaved like traditional anti-regulation conservatives. Pig slaughter lines are already allowed to process as many as 1,106 hogs per hour, or roughly one pig every 3.2 seconds, while poultry operations are allowed to slaughter up to 140 birds per minute. Yet in March, the US Department of Agriculture announced that it was drafting a rule to allow pig and poultry slaughterhouses to operate even faster. “Increased line speeds will hurt workers — it's not a maybe, it's a definite,” the president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which represents over 15,000 poultry workers, said in a press release. Animal advocates also worry about how this will impact the billions of animals that move through US slaughterhouses every year. “With fewer protections and higher pressure, animals will endure even more suffering on the already cruel live-shackle slaughter line,” Michael Windsor of the animal protection group the Humane League told me in an email. The USDA didn't respond to an interview request for this story. Toward the end of President Joe Biden's term, his USDA proposed — but didn't finalize — a rule that would require poultry companies to limit salmonella levels in their products and test raw chicken and turkey for six strains. In February, the USDA shrunk a farm animal welfare research team from five scientists to just one, Sentient Media's Grey Moran reported. The unit's research aimed to better understand “the gruesome mutilations and injuries routinely suffered by farm animals, including the pain experienced by livestock during and after castration (the removal of the testicles to prevent further breeding); the far-ranging psychological and physiological impacts of heat stress on farm animals and methods to increase cooling, and ways that farm animal stress is passed down to their offspring,” according to Moran. The USDA unit also worked with livestock producers to improve animal welfare and had conducted research on pain endured by female breeding pigs kept in tiny cages, a common practice in the pork industry. That work informed California's farm animal welfare law prohibiting extreme confinement of pigs. For a decade, JBS, the world's largest meat company, had been seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange to gain new investors to fuel its nearly $19 billion meat and poultry empire. During Trump's first term, the Justice Department fined JBS, JBS's parent company, and two brothers who control the parent company $280 million for bribing approximately 1,800 Brazilian officials. In mid-January, JBS agreed to pay $4 million to a youth migrant legal defense organization after the Labor Department found that children had worked in JBS's slaughterhouses for years. Less than two weeks later, its poultry subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride — the company that donated $5 million to Trump's inauguration — paid a $41.5 million settlement to investors over allegations that it had inflated its stock price. JBS has also long been implicated in deforestation, and last year, New York state's attorney general took the company to court for its “net zero” climate claims. Eggs are so expensive right now primarily because of bird flu, which has resulted in the brutal culling of around 100 million egg-laying hens — and over 60 million chickens and turkeys raised for meat — since the current outbreak began in early 2022. More than half of the nearly $2 billion the US has spent on this outbreak has gone to cover poultry companies' losses. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. While bird flu infections are hard to prevent, producers may be disincentivized from strengthening their biosecurity if the USDA guarantees they'll be compensated for their losses, a problem the Biden administration identified late last year when it implemented an interim rule requiring producers to pass a biosecurity audit to become eligible for compensation. Despite all this, in late March, the USDA more than doubled the amount that it pays egg companies for each killed hen, from around $7 per bird to almost $17. Although many consumers don't know it, and politicians do little to address it, agriculture is a massive polluter — it's the largest source of US water pollution, most of it from meat and livestock feed production — and accounts for at least 11 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. In early April, a leaked USDA memo revealed that the Agricultural Research Service, the USDA's in-house scientific research department, could no longer use 110 words and phrases, including water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, groundwater pollution, and climate change, in some of the department's documents. That'll only make it harder for anyone to understand and ameliorate the meat industry's social costs. There's more: Trump recently proclaimed that he wants to open up a marine refuge near Hawaii to commercial fishing, and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins has expressed strong support for legislative efforts to dismantle critical state animal welfare laws. Trump has also frozen most of the $19.5 billion set aside in the Inflation Reduction Act to help farmers implement conservation and climate practices, and has canceled a similar $3 billion Biden-era program. Nor is it necessarily clear that the Trump administration has been bad for animals on net. Animal advocates have cheered recent moves by the FDA and EPA to significantly reduce animal testing, which, although a separate issue from factory farming, could represent a major reduction in a type of animal suffering that has long been unchallenged by both parties. But when it comes to the industry that's by far more responsible than any other for hurting and killing animals, the Trump administration has been even more deferential than his recent predecessors. Its positions on meat and the animals who suffer for it could be summed up as simply as “kill, baby, kill.” A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional Republicans are set to introduce legislation on Thursday aimed at giving consumers a tax-free haven for their savings interest. “Washington shouldn't be in the business of micromanaging how people use their own money,” Harshbarger said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. Under a universal savings account, the holder would not have to pay taxes on the income earned from interest, giving consumers more flexibility for unexpected costs on housing, healthcare, and more. Anyone 18 or older who is a citizen or permanent resident can open an account with an initial contribution limit of $10,000 in after-tax income; the limit then increases by $500 each year until it reaches $25,000. “This bill provides a straightforward solution to those challenges. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this bill for the future generations of Americans.” Harshbarger previously introduced similar legislation last Congress that had six other Republican co-sponsors, but it was not given a floor vote. This version of the bill allows taxpayers to open custodial USAs for children. The accounts are similar to a Roth IRA but allow money to be withdrawn for any reason, not just retirement. Those who oppose creating tax-advantaged savings accounts argue they disproportionately help high-income earners who have the means to invest and that workers who spend most of their income on basic needs will not benefit from the reform.</p>
