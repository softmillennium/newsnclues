                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump appointee Darren Beattie requested records regarding a large list of high-profile names, organizations, and right-wing buzzwords for a “Twitter files”-style document dump about alleged conservative censorship. The document, originally shared in person with roughly a dozen State Department employees in early March, requested staff emails and other records with or about a host of individuals and organizations that track or write about foreign disinformation—including Atlantic journalist Anne Applebaum, former US cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, and the Stanford Internet Observatory—or have criticized President Donald Trump and his allies, such as the conservative anti-Trump commentator Bill Kristol. The document also seeks all staff communications that merely reference Trump or people in his orbit, like Alex Jones, Glenn Greenwald, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In addition, it directs a search of communications for a long list of keywords, including “Pepe the Frog,” “incel,” “q-anon,” “Black Lives Matter,” “great replacement theory,” “far-right,” and “infodemic.” Beattie, whom Trump appointed in February to be the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, told State Department officials that his goal in seeking these records was a “Twitter files”-like release of internal State Department documents “to rebuild trust with the American public,” according to a State Department employee who heard the remarks. “What would be the innocent reason for doing that?” Bill Kristol MIT Technology Review broke the news earlier this month that R/FIMI would be shuttered. Also included among the nearly 60 individuals and organizations caught up in Beattie's information dragnet are Bill Gates; the open-source journalism outlet Bellingcat; former FBI special agent Clint Watts; Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister; Daniel Fried, a career State Department official and former US ambassador to Poland; Renée DiResta, an expert in online disinformation who led research at Stanford Internet Observatory; and Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who briefly led the Disinformation Governance Board at the US Department of Homeland Security. Have more information on this story or a tip for something else that we should report? Using a non-work device, reach the reporter on Signal at eileenguo.15 or tips@technologyreview.com. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn't collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I've never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.” He adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.” Both GEC and R/FIMI, its pared-down successor office, focused on tracking and countering foreign disinformation efforts from Russia, China, and Iran, among others, but GEC was frequently accused—and was even sued—by conservative critics who claimed that it enabled censorship of conservative Americans' views. A judge threw out one of those claims against GEC in 2022 (while finding that other parts of the Biden administration did exert undue pressure on tech platforms). Among the ideas promoted in Revolver News is that GEC was part of a “censorship industrial complex” aimed at suppressing American conservative voices, even though GEC's mission was foreign disinformation. Many have been the subject of Trump's public grievances for years. (Trump called Krebs, for instance, a “significant bad-faith actor” in an executive order targeting him earlier this month.) Finally, he sought a list of additional unredacted agency records—including all GEC grants and contracts, as well as subgrants, which are particularly sensitive due to the risks of retaliation to subgrantees, who often work in local journalism, fact-checking, or pro-democracy organizations under repressive regimes. It also asked for “all documents mentioning” the Election Integrity Partnership, a research collaboration between academics and tech companies that has been a target of right-wing criticism. Several State Department staffers call the records requests “unusual” and “improper” in their scope. While they acknowledge that previous political appointees have, on occasion, made information requests through the records management system, Beattie's request was something wholly different. Never had “an incoming political appointee” sought to “search through seven years' worth of all staff emails to see whether anything negative had been said about his friends,” says one staffer. Notably, this includes several journalists: In addition to Bellingcat and Applebaum, the document also asks for communications with NBC News senior reporter Brandy Zadrozny. Rather, the effort seems like “a tactic designed to … make it much harder for journalists to strike up those source relationships in the first instance.” In addition to Jones, Greenwald, and “RFK Jr.,” the list includes “Don Jr.,” Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk, Marine Le Pen, “Bolsonaro” (which could cover either Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, or his son Eduardo, who is seeking political asylum in the US), and Beattie himself. It also asked for a search for 32 right-wing buzzwords related to abortion, immigration, election denial, and January 6, suggesting a determined effort to find State Department staff who even just discussed such matters. (Staffers say they doubt that Beattie will find much, unless, one says, it's “previous [FOIA] queries from people like Beattie” or discussions about “some Russian or PRC [Chinese] narrative that includes some of this stuff.”) Multiple sources say State Department employees raised alarms internally about the records requests. “Making it known that [they] took money from the United States would put a target on them,” this individual explains. Several people familiar with the matter say that by early April, Beattie had received many of the documents he'd requested, retrieved through eRecords, as well as a list of grantees. One source says the more sensitive list of subgrantees was not shared. Neither the State Department nor Beattie responded to requests for comment. A CISA spokesperson emailed, “We do not comment on intergovernmental documents and would refer you back to the State Department.” We reached out to all individuals whose communications were requested and are named here; many declined to comment on the record. Five weeks after Beattie made his requests for information, the State Department shut down R/FIMI. He then discussed in an interview with the influential right-wing Internet personality Mike Benz plans for Beattie to lead a “transparency effort.” “What we have to do now—and Darren will be big involved in that as well—is sort of document what happened … because I think people who were harmed deserve to know that, and be able to prove that they were harmed,” Rubio told Benz. Many of the names and keywords he included in his request reflect conspiracy theories and grievances promoted by Revolver News—which Beattie founded after being fired from his job as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration when CNN reported that he had spoken at a conference with white nationalists. Weaponizing any speech they consider to be critical by deeming it disinformation is not only ironic, says Jankowicz—it will also have “chilling effects” on anyone who conducts disinformation research, and it will result in “less oversight and transparency over tech platforms, over adversarial activities, over, frankly, people who are legitimately trying to disenfranchise US voters.” That, she warns, “is something we should all be alarmed about.” The National Institute of Standards and Technology's new harm reduction initiative is helping prevent needless deaths.

Not sure why this isn't said clearly in the article. Unfortunately, not referencing original sources is common practice among European digital rights groups.

I know that this is the wording the EU itself chooses to put there, but no. They are not "voted upon". Parliament cannot choose a EU commission president. The council (the heads of state of the member states) put forth a candidate and if the parliament says no, the council has to select a president (this time ... without the parliament needing to confirm them)Like anything else in the EU, the executive is in full control of1) itself2) law in the EU (the commission is the ONLY EU institution that can make laws, and yes, the essential part of that is that the parliament IS NOT in charge of EU law. It can neither force a law through nor can the EU parliament prevent the commission from enacting a law)

Even where the first part (in which, it should be noted, the terms involved are interpreted very narrowly) is not problematic, the “two witnesses" rule, which is applied independently to each fact necessary to sustain the conviction, is usually quite difficult to overcome, so its usually vastly easier to get a conviction for something else. The Korean war was never formally resolved, but the US hasn't declared war since WWII.There's also no indication of adherence here.Doing things that benefit a country and a leader that your  government officically doesn't care for can be all shades of prohibited and illegal, but it's not treason.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After notching a big win against Apple in a years-long legal dispute, Epic announced that its Epic Games Store will allow developers to open webshops, which can offer players out-of-app purchases to circumvent fees from Apple and Google. But Wednesday night, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in a seething filing that Apple was intentionally violating her 2021 ruling. Now, Epic is bringing its flagship game Fortnite back to the iOS App Store, where it will incentivize users to buy Fortnite's digital goods through Epic directly, since they'll get a better price. With the Epic Games Store's new webshops feature, other developers will be more easily able to follow suit. But starting in June, Epic Games will not take a cut from the first $1 million each game earns annually. “With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States,” Epic said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After nearly 13 years in business, Fivetran will now be able to offer its customers an end-to-end data movement solution. Fivetran, which helps enterprises move data from a variety of sources into cloud databases, announced on Thursday it has acquired Census, a reverse extract, transform, and load (ETL) platform that enables companies to transfer data out of databases and into operational tools. The company thought about developing an offering of its own, going so far as to build a prototype. “Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they're actually pretty different,” Fraser said. “The two products make broadly similar philosophical choices, and so they tend to appeal to the same customers, which is very important when you're thinking about synergy.” It didn't hurt that the founding teams of Census and Fivetran go way back, either. Fraser said he met the Census team, which includes CEO Boris Jabes and Anton Vaynshtok, during Y Combinator's 2013 winter batch. They all stayed in touch and even talked about Census as a concept years before the company was founded. Now, close to a decade later, everything is coming under one roof.

Google is also going to make AI Mode accessible outside of Labs, as it's testing an AI Mode tab in Google Search that will be visible to a small percentage of people in the U.S. As for the new functionality, Google is making it possible to go a step beyond asking detailed questions about places and products. For example, if you're searching for the best vintage shops with mid-century modern furniture, AI Mode can highlight nearby stores, provide real-time details like how busy they are, and let you quickly call or get directions. Or, if you're planning a camping trip, you try searching for something like “best foldable camping chair that would fit in a backpack for under $100.” AI Mode will then give you a breakdown of recommended products, alongside product details and links to retailers. Google is also making it possible to pick up where you left off when using AI Mode, which should be helpful in cases where you're working on longer-running projects and tasks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xbox is the first major game publisher after Nintendo to promise a sweeping price increase for its entire portfolio, save for Game Pass. It sounds like the sort of thing that would hurt sales, but all it really means is Xbox will push Game Pass even harder than before. Starting Thursday, May 1, all Xbox consoles will see price increases. An Xbox Series X Digital console now costs $550 compared to its previous $450, and the model with an optical drive now costs $600, $100 more than its previous $500 MSRP. An Xbox Series X Galaxy Black Special Edition with a 2TB SSD now runs $730, or $120 more than its previous $600 price tag, and even more than a $700 PlayStation 5 Pro. The Xbox Wireless Controller, which remains a staple for both console and PC gaming, now costs $65. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller now starts at $150, up from $145. The official Xbox Wireless Headset will set you back $120, $10 more than before. Microsoft's gaming hardware will see price hikes outside the U.S. as well. Microsoft's gaming brand is the first to jack up prices since Nintendo introduced its $70, $80, and $90 pricing structure for first-party Switch 2 titles. It's only a matter of time before other major publishers take the hint and raise their prices as well. “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,” the company wrote on its support page. Gizmodo reached out to Xbox for comment on whether this had anything to do with Trump's tariffs, but we did not immediately hear back. However, publishers have been looking hard at Nintendo and its Switch 2 pricing. Xbox Game Pass remains the only service that's not going up in price. Last year, Microsoft changed up its gaming subscription service, increased the cost of most tiers, and nixed access to day-one games from its lower-priced console tier. With more expensive games on the horizon, Game Pass may look like an even better deal than before, but Microsoft can always change its policies in the future. If it isn't clear already, Microsoft's Game Pass will be its bread and butter going forward. Xbox is no longer interested in using hardware to push exclusive titles. This month, it brought once-exclusive games like Forza Horizon 5 to PlayStation 5. Based on Microsoft's Q3 earnings report released this week, Xbox hardware sales were already down compared to the rest of its portfolio. Meanwhile, revenue from Xbox “services,” namely Game Pass, was up by 8% year-over-year. Microsoft now sees Xbox as a service model, and hardware will inevitably fall by the wayside. In that way, the entire games industry is feeding into Microsoft's hands. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. You won't just be haggling over Nintendo Switch 2's $450 price tag or $80 games, but its limited storage space. Be careful: Cheaper Switch 2 gear like the new GameCube controller or Hori's third-party cameras may not work exactly as you think. GameStop's Switch 2 preorders page shows the console is now sold out, though you should check your orders page in case you got lucky. Judging by these sales numbers, the U.S. Switch 2 preorder scene will be hectic midnight on Thursday. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year, D23 wowed collectors with one of the coolest Star Wars toys we'd seen in a very long time: a massive, 3.75″-figure-scaled replica of the original ride vehicle from Star Tours, the StarSpeeder 3000, that could seat 25 figures and even included a video screen playing back parts of the iconic Disney ride. But if your memory of Star Tours leans a little towards its modern rejuvenation (itself nearly a decade-and-a-half old now! ), then this weekend you're going to be in luck. io9 has got your exclusive first look at the return of the excellent Star Tours Starspeeder toy as part of the Disney Store's Star Wars Day offerings for May 4 this year. The ship still features a display stand, as well as seats to hold up to 25 3.75″-scaled figures (complete with those all-important seatbelts! One key difference is that while the StarSpeeder 3000 playset featured a suite of voice phrases from the beloved original Star Tours droid pilot, Captain Rex, the 1000 will further reflect Adventures Continue by featuring lines from C-3PO, who took over in the refresh as Star Tours' latest unwitting pilot. The Star Tours: The Adventures Continue StarSpeeder 1000 play set will be available from direct from the Disney Store at this link starting from 11am ET/8am PT this Sunday, May 4.

As the franchise increasingly grapples with trying to revisit its central figures over and over, Andor season 2's recast-by-necessity proves that there's another path. Matt Ferguson's new poster for Star Wars: Episode III is on sale now. There's a good reason the Imperial security droid played by Alan Tudyk hasn't appeared yet on the Star Wars series. If you're watching Andor for lore and cameos, you'll be left wanting when it comes to a certain Sith lord duo.

Third-party gaming controller and peripherals maker 8BitDo is putting a halt on shipments from its China warehouse to the U.S. The notice also said that only products stored in its U.S. warehouse would be available for shipment to American customers, while international fulfillment from China was temporarily on hold. At the time of writing, U.S. customers can still buy 8BitDo controllers, mice, keyboards, and other products that are already available in the company's U.S. warehouse. However, the website doesn't show which items are available locally. The only way to know that is at the checkout page, where it tells you if a product can or cannot be shipped to your location... For those who haven't heard of the brand, 8BitDo specializes in retro-inspired gaming controllers and peripherals. It sells high-quality wireless controllers that offer compatibility with platforms like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PC, Android, and even some classic consoles. 8BitDo's products often come with eye-catching vintage aesthetics paired with modern features such as support for wireless connectivity, customization software, and USB-C charging. Multiple companies are reportedly rethinking their logistics and pricing strategies. Just last week, PC case and component maker Hyte announced a pause in shipments of certain products to the U.S., citing the financial burden of increased tariffs. While certain PC cases may currently be exempt from the full 145% rate, they still face existing import duties, including a 20% base tariff and an additional 25% on aluminum-related materials. As U.S. trade policy evolves, companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, components, or materials are struggling to deal with rising costs and maintaining affordability for consumers. Smaller and mid-sized hardware manufacturers are being forced to either absorb their losses, pass the additional costs onto customers, or make changes and relocate their manufacturing.

Things like scrolling and typing are just way too annoying without it. In fact there already are some projects of eInk-orientd OSes (e.g. MuditaOS). I don't know how good they really are though. I hate scrolling and hardly ever scroll really - I just use multiple vertical displays to fit every page fully, only switching pages. Surely this whole discussion thread can't be fit in a screen but I'm perfectly comfortable "scrolling" it with PgDn.I'm used to slow-response typing (waiting for seconds before a word I typed appears when using modern software on old PCs).

I don't mean this is a right way to type yet it proves seeing characters displayed immediately is not essential. Messenger apps even have separate panes for displaying message threads and for editing the message you are going to submit - I could put these on separate displays (if the apps would allow moving panels around the way classic desktop apps did). Slow monochrome eInk panels have been around for 2 decades. Mostly built into pocket book readers, phones (like Motorola F3) and niche devices like supermarket price tags rather than computer monitors attachable with common connectors.Okay, perhaps it's not the speed which makes them expensive, yet manufacturers and researchers mostly brag about making them faster (and more colorful) rather than making them more cheap (what I would prefer them to). High efficiency computing where we dont update the screen until absolutely necessary. Nevertheless I would prefer there to be a cheaper option for those who only need to read static documents or watch dashboards of information which doesn't change fast.> You can simply refresh eink displays with different methods that offer different trade offsNeedless to say eInk displays aren't meant to refresh the same way classic displays do. Only the regions which actually change are supposed to redraw. 1 Hz doesn't mean the whole panel is fully reset 60 times every minute, only that it takes a second to display a change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a consequence, Trump could find himself at odds with constitutional prohibitions of bribery and corruption, experts claim. Those subsidiaries also profit from any surge in trading volume as rent-seeking intermediaries. However, the dinner maneuver may have political consequences for Trump. In creating the opportunity for anybody with sufficient wealth to purchase an audience, Trump risks falling foul of a part of the US Constitution—the emoluments clauses—that prohibit the president from accepting gifts or financial compensation from foreign and domestic state actors. “Trump has built an entire life prodding the border of what a powerful person can get away with,” claims Jeff Hauser, executive director at the Revolving Door Project, an organization that seeks to scrutinize the behavior of elected officials. “But at some point in time, he could push a little too far and it comes back on him. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The price of memecoins tends to whipsaw dramatically with swings in public sentiment toward the person, meme, or concept they are based upon. The market will expect further utility to come from holding that coin,” says Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon. “Before, you were speculating on a TRUMP coin with no utility. The act of transmuting his cryptocurrency into a utility coin is unlikely to have immediate regulatory implications for Trump. Likewise, during Trump's first term, the agency reached a similar conclusion about utility coins. “Whether it's a utility token or a memecoin, it's not regulated by the SEC,” says Lisa Bragança, attorney at Bragança Law and former branch chief at the SEC. Therefore, to avoid the attention of regulators, Trump need only refrain from fraud and unfair trade practices, she says. “If it's a utility coin and, say, a representative of Russia shows up for dinner with the president, we know it's an emoluments issue.” Today, access to the sitting US president carries a greater potential political currency than ever. “Trump is amalgamating even more power in the executive branch than anyone has before,” claims Hauser. “With ever greater power comes a larger warehouse of favors that can be sold.” In the halls of Congress, calls for Trump's impeachment are already growing. “He is granting audiences to people who buy the memecoin that directly enriches him,” said Democrat senator Jon Ossoff in a town hall meeting on April 25. “There is no doubt that this president's conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” For now, the Republican congressional majority and Trump's command of his party mean impeachment calls are unlikely to go anywhere. Equally, Trump has previously prevailed in multiple lawsuits alleging that he violated emoluments clauses during his first time in connection with his hotel business, which were later dismissed. “Right now, Trump rules the Republican party with such an iron hand that the notion of a successful impeachment leading to a guilty verdict is just somewhat fanciful.” However, in its potential to paint Trump in an unflattering light—as a president who puts his own financial interests over those of the nation—the TRUMP coin dinner could contribute to shifting the dial. But the optics are potentially much worse for Trump,” says Hauser.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has once again beat everyone else to a clean energy milestone—its new nuclear reactor is reportedly one of the first to use thorium instead of uranium as a fuel and the first of its kind that can be refueled while it's running. It's an interesting (if decidedly experimental) development out of a country that's edging toward becoming the world leader in nuclear energy. China has now surpassed France in terms of generation, though not capacity; it still lags behind the US in both categories. But one recurring theme in media coverage about the reactor struck me, because it's so familiar: This technology was invented decades ago, and then abandoned. You can basically copy and paste that line into countless stories about today's advanced reactor technology. This one research reactor in China running with an alternative fuel says a lot about this moment for nuclear energy technology: Many groups are looking into the past for technologies, with a new appetite for building them. First, it's important to note that China is the hot spot for nuclear energy right now. The country is building reactors at a remarkable clip and currently has more reactors under construction than any other country by far. Just this week, China approved 10 new reactors, totaling over $27 billion in investment. China is also leading the way for some advanced reactor technologies (that category includes basically anything that deviates from the standard blueprint of what's on the grid today: large reactors that use enriched uranium for fuel and high-pressure water to keep the reactor cool). High-temperature reactors that use gas as a coolant are one major area of focus for China—a few reactors that use this technology have recently started up, and more are in the planning stages or under construction. The reactor came online in June 2024, but researchers say it recently went through refueling without shutting down. It generates just two megawatts of heat—less than the research reactor on MIT's campus, which rings in at six megawatts. (To be fair, MIT's is one of the largest university research reactors in the US, but still … it's small.) Regardless, progress is progress for thorium reactors, as the world has been entirely focused on uranium for the last 50 years or so. A reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee that ran in the 1960s used Uranium-233 fuel (which can be generated when thorium is bombarded with radiation). Eventually, though, the world more or less settled on a blueprint for nuclear reactors, focusing on those that use Uranium-238 as fuel and are cooled by water at a high pressure. The research could also be applied to nuclear weapons. The company's technology could usher in a new era of reactors that are cheaper and safer to operate. But now there's a renewed interest in alternative nuclear technologies, and the thorium-fueled reactor is just one of several examples. A prominent one we've covered before: Kairos Power is building reactors that use molten salt as a coolant for small nuclear reactors, also a technology invented and developed in the 1950s and '60s before being abandoned. Another old-but-new concept is using high-temperature gas to cool reactors, as X-energy is aiming to do in its proposed power station at a chemical plant in Texas. Some problems from decades ago that contributed to technologies being abandoned will still need to be dealt with today. In the case of molten-salt reactors, for example, it can be tricky to find materials that can withstand the corrosive properties of super-hot salt. But as early progress shows, the archives could provide fodder for new commercial reactors, and revisiting these old ideas could give the nuclear industry a much-needed boost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas was from rural Tennessee and had studied computer science at the University of Missouri. Thomas had an Anglo-Saxon surname, so Wijckmans was surprised when he clicked into his Google Meet and found himself speaking with a heavily accented young man of Asian origin. Thomas had set a generic image of an office as his background. Wijckmans fired off his interview questions, and Thomas' responses were solid enough. But Wijckmans noticed that Thomas seemed most interested in asking about his salary. Once again, the applicant said they were based in the US, had an Anglo name, and appeared to be a young Asian man with a thick, non-American accent. In the lenses, Wijckmans spotted the reflection of multiple screens, and he could make out a white chatbox with messages scrolling by. “He was clearly either chatting with somebody or on some AI tool,” Wijckmans remembers. On high alert, Wijckmans grabbed screenshots and took notes. He found that his company's listings were being flooded with applicants just like these: an opening for a full-stack developer got more than 500 applications in a day, far more than usual. And when he looked more deeply into the applicants' coding tests, he saw that many candidates appeared to have used a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows you to mask your computer's true location. Wijckmans didn't know it yet, but he'd stumbled onto the edges of an audacious, global cybercrime operation. He'd unwittingly made contact with an army of seemingly unassuming IT workers, deployed to work remotely for American and European companies under false identities, all to bankroll the government of North Korea. With a little help from some friends on the ground, of course. In her spare time she listened to K-pop, enjoyed Renaissance fairs, and got into cosplay. It was March 2020 when she clicked on the message in her LinkedIn account. The company needed help finding remote employment for overseas workers. It's unclear how fast her workload grew, but by October 2022 she could afford a move from chilly Minnesota to a low-slung, four-bedroom house in Litchfield Park, Arizona. Chapman then started documenting more of her life on TikTok and YouTube, mostly talking about her diet, fitness, or mental health. In one chatty video, shared in June 2023, she described grabbing breakfast on the go—an açaí bowl and a smoothie— because work was so busy. In the background, the camera caught a glimpse of metal racks holding at least a dozen open laptops covered in sticky notes. A few months later, federal investigators raided Chapman's home, seized the laptops, and eventually filed charges alleging that she had spent three years aiding the “illicit revenue generation efforts” of the government of North Korea. For maybe a decade, North Korean intelligence services have been training young IT workers and sending them abroad in teams, often to China or Russia. From these bases, they scour the web for job listings all over, usually in software engineering, and usually with Western companies. Over time they began applying for these jobs using stolen or fake identities and relying on members of their criminal teams to provide fictional references; some have even started using AI to pass coding tests, video interviews, and background checks. A fake employee, after all, can't use the addresses or bank accounts linked to their stolen IDs, and they can't dial in to a company's networks from overseas without instantly triggering suspicion. She would often receive their paychecks in one of her bank accounts, take a cut, and wire the rest overseas: Federal prosecutors say Chapman was promised as much as 30 percent of the money that passed through her hands. Her most important job, though, was tending the “laptop farm.” After being hired, a fake worker will typically ask for their company computer to be sent to a different address than the one on record—usually with some tale about a last-minute move or needing to stay with a sick relative. Sometimes the facilitator forwards the laptop to an address overseas, but more commonly that person holds onto it and installs software that allows it to be controlled remotely. (“You know how to install Anydesk?” one North Korean operative asked Chapman in 2022. In messages with her handlers, Chapman discussed sending government forms like the I-9, which attests that a person is legally able to work in the US. (“I did my best to copy your signature,” she wrote. She also did basic tech troubleshooting and dialed into meetings on a worker's behalf, sometimes on short notice, as in this conversation from November 2023: Worker: We are going to have laptop setup meeting in 20 mins. Can you join Teams meeting and follow what IT guy say? Because it will require to restart laptop multiple times and I can not handle that. You can mute and just follow what they say ... Worker: You don't have to say, I will be joining there too. If they ask WHY you are using two devices, just say the microphone on your laptop doesn't work right ... “I will SEND them for you, but have someone else do the paperwork. I can go to FEDERAL PRISON for falsifying federal documents.” Michael Barnhart, an investigator at cybersecurity company DTEX and a leading expert on the North Korean IT worker threat, says Chapman's involvement followed a standard pattern—from an innocuous initial contact on LinkedIn to escalating requests. By the time investigators raided Chapman's home, she was housing several dozen laptops, each with a sticky note indicating the fake worker's identity and employer. Prosecutors said at least 300 employers had been pulled into this single scheme, including “a top-five national television network and media company, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an iconic American car manufacturer, a high-end retail store, and one of the most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the world.” Chapman, they alleged, had helped pass along at least $17 million. Chapman's case is just one of several North Korean fake-worker prosecutions making their way through US courts. A Ukrainian named Oleksandr Didenko has been accused of setting up a freelancing website to connect fake IT workers with stolen identities. Prosecutors say at least one worker was linked to Chapman's laptop farm and that Didenko also has ties to operations in San Diego and Virginia. In Tennessee, 38-year-old Matthew Knoot is due to stand trial for his alleged role in a scheme that investigators say sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to North Korea via his laptop farm in Nashville. (None of the defendants' lawyers in these cases responded to requests for comment.) The indictments claim that Prince and Ashtor had spent six years running a string of fake staffing companies that placed North Koreans in at least 64 businesses. before the hermit kingdom had its laptop farms, it had a single confirmed internet connection, at least as far as the outside world could tell. Then, in 2011, 27-year-old Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as the country's dictator. Secretly educated in Switzerland and said to be an avid gamer, the younger Kim made IT a national priority. Computer science is now on some high school curricula, while college students can take courses on information security, robotics, and engineering. The most promising students are taught hacking techniques and foreign languages that can make them more effective operatives. They are promised good wages and unfettered access to the internet—the real internet, not the intranet available to well-off North Koreans, which consists of a mere handful of heavily censored North Korean websites. The earliest cyberattacks launched by Pyongyang were simple affairs: defacing websites with political messages or launching denial-of-service attacks to shut down US websites. In 2014, North Korean hackers famously stole and leaked confidential information from Sony's film studio. Then they targeted financial institutions: Fraudulent trades pulled more than $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh's accounts at the New York Federal Reserve. While the amount of revenue the attack generated is up for debate—some say it earned just $140,000 in payouts—it wreaked much wider damage as companies worked to upgrade their systems and security, costing as much as $4 billion, according to one estimate. Governments responded with more sanctions and stronger security measures, and the regime pivoted, dialing back on ransomware in favor of quieter schemes. It turns out these are also more lucrative: Today, the most valuable tool in North Korea's cybercrime armory is cryptocurrency theft. In 2024, according to a recent report from South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the number of people working in North Korea's cyber divisions—which includes pretenders, crypto thieves, and military hackers—stood at 8,400, up from 6,800 two years earlier. They are relatively well compensated, but their posting is hardly cushy. “You don't have any freedom,” says Hyun-Seung Lee, a North Korean defector who lives in Washington, DC, and says some of his old friends were part of such operations. “You're not allowed to leave the apartment unless you need to purchase something, like grocery shopping, and that is arranged by the team leader. Two or three people must go together so there's no opportunity for them to explore.” The US government estimates that a typical team of pretenders can earn up to $3 million each year for Pyongyang. Experts say the money is pumped into everything from Kim Jong Un's personal slush fund to the country's nuclear weapons program. A few million dollars may seem small next to the flashy crypto heists— but with so many teams operating in obscurity, the fraud is effective precisely because it is so mundane. “He would dial in to meetings, he would participate in discussions,” an executive at the company told me on condition of anonymity. It was only later, when federal investigators discovered one of his pay stubs at Christina Chapman's laptop farm in Arizona, that the company connected the dots and realized it had employed a foreign agent for nearly a year. “We've seen long-tail operations where they were going 10, 12, 18 months working in some of these organizations,” says Adam Meyers, a senior vice president for counter adversary operations at the security company CrowdStrike. Sometimes, though, North Korean operatives last just a few days— enough time to download huge amounts of company data or plant malicious software in a company's systems before abruptly quitting. That code could alter financial data or manipulate security information. Or these seeds could lay dormant for months, even years. “The potential risk from even one minute of access to systems is almost unlimited for an individual company,” says Declan Cummings, the head of engineering at software company Cinder. Experts say that attacks are ramping up not just in the US but also in Germany, France, Britain, Japan and other countries. They urge companies to do rigorous due diligence: speak directly to references, watch for candidates making sudden changes of address, use reputable online screening tools, and conduct a physical interview or in-person ID verification. ChatGPT and the like give almost anyone the capacity to answer esoteric questions in real time with unearned confidence, and their fluency with coding threatens to make programming tests irrelevant. AI video filters and deepfakes can also add to the subterfuge. At an onboarding call, for instance, many HR representatives now ask new employees to hold their ID up to the camera for closer inspection. “But the fraudsters have a neat trick there,” says Donal Greene, a biometrics expert at the online background check provider Certn. They take a green-colored card the exact shape and size of an identity card—a mini green screen—and, using deepfake technology, project the image of an ID onto it. “They can actually move it and show the reflection,” says Greene. “He interviewed great,” says Brian Jack, KnowBe4's chief information security officer. We didn't have any reason to suspect this wasn't a valid candidate.” But when his facilitator—the US-based individual giving him cover—tried to install malware on Kyle's company computer, the security team caught on and shut him out. Back in london, Simon Wijckmans couldn't let go of the idea that somebody had tried to fool him. He'd just read about the Knowbe4 case, which deepened his suspicions. He conducted background checks and discovered that some of his candidates were definitely using stolen identities. And, he found, some of them were linked to known North Korean operations. I dial in to Google Meet at 3 am Pacific time, tired and bleary. We deliberately picked this offensively early hour because it's 6 am in Miami, where the candidate, “Harry,” claims to be. He's maybe in his late twenties, with short, straight, black hair. Everything about him seems deliberately nonspecific: He wears a plain black crewneck sweater and speaks into an off-brand headset. “I just woke up early today for this interview, no problem,” he says. “I know that working with UK hours is kind of a requirement, so I can get my working hours to yours, so no problem with it.” So far, everything matches the hallmarks of a fake worker. His English is good but heavily accented, even though he tells us he was born in New York and grew up in Brooklyn. Wijckmans starts with some typical interview questions, and Harry keeps glancing off to his right as he responds. “I have a problem with my microphone.” Wijckman nods, and Harry disappears. A couple of minutes pass, and I start to fret that we've scared him away, but then he pops back into the meeting. Maybe he restarted his chatbot, or got a coworker to coach him. The call runs a few more minutes and we say goodbye. Our next applicant calls himself “Nic.” On his résumé he's got a link to a personal website, but this guy doesn't look much like the profile photo on the site. This is his second interview with Wijckmans, and we are certain that he's faking it: He's one of the applicants who failed the background check after his first call, although he doesn't know that. “Political leaders ... government officials or the agencies responsible for border security,” Nic says. I'm swapping messages with Wijckmans on the back channel we've set up when it dawns on us: Whatever AI bot Nic seems to be using must have misinterpreted a mention of “Border Gateway Protocol”—a system for sending traffic across the internet—with national borders, and started spewing verbiage about immigration enforcement. I try to put myself in the seat of a hiring manager or screener who's under pressure. The fraudsters' words may not have always made sense, but their test scores and résumés looked solid, and their technical-sounding guff might be enough to fool an uninformed recruiter. I suspect at least one of them could have made it to the next step in some unsuspecting company's hiring process. As soon as they hit the button to start the test, their browser will spawn dozens of pop-up pages that bounce around the screen, all of them featuring information on how to defect from North Korea. Wijckman's stunt is not going to stop the pretenders, of course. But maybe it will irritate them for a moment. Then they'll get back to work, signing on from some hacking sweatshop in China or through a laptop farm in the US, and join the next team meeting—a quiet, camera-off chat with coworkers just like me or you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple “willfully chose not to comply” with a court order to loosen its app store restrictions—and one of its executives lied under oath about the company's plans, a federal judge wrote on Wednesday. This included Apple's policy of taking a 30 percent commission on certain in-app purchases. Apple responded by lowering its commission to 27 percent on purchases made elsewhere, but it also introduced a series of other changes, including showing so-called scare screens, to dissuade users from making purchases outside its ecosystem. Apple pursued its noncompliance strategy “with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. “That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.” “In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” Gonzalez Rogers said. She went as far as accusing Alex Roman, a vice president of finance at Apple, of lying during testimony in which he talked about how Apple came to its decision to go with a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store. “We strongly disagree with the decision,”  Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement to WIRED. Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citing internal Apple documents from 2023, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple's App Store chief Phillip Schiller “had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction” but that CEO Tim Cook “ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.” The judge demanded that Apple immediately comply with her earlier order. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X that the new ruling would bring an end to “Apple's 15-30% junk fees.” Update 4/30/25 10:00 ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.
