                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Difficulty finding words or the habit of substituting them with others that are similar semantically – such as knife and cutter – or phonologically – such as knife and wife – are usually the first symptoms of a type of dementia known as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Another sign is a subtle difficulty in forming sentences, evidenced by verbal and nominal agreement errors that have never been made before, or reversal of word order, for example. Primary progressive aphasia is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose neurodegenerative disease that begins with language problems that affect communication and progresses to more serious cognitive changes that may resemble Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. The neurological diagnosis of this dementia syndrome requires a complete analysis that includes other cognitive functions in addition to language and communication problems. Now, a study supported by FAPESP and published in the journal PLOS ONE has shown that this condition can be detected early using a set of speech and hearing tests known as the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Battery (MTL-BR). But of course we're not talking about a complete diagnosis, just a part of the assessment that can allow us to identify patients who need more monitoring and attention." Karin Zazo Ortiz, professor in the Department of Speech and Hearing Therapy at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) in Brazil and corresponding author of the article In the study, the researchers evaluated 87 individuals, including 29 diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and 58 healthy individuals matched for age and educational level. "We compared the performance of participants with and without the syndrome on a large number of tasks involving different linguistic processes. As this is a very comprehensive and complete battery, the researcher says that identifying the key tests can help simplify the assessment, making preliminary detection quicker and more accessible. Ortiz explains that the battery of tests was chosen as the object of study because it provides a broad assessment of oral (speech) and written comprehension and production, as well as being the only validated test in Brazil for acquired language disorders of neurological origin. The partial or total loss of the ability to understand and express spoken or written language came into the spotlight in 2022 when Hollywood actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with aphasia, which later developed into frontotemporal dementia. In the same year, Brazilian cartoonist Angeli announced that he was quitting his job because of the syndrome. Primary progressive aphasia is a different condition from aphasia, which can arise as a result of strokes, brain tumors and traumatic brain injuries. PPA belongs to the group of diseases known as dementias. Nevertheless, PPA is difficult to diagnose, mainly because the initial symptoms can be very similar to those of other dementia syndromes – although language impairment is much greater in relation to other cognitive domains. To further complicate diagnosis, there are four subtypes of PPA. One is non-fluent or agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, which is characterized by changes in the syntactic structure of sentences, difficulty understanding complex sentences, and may be accompanied by apraxia of speech, in which the patient makes speech errors due to motor planning deficits. Another variant is semantic primary progressive aphasia, which is characterized by difficulty understanding words due to semantic impairment, anomia, and difficulty reading and writing irregular words. Logopenic primary progressive aphasia is considered to be more similar to Alzheimer's dementia and in these cases the patient has difficulty understanding long content and commits exchanges and omissions of sounds in speech. There is also mixed or unclassifiable PPA, characterized by language alterations in which a specific language profile cannot be identified because either the patients do not have the characteristics predicted for one of the variants or they have characteristics of several of the variants, making it difficult to specifically diagnose one of them. "And it's in this sense that our study contributes to diagnosis, as it allows early identification of changes in language, highlighting the differences between primary progressive aphasia and other dementia syndromes," says Ortiz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reduced levels of a critical protein are linked to devastating brain diseases like Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Called endothelial cells, they play a vital role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. When endothelial cells lack enough TDP-43 protein, they don't stick together as tightly. This creates gaps in the blood vessel walls, allowing large or toxic molecules to leak into the brain. The resulting damage may play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS. To look more closely at this, the researchers used a mouse model carrying a TARDBP mutation known to be associated with both ALS and frontotemporal dementia. They also used a second model with genetically modified mice that deleted the protein TDP-43 only from endothelial cells, not other cells in the brain. Both mouse models showed clear signs of blood-brain barrier breakdown, brain inflammation, and behavioral deficits. This adds to the growing body of evidence that the defects in TDP-43 first observed in neurons of patients with ALS and frontotemporal dementia are also found in other cells of the brain. This may explain the varied presentations of these diseases. ALS is primarily defined by increasing paralysis, while frontotemporal dementia involves cognitive impairment. But in many cases the two overlap. Understanding cell-type specific vulnerabilities is likely to provide answers to the complex human presentations of these diseases. It may also shed light on less genetically linked diseases, like Alzheimer's, where TDP-43 dysfunction is also observed. And although genetic mutations seem to play a role in some of these devastating brain diseases, they don't tell the whole story. "While some people with ALS or frontotemporal dementia carry mutations in the TDP-43 protein, most patients do not-yet the protein still becomes dysfunctional in nearly all cases. This tells us that other unknown factors in the body might be causing TDP-43 disfunction," says School of Medicine researcher Ashok Cheemala. Cheemala and UConn School of Medicine biologist Patrick Murphy and their colleagues are working on finding other genes that might limit TDP-43 dysfunction. Brain blood vessels are in constant contact with neurons and support cells like astrocytes. "By discovering how TDP-43 becomes harmful and spreads, we hope to uncover new ways to protect the brain, preserve the blood-brain barrier, and stop the progression of diseases like ALS, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's," Murphy says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children with low vitamin D levels face a greater risk of early heart disease, according to a decades-long Finnish study. Could early supplementation shift the tide on cardiovascular prevention? Their findings suggest that low childhood vitamin D levels are independently associated with the development of early-onset ASCVD in adulthood. This research may identify an important early-life risk marker for cardiovascular disease, informing targeted prevention efforts. Previous observational studies in adults have shown that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In an earlier paper, this team of Finnish researchers found that low vitamin D levels in childhood correlated with higher intima-media thickness of the carotid artery in adults. If the plaque bursts, it could lead to blood clots. Due to these mechanisms, vitamin D deficiencies could increase the risk of heart disease. However, it remains unclear whether low vitamin D levels during childhood could predict actual cardiovascular events in adulthood. Researchers examined whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in childhood are associated with ASCVD. The hypothesis is grounded in emerging evidence that early-life exposures may affect long-term cardiovascular health. Given that vitamin D influences vascular and inflammatory pathways, this study aimed to investigate its potential role as an early-life risk marker for later cardiovascular events. Serum 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations were assessed in 2010 using frozen serum samples originally collected in 1980, when participants were between 3 and 18 years old. The average childhood vitamin D level was 51.3 nmol/L, with a mean age at baseline of 10.5 years. Childhood measurements also included body mass index (BMI), lipid levels (specifically low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoproteins [HDL], and triglycerides), blood pressure, dietary habits, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and physical activity. A total of 95 participants (2.7%) experienced at least one ASCVD event, with a median age at onset of 47 years. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations between different cut-off levels of childhood vitamin D and ASCVD risk in adulthood, adjusting for sex, age, and other conventional early-life risk factors. The study specifically analyzed several thresholds (cut-points) of vitamin D levels—31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, and 43 nmol/L—to assess which concentrations were most strongly associated with future ASCVD events. Researchers found that low levels of 25-OH-vitamin D during childhood were significantly associated with a higher risk of adult-onset ASCVD events. Specifically, having childhood vitamin D levels below 31, 33, 35, or 37 nmol/L was linked to an increased risk of ASCVD in adulthood. For example, children with vitamin D levels below 35 nmol/L had more than double the risk of developing ASCVD compared to those with higher levels (hazard ratio, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.30–3.69]; adjusted for multiple risk factors). These associations remained significant even after adjusting for numerous childhood risk factors, including BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, diet, and physical activity. These associations remained consistent in additional analyses, including propensity score matching and adjusting for adult vitamin D levels. Nearly one-fifth of the cohort had vitamin D levels below 37 nmol/L during childhood. The results suggest that suboptimal vitamin D status in early life is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk decades later, independent of other known risk factors. The study also explored potential mechanisms, noting that vitamin D receptors are present throughout the vascular system and that vitamin D's active form may help reduce inflammation, regulate blood pressure, and slow vascular aging, all of which could influence long-term cardiovascular health. This study suggests that low levels of vitamin D in childhood are independently associated with early-onset ASCVD in adulthood, highlighting a potential early-life risk marker for cardiovascular disease. The findings support current recommendations for maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in children and could inform preventive strategies. The study's strengths include a large, population-based cohort with long-term follow-up, robust health registry data, and a comprehensive assessment of childhood cardiovascular risk factors. However, limitations include potential measurement error from using serum samples stored for 30 years, though vitamin D is relatively stable under such conditions. The cohort was ethnically homogenous (white Europeans), limiting generalizability. Also, at follow-up, the participants were still relatively young, and many had not yet reached the ages at which ASCVD becomes more prevalent, warranting continued observation. Additionally, the study's observational nature precludes establishing a direct causal relationship between childhood vitamin D levels and subsequent cardiovascular events. In conclusion, the study provides early-life evidence linking vitamin D status with adult cardiovascular health. Optimizing vitamin D intake during childhood may offer a low-cost and easily implemented strategy for reducing long-term ASCVD risk; however, further research, including randomized trials, will be needed to confirm causality and refine recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the global population ages, supporting older adults in maintaining their cognitive and memory functions has become a pressing concern. This demographic shift is especially pronounced in Japan, the fastest-aging country, where 28.7% of the population is 65 or older. One promising strategy to counter cognitive decline is through olfactory stimulation-engaging the sense of smell. Smell signals travel directly to brain regions involved in memory and emotion. Building on this knowledge, a joint research team from Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), University of the Arts London, Bunkyo Gakuin University, and Hosei University, Japan, has developed the world's first cognitive training method for older adults by combining olfactory stimulation with virtual reality (VR). By combining goal-oriented tasks with real-time feedback, our VR-based olfactory training approach can increase cognitive engagement and maximize its therapeutic impact." The method involves an olfactory display that emits specific scents during immersive VR gameplay, activating memory- and emotion-related brain regions. In the activity, participants are asked to memorize and later match scents within a virtual environment. The experience begins in a virtual landscape. Participants then explore the virtual landscape to locate a scent source. Upon reaching the odor source, shown as a stone lantern, they encounter three colored vapor clouds, each emitting a different scent. "The smell memory phase strengthens odor recognition and memory encoding by linking the olfactory stimulus with a visual cue. The navigation phase challenges players to integrate spatial navigation with odor recognition while retaining memory of the initial scent. The final odor comparison phase engages olfactory discrimination and working memory retrieval, reinforcing cognitive function," explains Nakamoto. After just 20 minutes of playing the VR game, participants showed improvements in visuospatial rotation and memory. Visuospatial processing and cognitive function were assessed through different tasks. In the Hiragana Rotation Task, where they had to decide if rotated Japanese characters matched the original, scores improved from 19–82 to 29–85. In a word-based spatial memory recall task, where participants memorized word positions in a grid, scores rose from 0­–15 to 3–15. With continued research and development toward more affordable olfactory displays or alternate scent delivery methods, olfactory-based VR activities could become an accessible and engaging tool for supporting mental health in older adults. Exploring the effects of olfactory VR on visuospatial memory and cognitive processing in older adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GVN, comprised of 80+ Virology Centers of Excellence and Affiliates in 40+ countries, whose mission is to facilitate pandemic preparedness against viral pathogens and diseases that threaten public health globally, believes that systemic inadequacies and vulnerabilities persist, which threaten public health on a global scale. According to research by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank presented to the Group of Twenty (G20), or international forum of major economies, in 2022, an estimated USD $31.1 billion in annual funding is required to establish a comprehensive Pandemic Preparedness and Response (PPR) system. This falls at least USD $10.5 billion short of what is needed today to meet global preparedness requirements. To close this gap, urgent focus must be placed on strengthening systems that protect humanity from future, inevitable pandemic threats. Past pandemics have shown that failing to invest in sustainable health infrastructure can devastate healthcare systems, economies, and societies. Moreover, the reductions in global health programs and grant funding have led to major setbacks in pandemic preparedness. Without stable and reliable funding, the world risks losing hard-won progress in disease surveillance, research, training, and emergency response capabilities. As evidenced by the ongoing avian influenza (H5N1) outbreak, and described in GVN's Lancet Regional Health-Americas publication, which was published Monday, mutations and genetic reassortment, where two influenza viruses combine, pose a significant risk of increased transmissibility and mortality, and the potential emergence of another global pandemic. These risks are further exacerbated by inadequate biosafety measures and the absence of a robust, coordinated global surveillance system capable of detecting and responding to such threats in real time. Strengthening partnerships with global health organizations, governments, and the scientific community remains essential in addressing cross-border health challenges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background and goal: Many adults aged 65 and older never receive a cognitive check during regular primary care visits. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a digital cognitive assessment for Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening into primary care. Study approach: From June 2022 to May 2023, seven Indiana University Health clinics offered the five-minute Digital Clock & Recall test on an iPad to every patient 65 and older. Each site set its own rules on which visit types and which staffers would run the screen and upload results to the electronic record for the physician to review. In month three, researchers introduced a registered-nurse role to support patients for completing care pathways if they were flagged for cognitive impairment. Of the 16,708 patients identified as eligible for screening, a total of 1,808 digital cognitive assessments (10.8%) were completed by 1,722 unique patients. More than one-half (55.3%) of eligible visits never offered the digital cognitive assessment because PCPs declined or the encounter was deemed out of scope. During follow-up within 90 days for the impaired group, 2.1% received a new Alzheimer or related-dementia diagnosis. Additionally, 5.1% received a new mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, 16.9% had brain imaging ordered, and 62.7% were referred to the brain health navigator. Why it matters: Digital cognitive assessments may offer a feasible way to screen older adults during routine visits, helping identify those who may benefit from early diagnosis, treatment, and care planning.

Study approach: In this cross-sectional pilot study, researchers examined two groups of women aged 18 to 49 who were considering pregnancy. The first group included 100 women already scheduled for an echocardiogram. The second group of women with no indication for an echocardiogram were seen at a primary care appointment for routine care. All participants received two tests: a standard 10-second 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and a digital stethoscope recording that captured a 15-second, single-lead ECG and phonocardiogram (heart sounds) from up to three locations on the chest. AI models analyzed the ECG and stethoscope recordings to estimate each participant's risk of having left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), a type of heart dysfunction. Group 1 (diagnostic cohort, women scheduled for echocardiograms): Group 2 (screening cohort, women seen during routine primary care visits): Using the AI-ECG, only 1% of women in this low-risk sample screened positive. Why it matters: The findings from this study highlight the potential of quick, low-cost AI tools to help detect early signs of heart dysfunction during regular primary care visits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite a global surge in plant-based eating, a new review reveals that most studies still lack consistent definitions and validated tools to assess plant-based food diversity, thereby undermining efforts to link these diets to health outcomes. Review: Diversity of Plant-Based Food Consumption: A Systematic Scoping Review on Measurement Tools and Associated Health Outcomes. In a recent scoping review published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, researchers at King's College London, United Kingdom, conducted a systematic scoping review to investigate the definitions, assessment tools, methodologies, and health outcomes assessed in previous studies on plant-based diet diversity. The review focused on research conducted in high-income countries and identified 43 eligible studies, 88% (38/43) of which were observational in design. Plant-based foods are any dietary components derived from plant sources, including grains, herbs, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. The oils extracted from plants and beverages, which use plant products as their primary constituents, also fall under this category. Studies on plant-based foods have highlighted their health benefits, including a reduced risk of all-cause mortality associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which has triggered a surge in their global consumption. Reports estimate a 60% increase over just three years, between 2017 and 2020. Several national and international guidelines now recommend incorporating a variety of plant-based foods into a balanced human diet. Unfortunately, despite decades of research in the field, no standard definition for ‘plant-based food diversity' exists. The aforementioned dietary guideline recommendations primarily recommend consuming fruits and vegetables, and omit other plant-derived food sources. Furthermore, standardized methodologies and validated assessment tools for measuring plant-based food consumption and subsequent health outcomes are also lacking, potentially resulting in reduced study reliability and complicating comparisons between independent works. The present scoping review has four primary objectives concerning previous plant-based foods publications: 1. to identify the definitions of plant-based foods; 2. to identify variations in assessment tools employed; 3. to characterize the methodologies used; 4. to elucidate the findings (health outcomes) of previous works. Study data (publications) were obtained from Web of Science and Medline using a custom search strategy, encompassing all publications in these online repositories from the databases' inception until October 2022. Study inclusion eligibility criteria were designed using the Patient, Exposure, Comparators, Outcome, and Study Design (PECOS) approach and included observations or intervention studies reporting measurements, effects, or health-related outcomes of plant-based food consumption. Studies were restricted to high-income countries (as classified by the World Bank) to ensure a homogeneous sample population. Potential publications were manually screened for eligibility through a cascade of title, abstract, and full-text reviews. Data extraction comprised study design, population characteristics, methodology, dietary assessment tools (if available), diversity assessment tools (if available), and health outcomes. Review syntheses were both qualitative and descriptive in nature. Per-study sample cohorts ranged from 63 to 452,269 participants across the USA, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. An assessment of the definition of plant-based foods in studies revealed that almost three-fourths (74%) restricted the definition to comprise only fruits and vegetables, 12% included grains, and 7% included cereals. Only one study extended the definition to grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. None of the studies explicitly included herbs, spices, plant-based oils, or plant-derived beverages in their definitions. The three dedicated diversity indices (VIC, FAVI, FAVVA) were validated against food and nutrient intakes or dietary assessment tools; however, none were specifically validated for measuring plant-based food diversity itself—a subtle but important distinction. The durations of plant-based food diversity assessments varied substantially between studies, ranging from 24 hours to three months. Measurements of plant-based food diversity were similarly varied, with 59% of studies restricting their dietary assessments to only plant-based dietary components, while 40% included non-plant-based foods as well. For those studies that included non-plant foods in their diversity assessment, plant-based diversity scores were typically reported separately. Only three studies utilized dedicated dietary assessment tools, and although these were validated against dietary intake or nutrient biomarkers, none were specifically validated for assessing the diversity of plant-based foods. “Due to the variation in definitions, methods of measurement, and reporting of plant-based diversity outlined above, it is challenging to compare levels of diversity and subsequent associations with health outcomes, across studies.” The present review highlights significant methodological limitations in previous research on plant-based foods, underscored by a lack of consensus in the definitions of ‘plant-based foods' and ‘plant-based food diversity.' Glaring methodological limitations, particularly in measurement and assessment, were also observed, which prevented comparisons between studies and reduced the robustness of their findings regarding health outcomes. “While the impact of plant-based food diversity has been investigated for several health outcomes, findings are limited by contradicting evidence and the limitations in study designs. These, in combination with the increased interest in plant-based food diversity among the general population, highlight the urgent need to improve assessment and reporting of plant-based food diversity.” Hugo Francisco de Souza is a scientific writer based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
