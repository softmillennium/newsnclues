            Venezuela is demanding that a 2-year-old girl be returned to her family after the United States deported her parents and kept the toddler in government custody.
    


            The Venezuelan foreign ministry on Monday accused the US of “kidnapping” Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, saying she was separated from her mother as she was boarding a deportation flight back to Venezuela.
    


            It also said the girl's father, Maiker Espinoza-Escalona, had been deported earlier by the US to a notorious prison in El Salvador.
    


            “(The US) once again committed the extremely serious offense of separating families and removing a minor from her emotional environment and, in particular, from her biological mother,” read a statement from the Venezuelan government on Monday.
    


            The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied it kidnapped the girl, arguing it was trying to protect her from her parents, whom it accused without evidence of being part of Tren de Aragua (TDA), a Venezuelan gang the US has designated a terror organization.
    


            The father believes he was accused of being a gang member because he has tattoos, but he denies they have anything to do with gangs, according to his sworn declaration filed in court in early March. CNN has asked Maikelys' mother, Yorely Escarleth Bernal Inciarte, about the allegation.

            In a Saturday statement, DHS said the toddler was removed from a deportation flight list “for her safety and welfare.” She remains in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and has been placed with a foster family, it added.
    


            The toddler is one of several children to have been affected by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Last week, three US citizen children — including a 4-year-old with metastatic cancer — were taken to Honduras with their undocumented mothers as the women were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. White House border czar Tom Homan said the US removed the children because their mothers “requested” they stay with them rather than remain in the country.
    


            It's unclear if Maikelys' mother was given the choice to be deported with her daughter.
    


            When asked for more information, DHS referred CNN to the statement it released on Saturday. CNN has also reached out to ORR for details on Maikelys' case.
    


            The toddler and her parents entered the US in May 2024 to seek asylum, according to a court document filed by legal advocacy groups.
    


            Maiker – who received a deportation order last July under the Biden administration – said in his declaration that he and his partner were put in immigration detention while their daughter was placed in the custody of ORR. Between October and March, the couple had weekly, in-person visits with their daughter, Maiker stated. CNN has reached out to his attorneys for details about his detention and deportation order.
    


            On March 29, Maiker was sent to a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where DHS has transferred migrants, according to court documents filed by his lawyers.
    


            They said he was flown the following day to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison, which the US is using to detain hundreds of Venezuelan migrants it accuses of being violent gang members, though it hasn't provided strong evidence to back that claim.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Salvadoran government for more information on this case but has not yet received a response.
    


            The toddler's mother was deported soon after Maiker was sent to El Salvador. She was forced to return to her country on a flight without her 2-year-old child, Venezuela said.
    


            The girl was kept in ORR custody, with DHS saying, “We will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal activity that endangers her safety.”
    


            Without providing evidence, it alleged in Saturday's statement that the father was a TDA lieutenant who oversaw various crimes including homicides and trafficking, and that the mother oversaw the recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and prostitution.
    


            Venezuela accused the US of violating international law and said it would take all legal and diplomatic measures to secure the girl's return.
    


            Its government demanded the “immediate release” of the child and “that the rule of law and the basic rights of our little girl be restored.”
    


            It cited the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states in part that children should not be separated from their parents against their will unless such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.  The US has signed the convention but has not ratified it.
    


            CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on Venezuela's accusations.
    


            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro insists the US is unjustly holding the child. He announced that a march intended for International Workers' Day on May 1 would become a rally to demand her release.
    


            “I ask for the full support of the Venezuelan people in the effort we are going to make to rescue this kidnapped girl and to bring back safe and sound — sooner rather than later — the 252 Venezuelans kidnapped in El Salvador,” he said in Caracas Monday, referring to the Venezuelan migrants the US has deported to the Salvadoran prison.

Follow:


            Syria strongly condemned foreign intervention in the country following a rare Israeli strike near Damascus on Wednesday amid deadly sectarian violence.
    


            Syria said the Israeli strike killed at least one security officer and injured several other people.
    


            Earlier on Wednesday Israel's military said it had carried out a strike on the outskirts of the Syrian capital saying it was targeting an “extremist group” that had attacked the Druze community, a religious minority in the country.
    


            In a joint statement on Wednesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said the operation in the town of Sahnaya, southwest of Damascus, was a “warning action” against an unidentified armed group “preparing to continue attacking the Druze population.”
    


            Syria's foreign ministry reacted saying it had an “unwavering commitment” to protecting all Syrian people, including the “honorable Druze community.”
    


            According to Syria's state news agency SANA, government forces launched a wide-scale operation in the area surrounding Sahnaya to arrest “outlawed gangs” after an unidentified armed group attacked a Syrian government checkpoint late Tuesday, wounding three officers.
    


            Other groups simultaneously opened fire on civilian and security vehicles in nearby areas. Recent violence left at least 11 people dead and dozens injured.
    


            On Thursday, top Syrian Druze leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri called for the “immediate intervention” of international peacekeeping forces “for the swift protection of an innocent, defenseless population.” He described the violence against his community as a “campaign of extermination” carried by what he described as Syrian government “affiliated extremist gangs.”
    


            Without referring to Hijri's statement, Syria's foreign ministry immediately rejected calls for foreign interference.
    


            “Any call for foreign intervention – under any pretext or slogan – only leads to further deterioration and division,” the ministry said in a statement. “Those who call for such intervention bear historical, moral, and political responsibility before the Syrian people and history itself.”
    


            Foreign interventions, it added, “are often pursued at the expense of national interests and serve agendas unrelated to the aspirations of the Syrian people.”
    


            Syria's top Sunni-Muslim cleric Osama al-Rifai has called on all Syrians to keep calm and not escalate the situation.
    


            “Everyone must… stay away from calls for revenge and retaliation, and allow justice to take its course,” Rifai said regarding the “recent events,” in Sahnaya, in a statement on Wednesday as cited by SANA.
    


            Two local journalists in Damascus told CNN on condition of anonymity due to security concerns that the clashes in Sahnaya broke out between fighters loyal to the Syrian government and militiamen from the Druze minority.

In Netanyahu's new Middle East, Syria could become Israel's biggest strategic gain



Since the fall of the Bashar Al Assad regime, Israel has positioned itself as the protector of Syria's Druze, an Arab community that follows an offshoot of Islam and is predominantly present across Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Wary of a new regime led by former jihadists, a small minority of Druze have welcomed Israel's overtures, but many others have publicly denounced them.
    


A sizeable number of Druze live within Israel's internationally recognized borders, have Israeli citizenship and serve in its military. A large Syrian-Druze population is also present in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and most have rejected Israeli citizenship and do not traditionally serve in the Israeli military. Within Syria, many Druze live in the south of the country, parts of which Israel declared a buffer zone after Assad's fall.
    


            “On this Memorial Day for Israel's fallen soldiers, as we honor the Druze community's contribution to Israel's security, we stress our commitment to protect their brethren in Syria,” the joint statement added.
    


            Israeli officials also urged the Syrian government to prevent harm to the Druze community.
    


            On Wednesday evening, the Israeli military said that three Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated into Israel for medical treatment after they were injured in Syria.
    


            The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen has expressed his deep concern “at unacceptable violence in Syria especially in suburbs of Damascus,” and ” alarmed at reports of Israeli attacks,” in a statement on Wednesday
    


            ” These attacks must stop,” Pedersen said and called for “full respect of Syria's sovereignty.”
    


            The situation on the ground remains volatile, with residents telling CNN that Sahnaya continues to witness sporadic clashes and intermittent attacks by unidentified local groups involving mortar fire and medium-caliber machine guns. Efforts by government officials and community mediators to de-escalate are ongoing, multiple residents in the area told CNN.

India has closed its airspace to all Pakistan-linked aircraft, including military flights, as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors continue to mount following a deadly terrorist attack in the Indian-administrated Jammu and Kashmir.

The move comes in response to last week's decision by Islamabad to bar Indian-owned or operated airlines from Pakistani airspace.

A Notice to Air Missions, which was published by New Delhi on Wednesday, said: “Indian airspace [is] not available to Pakistan registered aircraft and aircraft operated or leased by Pakistan airlines. These include military flights.”

The announcement means that India and Pakistan have now blocked their airspace to each other until at least May 23.

The only Pakistani carrier currently operating routes through India is Pakistan International Airlines, which flies to Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.

The escalation between India and Pakistan started after the April 22 terrorist attack in India's Jammu and Kashmir federal territory, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists.

New Delhi blamed the incident on Islamabad, accusing the neighboring country's government of supporting cross-border terrorism and insurgency. Islamabad denied the allegations, calling for an impartial investigation into the incident and accusing New Delhi of backing “terrorist networks” operating on Pakistani soil.

The two countries have a long-standing dispute over Kashmir, which is de facto divided by the Line of Control established after the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.

Since the attack, India has ordered the expulsion of all Pakistanis from the country, the closure of the border between the two nations, and the suspension of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty. Pakistan responded by suspending all bilateral trade, including through third countries, halting special South Asian visas issued to Indian nationals, along with other tit-for-tat measures.

Wall Street Journal article saying headhunters were contacted is ‘absolutely false', says company chair

Tesla has denied a report that its board sought to replace Elon Musk as its chief executive amid a backlash against his rightwing politics and declining car sales.

Robyn Denholm, the chair of the board at the electric carmaker, said in a statement on Tesla's social media account on X: “Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company.

“This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.”

It followed a Wall Street Journal story published on Wednesday that claimed “board members” had contacted headhunters to recruit a successor about a month ago.

The reported move came as tensions grew at Tesla around falling profits and criticism of Musk for spending much of his time in Washington, where he has been helping Donald Trump slash federal spending as de facto head of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

It is unclear in the report whether these members were acting on behalf of the board as a collective, or if it was only some of them taking steps to find a new chief executive. The Tesla board is made up of eight people, including Elon Musk himself, his brother, Kimbal Musk, and James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

Tesla has been hit by a widespread backlash against Musk's recent political activity, not only against his Doge work, but also his public support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party before German national elections in February. Sales of the electric car have dropped in some of its biggest markets and there have been political protests at some of its showrooms.

Last week, the company reported that profits had dropped by 71% in the first quarter of this year to $409m (£307m), compared with $1.39bn in the same period in 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock has suffered, with the company losing about a quarter of its market value this year.

Musk told investors that starting from May he would be “allocating far more of my time to Tesla”. He is scheduled to leave his government role on 30 May, according to a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.

There have long been concerns around the demands on Musk's time. As well as Tesla, he oversees four other companies, including the space exploration company SpaceX and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Musk denounced the Wall Street Journal report on X on Thursday. He wrote: “It is an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS that the @WSJ would publish a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Rich in solar and wind power, and bulging in critical minerals for renewable energy technology, Australia touts itself as a leader in the race to net zero carbon emissions, but a political battle is being waged ahead of tomorrow's elections over whether to change the nation's trajectory and add nuclear reactors to the mix for the first time.

The row is reminiscent of the “climate wars” — a years-long political face-off over the need to slash carbon emissions — that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowed to end when he took office three years ago.

Australia sits on some of the world's largest uranium reserves, but it has legally banned nuclear power generation for a quarter of a century.

In the run-up to the vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton announced a US$200 billion plan to build seven large-scale nuclear reactors by 2050.

His proposal would ramp up gas production, slow the rollout of solar and wind projects, and ditch the clean energy goals set by Albanese's government.

Dutton says nuclear power would be cheaper and more reliable than renewable energy.

“I haven't committed to nuclear energy for votes. I committed to it because it's in the best interest of our country,” he said in a televised leaders' debate.

Interest in nuclear power is growing internationally as nations struggle to cut their dependence on fossil fuels. Thirty-one governments, including the US, France and Britain, have signed a pledge to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

Australia is a fossil fuel powerhouse with vast reserves of coal and gas, but it is also drenched in sun, with a broad landscape to accommodate wind turbines and solar panels.

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation estimates that the nuclear option would be 50 percent more expensive for the nation than renewable energy and take at least 15 years to become operational.

“The total development lead time needed for nuclear means it cannot play a major role in electricity sector emission abatement,” the government agency said.

Even countries with decades of experience in nuclear power generation struggle to get plants running on time and on budget.

France started its latest reactor, Flamanville 3, in December last year — 12 years behind schedule and about 10 billion euros (US$11 billion) beyond its original budget of 3 billion euros.

Albanese has embraced the global push toward decarbonization, pouring public money into the renewable sector.

The share of renewable energy in Australia's electricity generation has increased to record highs in the past few years, contributing 35 percent in 2023, government data showed.

The energy industry has largely backed a renewables-first pathway as coal-fired plants are retired.

“We are in a position now where coal-fired power stations are closing — and they have done a great job for a long time, but they are old and need to be replaced by something,” Clean Energy Council spokesman Chris O'Keefe said. “The best economic response for Australia right now is to continue on the path we are on. That is, building batteries, solar farms, wind farms.”

“What we are seeing is a situation where nuclear energy is being used as an idea to placate the fossil fuel industry and the people they have been traditionally aligned with, but the problem is it will not deliver a single electron for close to two decades,” O'Keefe said.

Dave Sweeney, nuclear power analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said switching the energy strategy now would cause “economic dislocation and rupture.”

“Why change horses from renewables when you are halfway there?” Sweeney said. “This is a 1950s piece of policy that is promoting a 1950s sense of technology.”

If Dutton's coalition wins the election, there would be strong community, local government and stakeholder pushback to nuclear reactors being built, Sweeney said.

“It would cause uncertainty, contest, fights and a lack of action around secure and clean energy. We would be back to hostile and conflict-fueled and unproductive climate and energy wars,” he said.

Still, nuclear supporters say the spotlight on the issue is long overdue.

“Our decades-old nuclear ban no longer reflects the realities of modern reactor technology or the shifting attitudes of Australians,” said Kirsty Braybon, a university academic and nuclear law expert at the Nuclear for Australia lobby group.

While other countries were moving ahead with nuclear, Australia was “held back by outdated prohibitions that stifle innovation, jobs and the chance to power a cleaner future,” she said.

“What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,” archeologist David Palomino said. 
The mummy was found in Aspero, a sacred site within the city of Caral that was a garbage dump for more than 30 years until becoming an archeological site in the 1990s.

Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.

Authorities said the incident happened shortly after 8pm in Vancouver's Sunset on Fraser neighborhood as members of the Filipino community gathered to celebrate Lapu Lapu Day.
The festival, which commemorates a Filipino anti-colonial leader from the 16th century, falls this year on the weekend before Canada's election.
A 30-year-old local man was arrested at the scene, Vancouver police wrote on X.
The driver was a “lone suspect” known to police, a police spokesperson told journalists at the

SOUTH KOREA

Warship prompts questions

North Korea's newly unveiled warship could have involved Russian help, Seoul's military said yesterday, while cautioning it was still conducting “a more detailed analysis.” Pyongyang recently unveiled a destroyer-class vessel named Choe Hyon that some analysts said could be equipped with short-range tactical nuclear missiles. Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun told reporters that Russia might have given help with the warship. “Looking at the weapons and equipment that were revealed, we believe that there is a possibility that they received technology, funds or assistance from Russia,” Lee said. “We are conducting a more detailed analysis.” Lee said its deployment is likely to require more time. “In the case of warships it takes several years to build and even after completion it takes additional time for them to become operational,” he said. “So although the Choe Hyon has been unveiled it seems likely that considerably more time will be needed for its [operational] deployment.”

Truce allowed to expire

The military junta let a truce declared to spur aid efforts after last month's earthquake expire yesterday, a ceasefire that monitors say it consistently violated with airstrikes. The March 28 magnitude 7.7 quake in the nation's central belt killed nearly 3,800 people and has left tens of thousands homeless as the summer monsoon season approaches. The junta declared a ceasefire on April 2 and extended it last week as aid groups warned of a long road to recovery. It expired at midnight on Wednesday, with the junta information team making no announcement of an extension.

Political killing ‘targeted'

The killing of a member of parliament, Charles Ong'ondo Were, in the capital, Nairobi, appeared to have been targeted, police said. Were was shot by a passenger on a motorbike late on Wednesday as he was in a car on the major Ngong Road, which runs through the capital, according to eyewitnesses cited in a police statement released hours afterward. “The nature of this crime appears to be both targeted and premeditated,” National Police Service spokesman Muchiri Nyaga said in the statement. After the gunman fled on the motorbike, the driver of the car rushed Were to Nairobi hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, Nyaga said. Neither the driver nor a male passenger, also in the car at the time of the incident, were hurt during the attack, the statement said. “At this stage, it is too early to provide further details,” Nyaga added.

World's oldest person dies

The world's oldest person, nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, died on Wednesday, the religious community she belonged to in the city of Porto Alegre said. She was 116. The title now passes to Ethel Caterham, a resident of Surrey, England, who is 115 years old, according to the US Gerontological Research Group and the LongeviQuest database. Born on June 8, 1908, Canabarro became the world's oldest person following the death in January of Japanese woman Tomiko Itooka, who was also 116. The Congregation of Teresian Sisters of Brazil announced Canabarro's death in a statement in which it gave thanks “for the dedication and devotion” she had shown in life. LongeviQuest said Canabarro had attributed her longevity to God and on her 110th birthday, received a blessing from Pope Francis, who himself died on Monday last week.



                                                                                Archeologists in Peru on Thursday said they found the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman at the sacred city of Caral, revealing the important role played by women in the oldest center of civilization in the Americas.
“What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,” archeologist David Palomino said. 
The mummy was found in Aspero, a sacred site within the city of Caral that was a garbage dump for more than 30 years until becoming an archeological site in the 1990s.
Palomino said the carefully preserved remains, dating to 3,000BC, contained skin, part of the                                    


TRUMP EFFECT: 
                                        The win capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history after the Conservatives had led the Liberals by more than 20 points                                        Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney yesterday pledged to win US President Donald Trump's trade war after winning Canada's election and leading his Liberal Party to another term in power.
Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.
“We will win this trade war and

Many Americans have never heard of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). However, for decades, hundreds of millions of people around the world have relied on the outlets that USAGM funds — including Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and Radio Free Asia (RFA) — for accurate, unbiased news. That changed in March, when US President Donald Trump signed an executive order reducing the agency's operations to the legal minimum as part of a supposed cost-cutting effort. USAGM, in turn, terminated grants and contracts for all the international broadcasters under its umbrella, citing the order.

Thousands of journalists stand to lose their jobs, and access to verifiable reporting in some of the world's most politically repressive countries is at risk. This blow to the US' soft power has created an information void that authoritarian regimes are keen to exploit. For example, the Chinese and Cambodian governments have celebrated the dismantling of USAGM as an end to “biased propaganda poison” and “fake news,” underscoring the agency's role in combating misinformation.

While RFE/RL's funding has been restored following a federal judge's temporary ruling, RFA's annual budget of US$60.8 million remains in jeopardy. The Asian broadcaster won a court ruling ordering the funds to be disbursed, although that has not happened yet.

This would have far-reaching consequences. Despite its relatively limited budget, RFA has long served as a vital source of uncensored news for its 60 million weekly readers and listeners. Operating in environments where press freedom is absent or under siege, RFA is also often the only broadcaster exposing the realities of life under authoritarian rule. From providing early evidence of China's mass internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang to reporting on the civil war in Myanmar, RFA has consistently brought international attention to abuses that might otherwise have remained hidden.

Nowhere is RFA's impact more evident than in Cambodia, where the government has severely curtailed press freedom. For decades, outlets such as RFA and VOA have symbolized hope, and today they are among the few trusted news sources for Cambodians at home and abroad. In recent years, their operations have become more essential than ever against a backdrop of democratic deterioration: The Cambodian government has shuttered independent media, dissolved opposition parties and jailed dissenters.

The arrest of award-winning Cambodian journalist Mech Dara, known for his courageous reporting, and the blacklisting of British journalist Gerald Flynn for appearing in a climate documentary that the regime accused of spreading false information, are emblematic of this trend. However, through it all, RFA has continued to publish investigative reporting on everything from official corruption and cybercrime to the erosion of civil liberties.

The gutting of RFA is not simply a media story; it is also a geopolitical one. Across Southeast Asia, regimes with close ties to China increasingly rely on state-controlled narratives to suppress dissent. In Myanmar, where a 2021 military coup ushered in an era of violence and repression, RFA has provided crucial on-the-ground reporting that counters misinformation spread by the ruling junta. In the absence of such coverage, the atrocities being committed in Myanmar — and in other countries — would be concealed from view domestically and globally. Authorities would be able to act with impunity and pursue ever-more repressive tactics to enforce their rule.

Also at stake is the US' ability to project democratic values and its credibility in doing so. RFA, much like the BBC World Service or Deutsche Welle, has long functioned as a strategic instrument of soft power, supporting the free flow of information. This tool has arguably never been more important, as China expands its state media apparatus, including outlets such as CGTN and Xinhua, into countries where US influence is waning to promote its worldview.

Cambodia's increasing reliance on China — which accounts for nearly half of foreign direct investment in the country — underscores the shifting landscape of influence. Chinese-backed infrastructure projects, coupled with growing diplomatic alignment, have made Cambodia an increasingly loyal partner, while China has gained a presence at Ream Naval Base that could threaten regional security. Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) recent visit to Phnom Penh further cemented the relationship. For the US to abandon RFA would be tantamount to ceding yet another front in the global contest of ideas.

US Congress must act to prevent that outcome. Judicial freezes on Trump's executive order targeting USAGM are certainly welcome, but are only a temporary reprieve. Restoring RFA and funding it beyond the current fiscal year are much more important, especially for foreign policy objectives. US policymakers should also explore long-term independent funding mechanisms that could insulate RFA from political interference and ensure its durability.

Ultimately, the decision to sustain RFA is about more than budget lines. It is about whether the US remains committed to defending press freedom and supporting the journalists who risk their lives to expose corruption and abuse. At least two RFA Khmer journalists are facing deportation when their US visas expire. For them, returning to Cambodia would mean certain imprisonment. Equally importantly, the US must not abandon the millions of people who rely on RFA for accurate reporting in an era of heightened mistrust and upheaval.

The Associated Press

12:02 JST, May 1, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Donald Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda.

Trump announced the far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. Amid the uncertainty for both U.S. consumers and businesses, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years.

The 49-49 vote came weeks after the Senate approved a resolution that would have have thwarted Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage.

Democrats said their primary aim was to put Republicans on the record either way and to try to reassert congressional powers.

“The Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness,” said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a lead sponsor of the resolution.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the dismal economic numbers should be a “wakeup call” to Republicans.

Wary of a rebuke to Trump, GOP leaders encouraged their conference not to vote for the resolution, even as many of them remain unconvinced about the tariffs. Vice President JD Vance attended a Senate GOP luncheon Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who assured senators that the administration is making progress toward trade deals with individual countries.

Collins said the close vote “demonstrates that there is unease with the president's plan.”

“It's partially the president's plan is still evolving but many of us are hearing from employers back home about the impact of the tariffs in a negative way,” she said.

Some Republicans argued that the vote was a political stunt. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he backs separate legislation by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley that would give Congress increased power over determining tariffs but would voted on the resolution, which he said is only about “making a point.”

Several Republicans defended Trump's tariffs — and said they were willing to give him time to figure it out.

“People are willing to give the president an opportunity to prove that the new system works,” said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn said the vote shows that senators “believe that the President's policies deserve to be tried and see if they're successful.”

Democrats say the Republicans' failure to stand up to Trump could have dire consequences. “The only thing Donald Trump's tariffs have succeeded in is raising the odds of recession and sending markets into a tailspin,” said Schumer, D-N.Y. “Today, they have to choose – stick with Trump or stand with your states.”

The Democratic resolution forced a vote under a statute that allows them to try to terminate the national economic emergency Trump used to levy the tariffs.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it a “fake” emergency that Trump is using to impose his “on again, off again, red light, green light tariffs.”

The tariffs “are pushing our economy off a cliff,” Warren said.

Republicans held a procedural vote after the tied vote to ensure that Democrats could not bring the resolution up again, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters afterward. Vice President J.D. Vance came to the Capitol to break the tie and ensure they dismissed the resolution for good.

The Republican president has tried to reassure voters that his tariffs will not provoke a recession as his administration has focused on China, raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% even as he paused the others. He told his Cabinet Wednesday morning that his tariffs meant China was “having tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business.”

Trump said the U.S. does not really need imports from the world's dominant manufacturer. “Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” he said. “So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”

U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said on April 30 that he does not expect Washington to abandon peace efforts despite previous threats from the White House to do so.

""The Ukrainians have already said they're willing to give up the land... not de jure, forever, but de facto because the Russians actually occupy it... That's what they're willing to go to, they told me that last week,"" Kellogg said in a television interview with Fox News.

The U.S. has intensified efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on April 28 a temporary ceasefire from May 8 to 11, which Kellogg on April 29 criticized as ""absurd.""

""I don't think so,"" Kellogg said when asked if the U.S. is ready to walk away from peace talks to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

The U.S. has threatened to walk away from efforts to broker a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia if progress is not made.

""We had 22 concrete terms that (Ukraine) agreed to. What they want... and what they have is a very comprehensive and permanent ceasefire that leads to a peace treaty. When I mean comprehensive, sea, air, land infrastructure for at least 30 days... It could build to an important peace initiative,"" Kellogg said.

Kellogg noted a ceasefire should last at least 30 days, adding that it is what U.S. President Donald Trump believes should be done.

""The reason why 30 days is important is that it stops the killing. That's what President Trump wants to do,"" Kellogg said.

When asked if Putin would be willing to accept the ceasefire, Kellogg said it is ""up to"" the Russian leader.

""If (Putin) really wants to stop the killing, if he wants this war to end, there is a pathway to do it that has been presented to him,"" Kellogg said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump met in the Vatican on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral on April 26. Kellogg described the meeting as positive.

""I think it was a very positive discussion, in fact, what the Ukrainians told me was very constructive,"" Kellogg said.

The U.S. could partially agree to Russia's maximalist demands towards Ukraine to reach a settlement, the special envoy said.

""People don't understand how violent this war has been. Soldiers alone, when you combine the Ukrainian and Russian soldiers killed and wounded, were over 1.2 million, that is an unheard of number,"" Kellogg said.

U.S., U.K., German, French, and Ukrainian officials met in London on April 23 to discuss a path toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms. So far, Moscow has refused.

Zelensky has repeatedly called for a full 30-day ceasefire, saying on April 23, Ukraine insists on an ""immediate, full, and unconditional ceasefire.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

After months of turbulent negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine finally signed a long-anticipated minerals agreement in Washington on April 30.

U.S. officials framed the agreement as a sign of lasting support for Ukraine, and it comes amid an apparent resetting of relations between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.

Previous iterations of the deal were viewed by many to be exploitative of Ukraine's natural resources, state institutions, and infrastructure. The latest version appears to be much more favorable to Kyiv.

Ukraine will retain ""full control over subsoil, infrastructure, and natural resources,"" Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said shortly before the deal was signed, adding: ""The agreement does not provide for any debt obligations.""

But the agreement provides no concrete security guarantees to Ukraine. It instead affirms a ""long-term strategic alignment"" between the two nations and pledges U.S. ""support for Ukraine's security, prosperity, reconstruction, and integration into global economic frameworks.""

Below is the full text of the agreement signed on April 30 as released by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers.

U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is causing concern within the White House over his unconventional approach to high-stakes diplomacy with Russia and Iran, the New York Post reported on April 30, citing unnamed sources.

Witkoff, who has emerged as Trump's de facto personal envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and concurrently handles Middle East affairs, has participated in solo meetings with foreign leaders, bypassing typical diplomatic protocol, according to the report.

According to New York Post sources, Witkoff has even used Kremlin translators during discussions with Putin — a breach of standard U.S. diplomatic practice.

Another source described Witkoff as a ""nice guy, but a bumbling f***ing idiot,"" adding: ""He should not be doing this alone.""

Ahead of his April 25 meeting with Putin, Witkoff greeted the Russian president informally and without the customary entourage of advisers, military officials, or experts that typically accompany senior U.S. negotiators. 

In contrast, Putin was joined by his aide Yuri Ushakov and Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev.

Witkoff's posture has alarmed officials because he frequently echoes Putin's narratives while reportedly lacking a clear understanding of Ukraine's position. The role of special envoy for Ukraine remains assigned to Keith Kellogg.

Following an April 11 meeting with Putin in St. Petersburg, Witkoff said discussions focused on a potential peace deal concerning ""five territories."" 

Though he did not name them explicitly, he appeared to reference Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, which Moscow claimed in 2022. 

""I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very important for the world at large,"" Witkoff said in an April 14 interview with Fox News.

Beyond his role in the Ukraine-Russia negotiations, Witkoff has also been tasked with brokering Middle East ceasefires and revisiting the Iran nuclear deal. 

He helped secure a two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that began shortly before Trump's inauguration but was not extended. However, his limited diplomatic background has sparked doubts about his capacity to handle complex international negotiations.

""Steve Witkoff is simply someone Trump trusts,"" Alexandra Filippenko, a U.S.-Russia relations expert, told the Kyiv Independent. She noted their relationship dates back to the 1980s Manhattan real estate scene. ""Trump values that kind of loyalty,"" she said.

Filippenko emphasized that Witkoff's prominent role in such sensitive negotiations, despite operating outside the State Department, remains ""an unusual arrangement.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

After all the noise, all the threats to abandon Ukraine, Donald Trump finds himself in roughly the same place that Joe Biden did: frustrated with Moscow and seemingly willing to support Kyiv with weapons. At least for now.

The motivations of the two men, of course, were and are very different. Where Mr. Biden, whose politics were moulded in the Cold War, saw helping Ukraine fend off the Russian invasion as a matter of principle, Mr. Trump remains a businessman and a dealmaker. When Russian President Vladimir Putin proved unwilling to make the kind of peace agreement that Mr. Trump had believed was in easy reach, the U.S. President grabbed the deal that was available to him.

The U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal signed Wednesday does not commit the U.S. to any new weapons transfers, nor does it offer any explicit security guarantee. But, after months of Ukraine's stocks running low – no new U.S. military aid has been announced since Mr. Biden left office in January – it opens the door to a resumption of such help. 

The pact is a 50/50 revenue-sharing agreement, covering the development and production of Ukraine's natural resources. Fifty-five minerals, plus oil and natural gas, are named in the document, according to the European Pravda newspaper, which said it had seen the agreement.

For the first 10 years, all profits will be contributed to a U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction fund created by the agreement. Any future military aid provided by the U.S. will be counted toward its 50-per-cent share of the fund.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday that the deal was a signal to the “Russian leadership that there is no daylight between the Ukrainian people and the American people, between our goals.”

In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Bessent described the deal as “a total economic partnership. This isn't just rare earth, it's infrastructure, it's energy. So there's the opportunity here for both sides to really win.”

Writing on social media, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the pact “an important milestone in Ukraine–US strategic partnership aimed at strengthening Ukraine's economy and security.”

While the agreement is hardly good news for Ukraine – which until now had been receiving U.S. and other Western military aid for free – it's a far better deal than the one Mr. Trump had tried to push on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February, when the two men publicly clashed in the Oval Office.

Mr. Trump initially sought US$500-billion of Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for the military aid (actually valued at US$183-billion by the U.S. government's own figures) given by the Biden administration. When Mr. Zelensky balked, Mr. Trump lashed out, famously telling the Ukrainian President that he was being disrespectful and “gambling with World War Three.”

That Mr. Zelensky was able to rebuild his relationship with Mr. Trump from that nadir is a substantive diplomatic accomplishment, even if the deal is one Ukraine would rather not have had to sign.

“It could have been worse. This deal was never truly meant to be in Ukraine's interests. Trump needed it, yes, and so Ukraine had to play along,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, an associate professor of international relations at Mechnikov National University in Odesa. “That said, it has apparently unblocked the chance for Ukraine to purchase some weapons from the U.S., which is a good thing.”

The signing of Wednesday's pact also suggests that Mr. Trump has assessed, correctly, that it's Mr. Putin, not Mr. Zelensky, who is the main obstacle to a peace deal – and the Nobel Peace Prize that Mr. Trump is said to crave.

Opinion: The U.S. and Russia are both negotiating in bad faith

The Kremlin nonetheless attempted to portray the minerals deal as a defeat for Ukraine. “Trump has finally pressured [Ukraine] to pay for U.S. aid with mineral resources,” Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who now serves as deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said in remarks carried by the official TASS newswire. “The country that is about to disappear will have to use its national wealth to pay for military supplies.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to signal the end of months of U.S.-mediated peace efforts, saying the timelines set by Mr. Trump were unrealistic. Mr. Trump initially vowed that he could end the war “in 24 hours,” then said he would give the process 100 days – a milestone that passed earlier this week.

“We understand that Washington wants to achieve rapid success in this process, but at the same time we hope that there is an understanding that the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis is too complex. There are many questions and details that need to be resolved before the settlement,” Mr. Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday.

Mr. Peskov said Russia's war aims – which include the demilitarization and official neutrality of Ukraine, in additional to Moscow's claim to have annexed five Ukrainian regions – remained unchanged from the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. He added that any peace deal needed to be agreed “with Ukraine, not the United States.”

Wednesday's deal brought Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. back closer to how the situation stood before Mr. Trump's return to the White House, with the U.S. signalling it will resume its military partnership with Kyiv, and Moscow making it clear through its actions that the war will continue regardless.

Tuesday night saw yet another Russian barrage of 170 drones and five ballistic missiles targeting Ukrainian cities. Two people were killed and 15 were injured when explosive drones struck a residential area in the port city of Odesa, and two others were killed in a Russian air strike on the battered frontline city of Myrnohrad, in the Donetsk region. 

Meanwhile, seven people were killed, and 20 injured, when a Ukrainian drone reportedly struck a market in a Russian-occupied town in the southern Kherson region.

Both sides fight on, knowing the tempestuous Mr. Trump could set yet another new direction at any time.

The U.S. and Ukraine have announced an economic deal after a weekslong press by President Donald Trump on Ukraine compensate Washington for more billions in military and economic assistance to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion.

Julia Johnson, seen here at Wolf Willow Park in Edmonton, has joined outdoor clubs in retirement. 'I am in way better physical shape than when I was working,' she says.Kaeden Dupre/The Globe and Mail

In Tales from the Golden Age, retirees talk about their spending, savings and whether life after work is what they expected. For more articles in this series, click here.

Julia Johnson, 72, Edmonton

I retired in July, 2020, at 67 years old, after a career as a computer scientist, working mostly as a professor at different universities across Canada and the U.S. I took an exit sabbatical before officially retiring so I could move to Edmonton from Ontario to care for my mother, who had cancer. She died a few months later.

Retirement was difficult at first. I had mapped out a life in which I would care for my mother for about five years. Her death was unexpected. With no children of my own and no spouse, looking after my mother would have been enough to fill my days. But suddenly I had no mother and no job.

I've been able to stay occupied in retirement. I've been clean and sober for more than 30 years and am now actively involved in the Alcoholics Anonymous organization, including as editor of its Edmonton central office newsletter. I've found many friends through the organization; it is a fellowship. 

I also spend a lot of time outside and have joined several outdoor clubs. A river runs through the City of Edmonton with deep ravines, where I enjoy hiking. I also have a gym membership. I am in way better physical shape than when I was working. 

I don't worry about money in retirement. I have a university pension. I began receiving my Canada Pension Plan benefits upon retirement. I started receiving my Old Age Security benefits after turning 70; however, much of it is clawed back because of my other pensions and other income, including my registered retirement income fund. 

I have modest investments in my self-directed investment account and, after making some initial poor stock choices, my investments are increasing slowly.

I also live more modestly than I used to, especially after buying a house with my sister in Edmonton in August, 2023. I had previously lost money on real estate in Edmonton and on some of the properties I sold in Ontario. But after almost five years of grieving and emotional turmoil, I have begun to make better financial decisions.

I don't travel much in retirement. I travelled extensively for work across Asia and Europe, and used to visit my sister in Australia, where she lived for about five years. I enjoy gardening, cooking all my food from scratch and spending time with my sister and her family. She has four adult children, and it's fun keeping up with their careers in academia, law, nutrition and psychiatric social work. 

I'm grateful to be financially able to contribute to organizations and causes that do useful work, such as animal rescue, the Wikimedia Foundation for disseminating the truth as widely as possible, and media outlets that run counter to the mainstream. They ring truer to what makes sense to me. 

My advice to others considering retirement is to avoid making the decision because of pressure from family, unexpected events such as the pandemic, or emotional issues related to relationships. Please make sure your head is on straight when making such a significant life decision.

As told to Brenda Bouw

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","China lifts sanctions on MEPs in EU 'charm offensive'","https://www.dw.com/en/china-lifts-sanctions-on-meps-in-eu-charm-offensive/a-72357774","Thu, 01 May 2025 07:19:28 GMT","

Observers view China's easing of sanctions on MEPs as an effort to woo the EU amid the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs. But it's unlikely that a frozen investment deal will be revived.

They were just one of many bones of contention between the European Union and China: tit-for-tat Chinese sanctions targeting members of the European Parliament first imposed in 2021 after the EU slapped restrictions on Chinese officials the bloc held responsible rights abuses in Xinjiang.

The blacklist included sitting MEPs whom China accused of ""maliciously spread[ing] lies and disinformation."" The sanctions were the nail in the coffin for ill-fated trade and investment deal inked by the EU and China in late 2020.

But, with US President Donald Trump rewriting the global order and China appearing keen to capitalize on the fallout, changes were made.

""It has always been the European Parliament's intention to have sanctions lifted and resume relations with China,"" a European Parliament spokesperson told DW.

On Wednesday, the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, told members that Chinese sanctions on five members of the European Parliament and on the Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights had been lifted.

However, as a statement from the Parliament said, ""the lifting of sanctions does not mean the European Parliament will overlook persistent challenges in EU-China relations. Parliament will remain a strong defender of universal human rights and fundamental values worldwide while seeking to engage with global partners in a principled and clear-eyed manner.""

Last week it had still been unclear whether Beijing would halt all restrictions it imposed in 2021 — which impact several current MEPs, the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, an ex-lawmaker, and a number of national parliamentarians, think tanks and academics within the member states.

China's EU embassy did not respond to DW's request for comment, but lifting sanctions makes it easier for MEPs to travel to the country for future talks.

Miriam Lexmann, one of the sanctioned MEPs, previously told DW that any change would mean ""practically nothing"" for her work and vowed to continue her regular criticism of Beijing.

Before the lifting of sanctions was announced, experts said their removal would indicate a change in China's political tone.

""The move would fuel expectations of an EU-China detente ahead of a summit planned for July in Beijing,"" Noah Barkin, a consultant and visiting researcher with the German Marshall Fund, wrote in a blog post recently.

Trump's tariff policies have left EU officials feeling let down by the European Union's biggest historical ally and China on the lookout for new export markets as it grapples with duties of up to 145% on imports to the United States.

""After Trump's return, the Chinese have been on a charm offensive to convince global actors that they should look to China for a reliable partner,"" said Varg Folkman, an analyst with the European Policy Centre.

""The main goal of the Chinese in lifting sanctions is likely to pave the way for trade discussions with the EU,"" Folkman said.

Brussels is seeking more cooperation with Beijing to monitor trade flows and keep cheaper Chinese products from flooding into the European Union amid US-China tensions. But Folkman said there were ""significant constraints"" on any prospect of a broader rapprochement. Beijing's close ties to Moscow are among them.

China has long pushed to revive the trade and investment deal it signed with the EU in 2020 before the European Parliament froze its ratification the following year to protest Beijing's sanctions.

Folkman said China was now angling to unlock progress.

Sanctioned lawmaker Miriam Lexmann said she hoped that the deal was ""dead forever.""

And neither Barkin nor Folkman think that there's any real prospect of reviving the accord.

Even Belgium-based researcher Weinian Hu — who recently penned an op-ed arguing the deal's content merits a ""second chance"" — thinks delisting lawmakers would have ""limited” impact on China's hopes for better trade ties.

Hu — an analyst with the Center for China and Globalization think tank, which is sometimes seen as close to Beijing — told DW that lifting sanctions may be more of a diplomatic ""overture."" 

The European Union and China mark 50 years of formal relations in 2025.

The European Union has no plans to mark the occasion with its own sanctions relief.

A spokesperson for the European Commission told DW that the restrictions the EU slapped on several Chinese officials and organizations in 2021 were ""consistent"" with its ""long-standing concerns about the human rights situation in Xinjiang.""

The spokesperson said the European Union had ""not observed changes"" in the region, home to the mostly Muslim Uyghur minority.

China claims that the EU response to abuses in Xinjiang is ""based on lies and false information.""

Previously the blacklisted lawmakers were banned from entering Chinese territory and doing business with Beijing, with similar EU restrictions applying to those Brussels holds responsible for what it calls ""large-scale arbitrary detentions of, in particular, Uyghurs in Xinjiang.""

The United States and Ukraine have signed a contentious rare earth minerals deal after weeks of wrangling.

The deal will allow the US to exploit Ukraine's natural resources, including aluminium, graphite, oil and natural gas.

The Trump administration said Russia should see it as a signal that Washington is committed to supporting a free Ukraine.

The deal comes after The Telegraph reported that Donald Trump had dropped his demand to force Volodymyr Zelensky to hold elections that could oust him as part of a peace deal.

Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary and one of the main architects of the deal, said it was “historic”.

“As the president has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” Mr Bessent said.

Thanks to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's tireless efforts to secure a lasting peace, I am glad to announce the signing of today's historic economic partnership agreement between the United States and Ukraine establishing the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund to help… pic.twitter.com/N1jPa35DYh

The deal marks a victory for Ukraine after weeks of contentious negotiations, however it has been reported the agreement does not include guarantees that Washington would provide future security assistance to Ukraine.

According to the New York Times, US negotiators rejected the idea early on in the discussions.

Mr Trump had said he expected a deal to be signed when Mr Zelensky visited the White House at the end of February. The Ukrainian president left without signing after an extraordinary row with Mr Trump in the Oval Office.

Since then, Mr Trump has condemned Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine and signalled growing impatience with Vladimir Putin.

He and Mr Zelensky had the chance to talk knee-to-knee last weekend on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral in Rome. Both said the talks had been productive.

Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's first vice-prime minister, confirmed a deal had been agreed, writing on X: “On behalf of the government of Ukraine, I signed the Agreement on the Establishment of a United States–Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund.”

She added: “Together with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment into our country.”

Ms Svyrydenko denied that the deal was debt repayment to Washington for its support during the war, saying that it would instead allow both countries to “expand their economic potential through equal cooperation and investment”.

In a post on X early on Thursday, David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, said: “The UK welcomes steps taken by the US and Ukraine to sign an economic partnership.

“The UK's support for Ukraine remains steadfast. With our 100-year partnership, we are deepening economic and security ties for the future generations of both of our countries.”

Mr Trump has struggled to deliver his promise to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump signalled that the deal was ready, saying: “We made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do. It's also good for them, because you'll have an American presence at the site.”

“And the American presence will keep a lot of bad actors out of the country, or certainly out of the area where we're doing the digging.”

“We made a deal today where we get, you know, much more in theory, than the $350 billion (£263.3 billion), but I wanted to be protected... I didn't want to be out there and look foolish,” the US president said.

The US has stepped up its hunt for sources of rare earth metals, which form essential components in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles, as it attempts to reduce its dependence on Chinese supply chains.

The agreement sets up a “reconstruction investment fund” that will be governed by three US and three Ukrainian board members.

It will invest in extraction of rare earth minerals, oil and gas with revenues split 50-50.

Keith Kellog, the US envoy for Ukraine, meanwhile said on Wednesday that Kyiv was willing to give up land occupied by Russia.

“The Ukrainians have already said they're willing to give up the land... not de jure, forever, but de facto because the Russians actually occupy it…they told me that last week,” he told Fox News.

Companies can now illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences.

On March 14, President Donald Trump quietly rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for private sector employees on federal contracts. The move is just one part of a wider war the administration has launched against the working class since assuming power.

Executive Order 14026 was issued by former President Joe Biden in 2021. In addition to increasing the minimum wage rate for federal contractors, it set adjustments to account for inflation. The Department of Labor (DOL) estimated that some 327,300 workers saw their wages go up, with an average wage increase of over $5,000 a year. The 2025 rate was set to be $17.75 per hour.

“Because federally contracted work so often takes place in long racially segregated industries in states where corporate lobbyists and their lawmaker allies have unjustly suppressed wages, this action will also help begin to close the racial wealth gap,” noted National Employment Law Project (NELP) Executive Director Rebecca Dixon at the time.

Trump's move could result in thousands of workers losing their pay increases, but its overall impact may be much more severe.

A full overturning of the rule means that some federal contractors will return Obama-era wage of $13.30 an hour, but Trump could undo the minimum wage for these workers altogether, meaning that some contractors could make just $7.25 an hour in some states.

“Lower-wage federal contractors include janitors who clean government buildings, food service workers on military bases, cashiers in gift shops in national parks and security guards protecting federal property,” Samantha Sanders, the Economic Policy Institute's director of government affairs and advocacy, told Truthout. “This pay cut is a blatant attack on these workers — everyday people all across the country trying to make rent, buy groceries, and support their families.”

Trump rolling back the Biden order doesn't mean the minimum wage for federal workers will immediately plummet. The DOL will have to go through a rulemaking process to determine how low to drop it.

However, that doesn't mean that workers won't end up making less, as the DOL has announced it won't be enforcing the EO in the meantime. In other words, companies can illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences. It's just the latest example of the White House openly ignoring the law.

Many workers technically have protections through labor laws like the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, which are supposed to require prevailing wages by certain federal contractors. However, these laws have not been updated to keep up with inflation and are largely inadequate in the current economy. As a Center for American Progress report points out, many of the market wages established by these laws are less than the $17.75 hourly wage that Trump just nixed.

“A nursing assistant on a federal contract in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, has a minimum wage of only $13.17; a food service worker in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas has a minimum wage of $12.06; and a landscape laborer on a construction site in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has a minimum wage of just $10.47,” explains the report.

The Trump administration knows there is power (and thus protections) in a union, which is why it's trying to prohibit federal workers from organizing in any way. The president's recent flurry of anti-union measures makes the resistance to his wage cuts even more challenging.

In March, the administration moved to revoke collective bargaining rights with federal unions across several federal agencies. According to a report from Government Executive, the order could eradicate bargaining rights for about 67 percent of the federal workforce and for 75 percent of workers who currently belong to unions.

“This administration's bullying tactics represent a clear threat not just to federal employees and their unions, but to every American who values democracy and the freedoms of speech and association,” said American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley after Trump announced the order. “Trump's threat to unions and working people across America is clear: fall in line or else.”

Shortly after the order was announced, Trump took the unprecedented step of suing the AFGE, the U.S.'s largest federal worker union, for allegedly constraining the executive branch. The lawsuit aims to invalidate a large swath of union contracts.

Elon Musk's so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) also effectively shut down the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), an independent federal agency tasked with resolving work stoppages.

DOGE “basically decided to eliminate all but a few people from the agency,” an FMCS employee, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told The Guardian. “We don't know the final count but maybe a dozen left out of an agency that had almost 200 employees through last year…. It is shocking as the agency does not regulate and has always been non-controversial.”

In yet another swipe against federal workers, Trump recently ended collective bargaining rights for nearly 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees. The move was a clear act of retaliation against the AFGE, which represents TSA employees and has continually sought to restrain the administration in court. The TSA negotiated a seven-year labor agreement last year, which included the addition of parental bereavement leave and expanded shift trade options for workers.

On April 8, Trump's attacks on the federal workforce got a boost from the right-wing Supreme Court. In a 7-2 ruling, the court paused an order from a San Francisco judge that required the administration to reinstate the more than 16,000 workers who were terminated earlier this year.

Thousands more could be facing unemployment, thanks to a rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on April 18. The mandate would reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as “at-will” employees, stripping them of civil service protections and enabling Trump to fire them en masse.

“Moving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as ‘Schedule Policy/Career,' and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,” Trump wrote on social media after the rule was announced. “If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job.”

The OPM estimates that 50,000 workers would be reclassified, which is about 2 percent of the federal workforce.

While Trump aims to reduce wages, many lawmakers are pushing to raise them.

Led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Democrats recently reintroduced the Raise the Wage Act, which aims to bring the federal minimum wage up to $17 an hour by 2030. Despite the rapidly rising cost of living the United States, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was established in 1938. An economic analysis of the move suggests it could provide a raise for some 22 million people.

“The $7.25 an hour minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be raised to a living wage — at least $17 an hour,” said Sanders in a statement. “In the year 2025, a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. Congress can no longer ignore the needs of the working class of this country. The time to act is now.”

Earlier this month, Sanders forced a vote on the issue, as part of the Senate Budget Resolution, but it was rejected by the Republican majority.

A report from the NELP notes that the bill would particularly benefit women and workers of color. The group estimates that Black workers would make an additional $3,200 a year; nearly 25 percent of Latino workers would see a raise; and 1 in 4 women would get paid more.

It would also undoubtedly improve the overall economy.

“A $17 minimum wage by 2028 would generate $86 billion in higher wages for workers and would also benefit communities across the country,” explains the report. “Because underpaid workers spend much of their extra earnings, this injection of wages will help stimulate the economy and spur greater business activity and job growth.”

On the campaign trail, and even after winning the election, Trump waffled on the issue of raising the minimum wage.

When asked about potentially raising it in December 2024, he told NBC News, “It's a very low number, I will agree, it's a very low number. Let me give you the downside, though: In California, they raised it up to a very high number, and your restaurants are going out of business all over the place. The population is shrinking, it's had a very negative impact. But there is a level at which you could do it, absolutely.”

It's clear that Trump is no longer undecided on the issue.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

The plans include elements that appear aimed at reversing or weakening policies pursued by the Biden administration.

Moves by the Trump administration to draw up a new regulatory framework for types of toxic chemicals has sparked suspicion among health advocates who fear the changes will protect polluters but not public health.

The concerns come after U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin on Monday rolled out preliminary plans to tackle widespread environmental contamination by per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals used in myriad industries for decades that have been found to pose health threats.

The plans include elements that appear aimed at reversing or weakening policies pursued by the Biden administration, including potentially shielding public water systems from the costs of cleaning certain types of PFAS from public drinking water supplies.

Zeldin said the agency would be “advancing research and testing,” and taking other actions to “ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land and water.”

But Betsy Southerland, a former EPA senior scientist and a former director in the agency's Office of Water, said the EPA announcement was “nothing but a spin document” that “indicates there are problems ahead, even though it's written as if it's just a fabulous plan for the future.”

“Their actions will absolutely ensure that for years longer people will be exposed to PFAS in their drinking water and their food without any relief from this administration,” she said.

PFAS are a class of thousands of humanmade so-called “forever chemicals” that can linger for many years in the environment and are used in manufacturing and consumer products including non-stick pans, raincoats and cosmetics.

At least 45% of U.S. tap water is contaminated with PFAS, according to a 2023 U.S. Geological Survey estimate, and about 97% of Americans have the chemicals in their blood. Some PFAS chemicals have been linked to health harms including certain cancers, liver damage, thyroid problems and reproductive issues.

Under Biden, the EPA in 2021 unveiled a “PFAS Strategic Roadmap,” which aimed at putting in place a series of policies to “safeguard public health, protect the environment, and hold polluters accountable.” To support these objectives, the EPA finalized rules that established reporting requirements for companies that manufacture or import PFAS, designated two of the chemicals as hazardous substances under the “Superfund” law, and put limits on six PFAS chemicals in drinking water.

In one of the many contentious elements of the roadmap, the Biden EPA's drinking water rule required public water systems to complete initial monitoring for PFAS chemicals by 2027 and to implement technologies for reducing PFAS in their water supplies by 2029 if levels exceeded certain limits.

The rule drew strong opposition from public drinking water utilities, which would face substantial costs for implementing new technologies to mitigate PFAS, and penalties for failing to do so. Costs for drinking water systems across the country to meet the rule could exceed $3.8 billion per year, according to an estimate on behalf of the American Water Works Association (AWWA).

The new plan laid out by Zeldin states that the EPA will “address the most significant compliance challenges …. related to national drinking water regulations for certain PFAS,” indicating to some attempting to read between the lines that Zeldin plans to set new rules on PFAS in drinking water.

The rule currently sets a limit of just 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), as well as limits for four other PFAS chemicals.

Zeldin may opt to give water utilities more time to comply with the standards, or he could change the standards so that fewer facilities need to comply, Southerland said.

Indeed, James Ferraro Jr., an attorney who represents water utilities currently suing PFAS manufacturers to try to recover costs related to PFAS contamination, said he thinks public water systems are “cautiously applauding” the announcement, indicating that they believe the Trump administration is looking to shield them from the hefty costs of mitigating PFAS contamination.

The Trump administration had previously signaled changes to the Biden rules may be coming. Earlier this year, the administration asked for and received a 60-day pause on litigation filed by the AWWA and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) over the Biden limits on PFAS in drinking water, with an additional 30-day pause granted last month.

In another indication Trump's EPA is charting its own roadmap on PFAS, the administration appears poised to repeal the designations of PFOS and PFOA as hazardous substances under the “Superfund” law, with the EPA stating that it is  “working with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework.” The agency earlier received a 60-day pause on litigation filed by the Chamber of Commerce that challenges the Superfund designations.

While it proposes creating guidelines for PFAS releases into waterways, the EPA plan makes no mention of Biden's draft guidelines for limits on releases by PFAS manufacturers, which were withdrawn shortly after Trump's inauguration, accompanying an executive order that froze new federal regulations.

In another area of concern, the new EPA plan fails to mention limits for landfills, which were originally expected to be proposed later this year.

As well, the EPA's new proposed plan cites “smartly collecting necessary information” from companies for the Toxic Substances Control Act “without overburdening small business and article importers” in language that suggests Zeldin may act to redo the PFAS reporting requirement rule. The compliance period for the rule finalized under Biden was set to begin this July.

Some of the initiatives announced by the EPA could support efforts to reduce widespread PFAS contamination, including restricting their use and setting limits on PFAS releases into waterways, said John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney for the Environment America Research & Policy Center.

But other aspects of the EPA plan, including unspecified adjustments to liability and national drinking water limits, “bear careful attention as they are developed,” said Rumpler.

Calling for “strengthening the science” around PFAS, the EPA announcement implies further work by the EPA's Office of Research and Development, potentially suggesting that the agency's research arm may not be eliminated as feared, said Rainer Lohmann, a professor at the University of Rhode Island who directs a PFAS research program. However, it is also possible that the call for more science could simply be a strategy to delay action on PFAS, he said.

For public water utilities, Zeldin's announcement came as a welcome relief. Along with fears about the cost of implementing the Biden EPA's PFAS drinking water rule, water utilities also fear being caught in the crossfire of legal battles over PFAS contamination despite EPA's reassurance that it would not go after passive receivers of PFAS, focusing instead on manufacturers and others using PFAS.

The announcement marks “an important step forward in reducing PFAS pollution,” the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) said in a statement. The actions “mirror the stance NACWA has long been advocating – polluters should pay the costs of removing PFAS, not public clean water utilities, which are passive receivers of these chemicals. NACWA looks forward to continued work with EPA in a collaborative manner to address PFAS contamination and ensure clean water for all Americans.”

The EPA said in a statement that new leadership is in the process of reviewing the PFAS drinking water rule “and the issues presented in the litigation in the current case around it, and developing its position on how to proceed.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Slammed with lawsuits, the administration paused its student visa revocations, but students still aren't in the clear.

Shortly after the Trump administration took office, the State Department warned international scholars and students — people who had come to the U.S. to teach, conduct research and learn — that it planned to revoke visas based on allegations of antisemitism or for their purported support for groups like Hamas or Hezbollah.

What happened was far more expansive — a sweeping termination of students' immigration status records in a Department of Homeland Security-managed database known as SEVIS (the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System), which left students and scholars — as well as their lawyers — with questions about their legal status while in the U.S.

The terminations often had “no clear reason or rationale attached, ” but affected more than 1,800 students at 280 institutions by April 25, when the Department of Justice announced that the policy had been temporarily halted.

In announcing the halt, the Department of Justice also made clear that it intends to “work up a new framework to revoke and cancel student visas.” The decision followed more than 100 lawsuits filed by students, universities and advocacy groups to end the revocations. The information revealed in those lawsuits have shed new light on the Trump administration's multipronged attack on international students and scholars.

The wave of visa revocations followed a spate of high-profile arrests of campus activists, including Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts student who was in the U.S. on a student visa, as well as Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and green card holder. Those arrests came after a report from the news outlet Axios, which found the State Department had been using artificial intelligence in what it calls a “catch and revoke” mission to monitor foreign nationals, with particular attention to student visa holders. The report said that the State Department was working alongside the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security “in what one senior State official called a ‘whole of government and whole of authority approach.'” As more students heard updates on their statuses, it became clear that the intended targets went beyond political protesters.

As of April 24, the news outlet Inside Higher Ed documented at least 1,800 students and scholars whose visa records in the SEVIS database were originally revoked. They attend or teach at a wide array of colleges and universities — ranging from public to private, from the Ivy League to art schools and small liberal arts programs.

And, while some of those targeted may have been actively involved in pro-Palestinian organizing, others believe they lost their visas because of minor traffic infractions or other low-level offenses that appear on their record.

More details came to light in a hearing on April 29 for one of the suits brought by a targeted student. In the hearing, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes urged government officials to share details over what they dubbed the “Student Criminal Alien Initiative.” Government officials described a program in which ICE, alongside contractors, ran the names of foreign students through a federal index that tracks interactions with law enforcement — including things like traffic arrests or charges that may have been dropped, if they were ever brought at all. The data analysis used to revoke visas or to terminate SEVIS records, Politico reports, was done with minimal oversight or review.

In the past, federal officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have repeatedly sought to justify student visa revocations, saying that the State Department has unbridled authority to revoke visas and deport all noncitizens who are “adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests of the U.S.”

But those public arguments fell apart when it came to individual legal cases.

In court, the government argued that the termination of records in SEVIS was simply an issue of removing information from a government database: “Terminating a record in SEVIS does not terminate an individual's nonimmigrant status in the United States,” an ICE official declared on April 14. “Terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation.” Meanwhile, Justice Department lawyers, when pressed by Reyes in another case, were unable to answer questions about the student's legal status. “This is not Schrodinger's visa,” Reyes said. “Either he's here legally or he's not here legally.” Historically, removing a visa for international students does not automatically lead to deportation orders or indicate that a person must leave the country.

New York City-based immigration attorney Kaitlyn Amanda Box told Truthout that the more than 1 million international students currently in the U.S. typically begin the process of international study by applying to a school that is both accredited and certified to admit international students. Once accepted, the institution provides the student with an I-20 form that outlines their intended course of study and asks for basic biographical information. The State Department then vets everything and students are typically issued an F-1 visa (for study at an accredited college, university or language institute), a J-1 visa (for international student exchange programs) or an M-1 visa (for non-academic vocational training). The process, Box reports, can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Once issued, a visa is normally good for the duration of time it takes to complete a degree; international scholars are generally authorized to stay for five years.

If a student's visa is revoked, Box says, “colleges and universities need to understand that this does not prohibit the student from attending classes or change their enrollment status.” In fact, she continues, “While a visa allows a noncitizen to enter the country, it does not control their status once they're here. If they leave to go home for a visit, though, because the original visa was revoked, they will need to apply for a new one. It is now uncertain if a second visa will be granted.” ICE is now indicating that this may change. In an internal memo, the agency shared a new policy warning that students whose visas are revoked may also get their legal status canceled.

In addition, Box said that following the April 25 pause, many questions remain unanswered. “No guidance has been promulgated so far to indicate what recourse, if any, people whose visas were canceled have,” Box told Truthout.

This includes questions about whether or not those with revoked visas can continue to do paid work on campus.

“Working in the U.S. could become an issue,” she said. “Some international students have on-campus jobs, and schools are unsure if they can still pay them. In addition, most international students want to spend additional time in the U.S. and complete an Optional Practical Training (OPT) program once they finish their degrees.” Until the Trump takeover, OPT allowed recent graduates an additional year during which they were permitted to complete an internship or work; STEM graduates were able to extend this for an additional 24 months. “But now,” Box said, “everyone is worried that they'll be unable to find a job or apprenticeship since mentors are afraid of negative consequences if they take someone on.”

Not surprisingly, she reports that this is taking an emotional toll on visiting faculty and international students. “There is so much fear and panic,” she said. “People are worried about their ability to fulfill their goals and control their education. A small number are even self-deporting and hoping to finish their programs online.”

Thiri, a doctoral student in theology from Southeast Asia who asked to be identified by first name only to avoid being targeted by the Trump administration, told Truthout that her anxiety ramped up shortly after the revocations began. “I know that my visa is vulnerable,” she said, “so I have provided hospitality to student protesters who need food or a place to stay. I have not gone to any demonstrations or rallies. I care deeply about what is happening in Gaza and in other places throughout the world, but I feel helpless. I don't think it is safe for me to protest, but I am doing what I can. I know I have to stay grounded to complete my dissertation.”

Like Thiri, Neha is hunkering down. Neha, who also asked to remain anonymous to avoid reprisals, came to the U.S. from India last fall to enroll in a one-year fashion management master's degree program in New York City. “This is a global program,” she told Truthout. “I'm learning how to navigate fashion trends and understand how the industry functions. But being in America is getting scarier and scarier for me. I came here wanting to stay and work but I'm now so worried that I carry my immigration papers with me at all times in case I'm stopped by ICE. I'm afraid of what might happen next.”

“Every day, there's a new policy or executive order,” Hua Li, also a pseudonym for a fine arts undergraduate from China, told Truthout. “They're arresting people with green cards, so I am terrified. I've deleted my social media,” Li added. “I want to go home to see my family this summer, once I graduate, but I also want to do an OPT year. I'm worried that they won't let me return. No one at my college has answers, so I really don't know what I should do.”

Part of the problem is that college administrators don't have answers either. But some are beginning to come together to develop strategies to resist the Trump administration's attempts to control everything from curriculum to student enrollment to faculty hires.

The Coalition for Action in Higher Education — a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), Faculty for Justice in Palestine, Scholars for Social Justice, Higher Education Labor United, the American Comparative Literature Association, the Debt Collective, Historians for Peace and Democracy and Jewish Voice for Peace — coordinated a nationwide Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17 that not only denounced the visa revocations, but also opposed efforts to restrict campus activism. Moreover, several high-profile college administrators — Michael Roth at Wesleyan, Jonathan Levin and Jenny Martinez at Stanford, Christopher Eisgruber at Princeton, and Alan Garber at Harvard — have denounced the Trump administration's attempt to force universities to adopt an anti-democratic and narrow ideological line in order to continue receiving federal funding. Some, including Harvard, have sued the administration — a riposte that some commentators have noted should be seen as a “bare minimum” rather than a sufficient response.

Other schools have focused more narrowly on the visa issue. The American Council on Education and 15 other higher education associations requested a meeting with the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security in early April — as yet unscheduled — to demand “clarity” about the termination of student visas. That request continues to be relevant.

Needless to say, there is a lot at stake. “Today, more than 1 million international students attend American universities,” the Association of American Universities wrote in an email to Truthout. “These students conduct life-saving research, start businesses, and foster intellectual dynamism. The administration's recent actions concerning international students create a great deal of uncertainty on college campuses and could deter global talent from coming to the United States.”

That talent, the American Council on Education estimates, is worth $43.8 billion a year and supports 375,000 U.S. jobs. Universities have their own financial stake in keeping international students safe: The Institute of International Education estimates that 81 percent of international undergraduates and 61 percent of international graduate students pay their tuition and living fees entirely on their own, without financial aid.

But the looming financial pinch is not the only thing vexing colleges. International scholars are also fearful about their continued ability to teach, do research and collaborate with U.S.-based colleagues.

Veena Dubal, general counsel of the AAUP, told Truthout that the organization is suing Marco Rubio to stop the “chilling and dismantling of academic freedom.”

The lawsuit was promulgated, she said, because so many AAUP members were reporting that their international colleagues were canceling papers, workshops and conferences due to fear of being deported. “Noncitizens feel that they are under scrutiny,” she said. “This is true for those with green cards as well as those here on temporary visas. What is particularly striking is that there is a confluence between Title VI investigations and attacks on preferred speech.” (Last month, 60 colleges throughout the country were notified that they were being investigated for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The charge? Antisemitism.)

People who write about foreign policy are obvious targets, she said, but the administration is also directing its animosity toward people who organize or write about gender, queer themes, climate change and race. “People are scared,” Dubal adds, “and are deciding not to teach classes on these subjects. Our lawsuit is a way to attack the administration's use of fear tactics against this subset of vulnerable people. People whose funding is being cut are being censored because their work does not comport with Trump's preferred ideology. The administration is offering a brazen and perverse vision of what society needs.”

Since the lawsuit was filed, it has garnered significant support. An amicus brief supported by 86 organizations and led by the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a group formed to support international students and boost documented and undocumented college enrollment, is demanding a preliminary injunction to “safeguard academic freedom and halt the large-scale arrests, detentions, and deportations of students and faculty engaged in constitutionally-protected activities.”

The brief stresses that the administration's actions will not only deter international students from coming to the U.S. but will deny U.S.-born students the opportunity to hear global perspectives. Since 2013, 12 million international students have studied at American colleges and universities. By 2023, they accounted for 6 percent of domestic higher education enrollment.

That said, some colleges are far more reliant on international students than others. According to ArtNews, 33 percent of students at the Rhode Island School of Design are international. Similarly, half of the students at the School of Visual Arts; 35 percent at Parsons School of Design; 30 percent at California Institute of the Arts; and 29 percent at the Art Institute of Chicago and Pratt come from outside the U.S.

And art schools and their students are not anomalies.

“Students who are here on visas are fearful about speaking out but are adjusting to the new reality of this administration,” Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Truthout. “They are realizing that they need to step back and allow U.S.-born citizens to step forward in anti-occupation and anti-genocide protests. But people are continuing to protest, and students are not backing down despite the Trump administration's use of tactics that represent the most autocratic regimes. It's incredible. These students have been so courageous and largely peaceful in their exercise of free speech. That's the story we need to elevate.”

“The entire Trump economic agenda is about making it easier to do business in America, to create jobs in America, to hire American workers, and to build your factories here in America, not in China, or any other country,” Trump said.

The president was flanked by high-tech displays, including an Anduril drone model, emphasizing his administration's push to rebuild American industry.

More than a dozen executives on hand for the event touted their companies' recent commitments, totaling more than $2 trillion collectively and described as historic by the Trump administration, and sought to encourage more manufacturing development projects in the United States.

Trump said his trade policies, which include 10 percent baseline tariffs on nations worldwide—and a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods—are spurring domestic manufacturing initiatives.

A tariff wall for the pharmaceutical industry is also in the works, he said.

“You build here, you have no tariffs,” he said.

Though critics of the U.S. tariffs suggest they could prove inflationary or cause supply chain disruptions, those who spoke at the event were in favor of the president's agenda.

Larry Culp, GE Aerospace chairman and CEO, said proposed reciprocal levies are “helping ensure that the U.S. aerospace industry, one of our biggest net exporters, continues to lead the world in innovation.”

Trump said approximately $8 trillion in investments in U.S. industries were secured in the first 100 days of his second presidency.

That figure includes $500 billion from Apple to develop manufacturing and training, $500 billion from NVIDIA for artificial intelligence infrastructure, and $500 billion combined from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, among other deals.

Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of Softbank, said during the event: “I tried to commit $100 billion, and President Trump said, ‘Oh Masa, go for more.' So, we did.”

Other businesses are also moving operations onshore, according to administration officials.

“The business community is bullish on America because President Trump is back in charge.”

The capital influx is expected to generate more than 451,000 new jobs in high-paying sectors, she said.

Trump has championed high-tech manufacturing developments, calling the domestic production of semiconductors and computer chips a matter of national security.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said the backing of the administration will allow the AI industry to proliferate in the United States and prove beneficial to a multitude of businesses.

“This industry is going to enable a whole bunch of other industries,” he said. “What we now call the AI infrastructure is going to revolutionize every industry that we know.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Since declaring his 2024 presidential candidacy, President Donald Trump has concentrated much of his economic agenda on trade, specifically tariffs.

“We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer,” Trump declared in his much-anticipated April 2 announcement on broad tariffs.

From leveling the playing field in global trade to reshoring U.S. manufacturing, the Trump administration aims to wield the tariff instrument to accomplish the president's goals.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum orders retaliatory tariffs, though she does not specify what will be targeted.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the U.S. tariffs are “entirely unjustified,” but says his country will not retaliate.

“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation,” Albanese says in a news conference.

“They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States.”

“In expression of our good faith and in spirit of strengthening our bilateral trade relations, Cambodia is committed to promote U.S.-based product imports with an immediate reduction of 19 product categories from our maximum 35 percent tariff-bound rate to 5 percent applied tariff rate,” Manet wrote.

“I really don't want cars from Canada,” Trump tells reporters at the Oval Office. “So when I put tariffs on Canada, they're paying 25 percent, but that could go up in terms of cars. When we put tariffs on, all we're doing is we're saying, ‘We don't want your cars in all due respect.'”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells reporters that the administration is estimating U.S.–China trade negotiations to last two to three years to ensure a “full rebalancing” in global trade.

The Trump administration will provide domestic car companies a 15 percent rebate this year if they finish assembling their automobiles in the United States. They will also receive a 10 percent rebate next year.

In addition, automakers will continue paying a tariff rate of 25 percent on imported vehicles, but the executive action will prevent other adjacent levies from “stacking” on top of the others.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

In early April, Goldman Sachs forecast significant challenges for the Chinese economy and labor market, citing high U.S. tariffs, declining exports to the United States, and a slowing global economy.

The investment bank estimated that China could lose about 10 million to 20 million jobs that depend on U.S.-bound exports.

U.S.-based economist Davy Wong said the impact may be larger because of the indirect effects on various businesses, including suppliers for export manufacturers, packaging companies, and logistics companies.

“It could be between 30 million and 35 million jobs,” he told The Epoch Times, noting that the impact is “lethal” to China's industrial cities.

Now, low-skilled laborers are also bracing for a jobless future as factories are expected to shut down, according to some individuals who spoke to The Epoch Times. The interviewees used pseudonyms to protect their identities because of safety concerns and the fear of retaliation from authorities.

Li, a factory worker in Shenzhen, said his employer's clients are exporting significantly fewer garments than they did in the past. The factory supplies materials to textile manufacturers in nearby Dongguan, a major hub for exporting consumer goods, including clothing and LED monitors.

“They used to ship goods every day but not so much now. Lots of products were left in the warehouse,” Li said, noting that many U.S. orders were left stranded in containers at Shenzhen's Yantian container shipyard.

“Job loss is inevitable; it's already hard to find a job,” he said.

Li noted that his factory, which also exports products to Japan and the UK, has been less significantly affected than those exporters working with U.S. clients. However, the factory's production has still decreased because of the effects of the tariff war.

Lee, an employment agent in Anhui Province, one of China's major production bases of solar panels and electric cars, said he has seen a drastic change in the job market.

“Many industries are in decline; lots of factories went bust,” he said. “Many factories furloughed their workers, who are now limiting their consumption because they can't make money.”

A few years ago, according to Lee, factories were actively hiring, and the average salary was 5,000 yuan (about $688) or more. Currently, many factories are adopting a four-day work week with no overtime, resulting in the average salary being cut in half.

Shenzhen is one of China's first-tier cities, attracting domestic migrant workers from smaller cities and rural areas who seek better job opportunities, higher wages, and improved living conditions. There are fewer than 20 such cities in China.

According to video footage posted on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, migrants have been returning home early this year because of a lack of job opportunities in big cities.

Those who return to live in rural areas will be counted as rural unemployment, which Beijing does not publish. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's urban unemployment rate in March was 5.2 percent.

In a video shared on Douyin on April 2, a business development professional advised viewers to not leave their jobs before securing a new one. The woman explained that she had changed jobs three times since 2022, successfully finding new positions in less than a week each time. However, she found it particularly challenging to do the same this year.

In early April, the state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. drew attention after posting a comment on WeChat, boasting that it had received nearly 1.2 million resumes for 1,730 vacancies.

After facing criticism for insensitivity toward young job seekers, the company deleted the post and announced plans to hire about 8,000 people.

The Epoch Times spoke to a number of people across China, who described a bleak picture for job seekers.

In Guangzhou, China's largest electronics manufacturing hub and home to several lucrative industries, Zhang, a 23-year-old computer hardware engineering graduate who moved to the city in March, said he was taken aback by how difficult it was to find a job.

“I'd advise others not to come unless you have to,” he said.

Zhang said he tried to get a job at an electronics factory, where 50 young candidates were competing for two vacancies. People had to compete for even the most basic job on the production line, he said.

In Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, Chen has been job hunting for about six months. She's making ends meet by delivering take-out food using rented public bikes.

It's tough to find employment in any industry this year, she said. “I feel completely lost now. I have no choice but to do the most basic jobs,” Chen said.

In Guiyang, Guizhou Province, Yang, an economics undergraduate, became indebted after losing her job at a local government department a few months ago, as she has been unable to find other employment since.

“I was in the middle of my contract when the department laid off employees,“ she said. ”To avoid paying compensation, they cut my salary [to force me out instead of letting me go], but I couldn't accept it, so I left.”

Yang said she is drowning in debt and that her contact information was made public by debt collectors.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

When Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987, the Chinese telecommunications company had a few thousand dollars in the bank and an eye on reverse-engineering advanced foreign technology. By 1994, Huawei was producing switching equipment, the hardware and software that form the basis of modern telecommunications, and Ren was taking a meeting with Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin. The Huawei chief executive observed that his company's product was a matter of “national security” and that a country “that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military.” “Well said,” Jiang replied. From that moment on, business and government have been partners in the mission to keep China's telecommunications secure.

Meanwhile, in the late 1990s and throughout the first decade of this century, the United States did not think much about its telecommunications dominance. Its leadership in the sector was unrivaled, and U.S. innovations—including 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies—were widely adopted and securely used around the world. But as the United States sat complacently in the top position, trusting that the strength of the free market would keep it there, China was carefully setting itself up as a challenger. Beijing poured resources into Huawei and other Chinese companies, positioning them to outcompete foreign firms. So successful was this effort that by 2012, Huawei telecom gear had been deployed across rural America, covering the bases that house U.S. nuclear weapons. This effectively provided the Chinese government with constant surveillance of the United States' most sensitive capabilities and military operations. Huawei may not have been raking in profits from this venture, but for Beijing it was an intelligence coup.

Although the United States began to push back on these efforts and eventually banned Huawei from U.S. networks in 2016, Huawei's successes have continued to mount. The company is now the world's largest provider of 5G networks and a dominant player in telecom equipment. It is also poised to lead the next generation of networking—6G. The company's competitors accuse it, with some justification, of achieving this dominance through intellectual property theft, helped along by aggressive Chinese subsidies and a closed Chinese market. Meanwhile, Huawei has demolished many of its rivals. Over the last 15 years, some, such as the U.S. companies Cisco and Motorola, have been driven out of the equipment market; others, such as the U.S. company Lucent, the French Alcatel, and the German Siemens, have been forced to sell or merge with larger firms in order to compete. The Canadian company Nortel declared bankruptcy in 2009. Today, only two non-Chinese firms remain capable of competing with Huawei on a global level: the Swedish firm Ericsson and the Finnish Nokia. The United States is their largest market, and U.S. telecommunications rely on the services of both.

This is not simply about Western firms' lost market share. Huawei's networks carry valuable data, which the company is obliged under Chinese intelligence laws to provide at the government's request. That access would be valuable to Beijing at any time. But now, in the era of artificial intelligence, the data sets that Huawei transports also have another function: training AI models. Huawei has deployed its Smart City services—which can include street camera imaging; electricity, gas, and water meter data; and social media analysis—in more than 200 cities in 40 countries, from Singapore to Spain. The data sets this produces could be fed straight into Chinese AI models and made available to China's military and intelligence agencies, making Beijing not just a leader in telecommunications but the dominant player in the use of AI for public safety and national security. The recently exposed Salt Typhoon hacking operation, which targeted major U.S. telecommunications firms, also demonstrated China's determination to gain access to U.S. networks by any means necessary.

U.S. President Donald Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden after him took steps to slow China's ascent to this commanding height. Both administrations tried, in particular, to address Huawei and other Chinese firms' cost advantage over their Western counterparts. Yet Huawei continues to extend its global reach. Beijing will gain an even greater edge in telecommunications if international tensions and trade wars undermine cooperation among Western countries. In his second term, Trump must redouble U.S. efforts to compete, enhancing programs that are working, making hard choices about how to allocate the range of invisible waves that carry wireless signals such as radio, television, and phone data through the air, known as spectrum, and working with allies to finance research and development and technology deployments abroad. Otherwise, China will extend its lead in 5G into the transition to 6G, cementing the country's authority over worldwide telecommunications—and putting it in a position to compromise the security of the U.S. and allied military and intelligence operations that rely on these global networks.

In the twentieth century, U.S. government investments resulted in the creation of the Internet, high-speed networking, and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Innovations in cellular technology by American firms also shaped global communications: 2G brought text, 3G brought mobile broadband, and 4G brought mobile video and app stores. Apart from its support for research and development, Washington largely left the free market alone. In China, by contrast, the government and military treated leading telecommunications firms as national champions, powering their rise because their success bolstered Beijing's strategic aims. Huawei alone reportedly received $75 billion in government support between 2008 and 2018, which enabled it to gain market share by pricing products well below cost. In the late 1990s, Western vendors owned nearly 90 percent of the market for telecom gear. By 2025, Ericsson and Nokia, even after acquiring their failing peers, were down to a combined 40 percent market share. Chinese firms account for an additional 40 percent of the global market.

Today, the United States and Europe—home of both Ericsson and Nokia—are sitting on a shrinking base, as China continues to undercut their sales pitches by subsidizing Huawei deployments around the world. Although Huawei's global dominance in 5G has been slowed by U.S.-led sanctions and export controls, neither the United States' innovations nor those of its partners have threatened the competitiveness of its products. Given that Huawei's research and development budget is more than twice the size of its two next-largest Western competitors, the company is unlikely to lose its innovation advantage.

The first Trump administration, recognizing the need for secure telecommunications, banned Huawei and other Chinese products from U.S. networks and took steps to replace the gear that was already present. The United States also began to encourage its allies, most notably the United Kingdom, to remove Huawei gear and work with trusted firms instead. The Biden administration continued this strategy. But both parties have known for years that banning Chinese technology would not be enough. The United States and its partners would need to develop a cost-effective alternative that could compete with China's aggressively subsidized products. To that end, the Biden administration brought in two critical government agencies, the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, to, among other projects, directly finance Costa Rica's move from a Huawei 4G network to a trusted 5G network and to team up with Finland's investment bank to finance a major deployment of Nokia's 5G technology in India.

Washington's objectives have not changed. It needs to compete with China at scale, narrow the price gap between U.S. and Chinese technologies, and encourage wider adoption of trusted systems. The way to accomplish this is with incentives for technology innovation and joint financing for countries choosing between Chinese and non-Chinese technologies.

The Trump administration should begin by making better useof the ten-year, $1.5 billion grant program established by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Initial grants focused on funding large-scale interoperability testing of technologies that integrate hardware and software from different vendors. Over $140 million was awarded to U.S. and foreign firms and universities through this initiative, with a further $420 million in grants made available in May 2024. This was a good start, but future funding rounds must move much faster and focus on projects that commercialize new technologies, giving U.S. software companies greater incentives to enter the market. In particular, directing capital to the “cloudification” of network infrastructure—that is, subsidizing technology that creates virtual versions of specialized equipment—will pay dividends for U.S. industry, which excels at software development.



AI applications rely on high-speed networking. The United States, however, trails far behind China when it comes to setting up the required infrastructure. Today, 45 percent of U.S. mobile users are covered by 5G, compared with 88 percent of Chinese mobile users. When 5G technology was first introduced, China built 600,000 5G base stations in three months. It took the United States two years to build 100,000. But where Washington cannot compete with Beijing on deployment at scale, it can compete on efficiency. By integrating artificial intelligence into telecommunications operations, companies could rapidly increase transmission speeds and network capacity, improving overall efficiency. The next round of CHIPS grants should be used to drive research and development and pilot projects in this area.

Another important way to lower costs for U.S. firms is through tax policy. For example, Washington can encourage investment in digital infrastructure by allowing accelerated depreciation, a financial tool that enables companies to quickly lower the value of new assets and thus reduce their tax burden and free up investment funds. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included such a provision, but it was set up to last for only a limited time and the mechanism is already being phased out. Congress should now extend these types of tax incentives to a broad category of digital infrastructure equipment to maximize private-sector investment.

Even after the United States implements these reforms, the cost of non-Chinese technologies will still undermine U.S. efforts to persuade other countries to avoid Chinese vendors. The alternative on offer must be technologically advanced and competitively priced. The United States therefore needs to cooperate with its partners on digital infrastructure financing. This model has worked before: under the East Micronesia Cable project, launched in 2022, Australia, Japan, and the United States have jointly contributed over $90 million to support secure, sustainable, and resilient telecommunications infrastructure in and between Pacific Islands countries.

Potential partners that could bring expertise and commercial capabilities to a U.S.-led 5G financing campaign include the EU, Japan, and South Korea. The two European heavyweights in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, are already well established in U.S. markets but need additional research and development support to be able to compete globally with Huawei. Japan and South Korea have smaller companies that could also compete if provided enough backing. A deal with Washington that covers R & D and financing for technology adaptation in third countries could help any or all of these partners lessen their companies' disadvantages relative to Chinese firms.



China is ramping up its funding for these projects, and the United States and its partners must do the same. The obvious institution for Washington to turn to is the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. government's credit agency. The bank still needs more flexibility to take on risk and offer competitive financing for 5G projects, but its recent efforts show promise. In 2023, the bank's board authorized 5G-related transactions in which less than 51 percent of the goods and services involved originate in the United States, provided the exporter could present a plan for job expansion in the United States. Already, $313 million has been approved to support 5G construction in India under a cofinancing agreement with Finland's export credit agency. With more collaboration of this kind, Washington can show the world that the United States and its partners are determined to offer compelling alternatives to China's subsidized vendors.

The private sector has a role to play, too. Earlier this year, Google and the government of Chile announced the launch of Humboldt Cable, a subsea cable route connecting Chile to Australia via French Polynesia. A concerted effort by the United States and its allies to include private firms in their strategy can incentivize similar investments to keep far-flung parts of the world connected to Western technology, rather than reliant on companies that may be controlled by Beijing.

Finally, Washington should reform its spectrum policy. Spectrum, which refers to the range of invisible energy waves used to carry information (such as television and WiFi) through the air, is a limited resource. The Department of Defense is the largest owner of spectrum in the United States and it is not transparent about how much spectrum it requires and when it is used. Spectrum is vital for all kinds of data transfers, whether streaming movies or using drones to monitor infrastructure—in other words, it is not only the government that needs it. But in the United States, unlike in China, the public and private sectors do not cooperate on shared goals. Instead, the government and private firms compete for access. This holds back U.S. technologies relative to their Chinese rivals. China's advantages in this area underpin its ambitions to control global networks and to reap military and strategic benefits from that control. Washington will now need to make hard choices to make portions of the Pentagon's spectrum available for commercial use, while ensuring that it preserves critical military and intelligence capabilities.

The benefits would be significant. U.S. companies would be better positioned to develop next-generation mobile technologies, initiating a virtuous cycle of innovation. As they build and test equipment, products, and technologies for the new spectrum, companies in other countries will follow suit. A hardware and software ecosystem generated by the United States and its allies would then filter across the globe.

In a few situations, the Defense Department will be unable to free up more spectrum for the private sector. But even here there are solutions. The Pentagon should work with commercial firms to scale up the use of new spectrum-sharing technologies, licensing regimes, and AI-supported software to make networks smarter and more agile. This would enable government and commercial users to share spectrum more effectively than is possible today, which means the Defense Department could access spectrum when needed for infrequent but important missions, training, and testing. A pilot project initiated by the Biden administration has aimed to test these technologies at scale and in partnership with private firms. The Trump administration should quickly wrap up this pilot and accelerate the next steps of figuring out how spectrum sharing will be governed and putting rapid dispute-resolution processes in place. This will assure the Pentagon and intelligence agencies that spectrum would be available to them during crises and conflicts. It will also give the private sector confidence that on-demand spectrum would be sufficiently reliable for commercial purposes. That confidence is key to making private-sector investment in digital infrastructure worthwhile.

Thus far, much of the digital infrastructure that has undergirded the modern world was invented, developed, and deployed in the United States. If the United States were to lose this advantage for good, the consequences would be immense. A China that dominates global digital networks would be able to surveil them at will. It would also be positioned to lead in AI, training AI models on data that traverses Chinese companies' networks and controlling AI applications that rely on high-speed networking. Successive U.S. administrations have recognized the magnitude of the problem. But the steps they have taken to address it have not resolved the core issue: the absence of alternative technologies that can compete with China's on price.

U.S. national security depends on the United States regaining its lead. It cannot do so alone. Although the competition with China will be fierce, particularly because of Beijing's willingness to wield its economic clout to give its companies a crushing competitive advantage, Washington must engage. Technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, virtualization, and artificial intelligence will only become more important. The country that leads the transition to 6G, moreover, will be at the forefront of advancements in a variety of applications, such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. If the United States, in cooperation with its allies and partners, adopts and implements the right policies, it can regain the technological initiative and protect its intelligence operations and military communications around the world. But to do so, it must ensure that advanced, trusted, and secure digital infrastructure, designed and produced outside China, remains available—and becomes the technology of choice—both at home and abroad.

President Donald Trump is fond of flexibility. Unperturbed by changing course, he prefers not to be pinned down by past precedent or by his own promises. Although he has pledged to end the war in Ukraine quickly, and although Washington has just signed a deal with Kyiv granting the United States a share of future revenues from Ukraine's minerals reserves, Trump could decide to walk away from the country entirely if he does not get the peace settlement he craves. A final text of the minerals deal has not yet been made public, but there is no indication that it includes security guarantees for Ukraine. As commander in chief, Trump can minimize U.S. support for Ukraine abruptly and dramatically.

But a Ukraine shunted aside by the United States would not be a Ukraine abandoned. After three years of war, dozens of countries now support Ukraine's increasingly capable military. No ally can replace the United States, but all of them make a difference: it is not within the power of the United States to end the war by pulling out. Although Ukraine will struggle to hold the line without U.S. support, Russia has no easy path to victory. The real risk of a precipitous American withdrawal of support is not that Ukraine will immediately collapse, but that individual European countries might lose the political will to stand up to Russia.

Should the United States forsake Ukraine, Europe would suffer multiple misfortunes. European leaders would conclude that Washington, having devoted itself to normalizing ties with Moscow, is no longer interested in providing the credible deterrence it had supplied for decades. They would perceive the Trump administration's abandonment of Ukraine as the first step toward a post-American Europe, if not a post-American world. Against this backdrop, Moscow may be tempted to scare Europe into submission, and some Europeans might choose appeasement rather than risk Russia's wrath.

The Trump administration is unlikely to endorse another supplemental support package for Ukraine. In a few months, the amount of weaponry and ammunition going from the United States to Ukraine will diminish. Even as Trump seeks economic gain from Ukraine in the form of a revenue-sharing deal, the United States may also curtail or halt the targeting and intelligence support it provides. Although Russia would still struggle to win the war outright, it would not have to worry about losing the war, either. It could lean into its strategy of damaging Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and terrorizing Ukrainians into leaving the country. Kyiv has the manpower, resources, and support to maintain sovereignty in most of the country, but Russian forces could advance slowly and make territorial gains, fulfilling Putin's goal of getting four of Ukraine's regions fully under his control.

Lacking the ability to make offensive gains, Ukraine would find it difficult to resolve the war on its terms. After successfully defending Kyiv in the spring and summer of 2022, Ukraine made daring moves in the south and the east, retaking the city of Kherson and liberating huge swaths of territory in the Kharkiv region. Last July, Ukraine even took a piece of Russian territory in the Kursk region. But over time, Ukraine has exhausted its offensive capabilities, and Russia has gradually pushed Ukrainian forces out of Kursk. Ukraine makes occasional drone strikes within Russia, and its degradation of Russian naval power in the Black Sea has been impressive, but Kyiv lacks the manpower and the materiel to capture large amounts of territory. Ukraine has drifted quietly, almost imperceptibly, from the wide-open war it was fighting in 2022 and 2023 to the defensive war it has been conducting since late 2024.

Without U.S. help, the support of its remaining allies would be crucial to Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have been innovative in their use of drone warfare, and European countries will continue to provide military aid. But Ukraine would suffer from a severe shortage of air defenses, enduring missile strikes across frontlines that would be essentially unprotectable. Kyiv would have to ration ammunition and would lose up-to-the-minute information on the battlefield. Even if the Europeans decide to step up, targeting would be exceptionally difficult without U.S. technology.

Ukraine's leadership knows what is at stake, and it knows what to expect. Kyiv will have to make difficult choices about which territories are defensible. Between the valor and efficiency of Ukraine's military and the continuous support from its remaining allies, however, Russia has no real path forward in Ukraine. The loss of life on the Russian side would not cease with American abandonment of Ukraine. The war would remain a strategic blunder for Russia. Even so, that abandonment would greatly burden Europe, call into question Washington's commitment to its European allies, and likely generate spiraling tensions between Europe and Russia.

The Trump administration might believe that Ukraine's destiny has no bearing on the future of the NATO alliance. The reality is that Ukraine is a linchpin of European security. The country is a twenty-first-century laboratory of containment, which has been the tacit transatlantic policy toward Russia since 2022. A U.S. retreat from Ukraine would signal to Moscow that Washington is no longer committed to checking the spread of Russian power in Europe. Seeing a green light, Russia would be tempted to test the foundations of European security, not necessarily through invasion but through intimidation and blackmail.

Russian President Vladimir Putin could target a European Union or NATO member state that he perceives as weak or internally divided; perhaps one of the Baltic countries or Romania. He could invent a crisis, perhaps claiming that a Russian-speaking minority is being persecuted in the country, and communicate a zeal to escalate by, say, demonstrating the reach of Russia's missiles. If the United States were unwilling to back the targeted country, the larger European powers—France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—would need to get involved. But without the United States, they might not be able to compel Russia to back down. The combined British and French nuclear arsenals are insufficient to deter Moscow from engaging in nuclear first-use blackmail or conventional threats. In the absence of a credible U.S. security umbrella for Europe, Russia would view NATO as a paper tiger.

In a post-American Europe, Moscow would establish a patchwork of individual relationships with European countries, confronting some with territorial threats and gray-zone tactics (such as disinformation campaigns) and rewarding others for their acquiescence with cheap energy. These circumstances could motivate some European countries to embrace neutrality or even partnership with Russia. No longer kept in check by a counterbalancing power such as the United States, Putin could reconstitute a sphere of influence in Europe. And then, the hegemonic transatlantic alliance—the dragon that Russian strategists have been trying to slay since the late 1990s—would be no more.

To be sure, Russia does not have the military capacity to capture much European territory outside Ukraine, and that is most likely not Moscow's underlying intention. But by terrifying and tempting Europe, Putin could drive a wedge in the transatlantic relationship and undermine the European project.

The prospect of a less committed United States instills fear in Europeans. It has already prompted higher defense spending in the EU. But the Europeans, including the United Kingdom, are still unprepared to take full responsibility for their own defense. They do not have the political will to take joint action. They lack the money, the military hardware (especially critical enablers such as intelligence and airlift capabilities), and the command-and-control structures necessary for any joint European defense. These capabilities will not be ready for years, possibly decades, and France's and the United Kingdom's nuclear umbrellas, even if extended to other European countries, are no match for Russia. Only the United States can ensure credible nuclear deterrence.

Some European countries, deserted by the United States and lacking a formidable European-only defense alliance, may be cowed into cutting deals with Moscow. They may reestablish trade relations or concede to Russian demands regarding the stationing of European troops and hardware. Europe is already rife with political parties willing to accommodate the Kremlin for short-term gain. And because the desired outcome—Europe's ability to defend itself without the United States—might take more than a decade to achieve, citizens may be reluctant to vote in politicians promising to invest in defense today.

Even countries willing to stand up to Russia might still be tempted to abandon lengthy joint European defense efforts for the sake of short-term bilateral deals with the United States. Poland has already asked the United States to deploy nuclear warheads on Polish soil instead of in western Europe. Should a race to secure favors from Washington ensue, Trump would relish playing the Europeans against each other. In time, the European security landscape could return to a pre-war hodgepodge of complex and confusing security deals and reassurance treaties, tying some countries to each other while excluding others. Amid the confusion, the emergence of rivalries among European countries is entirely possible. Whether the EU can withstand such developments, or whether it would survive at all without a U.S.-led NATO, is an open question. A brittle and acrimonious Europe would benefit only Russia.



To avert a drift toward division and conflict in Europe, the Trump administration should not consign Ukraine to Europe's periphery. Nor should it view Ukraine only in economic terms. Instead, Washington should build on the recently agreed-upon minerals deal and commit to Ukraine's long-term security; a sovereign Ukraine capable of defending itself would help to stabilize the entire region, a core U.S. interest.

Since its independence from the Soviet Union 1991, Ukraine has too often been denied a significant place in Europe's security architecture. At the 2008 Bucharest NATO summit, the alliance promised Ukraine membership, a promise that was callously forgotten. In multiple rounds of diplomacy in 2014 and 2015, after Russia's takeover of Crimea and incursion into Ukraine's Donbas region, France and Germany expended more effort on a cosmetic cessation of hostilities than on solving the underlying problems of regional security. The consequence, some eight years later, was Russia's brutal invasion, which has sent ripples of insecurity across Europe. Today, the status of Ukraine lies indisputably at the heart of European security.

Without the United States at its side in Ukraine, Europe would face impossible choices. European countries would have to fill gaps in their own security and defense investments, as well as Ukraine's. Limited resources, or pressure from Washington to moderate relations with Moscow, might induce the Europeans to cut back support for Kyiv, undermining their own long-term security in the process. Moreover, a U.S. abandonment of Ukraine would complicate NATO's ability to deter Russia. For now, Moscow is tied down in Ukraine and cannot afford to pursue more expansionist undertakings. But should the Trump administration decide that Ukraine does not merit U.S. partnership and cooperation, Putin's ambitions will only grow—along with the cost of deterring Russia in the future. If Washington abandons Ukraine now, Europe could become the consuming crisis of Trump's second term.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz expected to depart administration, sources say","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/politics/mike-waltz-national-security-adviser-depart","Thu, 01 May 2025 17:18:00 GMT","

Follow:


            National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to depart from the Trump administration in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN, the first major staff shakeup since the president took office in January.
    


            Waltz's job has been in limbo after it was made clear to him earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with the matter. Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are also expected to depart, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear.
    


            Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and even Secretary of State Marco Rubio have been floated to replace Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent replacement, according to a source familiar with the talks.
    


            Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made. But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly.
    


            Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals.
    


            “Why would he do that? Be saddled with managing the interagency instead of doing what he is doing now?” said a person familiar with Witkoff's thinking.
    


            Waltz had been on shaky ground – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes.
    


            Trump had considered firing him after the incident, but declined to do so because he didn't want to provide his enemies a perceived victory, and he hoped to avoid the type of chaos that colored his first administration.
    


            But while Trump stood by him at the time, Waltz's standing hadn't ever really recovered, according to four sources, and he lost clout with top aides inside the West Wing. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has privately been one of the officials most unimpressed with Waltz — even before the Signal fiasco.
    


            At 100 days into his second term, Trump no longer appears as concerned about the appearance of disorder. Multiple people familiar with the matter had increasingly described Waltz's potential ouster as a matter of “when, not if.” Mark Halperin first reported Waltz being pushed out.
    


            Watlz's influence internally had been waning for weeks, illustrated best by Trump's decision to dismiss several staffers from the National Security Council at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who told him they were disloyal. Loomer told CNN Thursday she had previously tried to raise concerns about Waltz directly with Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office, where Loomer was urging the removal of certain national security officials. She said she planned to show Trump a 2016 campaign ad in which Waltz criticized him, but before she could play the clip on her phone, Waltz entered the room.
    


            Loomer said she had also targeted Wong, citing his past work for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.
    


            Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to the news by saying Trump was firing the wrong national security official — they believed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserved the boot more after he discussed bomb targets in Yemen in the Signal chat.
    


            “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist on Signal was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.”
    


            But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was never able to move beyond the question of how Waltz invited Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic into the group chat in the first place, people familiar with the matter say.
    


            While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his Defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him.
    


            Hegseth also has more far support outside the administration through the Trump-inspired MAGA movement than Waltz, who was viewed with deep suspicion among the base. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz would not involve a Senate confirmation fight.
    


            Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.”
    


            Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he instead remained on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with the president to Michigan, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration.
    


            Asked about the impact of Waltz's dismissal, multiple foreign officials — including some from the Middle East — expressed apprehension about who would replace him. Many said the impact would all depend on who follows as national security adviser, and several said his ouster was expected.
    


            “Of all of them, we never thought he would be the first [to be fired],” said a senior western official.
    


            Behind the scenes, some administration officials had begun quietly discussing an off-ramp for Waltz over the last several days. Trump has expressed frustration with him on multiple fronts, including the Signal episode. He was also irritated the Florida congressional race to replace Waltz was closer than expected, two sources familiar with the conversations told CNN.
    


            But on Thursday, one administration official suggested the search for a soft landing spot was no longer a top priority.
    


            “President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” this source said.

• Waltz to leave post: National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to leave the Trump administration in the coming days, sources tell CNN, the first major departure of the president's second term. Waltz had been on shaky ground since he added a journalist to a group chat on military strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his deputy have been floated as possible temporary replacements, a source said.
    


• Tariff turmoil: President Donald Trump acknowledged his tariffs could impact US consumers — but downplayed the economy shrinking in the first quarter. Behind the scenes, White House officials describe intense pressure to produce trade deals as economic anxiety builds, sources tell CNN.
    


• Immigration ruling: A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas ruled that the president unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and blocked the administration from quickly deporting some alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.

            Most Americans are not too keen on the idea of Congress making major cuts to federal funding for Medicaid, according to a KFF poll released Thursday. Even a majority of Republicans feel that way, the poll found.
    


            The findings come as House Republicans are looking to slash hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending over the next decade as part of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package. The House committee that oversees Medicaid is expected to release more details next week.
    


            Here's more on the poll's findings:
    


• Just over three-quarters of the public oppose major Medicaid cuts, including 95% of Democrats, 79% of independents and 55% of Republicans.
    


• Similarly, a majority of all three groups oppose federal funding reductions for Medicare, Social Security and to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, but fewer than half of Republicans oppose the reduction of federal funding for HIV prevention programs, premium subsidies for people buying Obamacare plans and research at universities and medical centers.
    


• Those who identify as Make America Great Again supporters are split on Medicaid cuts, with 49% opposing a reduction. But a majority of this group opposes reductions for Medicare, Social Security and mental health and addiction prevention services. Like Republicans overall, fewer than half support federal funding for HIV prevention, Obamacare premium subsidies and research.
    


            The survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, is based on a nationally representative sample of 1,380 adults in the US who were surveyed during the 2nd full week in April.
    


            President Donald Trump told a group attending a National Day of Prayer event at the White House that he'd just left “a really great meeting” where he was updated on his sweeping bill on taxes.
    


            The president said that House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise were among those who attended the meeting.
    


                    Trump said he was being updated on “the progress of the one big, beautiful bill,” adding, “We love that bill. I won't like it if it doesn't pass, neither will you.”
                





            Yesterday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he plans to turn his attention on mustering congressional support for his party's tax bill.
    


            “And I just wanted to say the final details are coming together, and they're coming together rapidly, and I think we're right on schedule,” he said.
    


Sticking points: House Republicans are struggling to agree on key issues like Medicaid and raising the state and local tax deduction after a week of intense meetings and negotiations between swing district Republicans, key chairmen and leadership.
    


            The uncertainty about the path forward comes as hardliners remain dug in on wanting at least $1.5 trillion in cuts and as swing district Republicans are beginning to acknowledge that goal may not be achievable if they want to protect coverage for Medicaid recipients in their state.
    


CNN's Lauren Fox and Haley Talbot contributed to this reporting. 



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau have been floated to replace national security adviser Mike Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent pick, according to a source familiar with the talks.
    


            Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made.
    


            But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly.
    


            Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals.
    


            “Why would he do that? Be saddled with managing the interagency instead of doing what he is doing now?” said a person familiar with Witkoff's thinking.
    

National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to depart from the administration in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN's Kaitlan Collins reports.


This post has been updated with more reporting on Waltz's possible replacements. 



            The signing of a minerals deal between Ukraine and the United States is the “first result” of a meeting the countries' leaders had at the Vatican last weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today.
    


            The pair held a brief meeting before the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. Pictures released of the talk showed the leaders huddled in close discussion in an empty area of St. Peter's Basilica. Zelensky said he told Trump “about our readiness to conclude a deal” during the Vatican meeting.
    


            The Ukrainian leader called the minerals deal a “truly equal agreement” that “creates an opportunity for investment,” praising the Ukrainian delegation who worked on negotiations.
    


            “Our representatives worked very well. The agreement has changed significantly in the process of preparation,” he said. Zelensky said the deal is “debt-free” and will allow both the US and Ukraine to make money together.
    


            The Ukrainian leader called the Vatican meeting “meaningful” and said his country is “looking forward to the other results of our conversation,” without giving any more detail.
    


Remember: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and arranges for a joint investment fund that will pour money into Ukraine's natural resources.
    


            The pact features strong language on the war with Russia and is viewed as a way to further intertwine US economic interests with Ukraine's security needs, though it stops short of providing concrete security guarantees.
    


            A Donald Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has ruled that the president unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and is blocking the administration from quickly deporting some alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.
    


            US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas said Trump had unlawfully invoked the sweeping 18th century wartime authority to speed up some deportations. His decision means Trump cannot rely on the law to detain or deport any alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua within his district.
    


            The ruling is a significant blow to Trump's decision in March to invoke the act — a move that has faced numerous legal challenges and has been halted by several courts. But Rodriguez's ruling is the first to conclude that the president exceeded his authority by relying on a law that was intended to be used during times when the US is at war.
    


                    “Allowing the President to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope,” the judge wrote. “The law does not support such a position.”
                





            Although Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act has been litigated in multiple courts nationwide, including the Supreme Court, Rodriguez is the first judge to have reached a final decision on the merits.
    


            Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said he was not given a heads up that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be leaving the Trump administration. Waltz is expected to depart in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            “I had not heard about it until the middle of the hearing and so I really don't have anything to add at this point,” he told CNN after leaving a hearing for the panel.
    


            He would not answer when asked if he agrees with Democrats that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should also be held accountable and ousted over his involvement in the Signal chat scandal.
    


            Democratic Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Waltz's imminent departure from the administration “long overdue.” She said, “He's the guy who started the unclassified text chain when they were classified channels available. It's his responsibility, but I also think Pete Hegseth needs to be fired as well.”
    


            Duckworth said she thinks Trump is forcing out Waltz to protect Hegseth and that upheavals in the administration will continue because “people are scared to do their jobs.”
    


                    “People are concerned to share classified information. They don't trust that the secretary of defense knows how to manage classified information, and I think they're trying to get rid of this issue, but it is one of national security importance,” she said. 
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he also wasn't aware of Waltz's reported departure, and he wouldn't weigh in on Hegseth when asked if the defense secretary should also be held accountable for the now-infamous Signal chat.
    


This post has been updated with more reactions from lawmakers. 



            President Donald Trump praised members of his Cabinet by name at the top of a speech in the Rose Garden today, starting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who he said was doing “a fantastic job.”
    


            He did not mention national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom CNN reported is expected to depart the administration.
    


            Waltz and Hegseth were both involved in the Signal chat scandal involving the editor in chief of The Atlantic, with Hegseth also having shared detailed plans about a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen on a second Signal chat including family members.
    


            Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and others at the National Day of Prayer event.
    


            “Marco, when I have a problem, I call up Marco. He gets it solved,” Trump said of Rubio.
    


            Democratic senators said today that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should be ousted from the Trump administration, responding to reporting that national security adviser Mike Waltz will leave his position in the coming days.
    


            “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly told CNN, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist in a group chat discussing strike plans was an “unfortunate mistake,” but the “most troubling” part of the incident was Hegseth “sharing incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.”
    


            “That's where the accountability should be, not with the national security adviser. That's my view,” he added.
    


                    “I was surprised to see this. I think they fired the wrong guy,” he said.
                





            Asked if he's satisfied that someone is being held accountable for the group chat disclosing detailed military plans, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal answered, “The question is whether the right person's being held accountable.”
    


                    “There has to be accountability for the mistakes and the errors that have been made, but I think the secretary of defense ought to bear that responsibility. He should be fired,” he said, arguing Hegseth is responsible. 
                





            Meanwhile, Montana Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy said: “If Mike's leaving, that's the president's decision, and we support that.”
    


            “I'm frankly tired of hearing about Signal,” he said, praising the Trump administration for sending troops to the southern border and “putting terrorists back on their heels.”
    


            National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to leave the Trump administration in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            It would mark the first major departure from the administration during President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            His job has been in limbo since it was made clear to Waltz earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with what happened. Waltz had been attempting to stay on and attended yesterday's Cabinet meeting, appeared on Fox News and showed up to the West Wing today.
    


            But Waltz has been on shaky ground and lost most of his influence in the West Wing after he inadvertently added the editor in chief of The Atlantic to a group chat about military strikes in March.
    


            Trump stood by his national security adviser at the time, but Waltz's standing never really recovered, according to four sources. He had also lost his standing with top aides inside the West Wing.
    


            Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he remained behind at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with Trump to a Michigan rally, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration.
    


            Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, says he's “sure there'll be news by the end of the day” regarding a trade deal.
    


            Hassett, who made the comment in a CNBC interview today, declined to share which country the deal would be with. A likely candidate, however, is India.
    


On China: “We're pleased to see that last week China pulled back a bunch of tariffs on US products, perhaps in a show of good faith,” Hassett said during the same interview.
    


            China's pullback came after the US exempted certain electronics coming from China from 125% tariffs.
    


            China's response, Hassett said, “shows we're very close to making the kind of progress we need to move the ball forward.”
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading negotiations with China, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is leading negotiations with other countries.
    


            Hassett said he's confident Bessent will help get the deal done, saying his work on the Ukraine minerals deal was another sign of his leadership.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that lower Treasury yields and slower inflation suggest the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates.
    


            “We are seeing that two-year rates are now below Fed funds rates, so that's a market signal that they think the Fed should be cutting,” Bessent told Fox Business. “We've had some great inflation numbers. We had the biggest decrease in energy prices for a single month in years.”
    


By the numbers: The yield on the 2-year US Treasury note was 3.56% as of market open today compared to the Fed's benchmark lending rate at around 4.33%. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed's favored inflation gauge — registered a 2.3% annual rate in March, down from February's 2.7%.
    


Echoing Trump: Bessent's remarks come as President Donald Trump has recently publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, only softening his stance after advisers warned Trump that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


Unlikely to change: Fed officials, however, haven't signaled they're ready to resume lowering borrowing costs just yet. The central bank is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting next week, according to futures, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Last year, the Fed lowered its key interest rate by a full percentage point.
    


            Uncertainty over President Donald Trump's sweeping economic agenda and inflation's descent stalling out around the turn of the year have kept the Fed on hold. For the Fed to begin cutting again, central bankers will have to either see inflation continue to slow or the unemployment climb more than expected.
    


            The US Chamber of Commerce is asking the Trump administration to provide American businesses with sweeping relief from sky-high tariffs to avoid causing an economic downturn and wiping out countless small businesses.
    


            In a letter to Trump officials, US Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark warned that ending US tariffs imposed this year “is critical given the negative impact recent tariffs are having on the US economy, employers and American families.”
    


                    “We are deeply concerned that even if it only takes weeks or months to reach agreements, many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm,” Clark said in the Wednesday letter. “The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increase in tariff rates.”
                





            In order to “save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,” the chamber is requesting the administration immediately launch a tariff exclusion process.
    


            The business group argued the exclusion process should automatically exclude “any” small business importer from the new tariffs because smaller firms don't have the profit margins and financial resources to sustain higher tariffs.
    


            Additionally, the chamber wants the administration to provide “automatic” tariff exclusions for all products that can't be made in America or are not readily available from domestic sources such as on coffee, bananas, cocoa and certain minerals. The chamber is also asking for a process that would let businesses quickly get exclusions when they can demonstrate tariffs will kill jobs.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.
    


            Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said he expects that next week, “cargo coming into Los Angeles will be down 35% compared for a year ago” in response to tariffs.
    


                    “Many major retailers have told us they have about a six- to eight-week supply of inventory in their systems now,” Seroka said. “United States manufacturers and consumers alike will find difficult decisions in the weeks and months to come if policies don't change.”
                





            His comments come as some of the last cargo ships carrying Chinese goods without crippling tariffs are currently heading into US ports.
    


            Cargo on ships from China loaded after April 9 will carry with them the 145% tariff President Donald Trump slapped on goods from that nation last month. Next week, those goods will arrive, but there will be fewer ships at sea and they will be carrying less cargo. For many importers, it is too expensive to do business with China.
    


            Businesses are making a difficult choice: Continue selling products from China at more than double their previous prices or stop selling those products altogether. For consumers, that means some products will be hard to find or may be too expensive to buy.

            House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie will head to the White House this morning to meet with President Donald Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            The meeting comes at a key time when congressional Republicans are working to cut a deal on Trump's first big legislative package.
    


            Johnson was already expected at the White House to attend the morning prayer breakfast.
    


            The Trump administration's tariffs on imported cars and auto parts will cost General Motors between $4 billion and $5 billion this year. But in an interview on CNN, CEO Mary Barra said the company doesn't necessarily expect to pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of elevated prices.
    


            “We believe … pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” she told CNN's Erin Burnett today, although she added, “Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. We're going to respond to the market.”
    


            The company does expect the higher tariff costs to eat into its earnings as it slashed its profit guidance for the year, as revealed in a letter to shareholders from Barra released early this morning. The letter and guidance were delayed from their planned release on Tuesday, when the company reported lower first-quarter earnings and awaited tariff changes from the Trump administration.
    


            GM is the first major company to estimate, in dollars, how much President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs will cost it. Many others have walked back earnings forecasts because of the ensuing economic uncertainty.
    


            While GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest American automaker, with US sales of 2.7 million cars and trucks last year.

            President Donald Trump's family company has made two real estate announcements in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar just weeks ahead of the president's trip to the region.
    


            The announcements, which involve regional developers, come before Trump's first presidential trip of his second term to the wealthy Arab nations, which have pledged to invest trillions of dollars into the United States.
    


            The Trump Organization on Tuesday introduced the 80-floor Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, a $1 billion development where penthouses are going for $20 million.
    


            And yesterday, Qatari Diar, a real estate company owned by the natural gas-rich nation's sovereign wealth fund, signed an agreement with Dar Global to develop Trump International Golf Club, according to state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA). The 18-hole golf course will also include Trump-branded luxury villas. It is estimated the project will bring $2 billion in foreign investment into Qatar, QNA said.
    


            Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE from May 13 to May 16. The president fostered close ties with Gulf Arab states during his first term, choosing Saudi Arabia for his first presidential visit in 2017.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order establishing a religious liberty commission this morning, a White House official confirmed, during a National Day of Prayer event in the Rose Garden that is scheduled at 11 a.m. ET.
    


            Trump forecasted the action at the National Prayer Breakfast on Capitol Hill in February.
    


                    “I will be creating a brand-new presidential commission on religious liberty. It's going to be a very big deal, which will work tirelessly to uphold this most fundamental right,” Trump said at the time, saying that “this sacred liberty” has been “threatened like never before.”
                





            Previously, Trump signed an executive order targeting “anti-Christian bias,” and he has established a faith office within the White House.
    


            The Daily Wire first reported that Trump would sign the order establishing a religious liberty commission on Thursday.
    


            Job cuts by the government represented the largest chunk of layoffs so far this year, up 680% from the same period last year. Department of Government Efficiency-related cost-cutting led to a total of 281,452 layoffs.
    


            For the month of April, US-based employers announced plans to cut 105,441 jobs, according to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report released today. That's significantly higher than the 64,789 job cuts announced last April. However, a large chunk (40,000 jobs) of last month's layoff count can be attributed to plans tied to two major employers: UPS and Intel.
    


            Earlier this week, UPS said it plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a previously announced plan to increase automation and trim its Amazon business. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel was expected to cut 20,000 workers. The company has not announced specific details for potential upcoming layoffs.
    


            There is a clear trend of economic uncertainty weighing on businesses, noted Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement and business coaching firm.
    


                    “Though the government cuts are front and center, we saw job cuts across sectors last month,” he said in a statement. “Generally, companies are citing the economy and new technology. Employers are slow to hire and limiting hiring plans as they wait and see what will happen with trade, supply chain, and consumer spending.”
                





            The US Department of Health and Human Services this morning released a 400-page review of treatment for gender dysphoria in children but did not disclose who authored or reviewed the report.
    


            The report follows several actions by President Donald Trump's administration to halt gender-affirming treatment of transgender children and adolescents and cancel research about the transgender community.
    


                    “Contributors to the review include medical doctors, medical ethicists, and a methodologist. Contributors represent a wide range of political viewpoints and were chosen for their commitment to scientific principles,” HHS said in a news release about the review, adding that contributors' names are not initially being made public “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.”
                





            The agency said chapters of the report underwent peer review but did not specify who reviewed it. The agency also said it will undergo additional review “involving stakeholders with different perspectives” in the days ahead.
    


            The document, which includes sections on evidence, ethical considerations, psychotherapy and “clinical realities,” focuses on treatment of gender dysphoria in youths, not adults. HHS said the review finds that science and evidence do not support “these drastic medical interventions for our nation's youth.”
    


For context: Major mainstream medical associations — including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry — have affirmed the practice of gender-affirming care and agree that it's clinically appropriate care that can provide lifesaving treatment for children and adults.
    


            A growing number of states have enacted laws or policies that limit the kind of care young people can get. As of March, 27 states have enacted restrictions, meaning about 40% of trans youth live in a state with limited gender-affirming health care options, according to KFF, a health policy organization.
    


            More than 60% of the public opposes major cuts to health spending and staff at federal health agencies, according to a new poll from KFF.
    


            A similar share of the survey participants — including nearly all Democrats and most independents — say the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency have been “recklessly making broad cuts to programs and staff,” while a large majority of supporters of the Make America Great Again movement — including most non-MAGA Republicans and Republican leaners — say the administration is “carefully making cuts to programs and staff to reduce fraud and waste.”
    


            But more than three-quarters of participants say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, with even MAGA supporters closely divided on the issue.
    


            Protests under the “50501” movement — short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement — in response to the Trump administration's flurry of moves over its first 100 days are set to take place across the country today for May Day.
    


            May 1 marks May Day, which shares a date with International Workers' Day and is often a day for protests and civil action for labor rights.
    


            The 50501 movement sprang out of a Reddit forum and has held multiple national days of action the last few months.
    


            The most recent came on April 19 when crowds of people attended over 80 protests at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states to oppose what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.
    


            The planned protests come two days after Trump marked 100 days in office. In that short period, he has moved to upend the world order by cracking down on immigration and immigrants' rights; instituting tariffs that threaten global trade; dismantling the administrative state under the Department of Government Efficiency's slapdash cuts; rolling back protections for transgender people; and exercising executive power with disdain for checks and balances.
    


Read more here on the protests.



            In her first major address since leaving office, former Vice President and 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris blasted President Donald Trump's first 100 days, saying his agenda displays a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals.
    


            “Instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” Harris said. “And what we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage.”
    


            Harris also accused her former rival of setting off the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history through his tariffs, and warned that his conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis.

            Ukraine managed to wrangle some more favorable terms out of the United States before signing the long-awaited minerals deal on Wednesday.
    


            The agreement on natural resources was finally struck late on Wednesday, after weeks of tense bargaining that at times turned  sour and temporarily halted Washington's aid to Ukraine.
    


            Kyiv eventually convinced US President Donald Trump to drop some of his key demands but failed to make American security guarantees part of the agreement.
    


            Ukrainian officials touted the final accord as an equal partnership between Kyiv and Washington – a notable shift from some of the earlier drafts which were described by Ukraine's leader President Volodymyr Zelensky as the US asking him to “sell my country.”
    


            The signed deal, seen by CNN, does indeed appear to be more favorable to Ukraine than some of the previous versions. Here's what we know.
    


Aid: Crucially, the deal does not call for Kyiv to reimburse the US for the aid it has already received – a key concession from Trump who has long framed the agreement as Ukraine “paying back” the US.
    


            Washington initially demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine's rare earths and other minerals in exchange for the aid it has already provided to Kyiv. When Zelensky rejected that idea, Trump called him “a dictator.”
    


            Instead, the agreement that was inked on Wednesday says that future American military assistance to Ukraine will count as part of the US investment into a joint reconstruction investment fund that will be used to pour money into Ukraine's natural resources.
    


Natural resources: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and states that Kyiv will have the final say in what and where is being mined. Ukraine will also retain the ownership of the subsoil.
    


            “All resources on our territory and in our territorial waters belong to Ukraine. It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” said Ukraine's Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who signed the deal on behalf her country.
    


            And although Trump has referred to the agreement as a “rare earth” deal, the accord signed on Wednesday goes well beyond that by including other natural resources such as oil, natural gas, gold and copper.

The tone: In a win for Ukraine, the deal also adopts a strong language on the war with Russia itself. It points at Moscow as the aggressor in the conflict, diverging from some of Trump's previous false statements about Ukraine and Zelensky being responsible for the war.
    


            The deal also spells out the goal of the agreement as “a peaceful, sovereign and resilient Ukraine” – a notable step away from Trump saying earlier this year that, “Ukraine may be Russia some day.”
    


EU guarantees: It also keeps the door open for Ukraine's potential future membership in the European Union, saying that investment needs to be made in accordance with Ukraine's obligations as an EU candidate state. It adds that if Ukraine was to join the bloc in the future, this deal would be renegotiated “in good faith.”
    


A boost for the US: But the terms of the agreement also show the US has secured a host of advantages for itself.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized it as a “historic economic partnership,” saying in a statement that it “signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.”
    


            The agreement seen by CNN also specifies that the earnings and other payments made as part of the deal will be tax-free and not subject to any levies or duties by Ukraine.
    


            It also says that if a conflict arises between the wording of the agreement and Ukraine's law, the deal will have a legal precedent.
    


Security questions: Ukraine has dropped its key demand that the US provides security guarantees as part of this agreement. It was this demand that ultimately led to the shouty meeting between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office in February.
    


            Trump then refused to provide security guarantees, saying he wanted Ukraine to sign the agreement first and talk about guarantees later.
    


            At the time, Zelensky refused, but Ukrainian officials have since indicated that they believe that US investment and the presence of American companies in Ukraine will make Washington more interested in Ukraine's security.
    


Exclusive access for the US: While it ensures the US receives preferential access to Ukraine's mineral riches, the deal doesn't guarantee any exclusive rights.
    


Existing resources: The deal is limited to new projects, which means the US and Ukraine will have to invest in order to see profits. Existing mining operations that are already generating revenue for the Ukrainian government are excluded.
    


            This clause puts a question mark over the benefits of the deal for the US. While Ukraine has large reserves of several valuable materials, the process to extract some of them is expensive and technically difficult.
    


            Gavin Mudd, the director of the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre at the British Geological Survey, told the non-profit Science Media Center that the production of some minerals – such as titanium, lithium or graphite – could be achieved quickly, if the regions where the deposits are are secure.
    


            “However, in the case of rare earths, it will take years to ramp up capacity – studies will need to be completed to assess and determine how best to mine the deposits and process the ores and produce rich concentrate, and a new refinery will be needed to produce high purity metals and oxides for use in numerous technologies. All of this sits alongside the need to actually mine the minerals” he said.
    


            The Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine – to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands.
    


            Experts agree with that idea. Liam Peach and Hamad Hussain, economists at Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note on Thursday that the agreement “provides some reassurance that the Trump administration is not planning on abandoning Ukraine altogether” because it establishes US economic interests in Ukraine.
    


            The deal strengthens Ukraine's position, but doesn't necessarily bring the war closer to the end as it is separate from any negotiations with Russia. Those talks appear to be stalling, as Moscow continues to refuse a 30-day ceasefire agreement proposed by the US and agreed by Ukraine.
    


            Meanwhile, the devastating war keeps raging. Seven people died in occupied Ukraine Thursday, with Russian and Ukrainian officials trading claims over the attack
    


            Shelby Magid, the deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, wrote in a note that the deal puts the Ukrainians “in their strongest position yet with Washington since Trump took office.”
    


            The road to it was incredibly rocky, with the US temporarily suspending aid to Ukraine after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.
    


            Negotiations continued behind the scenes in the weeks that followed. In the meantime Trump began losing patience with Putin's stalling over a peace deal, giving an opening to Kyiv to repair ties.
    


            In the end, it seems that the two leaders just needed to talk to each other privately, without cameras and away from aides who have derailed the process in the past.
    


            Trump and Zelensky spoke at the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. A photograph of the two of them huddled together inside St. Peter's Basilica showed them in a discussion, leaning towards each other.
    


            Zelensky said on Thursday the signing of the minerals deal was “the first result of the Vatican meeting.”
    


            “President Trump and I used every minute of our time to the fullest. I am grateful for that,” he said.
    


            It was after this meeting that Trump questioned whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin wants a peace deal and floated the idea of imposing more sanctions on Moscow. Just days later, the minerals deal was signed.
    


            “Ukrainian officials showed they could manoeuvre and persevere to ultimately get a fair deal. While the Trump administration put tremendous pressure on Ukraine to accept earlier deals, Ukraine managed to show that it is not just a junior partner that has to roll over and accept a bad deal,” Magid said.
    


            However, there was some more drama on Wednesday, when a last-minute disagreement over which documents would be signed on Wednesday threatened to derail the deal.
    


            Materials such as graphite, lithium, uranium and the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths are critical for economic growth and national security.
    


            They are essential to the production of electronics, clean energy technology, including wind turbines, energy networks and electric vehicles, as well as some weapons systems.
    


            China has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials, leaving Western countries desperate for other alternative sources – including Ukraine.
    


            The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency.
    


            Ukraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government.
    


            The country has some of the world's largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation.

            In his bid to unseat Rep. Andre Carson, the 50-year-old Democrat who has represented Indiana's 7th Congressional District since 2008, 34-year-old challenger George Hornedo has argued the Democratic Party isn't working, nationally or locally.
    


            Some voters in the district are open to hearing him out.
    


            Maria Langston, a 69-year-old retiree and longtime Carson supporter, said she “would be open” to voting for Hornedo. She added that she wanted Carson to increase his “visibility within the neighborhood” and play more of a role in building the Democratic Party, which is out of power across all branches of Indiana's government and has few pockets of political clout outside Indianapolis, the solidly blue population center in the deep-red state.
    


            “We have to rebuild our leaders. We have to identify the leaders,” she said. “A lot of people have become too complacent, and that might be some of our Democratic leaders.”
    


            Putting a finer point on her message to the party, Langston added: “Come on, Democrats — let's do something.”
    


            Hornedo is part of a growing wave of young Democrats who have launched bids to shake up the party's ranks by ousting incumbent House members in deep blue seats. They see voter frustrations with what they've described as Democrats' ineffective response to President Donald Trump's actions as a mandate to remake the party.
    


            Leaders We Deserve, a group led by Democratic National Committee ﻿Vice Chair David Hogg, is planning to spend $20 million to boost young candidates, including some seeking to oust Democratic incumbents in safe seats. Justice Democrats, the organization that supported New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's successful 2018 primary run, announced its first challenge of the 2026 cycle Monday. So far, more than half a dozen young Democrats have launched campaigns against those in the party they say aren't doing enough to combat Trump's agenda.
    


            Many of those candidates are making cases for generational change.
    


            “It is about needing new energy in Congress to actually meet the moment where we are,” said 37-year-old Jake Rakov, who is challenging his former boss, 15-term Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California. “We just need people who are more active communicators, who can move the party into the 21st century and don't operate like it's 1996.”
    


            For others, it's about tactics – and volume.
    


            The 26-year-old social media star Kat Abughazaleh, who launched her run against Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky before reports the 80-year-old progressive planned to retire, said frustration with Democrats' response to Trump is “probably what unites a lot of us” who are taking on House incumbents.
    


            “We're done with this administration and we don't think that Democrats are doing enough,” she said. “We can't be like Chuck Schumer and write a bunch of strongly-worded letters for a president who doesn't like reading.”
    


            Abughazaleh said she has spoken with a number of other Democrats considering their own campaigns, and is planning a May video call to talk with many of them. Schakowsky, meanwhile, said in a statement she has not yet made a decision and will announce whether she will seek reelection in a May 5 speech.
    


            The spate of primary challenges comes amid a broader debate within the Democratic Party about how best to counter the president and reach the voters who handed Republicans full control of Washington in last year's elections. In some cases, the push for younger leaders has also extended a difficult conversation about age and fitness in the wake of President Joe Biden's late exit from the 2024 presidential race.
    


            The debate is playing out in midterm races, within the Democratic National Committee and in the earliest stages of the 2028 presidential primary contest, as potential contenders use rallies, speeches and podcasts to begin to position themselves and test messaging.
    


            The House primary races could test how strong the Democratic electorate's appetite is for fresh faces, and whether any new approaches are effective. The internal tensions come as the party faces questions about its image with voters – fueled by dissatisfaction within its own ranks. A recent CNN poll found just 38% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents approve of the party's leadership while anger with politics has swelled to 70% among Democratic-aligned Americans.
    


            As of now, the various primary efforts aren't connected. But they all share a common theme: a complaint that many of the Democratic Party's current leaders are relying on an outdated political playbook and failing to address the perceived overreaches of the second Trump administration with sufficient energy.
    


            Justice Democrats is returning to its roots of supporting primary challenges to Democrats after spending the 2024 cycle focused on protecting progressive incumbents. (Two of its endorsed candidates – former Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush – lost their primaries last year.) The group is actively recruiting candidates.
    


            “We feel like there is a mandate for us, based on the results in November, to help reshape and transform this Democratic Party, as we've tried to do since the start of this organization,” Usamah Andrabi, Justice Democrats' communication director, said in an interview.
    


            The group's first target is two-term Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar, a 70-year-old multimillionaire the group plans to frame as the Elon Musk of Detroit. Justice Democrats is backing 32-year-old state Rep. Donavan McKinney in the Detroit-area 13th Congressional District.
    


            As he confronts fresh political pressure from the progressive wing of the party, Thanedar this week introduced articles of impeachment against Trump. “We cannot wait for more damage to be done,” he said in a statement. “Congress must act.”
    


            The current wave of young primary challengers shares some common themes with the 2018 midterm election cycle, when candidates backed by Justice Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley and other progressive lawmakers who are part of “The Squad” beat longtime incumbents or won crowded primaries for safe seats. Now, however, candidates and organizations pushing for new leaders say the stakes are higher and the anger and frustration of the party base is more intense.
    


            Saikat Chakrabarti, a co-founder of Justice Democrats who is now challenging former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said he's in contact with other young Democrats running for office and has encouraged other would be challengers to launch campaigns.
    


            The 39-year-old said he was inspired to challenge Pelosi, 85, after she maneuvered to block Ocasio-Cortez's bid to become the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. The member Pelosi backed, 75-year-old Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, announced this week that he would step down from the leadership post on the committee due to health concerns and retire at the end of his term.
    


            “We need our best fighters in there,” Chakrabarti said. “This is long past the time of the politics of loyalty and seniority.”
    


            A spokesperson for Pelosi declined an interview request for this article.
    


            Hogg, however, said he would not support primary challenges against members like Pelosi, who he credited with leading House Democrats' resistance to Trump in 2018 and who he said needed to be there to mentor the next generation of Democrats. He is also not backing candidates who are running to the right of safe seat incumbents.
    


            Still, Hogg has angered party leaders by attempting to launch his own wave of challengers while being a party leader. The national party, they argue, should project neutrality. Later this year, the committee will consider an expanded neutrality clause that would force Hogg to choose between challenging incumbents and maintaining his leadership role. Hogg has said he believes the committee is preparing to “remove” him.
    


            Despite the controversy, Hogg has argued Democrats need to challenge what he deems “ineffective” lawmakers in safe seats to rebuild the party and improve its standing with voters.
    


            “We're going to have to challenge people. We're going to have to shake things up, especially if our approval rating is at 27,” he said. “There is no amount of messaging that is going to get us out of that.”
    


            Sherman, as well as other critics of the primary efforts, argue that Democrats could jeopardize their chances of retaking the House if they have to direct resources toward defending party members, and that incumbents in safe seats would have to spend money on themselves that could go toward flipping GOP-held seats. He also pushed back on the idea that Democrats need to radically transform the party.
    


            “The fact is, we are doing a hell of a job,” he told CNN.
    


            “We are winning, and maybe we're winning because the other side is screwing up, or maybe we're winning because we're doing a good job, but the polls right now are very good,” he added, referencing Trump's declining approval ratings and Democrats' standing on the generic ballot.
    


            But Democratic challengers are calling for more urgent and engaging representation in Congress.
    


            Everton Blair, a 33-year-old Georgia educator, announced a bid to unseat 12-term incumbent Democratic Rep. David Scott in Georgia's heavily Democratic 13th Congressional District last month, arguing voters there are “fed up” and need an “alternative.”
    


            Scott, 79, was first elected to Congress in 2002 and fended off multiple Democratic primary challenges in past cycles. In 2024, Scott secured enough votes to avoid a primary runoff when he faced six Democratic challengers in a district that was redrawn months prior.
    


            But Blair, a former chair of the Gwinnett County Board of Education, said this year's contest is different.
    


            “Somebody's got to do something, and I think we've witnessed what running the same tired playbook gets us,” said Blair, one of several Democrats planning to challenge Scott in 2026. “It's on us now. If we don't learn from this lesson and if we don't bring up a new bench of leaders, then we are the ones to blame when we don't succeed.”
    


            In interviews with Democratic primary voters in Indianapolis, conversations about the contest between Carson and Hornedo quickly shifted to concerns about the party's larger leadership vacuum.
    


            On a recent Saturday morning, Hornedo volunteered to clear invasive plants from an Indianapolis park. Several other volunteers said they'd gotten to know him through neighborhood association meetings.
    


            Thuriya Sai, a 29-year-old nonprofit worker who moved to Indianapolis last year and plans to vote in next year's Democratic primary, said he'll be closely watching where the two candidates' funding comes from.
    


            He said he is looking for candidates who “say what they're thinking and won't just be bootlickers to established Democrats.”
    


            Erica Johnson, a 62-year-old Indianapolis resident, said she's met Hornedo three times at neighborhood association meetings.
    


            As for Carson, she said: “Only time I see him is on TV.”
    


            Hornedo, she said, has already earned her support.
    


            “He deals with the people,” Johnson said of Hornedo. “He doesn't shy away. He comes to the meetings, he answers our questions, he stays. So of course I'm going to vote for him.”
    


            Carson, though, has the tried-and-true advantages of incumbency and deep connections to community leaders on his side — and those political assets could prove too much to overcome in a primary contest featuring a first-time candidate taking on an incumbent who is universally known in the district.
    


            His grandmother, Julia Carson, held the 7th District seat until her death in 2007. Andre Carson won a 2008 special election to replace her, and has held the seat since. No opponent has ever come within single digits of Carson in a primary or general election.
    


            At a recent Light of the World Christian Church event honoring the career of Bishop Tom Garrott Benjamin Jr., an influential Black leader in the city, Carson — who is Muslim — was invited on stage.
    


            “We live in a world where everyone's trying to amass power, but the power lives with the people,” he told the crowd. “Your job as a leader isn't to lord and master and rule over other people.”
    


            In an interview, Carson said Democrats in his district are looking for activism in taking on Trump, but it comes with a “Hoosier sensibility.”
    


            He touted his role in securing federal funding for $1 billion in projects in Indianapolis, as well as presiding over a House Intelligence subcommittee holding the first congressional hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years. Carson also said he was open to debating Hornedo or participating in forums.
    


            Most attendees CNN approached said they strongly support Carson, and many said they know him personally — some for decades.
    


            “I think he's a great leader. So was his grandma,” said Donna Perkins, 69, a retiree.
    


            “Anytime there's anything in the community, he shows up if you need him,” she said. “I think he's in the fight for us.”
    


            John Hall, a 78-year-old retiree who calls himself a political independent, said he has voted for Republicans for other offices but likes Carson and considers him “one of us.”
    


            “I'm talking about who's lived in this area, who's lived in this district, who's worked in this district, before you even become a representative,” he said.

            The “Chapel Bill” era has already taken an interesting route in North Carolina, despite the famed Super Bowl-winning head coach having yet to lead the Tar Heels in a game.
    


            Bill Belichick defended his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, after an interview he sat for, which aired on “CBS Sunday Morning” last weekend.
    


            The interview featured a now-viral moment where Hudson quickly interrupted after the 73-year-old was asked by reporter Tony Dokoupil how Belichick and Hudson had first met.
    


            Belichick, who was hired as North Carolina's new head football coach in December, said CBS did not honor the expectations set for the interview.
    


            “I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep that conversation centered on the book,” Belichick said in a statement through the university on Wednesday. “After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.”
    


            Belichick, the second-most winningest head coach in NFL history, backed Hudson, adding she “was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track.”

            In the statement, the coach questioned how the interview was edited after it took place to make it seem like they “were avoiding the question of how we met.”
    


            Belichick said Wednesday that the couple met on a 2021 flight to Palm Beach, Florida. The admission matched an Instagram post from Hudson earlier this year, which she said they met in February 2021.
    


            The eight-minute CBS interview with Belichick was about his life in football ahead of the release of his new book, “The Art of Winning” – set to be published by Simon & Schuster in early May.
    


            Dokoupil asked Belichick how he handles the public's “invested” interest in his relationship with his girlfriend.
    


            “Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,” Belichick said. “Just trying to do what's best for me and what's right.”
    


            Belichick was then asked how the pair met. Hudson jumped in from off-camera, saying, “We're not talking about this.”
    


            Dokoupil later referred to the 24-year-old Hudson as a “constant presence” during the taping of the interview.
    


            “The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,” Belichick said.
    


            “Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative – that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation – which is simply not true.”
    


            CBS responded to Belichick's statement later Wednesday, saying it was agreed upon to be a “wide-ranging” interview.
    


            “There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation,” a CBS spokesperson said in a statement. “This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.”
    


            The Tar Heels' job is the first college coaching job for Belichick, who has won eight Super Bowls as an NFL coach (six as the head coach of the New England Patriots and two as a defensive coordinator for the New York Giants), since he and the Patriots parted ways in January 2024.
    


            In addition to 24 seasons with the Patriots, Belichick was head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 1991 to 1995.

            Former Vice President Kamala Harris rebuked President Donald Trump in her first major speech since leaving office, accusing her former rival of setting off the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history through his across-the-board tariffs, and warning that his conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis.
    


            Harris spoke Wednesday evening at the Emerge Gala in San Francisco, benefitting an organization that supports women interested in entering politics. The 2024 Democratic presidential nominee marked the first 100 days of the second Trump administration during her address, saying that “instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.”
    


            “And what we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage,” Harris added.
    


            The former vice president delivered a series of attacks on the administration, blaming Trump for the economic turbulence caused by the tariffs he has imposed on goods imported from major trading partners.

            Harris called Trump's tariffs “reckless” and said, “as I predicted,” they are “clearly inviting a recession.”
    


            Harris said those import taxes will “hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials, devastate their retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into, and paralyze American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people.”
    


            Trump has said the across-the-board tariffs are meant to correct a trade imbalance with other countries and restore US manufacturing jobs. However, the administration's policy changes have rocked global markets and added to mounting economic pressure on the US economy. Official data released Wednesday showed the economy contracted in the first quarter by 0.3%.
    


            Harris told Democrats there is a method behind the break-neck pace of policy rollouts of the Trump administration, calling the president a “vessel” of a much larger conservative project.
    


            “Friends, please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. I know it may feel that way, but understand, what we are in fact witnessing is a high velocity event where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making,” the former vice president said.
    


            Harris' speech on Wednesday comes at an inflection point for the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, with weighty questions about both her own path forward and that of her party.
    


            In the wake of last year's loss, Harris and her team began debating her next steps, considering another run for president in 2028, or a return to her home state for a 2026 gubernatorial run. Notably, Harris' public address on Wednesday took place in California. “It's wonderful to be home,” Harris said during her speech.
    


            Harris' advisors believe that getting into the governor's race would require making her intentions clear at the latest by the summer of 2025, but she faces some pressure to make a decision soon – that contest is heating up, with Democratic former Rep. Katie Porter, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, and several other prominent contenders having already launched campaigns.
    


            Whether she enters the California race as a heavy favorite, or holds out for the 2028 presidential primary, a less certain proposition, Harris' remarks Wednesday also reflect a deliberate reemergence, months after her defeat, as Democrats look for leadership amid the turbulence of the new Trump administration.

            As she lambasted the Trump administration Wednesday night for attempting to “divide and conquer,” Harris urged Democrats to stay together.
    


            She also highlighted several lawmakers across the party's ideological spectrum who she said have “in different ways have been speaking with moral clarity about this moment.” Harris named New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
    


            “I am not here tonight to offer all the answers. But I am here to say this: You are not alone, and we are all in this together,” Harris said. “And straight talk: Things are probably going to get worse before they get better,” she said. “But we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader.”
    


            For Harris, the speech was part of a slow return to the public eye after leaving office in January.
    


            The former vice president is slated to do a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in New York City on Tuesday, per a source who received an invitation. In recent months, Harris has also been regularly soliciting funds for the committee using the extensive email list she helped develop during the 2024 campaign.
    


            Earlier this month, Harris began ramping up her public criticism of her former rival, appearing at the Leading Women Defined Summit, also in California, to share her misgivings about the course of events since Trump's inauguration. “There were many things we knew would happen,” Harris said in a video of her remarks. “I'm not here to say I told you so,” she added before laughing.
    


            Harris' speech Wednesday included sober warnings about the potential for a “constitutional crisis” as she suggested that checks and balances within the government had begun to “buckle” amid the administration's clashes with the courts.
    


            “We are living in a moment where the checks and balances on which we have historically relied have begun to buckle,” Harris. “And we here know that when the checks and balances ultimately collapse, if Congress fails to do its part, or if the courts fail to do their part, or if both do their part but the president defies them anyway - well friends that is called a constitutional crisis. And that is a crisis that will eventually impact everyone.”
    


            She added, “The one check, the one balance, the one power that must not fail is the voice of the people.”
    


            From immigration fights to defending President Trump's federal government cutbacks, the Justice Department has responded to more than a hundred emergency lawsuits in the first hundred days, in some case clashing publicly with judges as the administration lays out an expansive view of executive authority.

            Harris' condemnation of the administration Wednesday – her most direct comments this year – adds to an increasingly crowded Democratic chorus. Several other prominent party members have been active during Harris' quiet period, taking advantage of the leadership vacuum to elevate their national profiles, some with an eye toward 2028.
    


            Sen. Bernie Sanders has been touring the country with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in an attempt to galvanize the party's progressive base around fighting “oligarchy”; California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sparred with far-right leaders on his new podcast in an effort to broaden Democratic messaging; and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker traveled to the early-voting state of New Hampshire and accused parts of his own party of “simpering timidity” in the face of Trump's sweeping early actions.
    


            Meanwhile, Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has been publicly reflecting on lessons learned from the ticket's loss last year. And Walz also spoke to the delicate balance of setting the stage for the 2028 presidential race during an appearance earlier this week at Harvard University.
    


            “If people think you're hungry for the office rather than the moment that we're in and the fighting of this, I think they're going to bury you. I think people are like, not very patient right now for the politics as usual,” Walz said.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the Trump administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.

WASHINGTON (AP) — White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans, according to two people familiar with the matter Thursday, marking the first major staff shake-up of President Donald Trump's second term. 

Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. 

Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, is also expected to depart, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel move not yet made public. The National Security Council did not respond do a request for comment. 

Waltz, who served in the House representing Florida for three terms before his elevation to the White House, is the most prominent senior administration official to depart since Trump returned to the White House. In his second term, the Republican president had been looking to avoid the tumult of his first four years in office, during which he cycled through four national security advisers, four White House chiefs of staff and two secretaries of state.




The Signal chain also showed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop. Waltz had previously taken “full responsibility” for building the message chain and administration officials described the episode as a “mistake” but one that caused Americans no harm. Waltz maintained that he was not sure how Goldberg ended up in the messaging chain, and insisted he did not know the journalist. 

Trump and the White House — which insisted that no classified information was shared on the text chain — have stood by Waltz publicly throughout the episode. But the embattled national security adviser was also under siege from personalities such as Loomer, who had been complaining to administration officials that she had been excluded from the vetting process for National Security Council aides. In her view, Waltz relied too much on “neocons” — referring to hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party — as well as others who Loomer argued were “not-MAGA-enough” types.

Waltz was on television as late as Thursday morning, promoting the administration's agreement with Kyiv that would allow the U.S. to access Ukraine's critical minerals and other natural resources. As reports began to circulate that Waltz could be leaving the administration, Loomer appeared to take credit in a post on the social media site X, writing: “SCALP.”

“Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart,” Loomer wrote in another post.

Loomer had taken a similar victory lap when several other NSC officials were dismissed last month one day after she met with Trump. Those firings included Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs; and David Feith, a senior director for technology and national security, as well as other lower-ranking aides. 

Waltz's resignation comes as questions are swirling around Hegseth and his role in the Signal chat. 

While Waltz set it up, Hegseth posted times for aircraft launches and bomb drops into the unsecured app and shared the same information with dozens of people in a second chat, including his wife and brother. 

The Associated Press reported that Hegseth also bypassed Pentagon security protocols to set up an unsecured line for a personal computer in his office –- beside terminals where he was receiving classified information. That raises the possibility that sensitive information could have been put at risk of potential hacking or surveillance. 

The Pentagon inspector general is investigating Hegseth's use of Signal, and he has faced criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. It has added to the turmoil at the Pentagon at a time when Hegseth has dismissed or transferred multiple close advisers. Nonetheless, Trump has maintained public confidence in Hegseth.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the Trump administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. That's according to two people familiar with the matter, which marks the first major staff shakeup of President Donald Trump's second term.

Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.

Other news we're following:



The president signed an executive order creating the panel during a White House Rose Garden ceremony to recognize the National Day of Prayer.

Its members include Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, former U.S. housing secretary Ben Carson and TV talk-show host Phil McGraw. The commission was Patrick's idea, Trump said.

Patrick told Trump, “There has never been a president who has invoked the name of Jesus more than you.”

McGraw said Trump is a “man of deep faith … who wants this country to have a heart and have religion.”

The meeting Tuesday was the first known Trump administration contact with Syrian officials since the fall of President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December.

The new Syrian authorities arrived in the U.S. last week to attend a series of meetings in Washington and New York as part of an effort to urge relief from harsh sanctions that were imposed by America and its allies after Assad's brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that spiraled into a civil war.

In a statement released Wednesday, the State Department said while they do not discuss “private diplomatic conversations,” they continue to urge the interim authorities to “choose policies that will reinforce stability” for Syrians, “assure peace with Syria's neighbors,” while developing the war-torn country's economy.

“Any future normalization of relations or lifting of sanctions will depend on the interim authorities' actions and positive response to the specific confidence building measures we have communicated,” the State Department said.

Addressing a National Day of Prayer Event in the White House Rose Garden, Trump vowed: “We're bringing back religion in our country” and doing so “quickly and strongly.”

The president used the occasion to again promise that tax-cut legislation would work its way through Congress.

Trump noted that he was addressing “a religious ceremony” but, added that, to him, “That's part of the religion because, if your taxes go up” than some people “might give up your religion.”

“You might have no choice. You'll be working too hard to try and make it,” he said if taxes rise.

A Pentagon report released Thursday says there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023.

It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.

Defense officials say that while the decline is a good sign, the numbers of reported assaults are still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.

U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. is the first judge to rule that the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used against people whom the Republican administration claims are gang members invading the United States.

“Neither the Court nor the parties question that the Executive Branch can direct the detention and removal of aliens who engage in criminal activity in the United States,” Rodriguez wrote Thursday. But, he said, “the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.”

In March, Trump issued a proclamation claiming the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the U.S. He said he had special powers to deport immigrants, identified by his administration as gang members, without the usual court proceedings.

The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, most recently during World War II, when it was cited to intern Japanese-Americans.

The proclamation triggered a flurry of litigation as the administration tried to ship migrants it claimed were gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Rodriguez's ruling is significant because it is the first formal permanent injunction against the administration using the AEA and contends the president is misusing the law.

For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.

More than 20 of the agency's roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.

Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.

The reversals are the latest example of the haphazard approach to cuts at the agency, which have shrunk FDA's staff by an estimated 20%. In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days.

That's according to two people familiar with the matter, which marks the first major staff shakeup of President Trump's second term.

“It was a good conversation,” Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing. “Even though there wasn't a specific agreement, the important thing is that we're working on it.”

Sheinbaum, who said she and Trump spoke for 10 to 15 minutes Thursday morning, noted that the Trump administration had relaxed some of the tariffs on automobiles and auto parts this week, but said Mexico is still looking for a better deal for the automotive sector, as well as for steel and aluminum which face their own U.S. tariffs.

The U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit with Mexico, she said, noting that Mexico was working to find ways to help them do that.

The leaders agreed that their cabinet secretaries would continue negotiating.

“It is a good sign that we continue advancing,” she said.

French union leaders condemned the “Trumpization” of world politics, while in Italy, May Day protesters paraded a puppet of the American president through the streets of Turin.

Across continents, hundreds of thousands turned out for Thursday's rallies marking International Workers' Day, many united in anger over President Trump's agenda — from aggressive tariffs stoking fears of global economic turmoil to immigration crackdowns.

In the United States, organizers framed this year's protests as a pushback against what they called a sweeping assault on labor protections, diversity initiatives and federal employees.

In Germany, union leaders warned that extended workdays and rising anti-immigrant sentiment were dismantling labor protections. In Bern, Switzerland, thousands marched behind banners denouncing fascism and war — part of a wider backlash against the global surge of hard-right politics.

President Trump will travel to heavily Republican Alabama on Thursday to speak to graduating students at the University of Alabama, where he's expected to draw some protesters despite enjoying a deep well of support in the state.

Trump's evening remarks in Tuscaloosa will be the Republican president's first address to graduates in his second term and will come as he's been celebrating the first 100 days of his administration.

The White House did not offer any details about Trump's planned message.

Alabama, where Trump won a commanding 64% of the vote in 2024, is where he's staged a number of his trademark large rallies over the past decade. It also is where Trump showed early signs of strength in his first presidential campaign when he began filling stadiums for his rallies.

Administration officials say they're seeking a permanent home at the State Department for a memorial honoring fallen staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The memorial bears the names of 99 USAID and other foreign assistance workers killed in the line of duty around the world.

The Trump administration has dismantled USAID and terminated most of its programs and staff, accusing its humanitarian and development work of being wasteful and out of line with Trump's agenda. Past presidents since John F. Kennedy argued that working for a more stable and prosperous world benefited U.S. security.

The State Department says workers removed the memorial from the former USAID headquarters Wednesday. It's being held in a temporary location, the agency said.

Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller says former Vice President Kamala Harris' criticism of Trump are a “great reminder to the American people of just how blessed we all are that the leader sitting in the Oval Office today is President Donald Trump and not President Kamala Harris.”

“It would have been the end of America,” Miller said at a briefing with reporters at the White House on Thursday.

Harris said in a speech Wednesday night that Trump's tariffs are “clearly inviting a recession.”

Miller countered that, “The only things Americans want to hear from Kamala Harris is an apology” for less strict immigration policies and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said was “unforgivable.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “I think I speak for everyone at the White House, we encourage Kamala Harris to continue going out and do speaking engagements.”

The planned negotiations between Iran and the United States this weekend over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program have been postponed, Oman announced Thursday.

A message online from Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi made the announcement in a post on the social media platform X.

“For logistical reasons we are rescheduling the US Iran meeting provisionally planned for Saturday May 3rd,” he wrote. “New dates will be announced when mutually agreed.”

Al-Busaidi did not elaborate. Iran and the U.S. did not immediately acknowledge al-Busaidi's comments.

The talks Saturday were to be held in Rome.

Trump said children maybe “will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”

Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller insisted Thursday that the president was “making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with.”

In a briefing with reporters, Miller said dolls made in the U.S. had higher quality standards than ones from China that he said could contain lead paint.

“Yes, you'd probably be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,” Miller said.

China's state broadcaster has claimed in a social media post that the Trump administration has been seeking contact with Beijing through multiple channels to start negotiations over tariffs.

In a climbdown, the post by China Central Television says there's no need for China to talk with the U.S. before the U.S. takes any substantive act but also said “there is no harm” for contact.

“China needs to observe or even force out the true intent on the U.S. side to stay proactive in the talks,” reads the post.

Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said she also understands “it's getting close” for talks between the two sides but such talks will be at the working level, not yet between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

There's trouble as House Republicans race to build Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, especially over its trillions in costs and potential Medicaid changes.

Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, tax writing committee chairman Rep. Jason Smith and the chairman handling health programs, Brett Guthrie, are meeting with Trump.

Trump's administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia.

The Health and Human Services report questions standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and is likely to be used to bolster the government's abrupt shift in how to care for a subset of the population that has become a political lightning rod.

This new “best practices” report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19.

“Our duty is to protect our nation's children — not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. “We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.”

After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a deal that's expected to give Washington access to the country's critical minerals and other natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia.

According to Ukrainian officials, the version of the deal signed Wednesday is far more beneficial to Ukraine than previous versions, which they said reduced Kyiv to a junior partner and gave Washington unprecedented rights to the country's resources.

The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.

It doesn't include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new investments. Ukrainian officials have also noted that it doesn't refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits from the fund will likely not go toward the paying the U.S. back for its previous support.

To understand the Justice Department's struggles in representing President Trump's positions in court, look no further than a succession of losses last week that dealt a setback to the administration's agenda.

In orders spanning different courthouses, judges blocked a White House plan to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, ruled the Republican administration violated a settlement agreement by deporting a man to El Salvador and halted directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

That's on top of arguments in which two judges expressed misgivings to a Justice Department lawyer about the legality of Trump executive orders targeting major law firms and a department lawyer's accidental filing of an internal memo in court questioning the Trump administration's legal strategy to kill Manhattan's congestion toll — a blunder the Transportation Department called “legal malpractice.”

Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.

The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day — mostly from China — is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.

But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.

The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the U.S., fueling a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech Wednesday to sharply criticize President Donald Trump. She criticized the Republican president's handling of the economy, U.S. institutions and foreign policy.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech to sharply criticize Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor.

In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said Wednesday she's inspired by Americans fighting Trump's agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood.

Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November.

In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair.

Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar” and a “great candidate,” and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign.

Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda.

The 49-49 vote came weeks after the Senate approved a resolution that would have thwarted Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage.

PHOENIX (AP) — As a first-generation college student, Austin Kissinger was looking forward to celebrating graduation with others of similar backgrounds who helped each other find their way at the University of Kentucky. Typically, Kentucky students who are the first in their family to graduate from college pick a faculty member to join them in a special ceremony.

Earlier this month, the university canceled the ceremony, along with other convocations that recognize Black and LGBTQ+ students, citing the Trump administration's campaign to rein in diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

Those student groups pooled resources for a celebration together off campus — without the school's involvement — but Kissinger said the about-face left him and others feeling unsupported.

“It's kind of like you're taking away our celebration, like you're not letting us embrace who we want to be,” said Kissinger, a graduating senior who leads the university's First Generation Student Organization. “You're not letting us represent what we do at the university.”

President Donald Trump's calls to eliminate any program that treats students differently because of their race have brought new scrutiny of affinity graduation ceremonies. The events have long been a way to build community and recognize the achievements and unique experiences of underrepresented students.

Many affinity ceremonies are on track to proceed as usual around the country, with colleges saying the events comply with new guidance.




But some colleges are pulling back support. Those include Harvard University, which is battling the Trump administration over demands related to campus activism and diversity efforts on campus. Despite suing the administration over some of its attempts to force changes on campus, Harvard told students it would no longer provide funding, staffing or spaces for affinity celebrations, the Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported.

At the University of Kentucky, spokesperson Jay Blanton said the main commencement celebrates all students. He said the university did away with others to comply with the law and “how we believe it is being interpreted by the administration.”

“The success and support of our students is a principle and purpose that is incredibly important to us. Everything we do on this campus, we do with that in mind as our goal,” Blanton said. “At the same time, we believe we must comply with the law and are doing so here.”

Around the country, universities have come under increasing pressure to get in line with the political agenda of Trump's administration, which already has frozen billions of dollars in grants for Harvard, Columbia University and other colleges over allegations they have not done enough to counter antisemitism.

The Education Department directed colleges to distance themselves from DEI with a “Dear Colleague” letter in February. It said a 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing the use of racial preferences in college admissions also applied to things like hiring, scholarships and graduation ceremonies. The administration contended American educational institutions have been discriminating against students, including white and Asian American students.

“In a shameful echo of a darker period in this country's history, many American schools and universities even encourage segregation by race at graduation ceremonies and in dormitories and other facilities,” read the letter, which was signed by Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights.

The practice has roots in the era of segregation at some schools, but organizers of Black convocations today say they are a way to celebrate the accomplishments of diverse student populations that were once overlooked. Many colleges also have “Lavender graduations,” which celebrate LGBTQ+ students and grew out of a time decades ago when many lacked support from their families.

For students who are the first in their families to attend college, it can be easy to feel out of place or unsure of where to turn for help, Kissinger said. At Kentucky, he said he often felt like he had to figure out everything on his own. The affinity ceremony, he said, was intended as a celebration of resilience and pride that they reached graduation. 

Arizona's Maricopa County Community Colleges called off all its cultural and special interest convocations, citing in a statement “enforcement priorities” set by the U.S. Education Department. But the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community volunteered to hold a convocation ceremony for American Indian graduates.

“While we are deeply disappointed by the cancellation of convocation ceremonies for minority students, we believe it is important to come together as a community to honor our graduates and their families,” community President Martin Harvier said in a statement.

At Ohio University, Aaron Thomas arranged for his alma mater's Black alumni weekend to go forward this spring after the university canceled it to comply with a state prohibition on DEI, which echoes the federal directive. Thomas, who runs a production company near the university's campus in Athens, Ohio, planned to foot the bill for an alumni barbecue until the mayor's office, nonprofits and restaurants pitched in to organize a weekend of events.

Among the schools with affinity events planned over the next few weeks is California State University, Long Beach, which says its celebrations for Pacific Islander and Cambodian students, among others, comply with the administration's guidance because they are open to anybody.

“Our students are looking forward to these celebrations, which are open to all and are consistent with guidance from the Department of Education,” spokesperson Jim Milbury said.

On its website, a statement included with information about the cultural celebrations acknowledges the changing college landscape:

“Particularly as federal immigration policies evolve, there may be concerns that representatives and officers from U.S. immigration enforcement agencies may visit university campuses across the country,” it says. “While we have no knowledge of any planned visit to our campus, we offer this information.”

BEND, Ore. (AP) — The U.S. Forest Service on Thursday is set to evict dozens of homeless people living in an encampment in a federal forest in central Oregon. 

The federal agency has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes National Forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, said Jesse Rabinowitz, spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.

People who refuse to leave could face one year in jail, $5,000 in fines or both, Rabinowitz said.

He said it will be the Trump administration's first significant homeless encampment eviction. It also comes on May Day, which commemorates the struggles of the working class for fair wages and better working conditions around the globe.

Four people living in the encampment, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.

U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane has yet to issue a written opinion, but the federal court posted on its docket Tuesday that the restraining order was denied, The Bulletin reported. 

Up to 200 people were living in the forest several months ago when they were told that the forest area would be closed May 1, Rabinowitz said. 




Local homeless advocate and retired attorney Chuck Hemingway, who filed the claims, told the newspaper he estimated 80 people remained there as of Friday, and at least 40 would likely still be there on May 1.

Chris Daggett, who lives in the forest, told KTVZ-TV this week that his family has been in Bend for several generations and that living in the forest doesn't make him or anyone else a bad person. 

“It's incredibly difficult to get back on your feet once you've been knocked down,” Daggett said. “If they force us out on May 1, we still won't have anywhere else to go. It'll just make it even tougher for us to rebuild our lives.” 

The Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares) of the forest, is prompting the closure. The goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes National Forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.

Deschutes National Forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the government's goal is “voluntary compliance,” but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and “enforce the closure and ensure public safety.”

Mike Waltz is out as the national security advisor, along with his deputy. Chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on the ousting and what's likely to come.

Trump administration National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and other staffers are out at the National Security Council, sources confirmed to Fox News.

Fox News confirmed Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, were ousted Thursday. Sources said additional staffers removed from the office will likely be announced, and President Donald Trump is expected to speak publicly about the matter. 

Waltz, who previously served as a Florida congressman and as a decorated combat Green Beret, has come under fire from Democrats and critics since March, when the Atlantic magazine's Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg published a firsthand account of getting added to a Signal group chat with top national security leaders, including Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, while they discussed strikes against Yemen terrorists. 

Waltz took responsibility for the inclusion of a journalist in the group chat, telling Fox News' Laura Ingraham, ""I take full responsibility. I built the group,"" he said. ""It's embarrassing. We're going to get to the bottom of it.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital earlier Monday when asked about reports claiming Waltz and others would be shown the door, ""We are not going to respond to reporting from anonymous sources.""

WALTZ DOUBLES DOWN ON HEGSETH PRAISE AMID ONGOING PENTAGON CONTROVERSY

Trump held a meeting with members of his cabinet on Wednesday following his 100th day back in office Tuesday, with Waltz attending the meeting. 

Following confirmation of Waltz's ouster, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told Fox News, ""The National Security Advisor Waltz is out. He's the first. He certainly won't be the last.""

Wong served as Waltz's principal deputy national security advisor, who was detailed in the Signal chat leak as the staffer charged with ""pulling together a tiger team"" in Waltz's initial message sent to the Signal group chat in March, the Atlantic reported at the time. 

""Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours,"" Waltz wrote in the group chat. ""My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.""

Trump told the media April 3 that a handful of other National Security Council staffers had been let go following the Atlantic's report on the Signal chat leak, which characterized the Trump administration as texting ""war plans"" regarding a planned strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. 

TRUMP REVEALS WHO WAS BEHIND SIGNAL TEXT CHAIN LEAK

""Always, we're going to let go of people we don't like, or people we don't think can do the job, or people who may have loyalties to somebody else,"" Trump said from Air Force One on April 3 when asked about reports on the National Security Council firings. 

Trump confirmed at the time that National Security Council members had been fired, but remarked it was not many individuals. He added that he continued to trust his National Security Council team, remarking that they've ""done very well"" and ""had big success with the Houthis.""  

The Trump administration maintained that no classified material was transmitted in the Signal chat in March, with President Donald Trump repeatedly defending Mike Waltz amid the fallout. (The White House)

The Trump administration maintained, however, that no classified material was transmitted in the Signal chat in March, with Trump repeatedly defending Waltz amid the fallout. The strikes on Houthi rebels unfolded on March 15.

""As the president has made it very clear, Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team,"" Leavitt told the media in brief remarks during a gaggle outside the White House's press room March 31. ""And this case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned.""

""There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again,"" she continued. ""And we're moving forward. And the president and Mike Waltz and his entire national security team have been working together very well, if you look at how much safer the United States of America is because of the leadership of this team.""

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trump's administration will bring an end to DEI ""strangulation.""

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller touted President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs on Thursday.

Miller appeared alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a Thursday morning briefing, declaring that the administration is bringing a ""system of merit"" back to the U.S.

""This administration is not going to let our society devolve into communist, woke, DEI strangulation,"" Miller said. ""We are going to have a system of merit.""

""It's not just a social and cultural issue, it's an economic issue. When you hire, retain and recruit based on merit as President Trump has directed, you advance innovation, you advance growth, you advance investment, you advance job creation,"" he continued.

Trump shut down all DEI offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden's efforts on the issue.

The administration is also leveraging federal funding in an effort to force the nation's top universities to eliminate DEI programs as well.

In February, the Department of Education also warned state education departments that they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding.

The Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership, as well as its hiring and admissions practices by August 2025. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are ""hostile"" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism.

Harvard has so far refused to comply.

Steve Doocy shares a message with the 'Fox & Friends' audience.

The longtime host announced on ""Fox & Friends"" that ""it's time for a change"" that will allow him to spend more time with his growing family, while still continuing his hosting duties.

""After decades of getting up at 3:30 and driving into New York City in the dark, today is the last day I will host this show from the couch. I'm not retiring, I'm not leaving the show. I'm still a host, but it's time for a change,"" he said Thursday.

""Suzanne Scott, the CEO of Fox News Media and a friend of mine for over 30 years, and I have been trying to figure out what a guy who's been getting up at 3:30 for two generations should do next. And Suzanne gave me a great option. To keep working on this show, just not every day.""

Doocy said he'll now host three days a week and will be based in Florida. He said he will be reporting ""coast to coast,"" including from areas of the U.S. that don't get as much coverage. 

""When my kids were growing up, I never had breakfast with them,"" he said. ""I was always here, Kathy did everything. But starting tomorrow, I'm going to have breakfast with my grandkids and my children whenever I can.""

President Donald Trump also shared a special message to Doocy, thanking him for his fair coverage through the years and congratulating him on the transition.

""I just want to congratulate you on your new and probably enhanced role,"" the president said. ""I just think you're a fantastic guy. You've always treated me fairly, sometimes a little more fairly than other times, but that's okay. You've been really stellar at what you do and at your craft, and you're going to continue, and it's really been an honor to have spent so much time with you and watching you and the whole group in the morning."" 

""It's the number one show in the business, and it's going to stay that way for a long time to come, and you were a big part of it,"" he continued. ""So thank you for all of your service, because truly, it was service.""

Doocy, who joined Fox News Channel at its inception in 1996 and began as ‘Fox & Friends' co-host two years later, said he will be taking some time off to spend with his children and grandchildren before kicking off his new role.

Mount Sinai urology chair Dr. Ash Tewari joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss the PSA test designed to catch the ‘silent killer.'

A new means of prostate cancer screening could emerge as an alternative to the PSA test, which has long been the first-line option.

Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, Swedish researchers analyzed urine samples from more than 2,000 men with prostate cancer, along with a control group.

They determined that the simple, non-invasive urine test was able to detect biomarkers of prostate cancer with a high degree of accuracy — and could also determine the grade (stage) of the disease.

The results were published in the journal Cancer Research.

PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE

""Prostate cancer can be effectively identified by analyzing the expression of candidate biomarkers in urine,"" confirmed lead author Martin Smelik from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, who spoke to Fox News Digital about the findings.

""This approach outperforms the current blood tests based on PSA, but at the same time keeps the advantages of being non-invasive, painless and relatively cheap.""

The researchers were surprised by the ""heterogeneity of tumors,"" which refers to ""the differences between tumors of the same type in different patients, the differences between cancer cells within a single tumor, or the differences between a primary (original) tumor and a secondary tumor,"" according to the National Cancer Institute.

PROSTATE CANCER RISK INCREASES BY 45% AMONG MEN WHO SHARE ONE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR

""One of the main challenges of the study was to overcome this and to identify biomarkers that were specific for prostate cancer, but also expressed in all types of patients,"" Smelik said.

Dr. Timothy Showalter, a radiation oncologist at UVA Health in Virginia and chief medical officer at Artera, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings.

""This study highlights the power of machine learning applied to patient data in identifying breakthroughs that can help us diagnose cancer earlier, when our treatments are most effective,"" he told Fox News Digital. 

""Prostate cancer screening has not seen a transformative advance in decades, and current approaches still rely on the PSA blood test, which is known to have low specificity for clinically significant cancers.""

The existing PSA test works by monitoring levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood. 

It can be used to screen for prostate cancer or monitor the disease's progression, but some risks and limitations have been noted.

""Prostate cancer screening has not seen a transformative advance in decades.""

Matthew C. Abramowitz, M.D., co-chair and clinical lead of the Genitourinary Malignancies Site Disease Group at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, Florida, echoed the need for alternatives to the PSA test.

""While PSA is an incredibly sensitive tool for issues related to the prostate, it is not specific to prostate cancer,"" Abramowitz, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.

""The techniques proposed in the current study suggest the promise of identifying specific cancer markers in the urine, minimizing some of the specificity concerns associated with PSA.""

While PSA has the advantage of simplicity, quickness and reasonable cost, determining the meaning behind any abnormal findings often requires further testing, such as MRIs and biopsies, the doctor noted.

False positives are also common with the PSA test, occurring in about 6% to 7% of the cases.

""Only about 25% of men who have a biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer,"" states the NIH.

The study did have some limitations, chiefly the low number of samples. 

""The urine prostate cancer prediction model was performed on a small data set and appears to be largely an analysis of European men, both of which may limit its applicability to other high-risk prostate cancer populations,"" Abramowitz noted.

The test could also come with a significant cost increase due to the specialized equipment necessary to perform the analyses, he added.

The researchers acknowledged the need for larger studies to validate the findings and to potentially include other cancers.

This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing treatment-related morbidity."" (iStock)

""While this study was focused specifically on prostate cancer, we believe that some of the methods could be generalized to other cancers as well, which we would like to try in our future studies,"" Smelik said.

The ultimate goal, according to the researchers, is to achieve more efficient screening programs within the next few years, potentially helping to prevent and treat prostate cancer.

Showalter agreed, adding, ""This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing treatment-related morbidity.""

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the White House website changing the headline regarding COVID-19 origins to ‘Lab Leak' on ‘Special Report.'

China is blaming the United States for the origin of COVID-19, accusing Washington of ""evading responsibility"" for the virus amid multiple statements by President Donald Trump that it was leaked from a lab in Wuhan.

In a multipage paper, the Communist regime said the infectious disease was present in the U.S. earlier than what was officially determined. 

""The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,"" the paper states. ""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House. 

CREDIBILITY CRISIS: NEW YORK TIMES HELPED MISLEAD AMERICA OVER COVID LAB LEAK THEORY

The new COVID.gov website showing the ""true origins"" of the coronavirus. (Covid.gov )

The paper came after the White House earlier this month revamped its COVID.gov website, showing the ""true origins"" of the disease. 

The website, which previously focused on promoting the vaccine to Americans, walks readers through evidence supporting the lab leak theory, how former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci promoted the idea that COVID-19 originated naturally, former President Joe Biden pardoning Fauci for ""any offenses against"" the U.S. he may have committed, and providing details on the origin of the ""social distancing"" rules and mask mandates. 

The new site outlines that a biological characteristic found in the virus was not found in nature, bolstering the lab-leak theory, while noting that Wuhan, China, where the first coronavirus case was found, is also home to China's ""foremost SARs research lab"" and that ""if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't.""

TRUMP MADE ME DO IT: LIBERAL MEDIA BLAMES ITS DISMISSAL OF LAB LEAK THEORY ON EX-PRESIDENT'S ‘XENOPHOBIA'

The Trump administration's CIA reported earlier in 2025 that a lab leak was the likely origin of the COVID-19 virus, which had been passed off by media outlets and scientists as a likely conspiracy theory during the early days of the pandemic.

However, China said in its paper that a past joint study conducted with the World Health Organization (WHO) found that COVID-19 was most likely transmitted from bats to humans via another animal.

The report also accused the U.S. of not doing more to combat the virus.

""The slow and ineffective US response during the early stages of the outbreak set an appalling example to the international community and made the US performance in handling the pandemic the worst of all countries,"" Chinese officials wrote. ""Instead of facing this issue squarely and reflecting on its shortcomings, the US government has tried to shift the blame and divert people's attention by shamelessly politicizing SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing.""

""The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct,"" the report said.

House lawmakers voted Thursday to reverse the Environmental Protection Agency's former President Joe Biden-era decision to grant California the power to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

In a 246-164 vote, with 35 Democrats joining all Republicans, representatives overturned the Golden State's plan to transition away from gas-powered cars by 2035 and boost zero-emission vehicles. The EPA approved the plan in December 2024 through a waiver under the Clean Air Act.

Republicans argue that California's rules limit consumer choice. They have also claimed that the state's regulation sets a de facto national standard, as many states follow California's emission rules. A dozen states have adopted the ban on gas-powered vehicles.

“Since arriving in Washington, I have fought to protect consumer freedom and allow American families to choose the vehicle that best fits their budget and needs,” said Rep. John Joyce (R-PA), who sponsored the resolution. “The introduction of this resolution to overturn California's ban on gas-powered vehicles is long overdue.”

Joyce introduced the resolution through the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to bypass a filibuster and vote in a simple majority in both chambers to overturn rules. House Republicans on Wednesday also voted on two other CRA measures that would overturn California regulations on emissions.

In recent months, Republicans have used the CRA to try overturning federal energy regulations that do not align with the Trump administration's agenda.

Republicans' move to use the CRA to overturn a waiver could spark legal challenges. Last month, the Government Accountability Office ruled that the waivers under the Clean Air Act cannot be repealed through the CRA.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOTE TO SLASH CALIFORNIA VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS

California Air Resources Board members said in a statement Wednesday, following the other two CRA votes to repeal the state's emission rules, that the lawmakers are violating the CRA itself as recognized by the GAO.

“The vote does not change CARB's authority,” the CARB statement reads. “CARB will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Iowa, the second-largest food producer in the nation, is mulling legislation that could provide relief to an embattled herbicide manufacturer by providing it with limited legal protections. Lining up to oppose the bill is an army of lobbyists working for environmental groups linked to China, a country that stands to gain if that farm supply manufacturer fails. Complicating the situation is a flood of contradictory scientific evidence concerning the safety of the herbicide in question.

The legislative battle revolves around Bayer AG, a German pharmaceutical corporation that, in June 2018, acquired Monsanto and its flagship product, Roundup, a herbicide made using the controversial chemical compound glyphosate. Fast-forward six years, and Bayer CEO Bill Anderson is telling the press that his corporation faces an “existential” crisis as it handles a deluge of lawsuits claiming that glyphosate, one of the most commonly used agricultural compounds in the world, causes cancer, a claim in which some courts have found merit but scientific evidence is mixed.

In a bid to toss a lifeline to the troubled agricultural manufacturer, lawmakers in Iowa and other red states have repeatedly attempted, and largely failed, to pass legislation that would limit the ability of people to sue agricultural companies. Iowa Senate File 394, among the latest of these bills, would protect Bayer and other corporations from “failure to warn” lawsuits by declaring that the Environmental Protection Agency warning labels on their product are sufficient to inform consumers of health and safety risks.

Bills like these come with huge stakes. Bayer said mounting litigation costs could force it to stop selling Roundup — a move that the Wall Street Journal reports would make American farmers more reliant on Chinese-made glyphosate. Some Americans have accused China, which produces roughly half of the world's glyphosate in a given year, of selling the compound in the United States at below-market prices in an attempt to destabilize domestic producers and grow their market share.

With high stakes come many lobbyists. The Iowa Environmental Council, for its part, assigned seven lobbyists to advocate against SF 394 in February. 

Describing itself as a “nonpartisan alliance of diverse organizations and individuals working together to protect and preserve Iowa's environment,” the Iowa Environmental Council has, since 2015, consistently received a large portion, at times a majority, of its funding from the Energy Foundation, an international green nonprofit group with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party. 

The Energy Foundation was founded in the 1990s in San Francisco to fund green causes across the world. In 2020, after spending years growing its presence in China and rubbing elbows with CCP officials, the Energy Foundation split into two separate nonprofit groups: the Energy Foundation China and the United States Energy Foundation. Tax forms indicate that the two organizations continued to share office space until 2022. 

Ji Zou, who joined the Energy Foundation as CEO about a year before the 2020 split, previously served as the deputy director general of China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy, an agency within the Chinese government's National Development and Reform Commission, and has served as a special adviser to the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, which reports to the Chinese government's State Council.

Before bringing Ji on board, the Energy Foundation spent millions of dollars aiding China's rapid infrastructure expansion. In 2018, Energy Foundation co-founder Eric Heitz, for instance, bragged that the nonprofit group helped China become the “largest market and manufacturer for wind and solar” in the world. Tax documents show that the Energy Foundation spent roughly $65 million on programs in China between 2015 and 2019. 

Hongjun Zhang, who was on the Energy Foundation's board while it was funding the Iowa Environmental Council, was previously an official in China's National Environmental Protection Agency and a legislative director in China's National People's Congress. He also served on China's CCICED.

Other former Chinese government officials who occupied high ranks at the Energy Foundation while it funded the Iowa Environmental Council included its program director of industry, program director of environmental management, director of strategic communications, and a senior adviser, among others.

In 2019, the last year before the split with its Chinese branch, the Energy Foundation provided the Iowa Environmental Council with $510,000 — roughly 52% of its revenue. This figure dropped to about 37% in 2020, hovered around 20% in 2021 and 2022, and rose back up to about 30% as of 2023, with a donation of $515,000. Between 2015 and 2018, the nonprofit organization wired the Iowa Environmental Council over $100,000 each year.

The Environmental Law and Policy Center, which has registered two lobbyists to oppose SF 394, received just over $3.1 million from the Energy Foundation between 2015 and 2019, according to tax filings.

Such close links to China are hardly unique among American environmentalist nonprofit groups. Every year, millions of dollars flow from CCP-connected organizations to domestic green activist groups, and in turn, large U.S. nonprofit groups send millions to China to assist the country with its energy agenda.

The Iowa Environmental Council and the Environmental Law and Policy Center did not respond to requests for comment.

“If Bayer stops producing in the United States, we will be subject to Chinese glyphosate, and, quite frankly, I don't even know what it contains besides glyphosate,” Kip Tom, a farmer who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture during the first Trump administration, told the Washington Examiner. “They could be putting other inert ingredients in there. It puts our own national and food security at risk. Imagine China going to war with Taiwan. What happens to the 70% of pesticides that we import to the United States? Obviously, they'll probably be cut off. And I don't want to be subject to only having the option of going to China for our products.”

Tom, citing conversations he has had with Bayer's CEO, said the company's warning about cutting off sales in the U.S. is not an idle threat.

A previous version of the Iowa bill, advanced in 2024, tackled the China problem directly by excluding Chinese-owned companies from taking advantage of the new protections. The most recent version of SF 394, however, has no such exclusion. State Sen. Mike Bousselot, the legislation's floor manager, did not respond when asked why the most recent iteration of the bill did not contain such a provision.

As dueling lobbyists from farmers groups, labor unions, environmentalist organizations, and trade associations make their cases for and against the bill behind the scenes, the public discourse surrounding the bill has gotten heated. Some activists have gone as far as to characterize the bill as a “cancer gag act.”

State Sen. Adrian Dickey, a Republican, has said the legislation doesn't prevent consumers from suing Bayer if they believe one of its products gave them cancer. Rather, it prevents people from suing the company for not including a cancer warning label on its packaging. 

“Today's bill is not preventing anyone from suing a company if they feel the product causes cancer,” Dickey explained. “It's simply commonsense legislation that states that you cannot sue a company for having a label on a product when the federal government doesn't allow the label to be on the product.” 

Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, argue that many of the studies being used to defend glyphosate safety were influenced by industry money and tampering and that Bayer should be required to issue cancer warnings to its customers.  

THE ROLE ELITE US UNIVERSITIES PLAY IN TRAINING PRO-CCP PROFESSIONALS

Muddying the debate is the lack of scientific consensus on the possible dangers surrounding glyphosate. Health authorities across the world, such as the EPA, Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority, and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, have all attested to the compound's safety. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015, however, found that glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic,” and a 2019 University of Washington study linked the herbicide to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Regardless of SF 394 in Iowa, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed a strong desire to wean the U.S. off pesticides and herbicides such as glyphosate, making the future of the substance even more uncertain.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Mike Waltz expected to leave post as Trump national security adviser","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/national-security/3397790/mike-waltz-out-trump-national-security-adviser/","Thu, 01 May 2025 15:21:06 GMT","

President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, will leave their positions at the White House, according to multiple outlets.

Waltz, 51, has been mired in controversy for several weeks. He admitted responsibility for accidentally and unknowingly adding a reporter to the now-infamous Signal group chat in which senior officials debated whether to begin a military campaign in the Middle East.

“We are not going to respond to reporting from anonymous sources,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner.

It's unclear who will fill the vacancy Waltz is leaving, which was first reported by journalist Mark Halperin, though one name he floated was Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff, who had been in real estate development prior to being tapped to join this administration, is leading the White House's efforts to negotiate an end to the Israel-Hamas war, Iran's nuclear program, and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Witkoff has faced criticism himself, particularly for his approach to negotiating with the Kremlin. He has been accused of echoing Kremlin talking points. He also reportedly met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relying on Kremlin translators.

“Nice guy, but a bumbling f***ing idiot,” an anonymous member of Trump's first administration told the New York Post.

Waltz, the former Florida congressman, is the first major Trump administration official to be moved out of the administration. The move came amid a week of celebration from the administration designed to highlight all the achievements of the first 100 days of Trump's second term.

Trump did not fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat when it was first reported, standing behind Waltz, who accepted responsibility for adding Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who shared sensitive details of an impending military operation in the group chat.

In early April, Trump fired multiple staffers on his National Security Council shortly after he met with investigative journalist Laura Loomer in the Oval Office in the aftermath of the Signal reports. Following the Signal group chat leak, Loomer “exposed” several Trump administration staffers for alleged disloyalty and ties to foreign adversaries on X. Wong was among those she posted about.

“Laura Loomer is a very good patriot,” Trump said at the time. “She's a very strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations of names of people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody. I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision.”

When pressed on whether Loomer had “anything to do with the NSC aides who were ousted,” Trump replied, “No, not at all.”

Loomer had publicly called for Trump to fire Waltz and Wong and took a victory lap on social media on Thursday. 

“SCALP,” she posted on social media. “VETTING MATTERS. Don't ever forget that.”

PETE HEGSETH SIGNAL GROUP CHAT (PART 2): WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

The Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General is investigating Hegseth's Signal use. It's been reported that he shared those details in another group chat, including his brother, wife, and personal attorney.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","David Horowitz, American hero","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/3397115/david-horowitz-american-hero/","Thu, 01 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

David Horowitz died of cancer on Tuesday at the age of 86. One of the most influential conservative voices of the last half-century, he was a powerful writer, speaker, and polemicist. 

The son of two American Communists and born in 1939, Horowitz was a radical student leader and the editor of Ramparts magazine in the 1960s and early 1970s. He turned to the right politically in 1974, when his friend Betty Van Patter was murdered after going to work for the Black Panther Party. 

As he recounts in his autobiography, Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey, Van Patter's death caused Horowitz's conversion to conservatism. The murder was never solved, but here is how Horowitz described it in a 1999 article: “In pursuit of answers to the mystery of Betty's death, I subsequently discovered that the Panthers had killed more than a dozen people in the course of conducting extortion, prostitution and drug rackets in the Oakland ghetto. While these criminal activities were taking place, the group enjoyed the support of the American left, the Democratic Party, Bay Area trade unions and even the Oakland business establishment.”

In works such as Radical Son and The Black Book of the American Left, Horowitz argued that the “activists” of the 1960s, like the “progressives” of earlier eras and the liberals of today, are basically Communists. The Black Panthers, Bill Ayers and the Weather Underground, Saul Alinsky, Tom Hayden, Angela Davis, Todd Gitlin, and Mary Travers of the Peter, Paul and Mary folk trio — all called for a revolution. They weren't interested in mainstream Democrats such as Hubert Humphrey.

Today, it is no different. “Identity Politics is often referred to as Political Correctness,” Horowitz wrote in his 2021 book The Enemy Within: How a Totalitarian Movement is Destroying America, “but it is more accurately understood as Cultural Marxism—the idea that American society is characterized by oppressive hierarchies, and thus divided into warring races, genders, and classes. Political correctness is a term that describes a left-wing party line. It was coined by the mass murderer Mao Zedong in the 1930s to keep his followers under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party. Adherents of the progressive party line today regard white Americans, males, Christians, and Jews as ‘oppressors'—enemies—and themselves as warriors for social justice.”

Several years ago, Horowitz was on a panel at Georgetown University with Michael Kazin, who had been a leader in the Students for a Democratic Society, a leftist group in the 1960s. All the left wanted to do, Kazin said, “was give peace a chance.” Horowitz often reminded readers that during the Vietnam era, Kazin embraced the motto “bring the war home,” i.e., cause as much violence on American streets as possible. Horowitz noted that at a 1969 rally, Kazin led the following cheer: “Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, the NLF [Vietnamese Communists] is Gonna Win!” Horowitz said, “It had been liberalism that guided America to power in the postwar world. It was liberalism that had gotten America into Vietnam. Centrist liberalism was the balance wheel giving synchronicity to the entire political system. But now radicals assaulted the center; if it could not hold, America would fall.” 

Leftists were in no way, as Horowitz puts it, “mooning for Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King,” as they would later claim. They wanted to bring the war home and topple the United States.

In his writing, Horowitz often connected the left of the 1930s and 1960s with the left of today. Revolution was to aid in that process. Horowitz's own Communist parents saw their dreams collapse in 1956 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin's crimes and the “cult of personality” that surrounded him. Whittaker Chambers, as he chillingly put it, “heard the screams” and saw the lie that was Communism.

“I am constantly asked by people who have read my autobiography, Radical Son,” Horowitz once wrote, “or who have heard me talk about these events, how it is that my former comrades on the left can remain so silently and stubbornly devoted to ‘experiments' like the Panthers that failed, to doctrines that are false and to causes that are demonstrably wrongheaded and even evil.”

The answer was age-old: fanaticism and the refusal to accept reality. 

In his 2009 book, Barack Obama's Rules for Revolution: The Alinsky Model, Horowitz said, “An SDS radical once wrote, ‘The issue is never the issue. The issue is always the revolution.' In other words the cause – whether inner city blacks or women – is never the real cause, but only an occasion to advance the real cause which is the accumulation of power to make the revolution.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

VALENCIA, Spain — Two modern ills converged in Europe on Monday, literally one of the darkest days in decades. An ideological obsession with climate fanaticism left countries without power for hours, while censorship of “disinformation, ”often information the powerful don't like, plunged the population in an informational blackout in subsequent days.

The electrical blackout brought planes, trains, and automobiles to a screeching halt throughout Spain, Portugal, and small parts of southern France. Electricity simply stopped flowing, and with it control towers, rail lines, and traffic lights.

Cellphones became quadrangular black boxes that did nothing and lost their “smartness.”

A political conference I was attending in this sunny Mediterranean port city suddenly became eerie when people started coming in and out and whispering to each other. One person in the seat in front finally turned and enlightened a friend and me: “The electricity is down. We're cut off from the world.”

We then realized that, yes, sirens had been wailing outside, and it had been a while since we'd gotten emails or texts. A generator in the hotel kept our conference going, but nothing else worked; everyone had to take the stairs and use bathrooms in the dark — though water, too, stopped working.

It wasn't quite dystopic, but our modern dependence on electricity and its creature comforts suddenly was brought home to us.

Many speculated that it was a cyberattack from Russia or China. Who else had the power to do this? Center-right politicians from across Europe were about to descend on Valencia the next day. Surely, an invitation for bad actors to do their thing.

Well, not so fast. Neither Russia's Vladimir Putin nor China's Xi Jinping is above carrying out this type of attack, and cybersecurity is a serious matter. But, to quote Vice President JD Vance at a February conference in Munich, Germany, the threat to worry about the most in Europe “is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor.”

“What I worry about,” went on Vance, “is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its fundamental values.”

Vance mentioned Europe's need “to enjoy affordable energy,” and the fact that, as he put it, “free speech, I fear, is in retreat.” European officials are still fuming about how “rude” that young Vance was, but it looks like he was on the money.

It is increasingly clear that what caused the blackout was not a cyberattack. Reuters News agency reported that Spain's grid operator Red Electrica on Tuesday ruled out external sabotage, and said instead that it had identified two “incidents of power generation loss, probably from solar plants,” in southwestern Spain.

That, said the Reuters report, “caused instability in the electric system and led to a breakdown of its connection with France. The electrical system collapsed, affecting both the Spanish and Portuguese systems.”

“There was not enough inertia, or redundancy, in the system to keep it going,” my colleague Diana Furchott-Roth emailed from Washington when I was able to receive communications from the outside world. “The last coal-fired plant was closed on April 12.”

Diana has been warning about this type of thing for decades, and Spain's socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez is a poster boy for the things she has warned against. His government has not only closed coal-fired plants, but has been busily destroying nuclear plants as well. 

“Net zero,” or zero CO2 emissions, is the name of this new mad delusion, and Spain's infantile leftists have been posting on social media gleeful workers destroying nuclear power plants. The goal has been 100% percent “renewable” generation.

Well, they happened to have gotten very close to their holy grail on Monday at 12:30. The Iberian Peninsula's power grid was getting a disproportionate amount of energy from the renewables loved by the Left: 80% percent from solar photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind. Nuclear was at a measly 11% percent.

In a mere five minutes, solar photovoltaic generation plunged by 50%, from 18 gigawatts to eight, according to Reuters. Iberia and adjacent parts of France, including the tiny Pyrenean principality of Andorra, all of which depended on this grid, then descended into darkness at 12:35, from which it was not to recover till late at night.

The hapless Sanchez was still arguing late Tuesday that just because Red Electrica was discounting a cyberattack, it did not mean that one hadn't happened.

Governments finding themselves in a corner will lie, or at least equivocate, and it's the job of the opposition to keep asking for answers. “An energy policy that prioritizes the fight against climate change above the security of supply has provoked this general blackout,” said an analysis on the site of the think tank Disenso, which is linked to the opposition Vox Party (full disclosure, I sit on Disenso's foreign advisory board).

APPLE FACES A CHALLENGING EXIT FROM CHINA

But it is also the job of the media. Yet Spain's state television stations, and even private ones, were still keeping the truth about the failure of the Left's renewable dream from getting any airtime as late as Wednesday morning, when I left for the airport. That was left to radio and to some newspapers on the right.

An honest media would be not just informing voters about how a blackout that left at least five dead and stopped a modern economy in its tracks happened. It would also be debating whether such a modern society really does want to stop using comfort creatures and working toilets, all in the name of fighting climate change.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Even without Signalgate, the president wasn't likely to keep his national security adviser around long. 

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

For weeks, Washington has been waiting to see how long National Security Adviser Michael Waltz could hold on. The answer, we now know, was 101 days.

Multiple outlets reported this morning that Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, would be leaving the Trump administration. His firing comes roughly seven weeks after he added The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal chat in which top administration officials discussed a strike on Yemen before and after it took place. In legal and security terms, the mortal sin was conducting official business in an unsecured and unpreserved forum; in political terms, it was including Goldberg. Trump acknowledged last week in an interview with Goldberg, and my colleagues Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, that the scandal was “a very big story” and that his administration had learned “Maybe don't use Signal, okay?” Trump reportedly hesitated to fire Waltz because he didn't want to give the media a “scalp” or acknowledge that he cared, but his resolve apparently weakened.

Any other national security adviser would have been deservedly fired after the leak, but even without Signalgate, it's hard to imagine that Waltz would have survived very long. (He did, at least, outlast the first national security adviser of Trump's first term, Michael Flynn, who didn't reach the one-month mark.) Waltz was one of the more respected and expert hands on Trump's team, and that would have doomed him sooner or later.

Waltz's demise was foretold shortly after Signalgate, when the 9/11–conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who holds no government role, persuaded Trump to fire several NSC staffers whom she believed were insufficiently loyal. Implicit in her critique and Trump's acquiescence was a belief that Waltz wasn't really on the team, either. Waltz is a right-winger and a convert to Trumpism, but he is not a blind loyalist. He won four Bronze Stars while serving in U.S. Special Forces. He worked at the Pentagon during the George W. Bush administration, and was elected to four terms in Congress. As national security adviser, he tried to bring his expertise to the service of the president.

The problem is that Waltz was trying to serve two masters. As I wrote in January, Trump doesn't care about national security. He's not against it, or actively trying to undermine it; he's just not interested. He's not interested in hearing reasoned advice, developed through a careful process, as the National Security Council has done—especially if this advice contradicts his impulses or ideology. On an issue like the strikes on Houthis in Yemen, where Trump has fewer interests to balance, problems don't tend to arise. But on marquee issues that Trump can't ignore, and where tough trade-offs and complicated strategy enter the picture—such as with Ukraine or China—someone has to start giving him news he doesn't like.

Trump doesn't want expertise. He started his presidency by sweeping out dozens of career officials whom his team viewed as Democrats in disguise or creatures of the establishment. Since then, the ground has continued to shift. My colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker reported recently that as Waltz's control of the NSC slipped away, the real powers on the council were the longtime Trump adviser Stephen Miller and Trump's Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff. These two represent very different models: the ideologue and the old pal, respectively. Miller treats the NSC “not as a forum to weigh policy options,” Stanley-Becker wrote, “but as a platform to advance his own hard-line immigration agenda.” The handy thing about ideology is that it effaces all the hard choices that a pragmatic approach to the world requires. Witkoff, meanwhile, seems to have neither an ideology nor any expertise that might interfere with his fidelity to Trump. Though he lacks diplomatic experience, he has been friends with Trump for years, and the president has sent him ricocheting around the globe—with little to show for it so far.

Trump's allergy to expertise also helps explain why Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appears to be on more solid footing than Waltz despite worse scandals: He, too, was involved in Signalgate. Though Hegseth was not the one who added Goldberg to the chat, Hegseth did share detailed attack plans in it. He also shared sensitive information with his wife and others who had no need for it, installed an insecure line into the Pentagon, and can't manage to keep his staff from turning over. (“I think he's gonna get it together,” Trump told my colleagues in an interview last week. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.”) Waltz's ouster might be an ominous sign, however, for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a traditional Republican and Trump critic turned vassal who holds another delicate foreign-policy job.

Now Waltz joins a list of discarded Trump national security advisers, alongside Flynn, H. R. McMaster, and John Bolton. That unhappy fraternity is only likely to grow. Every administration official serves at the pleasure of the president, and nothing incurs this president's displeasure faster than trying to get him to care about national security.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The president's enthusiasm for digital currency could destabilize America's financial systems.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

In 2019, President Donald Trump asserted that cryptocurrency was “highly volatile and based on thin air.” The description is still highly accurate—but Trump seems to no longer believe it. These days, he praises the crypto community as brimming with “the kind of spirit that built our country and is exciting to watch.”

What happened between Trump's first and second terms is fairly predictable. Crypto advocates flattered him, and then he and his family personally invested in various crypto-related ventures. Just before his inauguration in 2025, he launched a $TRUMP meme coin, which reportedly has made his family and their partners a lot of money. Trump's oldest sons recently invested in a bitcoin-mining operation. And they hold majority stakes in World Liberty Financial, making them major dealers in the crypto world. That might help explain why the president has declared that he wants the United States to be the “crypto capital of the world.”

What's less predictable is how the president's change of opinion could destabilize the American financial system. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with the Atlantic staff writer Annie Lowrey, who covers the economy and politics, about Trump's plans to integrate crypto into the government and mainstream banking. What happens when Trump weakens regulation on a notoriously unstable currency? Who benefits? Who is likely to get duped? And when the crypto-induced financial crisis comes, how will it surprise us?

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music] 

News reader: The bitcoin boom persists. The price has not dipped since Donald Trump was elected—skyrocketing 40 percent in just the past two weeks. The president-elect vowing to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet.”

Hanna Rosin: Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been around for a while now. And headlines about crypto always have a boom-and-bust quality: overnight billionaires and tech entrepreneurs, scams and collapses on absurd scales.

It wasn't clear which way the crypto story was headed, because Trump opposed it in his first term, but now he's made a big turnaround. Trump has become very pro-crypto, pushing to change regulations and create a world where crypto plays a much bigger role in Wall Street and in Washington—all while he and his family stand to profit from crypto investments of their own.

I'm Hanna Rosin. And this week on Radio Atlantic: crypto in the new Trump era.

With so many high-stakes changes coming from the administration, it's easy to push the crypto story aside.

Annie Lowrey: There's just so many things going on right now, and people are so excited about some things and so upset by other things.

Rosin: That's Atlantic staff writer Annie Lowrey, who writes about the economy and politics, and she's here to tell us why we shouldn't lose sight of this one, because what Trump is proposing could have real risks for all of us. And the people who are paying the most attention are the ones pushing for it to happen. 

Lowrey: Crypto legislation is only the No. 1 most salient priority for crypto people. So the people that members of Congress are going to hear from are the crypto people.

Rosin: So let me just start basic: What was the initial idea of cryptocurrency, and how did it evolve over time?

Lowrey: Cryptocurrency initially started as basically a way to create a financial structure outside of governments and outside of the banking system.

Andreas Antonopoulos: Bitcoin is disruption. It's disruption on a scale that most people haven't even begun to imagine.

News reporter: In the world of libertarian high techies, skepticism about government-issued paper money abounds.

Jake Tapper: If enough people use bitcoin, it could help bring down the dollar. You think that's a real possibility?

Lowrey: It was really, really outsidery. It was kind of utopian.

Antonopoulos: Radical disruption. Completely decentralized money with no borders.

Brock Pierce: Every industry in the world is going to be affected, and it's going to be a beautiful, beautiful thing.

Lowrey: It was very, very techy. And from the very outset, it was simultaneously a currency, so supposed to be a store of value, an investment—perhaps something that you could put money in and get more money back later—and also a financial technology that would allow people to transfer money between each other without having to go through the kind of financial conduits that are controlled by governments and banks.

Don Tapscott: For the first time now in human history, people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer.

Lowrey: So a certain level of anonymity and privacy—that you wouldn't necessarily have, you know, Uncle Sam looking over your shoulder—and again, just something that was outside the aegis of the system that a lot of early crypto adopters really felt was suspect, something that could be, you know, universal, global.

Antonopoulos: Bitcoin is about the other 6 billion. Bitcoin is about unbanked and borderless.

Lowrey: There were some other kind of kookier ideas out there too, right: that this would come to supplant the dollar; that, you know, this would be a way to rebuild the entire globe's financial architecture. I think none of that is true at this point. But it was a very heady idea, and I feel like the idea of crypto has in some ways gotten smaller and smaller and smaller.

Rosin: So what evolved? What's going on with crypto these days?

Lowrey: When I say that the idea has gotten smaller, I think that unless you are a die-hard crypto booster in Silicon Valley or elsewhere, you no longer think, probably, that this is going to supplant the global financial ecosystem, that this is going to lead to the demise of the dollar and the euro and the yen, that this is going to eliminate banking and radically change how we use money.

This is a speculative instrument, right? So I'm going to buy and hold with the hope that it's going to go up in price. Or, you know, I'm going to bet against it and hope that it's going to go down. Or I'm going to invest in these crypto companies, and I think this one is going to make a lot more money than that one.

And I would note that I feel like people somehow underrate the degree to which crypto remains a foundational part of black markets, even today, right? It's been a big part of our regulatory skepticism and legal skepticism of it—is that it is used for human trafficking. It is used for drug trafficking. It is used for terrorism, state sponsored and not state sponsored. And a lot of crypto activity happens outside of the United States precisely because companies cannot or do not want to comply with American securities and banking laws.

Rosin: You said, “speculative instrument.” What does that mean exactly?

Lowrey: I mean, so for a lot of people, it's a very, very lucrative investment, particularly if you bought early, right?

News clip: He became a millionaire at 24, all by investing in bitcoin.

Lowrey: But we say it's a speculative asset. You know, it's a price that is unusual in the sense that it's completely untethered. So when we think about investments in general—so a stock, right? You know, if I'm going to buy a share of a stock, I'm not just getting the value of the stock itself; I'm getting the money that that company is going to remit to shareholders. The value of the stock and the amount of money that's going to get remitted to shareholders is based on the company's core financials, what they're buying and selling.

Bitcoin is different in the sense that there's nothing underneath at all. There's no way in which it's generating and throwing off cash over time, and there's literally nothing there.

It's like a lottery ticket. Even something like gold, which is a really speculative asset in the same way—gold itself does have, like, industrial uses. There are things you can do with gold. You know, there's really almost nothing like it. You know, even Beanie Babies or tulip bulbs, right? You have the Beanie Baby. You have the tulip bulb.

Here, it's, like, nothing. It's a bunch of numbers. That's it.

Rosin: Right, right. And what's the significance of that? Like, I know it sounds weird and alarming and virtual, but why is that an important thing to think about? Because money is also nothing. It's just, like, a thing that we've all agreed is worth a certain thing that can be traded for other things.

So why does it matter that there is no there there with bitcoin?

Lowrey: It means that the price is purely speculative and completely and only based—literally only solely based—on interest in the asset.

So imagine that everybody decides, No more bitcoin. We're all moving to ether or another cryptocurrency. There's nothing underlying the value of bitcoin. If bitcoin had some beating heart of an investment, right—like, it was an apartment building where you could rent the apartments out, it was a farm where you could eat or sell the apples, any of a million other things I could think of—there would still be some base value to it. And the thing with crypto is that there's nothing.

And so you'll see these, you know, smaller cryptocurrencies just completely crash and burn. And so it means that they're much more volatile, and it also means that they're harder to assess the value of, because there's no underlying value. It's just literally a bet on who's going to want it at what price.

Rosin: Okay. I think I'm starting to understand, in your voice—you haven't said this yet—but I think what I'm starting to understand is it's: The volatility probably makes everything more risky, and people involved in it more vulnerable, and makes it more vulnerable to manipulation.

Lowrey: Absolutely. And so if we were talking about somebody that we wanted to advise to have investments but to have pretty safe investments, usually we talk about, like, a bond, right? And bonds are low risk because they come with these kind of steady income streams—even, like, a government bond, you're going to need the government to decide not to pay the bondholder in order for that to be a bad investment in some cases. And there's sort of—I'm simplifying a lot here, right? And with crypto, you might be pretty confident that the price is going somewhere, but there's no guarantees about anything, and it's like you're in a room in which you're trying to suss out what everybody else is trying to do.

Rosin: Is the riskiness theoretical? How volatile has it actually been?

[Music]

Lowrey: I mean, it has boomed and busted and boomed and busted and boomed and busted, and it's boomingish right now but kind of busting a little bit at the moment.

If you remember back to just a few years ago, crypto had this big mainstream advertising push. The Staples Center was renamed the Crypto.com Arena. You started to see ads on television challenging people to embrace risk and invest in crypto.

Matt Damon: History is filled with “almosts,” with those who almost adventured, who almost achieved. But ultimately, for them it proved to be too much.

Lowrey: In the 2022 Super Bowl, there were these ads with LeBron James and Larry David that were hawking crypto.

Commercial actor: Like I was saying, it's FTX. It's a safe and easy way to get into crypto.

Larry David: Eh, I don't think so, and I'm never wrong about this stuff.

Lowrey: And just months later, FTX, which was Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto mega-exchange, it collapsed. And that fed a giant blowup in the crypto market, this enormous collapse in prices.

News clip: In less than a year, crypto or digital currencies have now lost $2 trillion in value after peaking at $3 trillion in November 2021.

Lowrey: One thing that I've also written about is that, you know, in 2021 and 2022, you had a lot of targeted advertising in Black communities, which were slow to adopt crypto—kind of late to get in. But there was a ton of advertisement basically, you know, kind of making this argument to Black folks who might have been kind of skeptical investors that this was their chance outside of, you know, these stodgy U.S. financial companies that had redlined them and hadn't treated them fairly—that this was their big opportunity.

And because there's such great racial wealth disparities in this country, I think that this was a very kind of attractive case, and a lot of Black folks bought in when the bubble was about to burst, right—when the bubble was getting blown up. And then, you know, they bought in when crypto was really expensive, and then they saw the price of their investment crater.

Rosin: So into this boom-bust world of incredible volatility walks Donald Trump. What does his return to office mean for crypto?

Lowrey: So Donald Trump had been a crypto hater for a long time. He was like, I don't like it.

News clip: Trump tweeted yesterday, quote, “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

Lowrey: He's a real-estate guy, right? These are real assets.

Rosin: Tangible, touchable assets, yeah.

Lowrey: Tangible, touchable assets. But he's also, you know, part of the scam economy, right? His Trump Steaks and his Trump shoes and his Trump Bibles and his Trump University.

And my sense of what happened by talking to people in this industry is that crypto folks began flattering Donald Trump, and they started sending him a ton of money, and they started setting up business ventures with his family members—with his sons—and all of a sudden, he became wildly pro-crypto, probably more than any but just a couple handful of members of Congress.

Donald Trump: The energy and passion of the crypto community is the kind of spirit that built our country, and it is exciting to watch as you invent the future of finance.

Lowrey: And so he said he was going to make, you know, the United States the crypto capital of the world. He was promising pro-crypto legislation. He said that the Biden administration had basically been strangling this nascent industry and punishing it by attempting to get it to comply with United States securities laws and banking laws. And that's where we are right now.

Trump: Together we'll make America the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world.

Rosin: All right, so Trump is into crypto now, and I get that that's risky. You've said that. But what if I never want to buy crypto or I never even want to think about it? Why do I care? What does it matter to me?

Lowrey: Right now, you or I or anybody can go buy crypto assets, right? We can go get bitcoin. We can go get any number of crypto assets. And that risk is ours. We can lose all our money on crypto if we want to. Crypto is not really knitted in with the American financial system, although that is changing slowly and is about to change quickly.

And so when these really volatile assets crash, you can have a lot of kind of personal pain. A lot of people could personally get scammed. They can lose a lot of money. But there isn't broad public risk. Donald Trump is planning on doing a few things.

So first, he's planning on cutting financial regulations for all financial businesses, so deregulating. He's reducing financial regulatory enforcement through the SEC and the other alphabet-soup agencies that do that in the United States. He's thinking about creating a crypto reserve, so using public assets to purchase bitcoin, ether, probably some other currencies. And then he's promised to sign a bill that would change the regulatory status of crypto, among other things.

At the same time, it's also worth noting that his family and he are kind of in the crypto business now. They're staked in a company called World Liberty Financial, which sells tokens. His older sons recently invested in a [bitcoin]-mining operation. And before the inauguration, they launched a $TRUMP meme coin, which cratered in value but appears to have made his family and their partners a lot of money, just from skimming from the transactions.

And so all of these things are happening at once. And the thing that I fear is that you could end up with less price volatility because you have this kind of stable government investment and this government interest—now a public interest—in stable crypto prices.

But you're socializing risk. It could be the taxpayer that's called on to bail out crypto businesses, the taxpayer that's putting, you know, public resources on the line. And I worry that Donald Trump is taking risk away from crypto investors—particularly big crypto magnates—and is putting it on the American taxpayer, on the citizen, in a way that, you know, I don't know that the taxpayer, the citizen is going to have those benefits redound to them.

Rosin: Okay, that was a lot. Let me make sure I understand that. So before, crypto was in a separate world, and whoever invested in it just took on the risk themselves. It wasn't integrated in the American economy in any particular way. And was it heavily regulated? Is that one of the things Trump is changing?

Lowrey: So crypto was interesting. And this is all really technical. Basically, there had been an argument from the crypto industry that crypto assets were different than the assets that were regulated by financial regulators like the CFTC and the SEC—basically that crypto needed its own legislation.

American financial regulators, by and large, rejected this argument. And so Gary Gensler, the former head of the SEC, basically said, Almost all crypto assets are securities, and securities are regulated by me here at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we don't need new legislation. We need all of you to comply with securities laws, which are quite strict.

News reader: SEC Chair Gary Gensler describing the world of cryptocurrencies as the “Wild West.”

Lowrey: And I think to give the crypto industry some benefit of the doubt on this, there were some questions about, like, Okay, is this a commodity or a security? Who should regulate? How does this rule exactly apply for a bunch of really technical reasons? But that was the world that we're in.

And from my perspective, it worked fine, right? You know, there were lots of crypto companies in the United States. You know, the financial system was mostly protected from this quite scammy, quite volatile industry. But the industry didn't like it, in part because Main Street and Wall Street banks declined to do a lot of business with crypto firms, because of questions about how they would be regulated.

If they did that, would it be safe for them? Would they get into trouble with their regulators? And that's really one of the things that's changing now that we're on the precipice of pro-crypto legislation coming out that, I think, is going to dramatically increase risk in the American financial system.

[Music]

Rosin: When we're back: What does a crypto-doomsday scenario look like? And how worried do we really need to be?

[Break]

Trump: Last year, I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet, and we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise.

Yesterday, I signed an executive order officially creating our strategic bitcoin reserve. And this will be a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold to be housed within the United States Treasury. That's a big thing, Scott.

[Applause]

Rosin: Okay, one thing you said that isn't so clear to me: You mentioned a bitcoin reserve. Like, I understand what an oil reserve is. I can visualize it. I can get what it's for. What is a bitcoin reserve, and why is that interesting to Trump?

Lowrey: I wish I had a great answer for this, because there's no point. This is a pointless, stupid thing to do, right?

Rosin: Uh-huh. (Laughs.)

Lowrey: Sorry, I don't know if I should say that.

Rosin: No, I mean, maybe I feel better. Maybe that's why I don't understand it. Yeah.

Lowrey: This is a pointless, stupid thing to do on a lot of levels. So the plan, you know—and again, we don't know yet—but the plan is to take $100 billion or so and to buy bitcoin and ether and a bunch of other cryptocurrencies.

And the U.S. government owns, depending on the day and the market value, roughly $20 billion of cryptocurrency that it has seized as a civil-asset forfeiture or in criminal cases. So they probably put that in there.

And look—the United States has a bunch of strategic reserves for strategically important goods. So petroleum: They will release that when gas prices spike because of crude-oil shortages. We have strategic stockpiles of kinds of pharmaceuticals, certain minerals that are important in defense, that sort of thing.

But yeah, what's the strategic point of the United States holding crypto? There is none, right? And this is a huge, huge boon—huge giveaway—to the crypto industry, an enormous one.

Rosin: Okay, so you have inched towards answering my big question, which is: Let's say I never plan to buy or even think about crypto. I listen to this conversation. We talk about weakened regulations, no more enforcement. What risks do I have? Like, what risks am I holding?

Lowrey: Well, there's two. The first has to do with public corruption. Donald Trump has, you know, taken a stake in this venture where we've had a foreign national with involvement with the American legal system, regulatory system effectively buying him off, right? Investing in these tokens, and then Trump gets a stake of that. He gets money from it.

Members of his family or representatives of his family have reportedly been holding talks to take a stake in the U.S. arm of Binance, which is the world's biggest crypto exchange. That's a company that pled guilty to violating American money-laundering laws.

Because of those kinds of laws, it runs a smaller offshoot in the U.S. And so Americans don't actually access, generally don't access the big Binance. My favorite fact about Binance is that it will not even name what jurisdiction it is based in.

And the founder of Binance pled guilty to violating money-laundering rules and is reportedly seeking a pardon from Donald Trump.

Rosin: So that's effectively just another way in which we are becoming a corrupt, banana republic kind of country.

Lowrey: Yes, this is like the Trump Hotel next to the White House on steroids, right?

Rosin: Right, right, right.

Lowrey: So I worry about that. And I worry about President Trump and his agents in office not acting in the public interest in ways that might be opaque.

And so then the second, more material big problem that I'm worried about: So say you don't have any investment in bitcoin. And so you're like, Yeah, you know, the government's getting in on it. But, you know, I'm not personally exposed. The thing that I am worried about is that Wall Street firms, in particular, will take the pro-crypto legislation and they will reformat parts of their business as crypto businesses in order to skirt financial regulations.

You know, this might sound outlandish, right? Maybe you'd say, Oh, wait. But all these Wall Street companies, aren't they regulated by the CFTC and the SEC and OCC and the Fed and Treasury? And can they really do that? And would they really do that?

And I would say that, yeah, the U.S. financial industry excels in regulatory arbitrage. That's, like, one of the main things that they do, is figure out how to get out from regulations. And so I worry about them investing in crypto, and crypto showing up on their books. But, you know, volatile crypto prices, I think that that'll be somewhat self-limiting.

And the thing I really worry about is, you know, a repeat of 2008.

[Music]

Lowrey: I worry about bitcoin being today's credit-default swap, today's mortgage-backed security. I worry about it being the instrument that—through its lack of regulation, through its opacity—being, you know, the lit match with a lot of kindling around. That's really what I worry about.

And that could be affecting people who have nothing to do with crypto, who have no idea it exists, who don't have crypto investments but have a mortgage or have a retirement account or, you know, want to open a business by getting a small-business loan. Because the financial system, it's based on trust. And, you know, if we increase risk in an opaque way in the financial system and reduce trust in it, I am terrified.

Rosin: Yeah. I mean, it doesn't sound outlandish to me, and that's exactly what I was going to say. The reason it doesn't sound outlandish is because we all lived through the subprime-mortgage crisis, and we understood, eventually, that there were a whole bunch of things happening behind the scenes, like complicated financial arrangements, that weren't exactly under the radar, but they did turn out to deeply affect the average American, and not just people who are out there speculating.

Lowrey: And that really was a fin-reg problem. And, you know, we had Dodd- Frank in the wake of that, which, you know, really made the system safer and has held up. And now they're going to gut it.

Rosin: Right. We have a lot of soul searching and response to that, and yet that doesn't really matter at this moment. Like, we're not reading the crypto crisis coming in exactly that same way. Why?

Lowrey: I think crypto is seen as this fringy, edgy, hyper-speculative: Oh, it's boomed and busted before.

Rosin: Ah, okay.

Lowrey: That's my guess, is part of what is happening here. And I think that history repeats itself and we forget so often.

So one of the things that Dodd-Frank did was it set up this little institution in Washington called the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because there was a recognition that the many financial regulators that the United States has—from the Fed to kind of obscure ones like OCC and, you know, important ones like FDIC—they're not really consumer facing.

And so they set up an organization that was really aimed at consumers, would really talk in plain language, and would not just help consumers who are getting ripped off by financial firms but would also watch for problems.

Rosin: Like, Don't sign that mortgage paper.

Lowrey: Yeah.

Rosin: Exactly, exactly.

Lowrey: And then could communicate those problems to the Fed and Treasury and other organizations that could maybe do something about it. And that agency's just gone.

Rosin: Right.

Lowrey: (Laughs.)

Rosin: I knew—as soon as you said that, I was like, Right. Of course. Right. That is gone. So we did set up guardrails that are now just destroyed.

Lowrey: Destroyed or in the process of being destroyed. The issue is still in court, but the Trump administration has functionally closed the CFPB. No work is getting done there right now.

Rosin: So aside from the subprime analogy, are there risks that are unique to crypto, like, different from what we saw unfolding?

Lowrey: The other risk with crypto—and in some ways, I think people underrate this—but it's really scammy. There are a lot of companies that kind of get set up overnight, and they make a bunch of promises, and they target people who might not have a lot of savvy, not a lot of technical knowledge. And these people get ripped off, and they get ripped off in bitcoin, so it's really hard to get the money back.

And so, you know, if you or I walked into a bank and we said, I want to send $10,000 to somebody in Southeast Asia, that would trigger a bunch of internal flags, both within the bank and also regulatory flags, right? Like, Why are you doing that? You know, Are you sure? Are you absolutely positive you want to do that? Okay. And probably somebody would sort of say, Okay, are you getting scammed? Did you read this pamphlet? Are you absolutely positive? And, you know, the problem—and ultimately, if you did really want to do that, like, it's your money. You could send it. But there's guardrails there.

And, you know, with crypto, we now have all of these, you know, older Americans, veterans, people trying to start businesses, people who are just, like, looking for a boyfriend on Hinge or a girlfriend on Bumble who are getting scammed. And this industry is worth, like, billions and billions of dollars. And there's the kind of, like, little ticky-tacky personal scams, which, you know, people can lose their entire life savings in—you know, the little texts that come up: Hey. It's Steve. How are you doing?

But then there's also businesses that get set up that completely misrepresent what they're doing and scam larger numbers of people. And, you know, we've had several Ponzi schemes in crypto.

And so I really, really worry about that too.

Rosin: At the total other end, what about other state actors?

Lowrey: Ugh.

Rosin: Like, is it vulnerable in that way? Did you say—

Lowrey: Yeah, it's so bad. So, you know, it was just a couple weeks ago. Probably most people didn't notice this. But, you know, there was a Dubai-based exchange called Bybit that got hacked. And it seems like the hackers, something called the Lazarus Group, which is run out of North Korea—out of the North Korean military dictatorship.

There's a tremendous amount of state-sanctioned theft, state-sanctioned terrorism that runs through here. And one thing that I quite worry about is: If the United States government is invested in these crypto businesses, and these crypto businesses are sort of being under-regulated in the American system, you know, what happens if China or North Korea or another adversarial country—or just, you know, an adversarial terrorist group that isn't state sponsored—comes in and decides to screw with the crypto markets?

So one way in which this could happen is something—I'm not going to get into the details of it, because it's very detailed—but it's something called a “51 percent attack,” which is that in a given crypto market, if somebody can take over kind of 51 percent of a blockchain, they can control the whole blockchain and kind of change rules within it. And, you know, we haven't totally seen this happen, because it would be expensive to do. But I don't know—maybe if you have state resources, it's not so expensive to do, and maybe you want to do it now that Washington is going all in.

Rosin: Right.

Lowrey: And, you know, going back to what we were talking about before, about, you know, 2007–08 and the global financial crisis: One thing that I worry about a little bit is, you know, one way or another, Donald Trump is not going to be president four years from now, right?

Rosin: (Laughs.)

Lowrey: And it, well, I—

Rosin: From your mouth to God's ears, Annie. But yes.

Lowrey: (Laughs.) I'm going to put a small—according to current American law, he shouldn't be president four years from now.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. Thank you.

Lowrey: And financial crises tend to take a long time to brew.

Rosin: Ah, okay.

Lowrey: It took a long time for the 2007–08 crisis to really kind of sink in and the conditions to come that, you know, it just all started to fall apart.

And I think that especially if, you know, the U.S. doesn't go into a downturn, the markets are probably going to be fine for a while. It's going to take a while for Congress to pass legislation. And, you know, I really worry that it might not be the president after Trump, if current law holds, or the president after that or the president after that—that's one thing that I really worry about.

Rosin: Wait. That you worry about or have hope in? The idea that they're, you know—if he's not president forever, people will reinstate some regulations, some rules. They'll put a block in the slow brewing of collapse.

Lowrey: That's a good point, but no. I mean, I don't think they're going to bother to reinstate rules afterwards, is my guess.

Rosin: Oh, okay. Yeah.

Lowrey: Who is going to prioritize floor time in the House to make sure that they get all the little Dodd-Frank provisions back? And industries, you know, the stronger they get, the stronger they lobby.

And so if you, all of a sudden, have all of these Wall Street, Main Street banks, crypto companies coming in and saying, like, No, no, no, no. Don't go back to the old regime. Don't do that.

Rosin: Right. Right. The motivations run in the opposite direction. Like, they're suddenly making unregulated money through crypto, and why would anyone have the motivation to stop that train?

Lowrey: I mean, I think it'll take another financial crisis for them to fix it—

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Lowrey: —is my guess.

Rosin: Well, Annie, thank you for paying attention, and thank you for coming on the show.

Lowrey: Thanks for having me.

The president is not the first American leader to disregard the role of morality in foreign policy, but he's taking things much further than anyone has before.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Behind closed doors, the late Henry Kissinger left no doubt about how little he valued human rights. Exhibit A is the conversation he had with his boss, President Richard Nixon, on March 1, 1973, which was caught, like so much else, on Nixon's Oval Office recording device. The two have just said goodbye to Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister, and they are casually discussing a matter that came up during her White House visit: whether the administration should do anything to help Soviet Jews, a population persecuted in their country but also denied the possibility of leaving it. “The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy,” Secretary of State Kissinger asserts. “And if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.” Maybe.

Coming from a Jewish man who fled Nazi Germany in 1938 and found refuge in the United States, this is some ice-cold stuff. But it is also classic Kissinger, the purest distillation of the chessboard logic of his realpolitik diplomatic philosophy: When it comes to dealing with other countries, pragmatism must prevail; there is no room for morality, for America's “missionary vigor,” as he scornfully called it in his book Diplomacy.

Perhaps no other American statesman has ever disdained the role of idealism in foreign policy—the meddling of human-rights activists and democracy crusaders—quite like Kissinger. Until now, that is. In just the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, not only has the president sidestepped those annoying do-gooders Kissinger had to contend with, but he has pretty definitively blown them away with a few robust huffs and puffs. And the change, which Kissinger could have only dreamed about, is bewildering to consider.

By defunding the U.S. Agency for International Development and rooting out offices dealing with human rights and democracy at the State Department, Trump decimated, almost overnight, a whole government sector focused on defending fundamental (and, it once seemed, deeply American) principles. Freedom House, established in 1941, one of the oldest human-rights organizations in the world, will now end 80 percent of its programming. Government-funded groups such as the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which monitor elections overseas and support anti-corruption efforts, have faced the chain saws of DOGE—both have had to furlough two-thirds of their staff and are closing offices all over the world. A third group, the National Endowment for Democracy, is in a fight for its life to get its funding restored by an act of Congress.

Adrienne LaFrance: A ticking clock on American freedom

Then there was the executive order killing the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, and broadcasts into countries including Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea. Their radio waves were transmitted to 420 million people in more than 100 countries each week. No more. The Trump administration even did away with the Wilson Center, a foreign-policy think tank whose thinking may have been too closely associated with its namesake, Woodrow Wilson, a president known for championing “moral diplomacy.”

Would Kissinger be pleased?

He certainly had negative feelings about human rights, but that was because they were a bothersome obstacle to an overriding goal: world stability and the avoidance of nuclear war. To give his own ethical vision its due, he thought that, by maintaining a balance of power among major states based on intersecting webs of self-interest, he might keep at bay the forces of geopolitical chaos and unpredictability. If a few Soviet Jews had to go to the gas chambers as collateral damage, that was, he seemed to be saying, a price worth paying for the greater good of avoiding a showdown with the Soviet Union that could blow up the world.

Though this represented transactionalism toward a greater purpose—morally corrupting though it may have been—what we are seeing now is transactionalism all the way down. Trump seems to want to sweep aside moral concerns not because they preclude the new world order he envisions, but because he believes they are inherently worthless—or, as his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put it, the fruits of a “radical political ideology.” This is not to say that past presidents were necessarily more idealistic at their core (though Jimmy Carter probably was). They found ways to use human rights and democracy promotion as rhetorical weapons for achieving their own global aims—such as Ronald Reagan's attack on communism as a godless and immoral system, and George W. Bush's framing of the Iraq War as part of a grand strategy to bring democracy to the Middle East. Trump has no use for these ideas. The world is dog-eat-dog, and the United States needs to assert itself as the biggest dog. End of story.

I asked Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of Henry Kissinger and the American Century, to imagine these past 100 days from Kissinger's perspective. “He would have been happy to see an emphasis on power over ideals,” Suri said. “He long criticized the United States for having this Wilsonian obsession and placing the soft elements, the idealistic elements, ahead of the power elements.” And Kissinger would have appreciated Trump's emphasis on powerful nations and contempt for international bodies, such as the European Union and the United Nations, which the statesman considered “a nuisance at best,” Suri said.

Stephen Sestanovich: The humbling of Henry Kissinger

Kissinger had his own Trumpy moments of impetuous bullying, in which he exercised American power without much thought to its consequences. The covert intervention in Chile is perhaps the best example. When the socialist Salvador Allende won the country's election in 1970, Kissinger feared the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere, but rather than creating a counterbalance, he decided to try to immediately stomp out the threat. “I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people,” he reportedly said. (It's not so hard to imagine Trump saying a similar thing after Canada's recent parliamentary election, in which the winning Liberal party won roughly 44 percent of the vote.)

The military coup that Kissinger helped foment in Chile, which ushered in the brutal regime of Augusto Pinochet, only further destabilized the region (and undermined his larger goal of global stability). Where his approach was more effective—more enduring and less Trumpy—was in bringing about “systemic shifts” in world power, as Suri put it: détente with the Soviet Union (those Jews be damned); the diplomatic opening to China (tens of millions of Mao's victims be damned). Morality was not a factor here either, but at least these moves were based on a strategy of arriving at more security and calm. Whether this was a worthy trade-off is the question that Kissinger's legacy leaves us with.

What he would never have anticipated is a world in which the “missionary” strain in American foreign policy would cease to be a factor at all. The idealists were foils for Kissinger, even when they called him a “war criminal,” as Christopher Hitchens did. But Kissinger knew they existed as a countervailing force, one as old as the country itself. What does it mean that this might no longer be the case, that an even colder, crueler, more self-interested version of realpolitik is upon us?

An NPR story on the new changes at the State Department contained a particularly chilling detail: According to a memo, employees were asked to “streamline” the annual human-rights reports issued by the department, so that they might align with “recently issued Executive Orders.” In practice, the memo explained, the reports should be scrubbed of references such as those to prison abuses, government corruption, and locking up dissidents without due process. They should now contain only the minimum that was legally mandated by Congress. In the report on El Salvador, whose penal system has become a dumping ground for migrants deported from the United States, there will be no details on the conditions in those prisons. Regarding Hungary, where Trump has a strongman ally in Viktor Orbán, the section titled “Corruption in Government” is to be struck, the memo shows.

Read: Looks like Mussolini, quacks like Mussolini

Even when America neglected its ideals, or just paid lip service to them, or had leaders like Kissinger who actively circumvented them, the country still presented itself as a record keeper of last resort when it came to abuses carried out by the forces of despotism. If you were a dissident or a persecuted minority, there was solace in knowing that, somewhere in the government of the most powerful country in the world, someone was working on a report that might bear witness to widespread discrimination or killing. America offered the chance to at least be heard—a hotline with some assurance of a sympathetic ear at the other end. But Trump is now going further than Kissinger himself might have wanted. He is disconnecting that line. There is no longer anyone left to pick up the phone.

Fascism, Bolton told Vox, is “too far above Trump's capabilities.”

by  Sean Rameswaram

To kick off his second term, President Donald Trump sought revenge on President Joe Biden, elite law firms, elite universities, and even some of his former staffers — including John Bolton. 

Bolton has worked in every Republican presidential administration since the '80s, including Trump's first, as national security adviser. Together, they tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the “Iran nuclear deal” put in place by President Barack Obama. 

The Trump-Bolton partnership, however, was not meant to last. Bolton left the Trump administration acrimoniously and has been a constant critic of the president since, so it should be no surprise that Trump revoked his security detail within hours of taking office for a second term in January.

Retribution — a theme of Trump's first 100 days — was one reason to speak with Bolton this week. The other was to get his take on how our democracy is faring at the moment. Another former Trump staffer named John, former chief of staff John Kelly, has said Trump fits the definition of a fascist. 

But Bolton wouldn't go that far, even after 100 days of payback. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. 

I don't disagree with John Kelly on his assessment about Trump, what Trump does, and what's wrong with [his behavior]. To be a fascist [however], you have to think at some conceptual level, which Trump never does. 

Would quibble with the term “fascist” because it's too simplistic? 

It's too far above Trump's capabilities. He has no philosophy. He has, in the national security space, no grand strategy, and doesn't do policy as we conventionally understand that term. It was difficult for me to accept. … There are plenty of people around hi with problematic philosophies, people who do have the ability to think at a more conceptual level. What they say may ultimately be reflected in certain Trump decisions, but it's not because he shares their worldview or anything like that.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

What was your impression of his approach — if not something leaning towards fascism or authoritarianism — when you were in his administration?

I think he wants to be the center of attention. I think that's probably his principal motivating factor. 

I think his approach was once described by [conservative columnist] Charles Krauthammer very well. Krauthammer said that he began by thinking Trump was an 11-year-old. But he realized after a close evaluation that he was about 10 years off: Trump's really a 1-year-old who just sees everything in the world and asks the question, “What's in this for me?” 

Somebody else, I don't remember the name, observed that Trump doesn't have ideas, he has reactions. And I think that's also an important insight. 

If you took all of his decisions in his first term, they'd be a big archipelago of dots; a lot of the dots I agreed with. But if you try to connect the dots…Trump himself couldn't connect the dots.

What have you thought of the first 100 days of the second administration so far?

I think it's even more incoherent. What you're seeing in public now [is] what many of us who were in the first term saw in private. 

Obviously, they spent the four years in exile at Mar-a-Lago planning. [In] their first 100 days, much more was accomplished from Trump's point of view than in his first 100 days in the first term. I'm not sure that history will record that after this burst of activity in the first 100 days, there's much more follow-up. 

I think Trump will get bogged down in a lot of subsidiary issues that happen to catch his attention. For example, he's now chairman of the board of the Kennedy Center. And I can think of nothing more important than for a man who knows so much about buildings [than] to spend a little time on the question of the rugs at the Kennedy Center, the carpeting, the curtains, and the stages. 

I think you're getting at something that I'm constantly struck by, which is while this seems like a serious administration with serious ideas, there's also all of these distractions that make this seem like a bit of a clown car. 

The DOGE firings and then hiring back of nuclear safety personnel, the infamous Houthi PC small group chat, the tariffs, no tariffs, tariffs, just kidding, no tariffs. At the same time, you've got the campaign of retribution we've spoken about. You've got defying court orders and challenging the judiciary. You've got the silencing of speech left and right; the First Amendment.

When you see these constitutional infringements, are you worried for the state of the republic?

I don't think Trump is an existential threat. I think our institutions are a lot stronger than him. … I think we will survive. 

But I think many of the things you've mentioned, he has singled out by executive order for example, Chris Krebs, former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Bureau at Department of Homeland Security in his first term, for prosecution because he dared to say that the 2020 election was safe and free from interference in cyberspace, which Trump didn't want to believe. He singled out a fellow named Miles Taylor, who had been chief of staff to the secretary of Homeland Security. These are actions by a president with no predicate for a criminal investigation that I think are very threatening. 

But you've got to evaluate all this [as] Trump making the first move. He's done all this in the first 100 days. He's done it in Trump time bcause he stays up until two in the morning. He's constantly active. The judicial system obviously doesn't normally react with such speed. Trump makes his headline and then moves on to something else. 

The real question is: What is followed up? 

I think if we come back in a couple of years, we'll see a lot of the effort of the first 100 days just in ashes because the courts will have held. I think that is the ultimate check. It obviously will have cost people money for attorneys' fees and time and aggravation and concern. But I think a lot of these efforts will fail, and they will set precedents that will make it even harder for a future president to try this kind of thing. 

It was 95 years since the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which were an act of monumental stupidity in 1930. I think history will record that Trump-Vance tariffs as another monumental act of stupidity, and hopefully it'll be another 95-year-long lesson. From that perspective, a lot of what has happened in the first 100 days is incomplete because while Trump has moved his pawn to King 4, the rest of the system is still reacting.

You have worked under four presidential administrations, from Reagan to George H.W. Bush to George W. Bush to, of course, President Trump. Does that historical long view that you personally possess work to your advantage in these trying times of ours?

Well, we've suffered a lot worse in this country. We did have a civil war where over 600,000 soldiers died of one cause or another, and the country moved on. I'm not underestimating the problems that Trump is causing. I just think it's important to bring as many people along on the proposition that this is unacceptable. I think sometimes, using the rhetoric that says this is existential turns people off. And I'm looking to convince as many people as possible that this is an aberration in American politics, that it's not sustainable, and particularly in the Republican Party, that beginning in 2026, certainly in 2028, we've got to move on from it.

Prices are rising due to Trump's tariffs — but not universally just yet.

by  Nicole Narea

President Donald Trump warned of short-term pain resulting from his tariffs. 

That pain has arrived in the form of higher prices — and it might not be temporary. 

A wide range of products — from car tires to clothing, many of which are produced in China — have seen price hikes in recent weeks as retailers face increased costs due to tariffs. Executives of big-box stores have reportedly warned the White House that they may have no choice but to pass some of those costs on to American consumers, and that product shortages could follow.

Not all price increases are happening at once or on the same scale. That's in part because some retailers took steps to mitigate the initial impact of tariffs on their businesses. 

But any price increases will put pressure on Americans who were already struggling to keep up with inflation in the post-pandemic era. This year, lower-income consumers, in particular, are already pulling back on spending, and the Yale Budget Lab has projected that the tariffs could cost Americans an average of $4,900 per household.

That's left retailers reluctant to raise prices too much and drive away customers. Businesses that can afford it have been stockpiling inventory for months in an attempt to keep prices low and ride out the tariffs, hoping that Trump will change course.

“I think they probably can make it until the holiday season,” said Edmund Zagorin, founder and chief strategy officer at Arkestro, a supply chain startup that helps companies use AI for procurement of materials and services.

But if Trump digs in his heels on tariffs for the long haul, the current price hikes might only be the beginning. 

Clothing, electronics, household products, baby items, and more are already more expensive now that the tariffs have taken effect, raising costs for retailers that they are passing on to consumers.

Chinese retailers Temu and Shein have announced that they are starting to raise prices. Price hikes vary by category of goods, but Bloomberg reported that Shein prices rose by about 10 percent in a two-day span last week. Temu has added “import charges” of 145 percent of an item's cost.

Their announcements came before Trump eliminated what's called the “de minimis” exemption for Chinese imports on May 2. Under that exemption, shipments of goods valued at less than $800 — the vast majority of Temu and Shein orders — are exempt from tariffs.

Some Amazon sellers have also raised their prices in recent weeks. E-commerce software company SmartScout found that 930 products sold on Amazon have seen price hikes since early April, increasing by 29 percent on average. About 25 percent of those increases have come from sellers based in China.

Companies from Procter & Gamble to Goodyear to Hermès have also announced price increases due to tariffs. Others appear to have done so quietly, with Logitech raising its prices by as much as 25 percent in the wake of the tariffs without explanation. 

Others, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot, reportedly told Trump they are prepared to raise prices if the tariffs remain in place. Executives at Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile have said that if smartphones (which are currently exempt from the highest tariff rates) are later targeted with new tariffs, they will also raise their prices. 

Companies that make goods in the US won't necessarily be spared. Even if products are made in the country, their component parts may be fabricated elsewhere, meaning that they will now cost more to produce.

Although many companies have announced drastic price increases, the effect of tariffs on prices has not been uniform so far. There are a few reasons for that. 

For one, supply chains are now much more robust to shocks like tariffs than they were even just a few years ago. 

After the pandemic upended global supply chains (recall the 2020 run on toilet paper), companies took steps to invest in warehousing and increase their US inventory to avoid future shortages. The total value of US business inventory adjusted for inflation has increased from $1.9 trillion at its trough in June 2020 to about $2.6 trillion in February 2025. 

That means that many businesses already had stockpiles of products that weren't subject to the current tariffs. 

“We're not going to see anything like what we saw during Covid,” Zagorin said. “Companies just carry more inventory, they have higher safety stock levels. ... The supply chain is much more inherently resilient as a result.” 

Companies such as Sony, Apple, Williams-Sonoma, and Costco have also taken additional steps to further expand their US inventory ahead of the tariffs. That means that some big-box retailers are “sitting on an inventory glut in certain categories where they estimate there to be demand,” Zagorin said. 

That has caused shipping activity to decrease in the immediate term, he added. Ship tracking data shows that 33 percent fewer freight vessels are slated to arrive at a major port in Los Angeles in the first full week in May than in the same week last year. 

“There are no ships coming into the port in Seattle and LA because the beast has eaten, and the beast is full,” Zagorin said. 

But not all businesses can afford to stockpile, especially if they have limited capital or are launching a new product. Perishable items can't be stockpiled, meaning that prices of things like imported fresh produce could jump sooner. And there is only so long that retailers' stockpiles will last.

If Trump maintains the tariffs, particularly the high rates on China, through the end of the year, it would create significant supply chain challenges across US businesses, and American consumers would ultimately pay the price. 

“People are not betting on — especially the 145 percent tariff [on Chinese imports] — being a long-term, to-the-end-of-the-year phenomenon,” Zagorin said. “And I think if it is, then probably some of the things that you're seeing headlines about are going to happen, like empty shelves, right in time for the holidays.”

All those rape myths Me Too was supposed to debunk are back.

by  Constance Grady

A few short years ago, Harvey Weinstein was widely considered the monster against which all other alleged sexual abusers were measured. As he begins his New York state retrial for a series of rape and sexual assault charges over a period of years, that consensus has broken. 

To see just how wide of a cultural swing we're in the midst of, observe the questions right-wing commentator Candace Owens and manosphere hero Joe Rogan — notable “just asking questions” provocateurs — have begun asking on Weinstein's behalf.

“After looking over this case, I've concluded that Harvey Weinstein was wrongfully convicted and basically just hung on the Me Too thing,” Owens said on a podcast on Sunday. Owens is in the midst of promoting “Harvey Speaks,” a series of jailhouse interviews with Weinstein which she promises will exonerate him. 

“I can't believe I'm on Harvey Weinstein's side,” Joe Rogan said on his podcast in March. “I thought he was guilty of, like, heinous crimes and then you listen, and you're like, ‘Wait, what? What is going on?'” Rogan says Owens's series convinced him to change his mind on Weinstein.

This high-profile support for Weinstein is part of a larger anti-Me Too, anti-feminist backlash that took off in earnest in 2023, arguably beginning with the Amber Heard-Johnny Depp domestic violence trial. The days in which America was transfixed by accusation after accusation of sexual violence committed by famous men are long over. Gone is the era in which it seemed possible that America was going to truly hold sexual predators accountable, regardless of their fame and power. In this moment, America is more often transfixed by the idea that those famous men aren't so bad after all — that maybe the women who accused them are simply lying. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

For Owens and Rogan to embrace even Harvey Weinstein signals a true sea change in the place the Me Too movement holds in American culture, and with it, a change in how we understand sexual violence. In the first days after Weinstein was accused, around 2017 and 2018, he was treated as a sort of boogeyman, a man whose crimes were so many and so monstrous that all the other sexual crimes coming to light around the same time paled in comparison. 

Now, Weinstein himself is apparently no Weinstein. 

“He's no Weinstein,” commenters said of all the other accused men in those months: Louis C.K., Al Franken, Garrison Keillor. Over the next few years, as Weinstein faced jail time and the other men by and large did not, Weinstein became, as the feminist commenter Jessica Valenti wrote in 2022, a point of comparison next to which everyone else seemed not particularly bad. “Weinstein went to jail,” Valenti wrote, “so that when a woman complains about Louis CK winning a Grammy, men can scoff at her greedy overreach.” 

Now, Weinstein himself is apparently no Weinstein. 

Weinstein is currently facing retrial in New York because his 2020 guilty verdict was thrown out on a procedural issue. He is still serving out a 16-year sentence he received after a 2022 guilty verdict in Los Angeles, but a not guilty verdict in the New York retrial would mean he would not have to serve any time on top of that LA sentence. As he waits for the current trial to make its way through the courts, he appears optimistic about Owens's efforts on his behalf. “I've never seen anything like it,” he told the New York Post. “The woman is going to be a superstar, and I have been around stars.”

One of the greatest successes of the Me Too movement at the height of its influence was not necessarily the criminal prosecution of accused sexual abusers, but its powerful challenge of myths around sexual abuse that had been pervasive for decades. To see Owens's millions of podcast subscribers and social media followers respond by and large favorably to these familiar flimsy defenses shows just how much we seem to have regressed.

One of the greatest successes of the Me Too movement was not necessarily the criminal prosecution of accused sexual abusers, but its powerful challenge of myths around sexual abuse.

First, Owens incorrectly asserts that of the more than 80 women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, only three ended up bringing charges against him. This, she says, proves that the rest of Weinstein's accusers were liars, and that the evidence against him is thin. In fact, three women brought charges against Weinstein in New York and five more in Los Angeles. By most standards, being legally charged with sexual assault against eight different women would be considered a lot, although in Weinstein's case, it does work out to around 10 percent of his public accusers. 

Sexual assault is notoriously difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard of defense in a criminal court. Many of the women who accused Weinstein publicly did so years or even decades after the fact, a common phenomenon among survivors of sexual assault, both because of the shame associated with the attack and the difficulty of securing a conviction. In some cases, the legal statute of limitations had closed by the time these survivors finally went public. 

The standard of evidence in a criminal court is high for good reason: if you're going to take someone's freedom away from them, you should be absolutely certain that they committed a crime. The eight cases brought against Weinstein represent the eight cases that law enforcement was confident they could prove to that standard. 

The fact that the other 72 or so accusations against Weinstein never resulted in criminal charges doesn't mean that they're all false. It doesn't mean that they're all true, either. It means they don't meet the high standards of a courtroom, and that's it. 

Owens's second major argument is that Weinstein's accusers continued to spend time with him and, in some cases, send him flirtatious messages after they say he attacked them. She contends that they were acting as “sugar babies,” engaging in a quid pro quo relationship with Weinstein in which they traded sexual favors for his professional support. 

It is true that many of the women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault continued to maintain friendly relationships after their attacks. This, too, is extremely common among victims of sexual violence, the vast majority of whom know their attackers well. In the case of Weinstein and his accusers, Weinstein held significant professional power over his alleged victims — and his reputation as a vindictive actor left little doubt that he would not hesitate to use it. He torpedoed the careers of women who rejected his advances. That includes Mira Sorvino, who said she was forced to stop acting in major studio films after she turned him down (director Peter Jackson confirmed he decided not to hire her after Weinstein advised him against it).

We also know that Weinstein's machinations didn't stop with professional retaliation. As publication approached for the two bombshell news articles breaking the story of Weinstein's decades-long pattern of sexual assault, Weinstein hired private security agencies, including former Mossad spies, to collect compromising information on the women who were preparing to accuse them.

None of the information or context I am laying out here is new. All of these revelations were discussed in the press in great detail in the weeks and months after the Weinstein story first broke in October 2017, and then repeated again over the course of his 2020 New York trial and his 2022 Los Angeles trial. 

When Owens performs her “just asking questions” routine about Weinstein, she is not asking new questions.

That was one of the few benefits of using Harvey Weinstein as a symbol of the worst kind of monster a sexual predator could possibly be. It was reductive and a little sensationalist, but at the very least, the public's fascination with Weinstein meant a chance to talk through a few all-too pervasive rape myths. It meant a chance to explain why so many women hesitate to come forward and tell their stories, why so many women maintain relationships with their attackers, and why it's so hard to get a conviction on a rape case. For a time, it looked as though if the Me Too movement had accomplished anything outside of a few high-profile arrests, it was at least that it educated the public.

When Owens performs her “just asking questions” routine about Weinstein, she is not asking new questions. She is asking very old ones and acting as though they weren't thoroughly answered the first time around. That she has been able to do so successfully with Weinstein and find an audience willing and eager to welcome her takes means things could get a lot worse for all the other victims of sexual assault out there: the ones whose attackers don't have 80 public accusations against them; whose attackers are, after all, no Weinstein. The informational ecosystem she is building is just one sign that the gains of Me Too are far more ephemeral than we had once hoped.

The Trump administration wants more births. What would that mean for children?

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

The pronatalists have entered the White House.

Last week, news broke that the Trump administration was considering a variety of policies to get Americans to have more kids, inspired by figures like Elon Musk (who has 14 known kids) and activists Simone and Malcolm Collins (who have four but want as many as 10). Those suggestions, which included a $5,000 baby bonus and a “National Medal of Motherhood” uncomfortably reminiscent of Nazi Germany, triggered immediate backlash. Many wondered how any of them would actually help parents, at a time when $5,000 only covers a few months of child care in some places.

Today, however, I want to look at pronatalist policies through a slightly different lens: whether they benefit kids. People who want to boost birth rates generally talk about the importance of children to society as a whole: We need more kids, they often say, to pay into Social Security and take care of us when we're old. But what about the kids themselves? Are pronatalist policies, and pronatalism in general, in their best interest?

In some cases, these questions can be easily answered with data. In others, they're more about values. Is a world with more kids inherently better for kids? Is championing childbirth the best way to show kids that they're valued? The answers to these questions are complex, but the experts I spoke to were clear about one thing: If the United States aims to be a pro-child country, we have a long way to go.

Of all the pronatalist policies reportedly under consideration, one is straightforwardly good for kids, experts told me. That would be the one where the government gives parents money.

Five thousand dollars may not pay for day care — and it may not substantially boost birth rates — but it could be enough to allow a parent to stay home for a few more weeks with a new baby, said Karen Guzzo, a family demographer and director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That extra leave would benefit baby and parents alike, research suggests.

The money could also help defray the costs of a birth (often expensive even with insurance) and of necessities like car seats and strollers (which could be about to go up in price). If it helps keep families solvent during a time of financial upheaval, a baby bonus could benefit children in the long run, since financial stability is good for kids' health and learning. “I'm all for giving families money,” Guzzo said.

In fact, a similar policy already had impressive results. During the Biden administration, the American Rescue Plan expanded the child tax credit from a maximum of $2,000 to between $3,000 and $3,600 per child per year, and made it fully available to poor families. As a result, child poverty dropped to the lowest level on record, and the number of kids going hungry appeared to decrease as well.

However, the expanded child tax credit lapsed at the end of 2021, and child poverty immediately spiked again. Republicans are reportedly interested in bringing the expanded credit back, but the path for any legislation remains unclear. For now, “it is frustrating to hear that we are thinking of giving one-time bonuses when we already had a plan that worked” to reduce child poverty, “and we got rid of that,” Guzzo said.

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

Other policies reportedly under consideration, like giving a medal to moms with more than six children or reserving a certain percentage of Fulbright scholarships for married people or parents, are unlikely to do much of anything for kids or birth rates, according to Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who studies demographic trends. 

But more broadly, it's worth thinking about whether the pronatalist project in general — producing more births — is good for children.

Some observers argue that certain countries with low birth rates have become actively anti-child. In South Korea, for example, hundreds of restaurants, museums, and other public spaces bar children from entering. These “no-kids zones” make life difficult for parents, who have begun to campaign against them, but they arguably limit kids' opportunities to enjoy and learn about the world as well.

“We don't fund school systems, we don't fund child care, we do not fund leave programs. We are so not pro-family in the United States.”

If pronatalism led to more children and therefore more tolerance of children in public space, or even to child-friendly urban design, it could benefit kids. For example, child-centric neighborhoods where kids were able to “flow out their doors” and form “their own little society” would be both fun for kids and beneficial for them as adults by potentially making them more self-sufficient and able to advocate for themselves, Trent MacNamara, a history professor at Texas A&M University who has written about fertility rates, told me. 

Some experts worry about the decline of autonomy and free play among children today, and for MacNamara, it's possible to imagine that having more children around could bring some of that freedom back. “Maybe if you do build a more child-centered society, it's easier for parents to think of kids as running their own show,” he said. 

There are also intangibles to think about — the joys (and trials) of growing up with a lot of siblings, or a lot of cousins, or as part of a big generation. Having a lot of kids around helps both adults and other children get in touch with “their wilder side” and “let go a little bit,” MacNamara said.

However, because pronatalism often goes hand in hand with patriarchal values, it's not necessarily great for the roughly half of children who happen to be girls, Cohen noted.

It's also not completely clear that a world with more births is always a better one for kids. Around the world, “the decline of fertility has been a key part of rising living standards” for kids and adults alike, Cohen said. Fewer kids can mean more resources per kid — for example, falling birth rates in the US are one reason that state and local governments have been able to expand publicly supported preschool. 

Birth rates falling below a certain point could be bad for kids — if, for example, their schools close. But when it comes to policy, the most pro-child ideas aren't necessarily the ones advocates typically bring up to increase birth rates. Kids need food, housing, health care, and education, and they need “the confidence that those things will be there for them in the future, and that their families will be there for them in the future,” Cohen said. 

Policies that would bring stability to parents and kids include robust paid leave, access to health care before and after birth, and subsidized high-quality child care, Guzzo told me. Some pronatalists have pushed for such supports, but right now, they feel out of reach in many parts of the country.

​​“We don't fund school systems, we don't fund child care, we do not fund leave programs,” Guzzo said. “We are so not pro-family in the United States.”

Three children who are US citizens were sent to Honduras last week along with their mothers, who were deported. One is a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer who was removed from the country without his medication, advocates say.

Cuts to the federal government have had a profound effect on programs serving kids, affecting everything from education to safe drinking water.

“Chicken jockey” is a thing now, I guess.

My little kid and I have been reading Nothing's Wrong! a picture book about an anxious rabbit and the bear friend who makes him feel better. My kid refers to this only as “the cool book,” for reasons that remain unclear.

Last week, my story about mental health days for kids reached Sean, a reader who is a high school student in California, when he was, in fact, taking a mental health day. 

“There is a freedom in knowing that when I take on things outside of school to boost my college resume, I can also alleviate some of the pressure that school puts on me,” he wrote. “Yesterday, the thought of going to school made me feel zombified and my usual motivation had melted away, but by the time Monday rolls around, I expect to feel at least somewhat motivated to go.”

In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has moved to roll back food safety measures, endanger slaughterhouse workers, and more.

by  Kenny Torrella

President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been a gift to a sector of the economy that gets little attention but has enormous social and economic consequences: the US meat industry.

While Congress and both Republican and Democratic administrations tend to do what meat companies want — in part because those companies tend to give a lot of money to politicians and intensively lobby them — Trump has been even friendlier than most.

The one striking exception, of course, are the tariffs, which farm groups have opposed and are already feeling the sting from. The ensuing trade war has reduced two of US agriculture's most important exports to China: pork and soybeans.

In most other respects, though, the Trump administration has behaved like traditional anti-regulation conservatives. It's quickly taken a number of actions that directly benefit the meat industry, at the expense of the environment, animals, slaughterhouse workers, and the American consumer.

Here are the six most consequential ones.

Pig slaughter lines are already allowed to process as many as 1,106 hogs per hour, or roughly one pig every 3.2 seconds, while poultry operations are allowed to slaughter up to 140 birds per minute. Yet in March, the US Department of Agriculture announced that it was drafting a rule to allow pig and poultry slaughterhouses to operate even faster. 

Labor advocates say the new regulations will further endanger slaughterhouse workers, who already work one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, suffering high rates of injury from the repetitive cuts they must make to animal carcasses for hours on end.

“Increased line speeds will hurt workers — it's not a maybe, it's a definite,” the president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which represents over 15,000 poultry workers, said in a press release. 

Animal advocates also worry about how this will impact the billions of animals that move through US slaughterhouses every year. “With fewer protections and higher pressure, animals will endure even more suffering on the already cruel live-shackle slaughter line,” Michael Windsor of the animal protection group the Humane League told me in an email.

The USDA didn't respond to an interview request for this story.

Toward the end of President Joe Biden's term, his USDA proposed — but didn't finalize — a rule that would require poultry companies to limit salmonella levels in their products and test raw chicken and turkey for six strains. “If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn't be sold and would be subject to recall,” according to the Associated Press. 

The Biden administration aimed to prevent more than 10 percent of the 1.35 million salmonella infections Americans suffer from each year. But that won't be happening. The National Chicken Council, the industry's leading trade group, opposed the rule when it was proposed; in April, Trump's USDA withdrew it.

In February, the USDA shrunk a farm animal welfare research team from five scientists to just one, Sentient Media's Grey Moran reported.

The unit's research aimed to better understand “the gruesome mutilations and injuries routinely suffered by farm animals, including the pain experienced by livestock during and after castration (the removal of the testicles to prevent further breeding); the far-ranging psychological and physiological impacts of heat stress on farm animals and methods to increase cooling, and ways that farm animal stress is passed down to their offspring,” according to Moran. 

The USDA unit also worked with livestock producers to improve animal welfare and had conducted research on pain endured by female breeding pigs kept in tiny cages, a common practice in the pork industry. That work informed California's farm animal welfare law prohibiting extreme confinement of pigs. 

For a decade, JBS, the world's largest meat company, had been seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange to gain new investors to fuel its nearly $19 billion meat and poultry empire. The Biden administration didn't approve the Brazilian company's listing, nor did Trump in his first term. But last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission gave JBS the green light to go public, news that came the same week it was revealed that one of the company's subsidiaries was the largest single donor to Trump's inauguration.

JBS has long been embroiled in scandal. During Trump's first term, the Justice Department fined JBS, JBS's parent company, and two brothers who control the parent company $280 million for bribing approximately 1,800 Brazilian officials. 

In mid-January, JBS agreed to pay $4 million to a youth migrant legal defense organization after the Labor Department found that children had worked in JBS's slaughterhouses for years. Less than two weeks later, its poultry subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride — the company that donated $5 million to Trump's inauguration — paid a $41.5 million settlement to investors over allegations that it had inflated its stock price.

JBS has also long been implicated in deforestation, and last year, New York state's attorney general took the company to court for its “net zero” climate claims. 

Eggs are so expensive right now primarily because of bird flu, which has resulted in the brutal culling of around 100 million egg-laying hens — and over 60 million chickens and turkeys raised for meat — since the current outbreak began in early 2022. 

More than half of the nearly $2 billion the US has spent on this outbreak has gone to cover poultry companies' losses. According to a recent report by advocacy group Farm Forward, around one-third of payments to poultry companies — some $365 million — have gone to 67 “repeat offender” operations with two or more outbreaks. 

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

While bird flu infections are hard to prevent, producers may be disincentivized from strengthening their biosecurity if the USDA guarantees they'll be compensated for their losses, a problem the Biden administration identified late last year when it implemented an interim rule requiring producers to pass a biosecurity audit to become eligible for compensation.

Despite all this, in late March, the USDA more than doubled the amount that it pays egg companies for each killed hen, from around $7 per bird to almost $17. No matter how weak the poultry industry's biosecurity, and despite the fact that it culls birds in the most painful ways imaginable, the government has made clear it will generously cover poultry producers' losses. 

Although many consumers don't know it, and politicians do little to address it, agriculture is a massive polluter — it's the largest source of US water pollution, most of it from meat and livestock feed production — and accounts for at least 11 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. 

In early April, a leaked USDA memo revealed that the Agricultural Research Service, the USDA's in-house scientific research department, could no longer use 110 words and phrases, including water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, groundwater pollution, and climate change, in some of the department's documents. That'll only make it harder for anyone to understand and ameliorate the meat industry's social costs. 

There's more: Trump recently proclaimed that he wants to open up a marine refuge near Hawaii to commercial fishing, and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins has expressed strong support for legislative efforts to dismantle critical state animal welfare laws.

But not all of the Trump administration's agricultural policies have been favorable to industry (like the tariffs). In March, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the egg industry over price-fixing concerns. Trump has also frozen most of the $19.5 billion set aside in the Inflation Reduction Act to help farmers implement conservation and climate practices, and has canceled a similar $3 billion Biden-era program.

Nor is it necessarily clear that the Trump administration has been bad for animals on net. Animal advocates have cheered recent moves by the FDA and EPA to significantly reduce animal testing, which, although a separate issue from factory farming, could represent a major reduction in a type of animal suffering that has long been unchallenged by both parties.

But when it comes to the industry that's by far more responsible than any other for hurting and killing animals, the Trump administration has been even more deferential than his recent predecessors. Its positions on meat and the animals who suffer for it could be summed up as simply as “kill, baby, kill.”

Have you noticed more professionally produced videos in your LinkedIn feed recently? It's by design, and you can expect to see more.

LinkedIn on Thursday said it's launching a new slate of five original shows from business-focused creators, including the entrepreneur and ""The Diary of a CEO"" podcast host Steven Bartlett, the fashion designer ""Real Housewives of New York"" star Rebecca Minkoff, and Candace Nelson, who founded Sprinkles Cupcakes and the Pizzana pizzeria chain.

LinkedIn's new video push comes as tech companies, from Spotify to YouTube, scramble to lock down top creator talent.

Davang Shah, LinkedIn's VP of marketing, told Business Insider that the effort is also part of the platform's increased focus on video. Total video viewership is up 36% this year versus last, and video creation is growing at twice the rate of other post formats, he said.

The new LinkedIn shows will focus on topics such as female entrepreneurship, the CEO playbook, and artificial intelligence. The other creators taking part are Shelley Zalis, founder of The Female Quotient; Guy Raz, host of the ""How I Built This"" podcast; and the author Bernard Marr.

LinkedIn said more shows from additional content creators are in the works, though the company plans to keep the selection highly curated for now.

The new shows mark an expansion of LinkedIn's Wire Program, which has been renamed BrandLink. The initial 2023 to 2024 launch partners were professional news publishers like The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and Business Insider. LinkedIn said it's also bringing on new publishers this year, including The Washington Post, Front Office Sports, and Adweek.

The expansion to creators, however, shows how influencers are becoming an increasingly important part of social media, especially when it comes to news topics. While LinkedIn was once seen as a largely self-promotional tool for job seekers, more corners of the business community — from venture capitalists, to CEOs, and marketers — are regularly coming to the platform to riff on the latest news and other trending topics in their industries.

The BrandLink program lets the publishers and creators monetize their videos through pre-roll ads on their shows, which appear in the feed as users scroll the app. Like YouTube, users can skip the full ad after watching for a few seconds. Advertisers can choose which shows they want to appear in and use LinkedIn's data to target specific cohorts of users, with pricing determined by an ad auction.

LinkedIn has typically kept a 50% cut of the ad revenue through the BrandLink program, a publisher exec told BI. A LinkedIn spokesperson said the company couldn't share specifics about the revenue share model. Creators own the intellectual property of the content they create for LinkedIn, and they are free to distribute the content on other platforms — but they must post it to LinkedIn first, the spokesperson said.

LinkedIn has long courted creators. In 2012, it launched its Influencers program, encouraging famed businesspeople like Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Arianna Huffington to post to the platform. But its efforts have ramped up in recent years, as it's rolled out tools for famous and everyday creators alike, designed to help them showcase their expertise and boost their followings. Creators told BI last year that they had seen early success by posting videos to its TikTok-style vertical video feed.

Shah said advertisers are drawn to content on the platform that has credibility and authenticity.

""When you produce authentic and trusted content, it leads to connections, it leads to conversations, and ultimately, it leads to closed deals, and that's what marketers care about the most,"" Shah said.

For LinkedIn, any uptick in user numbers and engagement boosts its advertising business. Research firm EMARKETER, a sister company of BI, forecasts that LinkedIn will generate $8.06 billion in ad revenue in 2025, up 12.4% year-on-year.

LinkedIn's video ambitions face stiff competition from YouTube and TikTok, which already host oodles of business and finance-focused content. YouTube, in particular, has become a top destination for podcasts, including the aforementioned ""Diary of a CEO.""

Brendan Gahan, the CEO of Creator Authority, an influencer marketing agency focused on LinkedIn, said the platform has its advantages, however. It ticks off attributes that many marketers want: A large audience (more than 1 billion users, per LinkedIn), strong ad tools, and a largely brand-safe environment. Gahan said what sets the platform apart is its professional, affluent niche.

""This is where decision-makers and executives actually spend time,"" Gahan said. ""Probably more time than any other platform.""

As LinkedIn goes all in on video, Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, an analytics platform and data consultancy, said the platform should avoid chasing volume over value.

""LinkedIn must curate high-signal content that matches the platform's professional intent, not just push engagement bait,"" Cicero said. ""The goal isn't scale, it's signal. You don't need a million views. You need the right 10 decision-makers.""

High-profile tech titans like Mark Zuckerberg have largely embraced President Donald Trump since he won a second term, with many of them making large donations to the president's inaugural fund and socializing among MAGA world at Mar-a-Lago.

Podcaster Dwarkesh Patel asked the Meta CEO to elaborate on his connection to Trump during a Tuesday interview.

""Our default as an American company should be to try to have a productive relationship with whoever is running the government,"" Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago the day before Thanksgiving in 2024, and he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his fellow tech billionaires at Trump's inauguration in January.

He told Patel that Meta's attempts to work with the Biden administration didn't pan out.

""I've been pretty public with some of my frustrations with the previous administration — how they basically did not engage with us or the business community more broadly,"" he said.

In August, Zuckerberg called out the Biden administration, saying Meta was pressured to remove Facebook posts related to COVID-19 by the government. Zuckerberg said at the time he regretted not pushing back on the White House.

A strong relationship between Big Tech and the government is ""necessary"" for progress, Zuckerberg told Patel on Tuesday.

""It's like we're trying to build great stuff,"" he said. ""That's sort of that's how I see it, and it's also how I would guess most others see it.""

A spokesperson for Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The US and Ukraine struck a major deal granting American companies privileged access to key natural resources in Ukraine — including aluminum, graphite, oil, and natural gas — that could boost the tech and automotive sectors.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent signed the deal in Washington, DC, on Wednesday.

""This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,"" the Treasury Department said in a press release. ""President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides' commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.""

The Treasury Department added that the economic partnership positions Ukraine and the US to ""work collaboratively and invest together"" to ensure that ""our mutual assets, talents, and capabilities can accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery.""

On social media, Svyrydenko wrote: ""Together with the United States we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment into our country.""

Bessent later said in a video statement that the deal would help ""unlock Ukraine's growth assets.""

The agreement comes at a time of rising supply-chain uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare earth metals are sourced from.

On April 4, China restricted exports of seven rare earth elements and related materials in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially affecting critical industries like defense, energy, and automobiles.

Ukraine possesses a rich array of natural resources that are of growing importance to the US. Graphite, lithium, and titanium are vital for EV battery production, solar panels, and military equipment. High-purity neon gas and rare earth metals are critical for semiconductor manufacturing to power the growth of AI systems.

The minerals deal was originally set to be signed on February 28, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington ended in acrimony.

The agreement was signed just days after Trump and Zelenskyy met in person on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, as cease-fire talks between Moscow and Washington continue. Trump on Wednesday called their face-to-face meeting a ""moment of solace in a sense"" in an interview with ABC News.

The White House and the  Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta's Reality Labs is burning money. Recent layoffs may be the beginning of the end.","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-q1-2025-earnings-reality-labs-layoffs-losses-2025-4","Thu, 01 May 2025 00:20:00 GMT","

Meta reported $4.2 billion in losses from its Reality Labs division this quarter on Wednesday. Its total metaverse burn has now pushed past $60 billion since 2020.

Adding to the turmoil, Meta conducted layoffs in its Reality Labs division last week, primarily affecting teams that focused on VR gaming and the Supernatural VR fitness app, which Meta owns.

At least one analyst thinks the end is near.

""For now, Meta maintains two tales of one company,"" Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx told Business Insider. ""Its Family of Apps continues to grow by the metrics that matter. But Reality Labs is a leaky bucket. Year-over-year, that division's revenue is down, and losses are up. I predict come end of this year, Meta will shutter its metaverse projects, like Horizon Worlds.""

Horizon Worlds, Meta's social VR app in which users interact as avatars in shared digital spaces, was once the company's poster child for the metaverse. However, it has struggled to gain mainstream traction.

Over the 2024 holidays, Meta's Horizon app briefly topped app store charts — not because of surging interest in the metaverse, but because it's required to set up a new Quest headset. It signaled that the devices were a popular gift.

That momentum didn't stick. On this week's earnings call, Meta said Quest sales underperformed, dragging Reality Labs' revenue down 6% year-over-year.

On the call, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked what might finally shrink those multibillion-dollar losses.

""There are more investments that I think make sense to make,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded, citing the growth of Meta's AI glasses and a vision to eventually sell tens of millions of units.

Internally, the stakes are high. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has said 2025 is the ""most critical"" year for the company's metaverse effort, warning staff that without real traction, the whole thing could go down as a ""legendary misadventure.""

Reality Labs, which includes the Quest headsets, Horizon Worlds, and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, is structured into two units: Metaverse and Wearables. In January, Meta quietly reshuffled the division, moving top sales and marketing leads under broader company leadership to align more tightly with its AI push.

For now, Meta is still in the fight, though its momentum has clearly moved elsewhere: to its Llama AI models, Meta AI, and those Ray-Bans. The metaverse may not be dead yet, but it's no longer center stage.

The Capitol Building in Washington.

Key House Republicans on Thursday discussed ways to direct an expanded state and local tax deduction to those making less than $400,000 as they seek to balance the cost of the tax break with the political needs of several lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. 

The $10,000 cap on SALT, one of the most contentious issues in the GOP debate on its giant tax bill, remained unresolved as lawmakers left Washington Thursday. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Republicans moved a step closer Thursday to repealing a federal waiver allowing California to ban gasoline-powered cars by 2035, a policy that had drawn opposition from automakers, fuel producers and President Donald Trump himself. 

The US House voted 246-164 to roll back an Environmental Protection Agency authorization issued under former President Joe Biden, which let California enact emissions standards even stricter than the US government's requirements to increase sales of electric and other zero-emission vehicles.

Charles Schwab Corp. telephoned thousands of its retail-investing customers who were close to margin calls last month as US President Donald Trump's trade war sent stocks sinking, Chief Executive Officer Rick Wurster said.

It's a “pre-margin-call call,” Wurster said Thursday at a Reuters event. Schwab reaches out to clients if they're nearing a margin call — triggered when money is needed in a margin account to meet minimum capital requirements — because some clients opt to add funds rather than being automatically pulled out of a position, he said. “We absolutely have had to do a lot more of those.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

McDonald's Corp. US sales fell sharply in the first quarter, reflecting a deterioration in consumer sentiment that's making it harder for restaurants to lure in diners.

Same-store sales slumped 3.6% in the US, according to a statement Thursday, mainly because of a decline in guest counts. It's the biggest drop in the chain's home market since the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic kept diners at home.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

French power prices again tumbled below zero as solar energy swamped the grid, forcing the country's vast nuclear fleet to slash output.

Intraday prices sank as low as minus €68.42 a megawatt-hour Thursday as a flood of solar energy coincided with a slump in demand as people stayed off work for the May Day holiday.

In this article

Kohl's said on Thursday it had fired CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation found he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, after little more than 100 days in the CEO job.

Buchanan engaged in transactions with this person's company on ""highly unusual terms"", Kohl's said in a filing, and also caused the company to agree to a multi-million-dollar consulting agreement with a team that included this person he was involved with. He also did not disclose the relationship, the company said.

Buchanan's firing makes the third change at the helm in as many years for the beleaguered department-store retailer, which has been struggling with several quarters of sagging sales due to stiff competition from e-commerce firms and big-box retailers such as Walmart, as well as its own strategic missteps.

Kohl's shares rose 8.4% on Thursday, as it reported better-than-expected preliminary first-quarter earnings, but the stock is still down roughly 70% over the last year.

Buchanan was not immediately available for comment when contacted on LinkedIn, while Kohl's declined to provide further comment.

Buchanan was named CEO in November, replacing Tom Kingsbury. After he took over as CEO in January, Kohl's cut about 10% of its corporate workforce to improve profitability.

""(Kohl's) desperately needs stability and changes in its business model. However, it's better to make the move to fire Buchanan rather than let the situation get worse,"" Morningstar Research analyst David Swartz said.

Buchanan is forfeiting all stock awards he received, including $15 million in restricted stock that was meant to vest over three years as long as he was still employed with the company. He also has to reimburse the company for $2.5 million of his $3.75 million signing bonus.

Buchanan joined Kohl's from Michaels Companies, a specialty retailer of arts and crafts supplies, where he was CEO since 2020. He was also the chief merchandising and chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. e-Commerce prior to that.

Kohl's expects first-quarter comparable sales to fall between 4% and 4.3%, compared with analysts' average expectation of a 6.34% decrease, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company expects a loss per share in the range of 20 cents to 24 cents, compared with estimates for a loss of 52 cents per share.

Kohl's will report first-quarter results on May 29.

Buchanan's removal does not affect Kohl's financial reporting or other employees, the company said. It named Michael Bender as its interim CEO, effective immediately, and said that the search for a permanent chief executive would begin soon.

As he exits his efforts to curtail wasteful government spending, Elon Musk is taking one last shot, calling into question the $2.5 billion Federal Reserve building renovation.

In a rare interview with print reporters, the initiator of the Department of Government Efficiency advisory board said the price tag for the central bank operation ""sounds high.""

""I mean, what do you get for $2.5 billion in redecorating? Must be incredible,"" the Tesla CEO said.

The Fed began the project in 2021 with an initial price tag of $1.9 billion. Since then, multiple factors have converged to drive up costs, including rising costs of materials, construction delays, changes in the design and site problems.

Among the goals for the renovation are dealing with a backlog of upgrades, meeting building codes and regulations, updating technology, and addressing energy efficiency. Fed officials say the changes ultimately will save money by consolidating staff into one space, which will reduce leasing costs, ""and provide a modern, efficient workspace for employees to conduct their work on behalf of the American people.""

Musk, though, said the cost overruns should be part of the broader examination of government waste. DOGE claims to have saved taxpayers $160 billion during its short operating life looking through the government's books.

""Since, at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, I think ... we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer,"" Musk said. ""That's an eyebrow-raiser, you know? They're like, can we see pictures of what you get for that?""

The Fed is not actually funded by taxpayers but rather by the interest the central banks earns on its securities as well as fees from banks it supervises. Members of the Fed board of governors have their salaries set by Congress and also are paid through the same funding mechanism.

Normally, the money the Fed earns beyond its operating costs are paid back to the Treasury. However, the past two years the central bank has seen operating losses due to rising interest rates that it must pay on bank reserves.

As for the renovation, documents filed with the National Capital Planning Commission note that, ""While there have been regular modifications and renovations to the building over its 80-year history, many of the building systems are at the end of their useful life, and the building no longer fully serves the Board's needs.""

Fed officials declined comment.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is urging the Trump administration to immediately implement a ""tariff exclusion process"" in order to keep the U.S. economy from falling into a recession and inflicting ""irreparable harm"" on small businesses.

In a letter first obtained by CNBC, the massive business lobbying group asked key Trump trade officials to automatically lift tariffs on all small business importers and on all products that ""cannot be produced in the U.S."" or are not domestically available.

The letter from the Chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, also asked the Trump administration to establish a process for businesses to quickly obtain tariff exclusions if they can demonstrate that import duties pose ""significant risks to U.S. employment.""

""We are deeply concerned that even if it only takes weeks or months to reach agreements, many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm,"" Clark wrote in the letter sent late Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

""The Chamber requests the administration take immediate actions to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,"" she wrote.

In an interview Thursday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" Clark said she penned the White House because ""we were just getting inundated by small business requests for information, for relief.""

Those business owners are ""afraid for the very survival of their business,"" she said.

Clark also explained why the Chamber is opting not to challenge Trump's tariffs in court — as others have done — even though her group had sued the Biden administration more than 20 times.

""We do worry about government overreach"" and ""micromanagement,"" she said. ""But in this case, the courts take a long time. And what small business needs, what all business needs, is more immediate relief.""

Asked in a press briefing if the Trump administration is considering the Chamber's request for tariff exemptions, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller suggested it is not.

""The relief for small businesses is going to come in the form of the largest tax cut in American history,"" he said, referring to Republicans' plan to pass a major tax cut bill this year.

Miller also said that President Donald Trump has ""made clear"" that companies that invest in the U.S. will face no liability from tariffs.

Pressed to clarify that he was rejecting the idea of short-term tariff relief for small businesses, Miller said, ""It's a yes on tax relief for small businesses. And again, you only pay the tariff for products that are made outside the United States.""

Correction: Stephen Miller is White House deputy chief of staff. An earlier version misspelled his name.

National security advisor Mike Waltz is expected to leave his post in the Trump administration on the heels of controversy over his creation of a Signal messaging app group that was used to discuss U.S. military plans in March.

Deputy national security advisor Alex Wong is also expected to leave his job, according to three sources who spoke to NBC News about the two exits on Thursday.

Waltz was conspicuously absent from a Rose Garden event at the White House marking the National Day of Prayer on Thursday. Many other senior Trump administration officials were in attendance.

The Signal group that Waltz created inadvertently included The Atlantic Editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of messages exchanged between high-level Trump administration officials.

The group's other members were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, CIA Director Scott Ratcliff, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Goldberg reported that the texts ended with Hegseth on March 15 detailing plans that ""included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing"" of attacks on Houthi forces in Yemen, which were launched within hours of those texts.

Waltz would be the first major official to leave the White House since the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term in January.

Trump earlier this week told The Atlantic that Waltz's job was secure.

In a discussion with Atlantic reporters, Trump was asked if he believed that Hegseth would remain as Pentagon chief. 

Hegseth has been criticized for his disclosure of the attack plans on the group that included Goldberg, and for his separate use of the app to send some information about the planned strikes on Houthi forces to his wife, his brother, his attorney, and some aides.

""Yeah, he's safe,"" Trump said of Hegseth.

Asked if Hegseth would stay in the administration longer than Waltz, Trump replied, ""Waltz is fine. I mean, he's here. He just left this office. He's fine. He was beat up also.""

The Pentagon's internal watchdog is investigating Hegseth for his use of Signal to discuss pending military strikes.

The probe by the Office of the Inspector General will determine if Hegseth and other Defense Department staff complied with rules over the ""use of a commercial messaging application for official business,"" the office said last month.

Hegseth and others in the Trump administration have downplayed the controversy, saying no classified information was shared on the Signal chats.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday that he believed Waltz should be dismissed from his post.

""Look, they should fire him, but they're firing the wrong guy,"" Schumer said. ""They should be firing Hegseth.""

Trump's first national security advisor, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, resigned under fire in early 2017 after just 24 days for having misled then-Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition.

In late 2017, Flynn agreed to plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

Trump pardoned Flynn in late 2020, months before leaving office.

In this article

Meta Platforms shares jumped more than 5% Thursday after the company topped earnings expectations and showed advertising resilience in a murky macroeconomic environment.

""Key here is that Meta's adv. demand trends appear to be relatively healthy and while we're watching for any impacts from macro and lower spend from China-based advertisers given the de minimis change, Meta's scale of users and advertisers + focus on newer products are offsetting some macro challenges,"" wrote Citi's Ronald Josey.

First-quarter revenues grew 16% from a year ago to $42.31 billion and topped a $41.10 billion estimate from LSEG. Earnings came in at $6.43 per share, versus the expectation of $5.28 per share. Net income reached $16.64 billion, jumping 35% from $12.37 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The company also issued in-line guidance for the current period. Meta's finance chief Susan Li said the company expects sales to range between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG had forecast $44.03 billion in revenues.

""Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reassured analysts on an earnings call Wednesday.

Investors this earnings season are watching for signs that President Donald Trump's tariff push is hampering advertising demand, in which many technology businesses make up a sizeable chunk of revenues. Snap and Google have already warned of potential headwinds to their ad businesses.

Advertising revenue for the first quarter came in at $41.39 billion, topping a forecast of $40.44 billion from Wall Street. But Li told analysts that Meta has ""seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters,"" which may stem from the ending of the de minimis trade loophole on Friday.

""The digital ad market is likely to get a bit jittery over coming months, but META's performance orientation and significant AI ad investments should mean continued relative share gains against the field,"" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler.

Meta also upped its capital expenditures range to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in artificial intelligence and a potential uptick in infrastructure hardware costs as trade uncertainty continues.

Bernstein's Mark Shmulik called the hike in spending a ""bold strategy"" against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, but called Meta the ""safest and most exciting dodgeball team around.""

""We continue to believe that Meta is well positioned for a tougher macro environment given its scaled advertiser base, highly performant platform, & vertical agnostic inventory,"" wrote JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth.

Related Stories

We've all been there: A coworker, a relative or even a stranger at the coffee shop comes out of left field with a remark that's cutting, condescending and just plain rude.

Your first instinct might be to fire back with a snarky comment. And sure, delivering a withering comeback would feel satisfying in the moment, but in most situations — especially professional ones — that's not the move. Ideally, you want to be known as someone who holds their ground with composure and confidence.

To shut down rude behavior instantly, try a simple yet powerful five-word response: ""Do you really mean that?"" 

Say it with outrage or dripping sarcasm, with raised eyebrows or deadpan calm. It doesn't matter. This phrase is quietly disarming and deceptively powerful.

When you ask someone if they really meant what they just said, you're doing two things at once.

First, you're giving them a chance to reconsider. Most rude remarks aren't calculated — they're tossed off without forethought. By responding with curiosity instead of defensiveness, you're holding up a mirror. Often, that's all it takes for the other person to walk back their offense.

Second, you shift the power dynamic. You're not on your heels anymore — you're in control. And instead of lashing out or escalating, you're putting the responsibility back where it belongs: with the person who made the rude comment.

At work, rudeness can take many forms:

Outside the office, rude comments tend to be even more personal:

In each case, asking the speaker to reflect on the meaning of their words will likely make them soften, correct themselves, or at least get the message: You're not a pushover. You noticed their aggressive behavior and served them notice.

The goal isn't to embarrass or dominate the other person. You want to hold the line with dignity. When it works, it opens the door for a reset. A backpedal. Even, occasionally, an apology.

Sometimes, the best thing you can do is let it roll off your back. People are unpredictable, distracted, under pressure. A weird comment doesn't always mean they don't respect you.

But if you do feel the need to respond, and you want to keep things calm but clear, this five-word phrase can be your new go-to. The best thing about it? Instead of sulking or re-categorizing someone as an enemy, you preserve the relationship.

In this article

Shares of Tesla were flat in premarket trading Thursday after the EV maker denied a Wall Street Journal report that its board was searching for a replacement for chief executive Elon Musk.

The report, citing comments from sources familiar with the discussions, said that Tesla's board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding the company's next CEO. Shares of Tesla fell as much as 3% in overnight trading on trading platform Robinhood following the news, before paring losses.

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm wrote on the social media platform X that the report was ""absolutely false.""

""Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,"" she wrote.

""This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.""

It comes after a sharp drop in the electric vehicle giant's sales and profits, with its top and bottom lines missing estimates in the first quarter. Musk has admitted that his involvement with the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker's stock price.

The mega-billionaire said on a Tesla earnings call last week that he plans to spend just a ""day or two per week"" running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency beginning in May.

Tesla's total revenue slipped 9% year-on-year to hit $19.34 billion in the January-March quarter. This falls short of the $21.11 billion forecast by analysts, LSEG data shows.

Revenue from its automotive segment declined 20% year-on-year to $14 billion, as the company needed to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. Tesla also attributed the decline to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Its net income plunged 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

Since the start of the year, its shares have plunged over 30%.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's eye-scanning venture officially makes its U.S. debut Thursday.

Altman co-founded ""World"" in 2019 — known as Worldcoin until last year — to create a global identity verification system for people, using iris scans and the blockchain to ideally fight against fraud and bots.

Here's how it works: You go up to an Orb, a spherical biometric device, and it spends about 30 seconds scanning your face and iris, then creates and stores a unique ""IrisCode"" for you verifying that you're a human and that you've never signed up before. Then you get some of the project's cryptocurrency, WLD, for free, and you can use your World ID as a sign-in with integrated platforms, which currently include an open API integration with Minecraft, Reddit, Telegram, Shopify and Discord.

Starting Thursday, the company is opening six flagship U.S. retail locations where people can sign up to have their eyeball scanned: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco.

At an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, the venture announced two high-profile partnerships: Visa will introduce the ""World Visa card"" this summer, available only to people who have had their irises scanned by World, and the online dating giant Match Group will begin a pilot program testing out World ID and some age verification tools with Tinder in Japan.

World's ""At Last"" event in Fort Mason — which featured a performance by singer and rapper Anderson .Paak — included a live demo following a keynote by World Network co-founders Alex Blania and Altman. The demo, which got off to a slightly slow start due to some interference from the stage lights, showed the audience how to pair the Orb to their phones. At one point, the person doing the demo had to take off his glasses so the Orb could see his face a little more clearly.

""We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central, in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content,"" Altman said during the keynote.

The latest version of the Orb is powered by the Nvidia Jetson processor, the company said. World plans to deploy 7.500 orbs by the end of the year in the U.S.

The company said it also plans to open an assembly line for manufacturing orbs in Richardson, Texas.

Answering questions from reporters who flew in from all over the world for the event, Blania called the current challenges from AI bots and deepfake technologies a ""wake up moment for proof of human.""

Although Altman, who is the CEO of OpenAI, spoke at the event on Wednesday, a representative for the company said an integration with OpenAI wasn't in the works at the moment.

Blania told reporters that he was open to the idea of a partnership, adding that ""we will share news when we have them.""

World's mission has been questioned by some governments and Hong Kong regulators asked the project to cease operation of all data collection last year.

One of the controversies surrounding World relates to data storage.

The project keeps some personal data for fraud purposes, to make sure that people aren't double-scanning or tricking the system. But investors in the project, as well as its team members, say that data is decentralized and impossible to reverse-engineer — unlike typical anonymized data, which it is possible to de-anonymize and identify someone with.

Adrian Ludwig, chief information security officer at Tools for Humanity, a core contributor to World, said in an interview that the project splits up individuals' stored data among multiple parties, such as a ""couple of different financial institutions"" and some blockchain institutions.

""The way I always think about it is we were very surprised when the Panama Papers got broken into and they got leaked,"" Ludwig said. ""We're concerned about that kind of situation, and so we don't have a single place that has all the sensitive data. We split it up across multiple different companies and organizations that are holding it, and we use cryptography to keep it separate. You'd have to compromise all of them simultaneously.""

Since its founding, Tools for Humanity — the Altman-founded startup behind the World project — has raised upwards of $140 million in funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase and billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, giving the firm a $1 billion valuation as of 2021, the most recent year for which the valuation is available.

So far there are 26 million people on the network across Europe, South America and the Asia-Pacific region, with 12 million verified, according to a representative for World, who added that its goal is to scale to one billion people. It's moving slower than expected, though: In 2021, the project's goal was to scale to one billion people by 2023.

The White House announced Wednesday night that it signed an economic partnership with Ukraine that includes an agreement on the ownership and extraction of natural resources from the war-torn nation.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, established as the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, will allow the U.S. to ""invest alongside Ukraine"" to unlock its growth assets and ultimately accelerate its economic recovery.

""As the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,"" Bessent said. ""President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides' commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.""

""To be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" he added.

Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, provided more details on the minerals deal outlined in the agreement, first noting in a post on X that ""it is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract"" and that ""subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership.""

Ukraine and the U.S. will jointly manage and maintain co-ownership of the investment fund, with neither side holding a dominant vote, Svyrydenko said. It will be financed by new Ukrainian oil, gas and critical mineral licenses, with 50% of all revenue from the licenses going toward the fund.

Svyrydenko indicated in her post that the U.S. will also contribute to the fund, through it is unclear exactly how much.

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin, soaring this week to levels not seen since before the markets' tariff tantrum (and helped by a predicted $10 trillion Wall Street surprise).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has added almost 30% since crashing to April lows as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar.

Now, after a leak revealed growing establishment “panic” over U.S. president Donald Trump's plans for bitcoin and crypto, analysts are warning a Federal Reserve “nightmare” is coming true as data reveals the worst U.S. quarterly economic performance in three years.

“The Fed's worst nightmare just got worse,” analysts with the The Kobeissi Letter posted to X. “The market knows that stagflation has arrived.""

Commerce department data showed U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter contracted at a 0.3% annualized rate, weighed down by a record surge in imports.

The analysts also pointed to the latest reading of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, that was unchanged in March after advancing 0.4% in February.

""The PCE price index is now at its highest reading since July 2024, before the ‘Fed pivot' began,"" Kobeissi analysts wrote.

In September, Fed chair Jerome Powell surprised markets with an interest rate cut, kicking off a monetary policy loosening cycle that's been on pause for months.

Kobeissi researchers have previously warned of the looming threat of “stagflation,” referring to a combination of economic stagnation and climbing inflation.

“We have rising inflation with a weakening economy,” they wrote following this week's data drop. “The Fed is facing the lose-lose situation they thought would never arrive.”

The Fed will meet next week to decide whether to change interest rates, with the market currently predicting it will leave rates on hold.

However, traders are betting the Fed will begin cutting in June, something that's expected to boost the bitcoin price and risk assets.

""For bitcoin, such a scenario is a positive factor, since the easing of monetary policy traditionally leads to an influx of liquidity into risky assets,"" Tracy Jin, chief operating officer of bitcoin and crypto exchange MEXC, said in emailed comments.

Bitcoin's performance in recent months at first disappointed traders as the bitcoin price fell along with stocks in the face of Trump's escalating trade war.

However, the bitcoin price has surged back through April, making it one of the year's better performing assets so far.

“Since president Trump's Liberation Day announcement, bitcoin has charted its own course, surging past $90,000 and demonstrating remarkable resilience against the headwinds affecting traditional markets,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, said via email.

“This outperformance relative to the Nasdaq represents a significant departure from historical patterns. As the impacts of president Trump's tariff policies begin to materialize more fully across the economy, we anticipate bitcoin could further disassociate from equities. The asset shows strong potential to outperform other risk assets as investors seek hedges against policy-driven market volatility.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Last year on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to be a champion of the Bitcoin mining industry in the US. Yet as American crypto miners begin to release their first quarterly earnings reports since Trump returned to the White House, it's clear the group is struggling.

Seven of the eight biggest publicly traded miners that are based in the US are expected to post a loss when they report first-quarter results, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The financial struggles come even after Bitcoin reached a record above $109,000 in January, and its price in the quarter averaged about 75% higher than it was in the first quarter of 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Developers working on Ethereum are about to finalize two complementary standards that could solve one of the network's persistent user experience problems: how to clearly point to addresses across different chains.

""Users and apps need ways to unambiguously refer to an address on a specific chain,"" Wonderland, a multi-protocol team contributing to Ethereum and other decentralized networks, explained.

Right now, ""there's no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,"" it added in a tweet thread.

Wonderland presented their work on ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 on Wednesday's Ethereum L2 Interop Working Group call, detailing how these ""interoperable addresses"" will improve cross-chain interactions.

The two standards help reduce confusion about addresses between different chains. They use a simple format and an easy-to-understand naming system.

Currently, there's no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information.

Wallets, dapps, explorers, and smart contracts all handle addresses differently. The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX.

— Wonderland (@DeFi_Wonderland) April 30, 2025



For everyday users, these standards promise simpler, safer cross-chain transactions.

Instead of managing complex addresses across multiple networks, users can see human-readable names, making it easier for them to interact across a sprawling ecosystem of networks and sidechains.

“The idea is for this to serve the needs of two groups of people,"" Wonderland's pseudonymous developer, Teddy, explained on the call.

ERC-7930 gives computers a standardized format to identify exactly which network an address belongs to.

ERC-7828, meanwhile, makes addresses human-readable: something like ""readonly@decrypt.this,"" instead of a long string of letters and numbers, making addresses easily recognizable by chain.

This approach addresses a pain point. Users often switch between wallets and networks, making it easy to send money to the right address but on the wrong network, which can result in losses.

""On a fundamental level this is very simple. This is just 'okay people know about addresses' and we have to also strap a chain ID on top of that, so people know where that address actually lives,"" Teddy explained.

With finalization targeted for May 9th, the standards will soon be available for implementation in wallets, block explorers, and cross-chain messaging protocols.

The Wonderland team is calling for final community feedback through Ethereum Magicians forum threads before the standards reach final call status.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","The Next Ethereum Will Come From a Dorm Room (or a College Dropout)","https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-toronto-2025-coverage/2025/05/01/the-next-ethereum-will-come-from-a-dorm-room-or-a-college-dropout","Thu, 01 May 2025 14:46:54 GMT","

Before Ethereum had a market cap, it was just an idea in a college dropout's head.

Crypto's biggest companies aren't being planned in boardrooms. They're being built in dorm rooms, group chats, and hackathons by founders who don't wait for permission (many of them don't finish college at all). This is not a coincidence. It's a repeat of a pattern we've seen before: bold ideas, early action, and zero regard for institutional timelines.

In 2014, a group of students launched the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) to connect students exploring bitcoin and blockchain across college campuses. Within a year, BEN had grown to over 160 chapters in more than 35 countries.

What started as grassroots education quickly became a launchpad for builders.

BEN became a catalyst for its core members and for a global cohort of students who saw crypto as a blank canvas. Some dropped out. Others stayed in. Nearly all started building before the rest of the world caught on. Projects fostered by that ecosystem have gone on to collectively reach over $20 billion in peak valuations, including IOTA, Optimism, Bitso, Augur, Wanchain, Notional and Roll.

That same spirit of early action led me and Erick Pinos, former president of MIT's Bitcoin Club, to co-found Dropout Capital, backing young, technical founders who move before the world notices.

Erick Pinos will speak at Consensus 2025 on May 16 in a panel titled “The Talent Pipeline: How to Find a Job in Crypto.”

As Pinos puts it:

“Over the past seven years we've met with countless student founders and at least half a dozen have become unicorns…we're excited to give others the opportunity to be a part of funding the next generation of blockchain innovation.”

This urgency isn't new. It's the same drive that shaped early tech giants. Steve Jobs (Apple), Steve Wozniak (Apple), Jack Dorsey (Twitter, Square), and Patrick & John Collison (Stripe) all left college behind to build companies that redefined their industries.

Web3 founders are following the same path

Some of crypto's most influential founders started the same way:

•	Vitalik Buterin dropped out of the University of Waterloo to launch Ethereum (peaked at $500 billion+)

•	Charles Hoskinson left the University of Colorado before founding Cardano (peaked at $70 billion)

•	Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and Stellar, dropped out of UC Berkeley (Ripple peaked at $130 billion)

•	Jesse Powell left Cal State to build Kraken (valued at $10 billion)

•	Shayne Coplan dropped out of NYU in his first semester to start Polymarket (estimated at $1 billion)

•	Joey Krug left Pomona to co-found Augur (peaked at $1 billion)

•	Jeremy Gardner, who co-founded Augur with Krug, dropped out of the University of Michigan (peaked at $1 billion)

•	Jinglan Wang left Wellesley to build Eximchain and later helped lead Optimism (peaked at $11 billion+)

•	Noah Tweedale, co-founder of Pump.fun, never enrolled (estimated at $1 billion+)

At Dropout Capital, we've backed early-stage companies including:

•	Vana, founded at MIT, building a decentralized data marketplace

•	SatLayer, started by MIT alumni and former VCs, creating Bitcoin-native compute for AI

•	Tenderize, launched by students at Marquette University, building a liquid staking marketplace

•	Algebra.Finance, founded by a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a background in mobile operating systems, rethinking on-chain prediction infrastructure

One place where these stories, and the stories of the next generation are already being shared is ChainStories, a podcast I host alongside Erick.

ChainStories takes listeners behind the scenes of some of the most successful projects in crypto, including Plume Network, YesNoError, Algebra.Finance, Virtuals.io, TON, Horizon Labs, and many others, breaking down how real companies are built from idea to launch, and helping founders and VCs understand the decisions, tradeoffs, and risks that happen long before anyone notices.

The future of crypto isn't being theorized at conferences or slow-walked through corporate committees.

It's being built by people who move early, take risks, and start building before the world even realizes what's happening. And, if history is any guide, the companies that matter most won't be the ones that waited.

Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), believes that Ethereum will become irrelevant in five or ten years from now if its current trajectory does not change. 

Earlier this month, Feist introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7938, which aims to increase the gas limit by 100x over the course of four years. This would make it possible to conduct a much bigger number of transactions per block. 

Feist has admitted that the proposal is ""unconvetional,"" but he argues that such unorthodox decisions are needed since the layer-1 chain is at risk of fading into irrelevance.

The researcher is part of the camp that wants Ethereum to become the center of economic activity within the ecosystem. Ultimately, the endgame is to scale Ethereum up to 1,000x, according to Feist.

40,000 ETH Added as Ethereum ETF Sentiment Shifts

ByTomiwabold Olajide





If liquidity gets fragmented across layer-2s, Ethereum will likely end up losing to other competing ecosystems, the researcher warns. 

Feist is convinced that Ethereum will be able to scale without compromising its crucial properties (censorship resistance and verifiability). 

As reported by U.Today, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson recently predicted that Ethereum would not be able to survive 10 years from now, with ""parasitic"" layer-2 solutions being cited as one of the key reasons behind its possible demise. Hoskinson predicted that Ethereum would face the fate of Blackberry, the leading smartphone manufacturer that lost its crown to Apple in the late 2000s and went extinct. 

Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, says that Ethereum has ""realized that it is in a hole and has stopped digging"" in response to Feist's proposal. However, it remains to be seen whether it will manage to climb out of this hole, according to Hougan.

The wider cryptocurrency market may have slowed the relief rally that began after United States (US) President Donald Trump paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, but select altcoins such as Fartcoin, Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Curve DAO (CRV) do not show any signs of a waning bullish momentum. Over the last few weeks, Fartcoin has flipped the bullish trend, riding the wave of Solana-based meme coins' comeback to reach a four-month high of $1.25. 

The resurgence of bullish sentiment in the market reflects improving optimism as the US and China ease trade tensions, with expectations of a short-term tariff agreement paving the way for a broader deal.

Fartcoin's price hovers at $1.22 at the time of writing on Thursday, amid an extended rally from its April low of $0.35. The meme coin's ascent above the 12-hour 50, 100, and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) flipped the narrative bullish, igniting trader interest and confidence in the recovery.

Fartcoin's price remains above the key moving averages, indicating a potential long-term bullish trend, which has been recently reinforced by breaking through the critical $1.00 and $1.20 levels.

The SuperTrend indicator presented a buy signal on April 10, which continues to influence Fartcoin's bullish structure. This buy signal occurs when the indicator flips below the token's price, and the color on the chart changes from red to green.

FARTCOIN/USDT 12-hour chart

Traders should watch for confirmed support above the former resistance, now acting as support at $1.20, to gauge the strength of the uptrend. On the upside, supply zones at $1.50 and $1.80 are key to monitor as Fartcoin aims for its $2.00 target. However, profit-taking at these levels might hinder the uptrend or trigger a reversal.

Virtuals Protocol's price is up a staggering 292% from its April low of $1.00, currently exchanging hands at $1.63 at the time of writing. The bullish momentum behind the token remains unrelenting, following several milestones, including the market capitalization surpassing the $1 billion mark.

VIRTUAL's rally can be attributed to several factors including a strong technical structure characterized by the SuperTrend indicator's buy signal and the price action above the 50-, 100- and 200-day EMAs.

VIRTUAL/USDT daily chart 

Traders would anticipate higher support at $1.50 to hold in the event of a reversal. At the same time, VIRTUAL's bullish momentum could accelerate towards the $2.00 level, which was tested in December and January as both support and resistance.

The potential upcoming crossing of the 100-day EMA above the 200-day EMA would encourage traders to seek more exposure to VIRTUAL, thereby igniting a strong tailwind. 

Beyond the short-term support at $1.50, it would be prudent to prepare for varying eventualities, including losses that could test the confluence demand zone around $1.00, established by the 100- and 200-day EMAs.

Curve DAO's uptrend steadies at $0.72, supported by a golden cross pattern in the daily time frame. CRV cemented the bullish outlook in April after breaking out of a cup and handle pattern, as shown in the chart below. This elevated the token above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, driving interest among traders. 

On April 25, the 50-day EMA crossed above the 200-day EMA, forming a golden cross that confirmed bullish dominance and signaled a strong upward trajectory as the path of least resistance. 

CRV/USD daily chart

Curve DAO may encounter resistance at $0.75, where traders could decide to take profit, thus weakening the uptrend. Beyond this level, investors would monitor CRV's reaction to the supply zones at $0.80 and $1.00, which have previously been tested as support and resistance levels.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Solana (SOL) price is stabilizing at around $149 at the time of writing on Thursday, after finding support around its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) the previous day. On-chain data support a bullish thesis as SOL's stablecoin market capitalization has surged to $13 billion.

The wider cryptocurrency market may have slowed the relief rally that began after United States President Donald Trump paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, but select altcoins such as Fartcoin, Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Curve DAO (CRV) do not show any signs of a waning bullish momentum.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the likelihood of US regulators approving a Solana ETF (exchange-traded fund) is now a whopping 90%.

This is particularly noteworthy because the company's odds for a $SOL ETF were just 70% back in February, i.e., only a couple of months ago.

Combined with the CME listing Solana-based futures contracts in March, a $SOL ETF will likely rocket Solana to the moon.

Keep reading to find out all the reasons for being bullish on Solana right now. We'll also point you towards the best altcoins you can buy today to make the most of $SOL's bright future.

While six asset managers await the SEC's permission to list $SOL ETFs, the crypto's future open interest reached $5.75B (or $40.5M $SOL).

Moreover, this data is hot off the oven (recorded just a few days ago), so it's dead accurate and proof of strong institutional interest in the blockchain.

One of the biggest reasons behind the growing adoption of $SOL derivatives is that the crypto held the crucial $140 support level.

With rising DEX volumes and a staggering $9.5B in total value locked (TVL), $SOL can easily surge past $200 well before a potential spot ETF approval on October 10.

Technical analysis on $SOL's charts paints a pretty picture, too. The crypto has bounced perfectly from the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs simultaneously on the daily chart, which is a hugely positive signal.

The aforementioned bounce is also at a major support/resistance zone, further proving that the current bullish rally could hold itself nicely.



The only thing left to see is whether $SOL can break and hold itself above the 200 EMA. However, as per the 4-hour chart, it should easily be able to do that, seeing as it's above all the major EMAs on that time frame.

All in all, Solana is doing really well and could pump soon. If you want to ride its growth, here are three Solana-based coins that could give you the best results in an already-pumping market.

Our top pick, Solaxy, shows the best potential. It's still in presale, which has turned out to be a massive success thanks to over $30M in early investor funding.

Unlike other coins on Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) won't just use the blockchain's low-cost, high-speed architecture to further its interests. Its goal, in fact, is to improve Solana.

Solana has become too popular for its own good, ironically. A recent massive influx of new investors to the network has overloaded it. As a result, it has been struggling with congestion and scalability issues.

Solaxy will solve Solana's aforementioned issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on the network.

It will process some of Solana's transactions on a sidechain, reducing the burden on its mainnet and increasing transaction speed while lowering traffic congestion. In one word, Solaxy will optimize Solana's key areas.



The utility-based nature of $SOLX significantly contributes to its uniqueness and makes it one of the best cryptos to buy today.

As mentioned earlier, Solaxy is currently in presale, which is another reason why it's such a lucrative opportunity. Remember, prices are at their lowest during the presale stage, offering insane risk-to-reward possibilities (like a 29x increase by the end of 2026).

With over $32.6M in presale funding so far, one $SOLX is currently available for just $0.00171. Here's how to buy it.

ai16z ($AI16Z) really stands out because it's the first-ever venture capital firm run solely by AI agents. This crypto project is redefining the possibilities of artificial intelligence in the crypto investment space.

A decentralized trading fund, ai16z uses AI agents to collect and analyze investment-related data, including current community sentiment. This speeds up the entire process of deciding whether a certain company is worth investing in.

Aside from extra speed, AI will also reduce human error. What's more, these AI agents are also equipped to execute transactions both on-chain and off-chain, further improving flexibility and transaction speed.



As a leader in the AI-powered decentralized trading segment, $AI16Z has unsurprisingly been one of the most successful cryptos of late. It reached a record market cap of around $2.6B in January 2025.

Over the last month or so, the token is up a staggering 60%. It's also currently one of the top trending cryptos, having jumped 10% in just the last 24 hours. $AI16Z is currently trading at $0.3043.

Often referred to as ‘the dog coin of the people,' Bonk is the first and the largest dog-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain.

It's also the fifth-largest meme coin across the board, with a market capitalization of over $1.5B. Only $TRUMP, $PEPE, $SHIB, and $DOGE are above it.

Launched in December 2022, $BONK currently boasts over 17,000% in lifetime returns, which more than justifies its massive popularity among crypto degens.



After a nearly two-month-long steady decline, the token is climbing once again. It's up over 36% in the last week and 67% in the last month.

With one of the lowest per-token prices (just $0.00001968 at the time of writing) in the entire meme coin industry, $BONK is certainly one of the best cheap cryptos to buy to benefit from a potential $SOL rally.

Just the increased likelihood of a $SOL ETF has put the best altcoins on Solana in green.

Its actual launch, therefore, could be a canon event that sets forth a new future for $SOL and Solana-based cryptos.

That being said, we urge our readers to kindly do their own research and back their intuition with facts. None of the above is financial advice, after all.

Cryptocurrency is back in the spotlight — and Bitcoin and Ethereum are still dominating the headlines. But for sharp investors, the real excitement is happening under the radar. In 2025, altcoins are where the action is, offering fresh utility, bold innovation, and serious upside potential.

At TOKEN2049 Dubai, BlackRock's Robert Mitchnick touched on the ETF space, noting lukewarm appetite for altcoin ETFs. Still, the bigger shift is happening behind the scenes—institutional players are moving in, pushing beyond retail speculation toward smarter, long-term strategies.

That makes this the perfect time to explore what's next. Projects like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) are stepping up with real tech, staking rewards, and meme-powered momentum—mixing fun with function in a way that fits today's market.

In this guide, we'll break down the best altcoins to buy now—tokens that combine narrative strength, advanced features, and high-growth potential. Get ready to go beyond BTC and ETH—and spot the gems before the next rally takes off.

Bitcoin and Ethereum may be the pillars of crypto investing, but with their massive market caps, their ability to deliver exponential gains during bull runs is limited. Altcoins, on the other hand, are smaller and often more volatile, offering opportunities for investors willing to take calculated risks. 

Altcoins span multiple blockchain use cases, from AI-powered platforms to gaming ecosystems. By diversifying into altcoins, investors can explore emerging trends like DeFi, tokenization, and interoperability. This not only reduces portfolio risk but also captures value from groundbreaking innovations. 

For those looking to get started with a smaller budget, altcoins provide an attractive alternative. Many have lower price points, allowing investors to own entire tokens rather than fractional shares of Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

ETF momentum has grown, with a recent week highlighting $3.06 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows. BlackRock's IBIT ETF alone consumed a staggering $643 million in one day. Yet, institutional players like BlackRock have indicated minimal interest in altcoin ETFs for now.

This dynamic creates an interesting marketplace where retail and institutional investors may have differing priorities, opening opportunities for savvy altcoin investments. 

While choosing the best altcoins to buy now, it's important to focus on projects with real utility, solid technology, and market relevance. Here are the most promising ones to keep on your radar. 

Merging the best of artificial intelligence and meme culture, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is quickly gaining traction among retail investors and enthusiasts. Unlike typical meme coins, $DAGZ offers real utility through AI-powered tools like advanced trading bots and market analysis features. 



Early adopters gain exclusive staking rewards, while a comprehensive audit by SolidProof ensures strong security. With plans for further integrations and attractive tokenomics, Dawgz AI is a prime candidate for altcoin investors seeking both fun and functionality. 

Why $DAGZ Stands Out 



Pro Tip: Grab $DAGZ during the presale phase to maximize long-term gains. 

TokenFi, developed by the Floki team, focuses on making tokenization accessible. The platform enables users to create tokens and tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate or artwork without technical knowledge. Powered by its native TOKEN token, this project taps into the multi-trillion-dollar potential of the RWA market. 

Key Features 

Formerly known as Gnosis Safe, SAFE provides secure multi-signature smart accounts on Ethereum and other networks. It's tailored for organizations and teams needing higher levels of security for managing funds. Its governance token, SAFE, plays a pivotal role in decision-making and platform improvements. 

Why SAFE Matters 

GamerCoin (GHX) operates as the native token for the GamerHash platform, where gamers can earn rewards by sharing unused computing power. This earned $GHX can be spent in a gamer-focused marketplace, blending gaming activity with blockchain utility. 

Standout Features 

Investing in the right altcoins requires a balance of due diligence and timing. Start by understanding the fundamentals of each project, including its tokenomics, utility, and market appeal. Align your investments with emerging trends like AI, gaming, and tokenization for the best chances of long-term growth. 



Bitcoin and Ethereum might be the backbone of the crypto market, but altcoins are where the innovation happens. Whether it's Dawgz AI's unique blending of memes and AI or TokenFi's ideal positioning in tokenization, there are plenty of opportunities to explore. 

Among the options, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) not only encapsulates 2025's strongest crypto narratives but also provides genuine utility, making it a top altcoin to consider. Early movers always see the most significant gains, so don't wait too long. 

Coins with low market caps and innovative technology usually have the potential for exponential growth. Dawgz AI, with its AI integration and meme culture, is one of the most promising options right now. 

Altcoins like Dawgz AI, TokenFi, and GamerCoin show strong potential due to their innovative approaches, market relevance, and community support. 

If you're looking for both utility and growth, Dawgz AI is a strong contender. Its blend of AI-powered features and low-entry cost positions it as a standout investment. 

Consider Dawgz AI for its presale advantages, TokenFi for its way into the tokenization market, and SAFE for security-focused crypto needs. 

Altcoins integrating AI like Dawgz AI are poised for significant growth as AI becomes a driving force in tech and finance trends.

Crypto investment firm dao5 raised a $222 million fund to invest in blockchain projects targeting institutional and government adoption. The fund brings the firm's total assets under management to $550 million.

Founded in 2022 by Tekin Salimi, a former partner at Polychain Capital, dao5 made early bets on projects including Story Protocol, Bittensor, Berachain and EigenLayer. 

The firm's first fund, launched during the final days of the last bull market three years ago, was fully deployed and has already returned “the vast majority of commitments to its limited partners,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

“Crypto is entering its adolescence phase. The industry's dependency on pure speculation as the driver of growth is no longer as effective as it once was,” Salimi said.

Future success will be a product of “the real integration of blockchain technology into global financial, governmental, and private sector systems,” he said.

The new fund's focus is on-chain public infrastructure, novel stablecoin systems and “state-sovereign artificial intelligence.”

In tandem with the fundraise, the firm plans for its dao5 fund to convert into a decentralized autonomous organization later this year. To support its expansion, the firm added George Lambeth, who previously backed projects like Avalanche and Celestia, as General Partner.

In our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, we estimated that illicit cryptocurrency addresses received $40.9 billion in 2024. At first glance, this appears to mark a decline from the previous year's $46.1 billion. However, our 2024 figures reflect-lower bound estimates based on identified illicit addresses — when accounting for likely undiscovered activity, the true number is closer to $51.3 billion. In other words, crypto crime intensified.



As blockchain adoption accelerates and decentralized infrastructure expands, so does the attack surface. With every new protocol, smart contract, and wallet user added to the ecosystem, the need for robust blockchain security grows more urgent. Innovation has opened the doors to remarkable possibilities, but also to a new era of sophisticated threats.

From smart contract exploits and cross-chain bridge hacks, to phishing campaigns that drain users wallets, the risks facing blockchain technology are evolving in real time. However, with the right tools, many attacks can be stopped before they strike. In this blog, we'll explore the most pressing blockchain security challenges and the steps participants can take now to build more resilient infrastructure.

Keep reading to learn more about the following topics:

Blockchain security refers to the combination of cybersecurity principles, tools, and best practices aimed at mitigating risk, avoiding malicious attacks, and preventing unauthorized access while operating on blockchain networks.

While all blockchains run on distributed ledger technology (DLT), not all blockchains are functionally the same or equally secure. Both public and private blockchains have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, and their security models are fundamentally different due to the open versus closed nature of their networks.

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open, permissionless networks where anyone can join and participate in validating transactions. The codebase of public blockchains is open source — publicly available and continually vetted by developers who review the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. By leveraging the expertise of open-source communities, the security, features, and efficiency of these blockchains are continuously examined and improved. At the same time, hackers and malicious entities also examine code to search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

In contrast, private blockchains are exclusive, permissioned networks with limited access, making them more centralized. Securing a private blockchain is the sole responsibility of the operating entity. The centralized nature of these blockchains means that there is a single point of failure, making it crucial for the institution to implement strong security measures.

Although private blockchains may not benefit as much from the decentralized and security-by-numbers approach of public blockchains, they are generally faster and more efficient due to less computational work required for consensus algorithms. However, because the entity granting permission also has authority over the network, there is a theoretical risk of the network being shut down or manipulated.

Blockchain technology runs on a distributed digital ledger system. A blockchain network is made up of a worldwide network of computers, known as nodes, validating and recording transactions. Every participant maintains a copy of the ledger, so there is no centralized authority or point of failure. Each time a transaction occurs — such as sending or receiving cryptocurrency — it is recorded on a block.

Before a block (made up of a group of transactions that occurred during a given time frame) is added to the chain, it must first be verified by consensus. That's where consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, come into play. In a Proof-of-Work system, miners compete to solve computationally intensive algorithms to validate transactions. In a Proof-of-Stake system, network participants lock up a certain quantity of tokens to run a node to validate transactions. Miners and stakers are incentivized with rewards to secure the network. This process ensures everyone agrees (or reaches consensus) on the validity of each transaction. Once a block is full, it is sealed and linked to the previous block using a cryptographic code, forming a chain. By linking each block using cryptography and distributing the ledger across numerous computers, any attempt to tamper with a block would disrupt the entire chain.

Unlike traditional finance — which operates on permissions to pull funds — a crypto transaction is a push transaction, initiated peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediary. Participants in blockchain networks control their digital assets on the blockchain with a private key — a cryptographically secured method of authentication and access.

Crypto requires you to be deliberate. Because no intermediary is required, personal responsibility becomes much more important when transferring value on-chain. Once transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, they are irreversible. This makes it notoriously difficult to recover funds that are lost or stolen.

The notion that blockchain technology is inherently immune to security threats is somewhat misleading, but several of its unique structural features bolster its intrinsic security:

While these defining characteristics are the reason blockchain technology is considered so revolutionary, there are still vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Paradoxically, some of the traits of blockchain (e.g. immutability) can introduce unique complexities if the system itself is compromised. Next, we'll look at challenges in securing blockchains and some of the most common threats currently shaping the landscape.

A major challenge in securing blockchain systems is that the pace of innovation continues to outstrip the development of security tools. New protocols, features, and use cases emerge faster than they can be thoroughly vetted, leaving gaps that attackers are quick to exploit.

The permissionless nature of blockchain adds another layer of complexity. Anyone can deploy a contract, launch a token, or interact with protocols, creating low barriers for malicious actors to operate at scale. Scams can proliferate with little friction, often faster than detection systems can respond.

Cross-chain activity only compounds the problem. As users move assets across multiple blockchains, visibility into transactions can become fragmented. Monitoring and securing these flows requires coordination across protocols — something the current infrastructure isn't fully equipped to handle.

Finally, one of the most persistent challenges is real-time detection. On-chain behavior can look similar, whether it's part of a legitimate arbitrage strategy or a coordinated exploit. This ambiguity makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between malicious and benign actions before damage is done.

The following threats target applications operating on-chain — such as DeFi protocols, bridges, and phishing tokens — rather than the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself.

Smart contracts are self-executing code that power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But once deployed, a single bug can expose millions in locked assets. Attackers often exploit logical flaws, reentrancy vulnerabilities, or unchecked access controls to drain funds or manipulate protocol behavior. Without code audits, even well-intentioned projects can become exposed.

Between January and November 2024, approximately 8.5% of funds stolen were due to smart contract vulnerabilities and code exploits.

Oracles feed real-world data into smart contracts. If attackers influence or corrupt these inputs, they can trigger faulty contract logic. For instance, manipulating the reported price of an asset could allow an attacker to buy it at a discount or trigger a liquidation cascade. In DeFi, where value is algorithmically tied to oracle data, the consequences can be immediate and catastrophic.

Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains, but they've also become prime targets for attackers. Many bridge architectures rely on complex smart contracts and custodial mechanisms, creating large honeypots of funds. A single vulnerability can be exploited to mint or release wrapped tokens without backing, leading to massive losses.

Not all threats in blockchain are technical. Some of the most damaging attacks are social in nature. Rug pulls occur when developers abruptly withdraw liquidity or abandon a project after attracting user investment, leaving holders with worthless tokens. These schemes often masquerade as legitimate startups, leveraging hype, influencer marketing, and anonymous teams to build trust before vanishing with user funds.

We identified that 3.59% of all launched tokens in 2024 displayed patterns that may have been linked to rug pull schemes. Moreover, approximately 94% of DEX pools involved in suspected pump-and-dump schemes appear to be rugged by the address that created the DEX pool. The other 6% appear to be rugged by the addresses that were funded by the pool or token deployer.

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors in crypto. As we recently revealed in our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, nearly $10 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraud and scams, although we estimate this number is likely closer to $12.4 billion, which would be a slight increase from amounts stolen in 2023.

Whether through fake wallet apps, malicious airdrops, or impersonated support accounts, attackers trick users into revealing private keys or signing malicious transactions. These scams are growing more targeted and convincing, often exploiting community trust and platform UX loopholes.

Preventing cyberattacks before they happen starts with visibility. On-chain data provides an invaluable window into blockchain activity, helping security teams identify red flags early — whether that's unusual transaction patterns, interactions with known malicious contracts, or sudden liquidity movements. Real-time monitoring and transaction analysis are essential for catching threats in motion.

Key components of blockchain analytics include:

Chainalysis plays a critical role in blockchain analytics by connecting activity across chains and platforms, enabling faster detection, deeper investigations, and more coordinated responses.

A pizza party in a Midtown eatery covered in art is expected to mark the launch of a Nouns DAO chapter in Kansas City — a group endeavoring to fund local creativity, support the public good and expand access to decentralized cultural funding. 

But there's more at stake than just getting a piece of the blockchain pie.

Artègo Pizza, 900 W. 39th St., Kansas City; photo by Tommy Felts, Startland News

“I want people to understand how they can empower themselves and their communities through participating in these DAOs,” said Mary McCawley, a digital art curator at and founder of Digital Dreams KC and key organizer for Nouns KC DAO. 

“A lot of people are expressing that they are seeing and feeling a lack of funding that's been cut because of the recent (presidential) administration's policy decisions, and I feel that the answer is to take the power back on the grassroots level, to recognize that we don't have to wait for Big Brother to put his hand out and make certain things possible.”

The launch event — 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. May 22 at Artègo Pizza, 900 W. 39th St. — coincides with Global Pizza Day in collaboration with Pizza DAO (a decentralized global initiative taking place in more than 300 cities worldwide).

Nouns KC DAO's site is under construction but should go live at citynouns.wtf.



Why May 22?

Pizza DAO is an annual global pizza party that's been sharing pies since 2021. It is a “community of 5,000+ artists, engineers, community managers, marketers, and pizzeria owners” collaborating to “spread the joy of pizza, the most popular food in the known universe.”

It organizes party sites on May 22 each year to mark the day Bitcoin — or any digital asset — was first used to buy a tangible item.

On that day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz deemed that pizza would be the world's first real-world item purchased. He bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC (or roughly $782 million in today-dollars).

Here's how it works

Kansas City's Nouns DAO chapter is expected to tap into the larger group's positioning as a legend in the DAO space, McCawley said.

Nouns DAO operates by creating a work of art — an NFT, or nonfungible token — each day that is then auctioned to raise funds for the DAO. Those funds are used for just about anything: film and TV projects, nationwide cleanup actions, extreme sport athlete sponsorships, web3 infrastructure, etc.

The DAO has purportedly controlled upward of $44 million, though presently its holdings appear to be about 3,368 ETH, or just over $6.3 million USD.

Watch the video below for more on how Nouns DAO works.

﻿

Empowering digital democratic norms

If you're a little lost here, let's pause.

The term DAO is an acronym for “decentralized autonomous organization.” 

These organizations are cropping up across the globe and are championed by blockchain enthusiasts — blockchain being the nearly immutable ledgering tech behind cryptocurrency.

Another group, KC Futures DAO, launched last year and is in a fundraising cycle. They're partnered with KC nonprofit KC Digital Drive, which has a mission of making Kansas City a digital leader and to improve the quality of life for all people in the region.

(For crypto enthusiasts looking to network in the region, KC Digital Drive regularly plays host to “CryptoMonday” events in Kansas City.)

Blockchain's primary strength is that it is a decentralized record of transactions or actions that each must be fully verified by multiple authorities — usually automated systems — before any subsequent transactions or actions can occur. This means every transaction is verified and settled and cannot be changed without subsequently invalidating all that come after.

“It's a way that everyone can have a voice by voting as to how the funds are allocated and used. And it's a way that people can empower themselves when they feel unempowered.”

— Mary McCawley,
Nouns KC DAO

If a party tampers with a past transaction, then every subsequent transaction becomes erroneous. This means tampering with or falsifying one record creates a subsequent chain of error pointing a curious party back to the tampering and the entity that performed that tampering. 

And blockchain's ledgers can be private, public or permissions-based, with a DAO's likely being set to the latter so that only members can view all DAO actions or transactions. 

Typically the greater a member's investment in the DAO, the more votes they have as to the DAO's actions. This creates, at least upon inception and in effect, a bottom-up style of decision making. 

In a world where data manipulation — and information manipulation generally — is of growing concern, McCawley said, she sees DAOs and their blockchain tech as a way to code democratic norms into organizational decisions, financial decisions and more.

“It's a way that the funds can't be mismanaged,” she explained. “It's a way that everyone can have a voice by voting as to how the funds are allocated and used. And it's a way that people can empower themselves when they feel unempowered.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Data watchdog will leave British Library alone","https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/ico_brit_library/","Thu, 01 May 2025 10:15:00 GMT","

The UK's data protection overlord is not going to pursue any further investigation into the British Library's 2023 ransomware attack.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it doesn't think its resources would be best spent on UK's national library, even though it was such a disaster due to MFA not being applied on an admin account.

""Having carefully considered this particular case, the Information Commissioner decided that, due to our current priorities, further investigation would not be the most effective use of our resources,"" a statement read.

""We have provided guidance to the British Library, which has reassured us about its commitment to continue to review and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect people's data.""

In the short post on the matter, the ICO – like many others in the cybersecurity community have done since the digital break in – lauded the British Library for its stellar approach to responsibly disclosing the ransomware attack.

From the start, the library issued regular, comprehensive updates about its recovery status, and in March 2024 it published a full review of the attack, outlining in depth the institution's IT weaknesses and the lessons it learned.

The ICO commended the British Library for its crisis comms, which major organizations are still struggling to emulate years later.

""Following the incident, the British Library published a cyber incident review in March 2024, which provided an overview of the cyber-attack and key lessons learnt to help other organisations that may experience similar incidents.  

""We commend the British Library for being open and transparent about its system vulnerabilities that contributed to the incident, the impact it has had, and the improvements made so far to protect people's personal information. ""

The ICO's decision to leave the library in peace is taken at a time when internal resource constraints have contributed to performances that break the wrong records.

Earlier this month, the regulator revealed that it missed its complaint response targets by the biggest margin since it started tracking them, and due to current staffing levels, its performance is expected to decline further. 

Illustrating the size of the backlog, it said the goal is to respond to all complaints within 90 days, however, only 12.3 percent of complaints from the latest quarter were thoroughly assessed.

For context, the ICO has a lot on its plate. For a small-ish team operating out of a modest office in Wilmslow, a small English town in Cheshire East, it received more than 10,000 complaints during the most recent quarter, an increase of 746 compared to the three months prior.

The ICO confirmed it was hiring for various roles and ""significant digital and process changes"" were on the way, with the aim of easing the burden. ®

The success of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is far from guaranteed, according to a new paper from the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), which found that while these assets are crucial enablers of the development of tokenised ecosystems, they face many challenges.

High costs and low performance are some of the issues that the WFE, the industry association for exchanges and clearing houses, sees as hurdles. The paper notes that while 94% of central banks are currently working on CBDC projects, “the operational realities, efficiency needs and stability requirements of public markets” require careful analysis before adopting these digital tokens.

“This paper finds that CBDCs are a crucial enabler of a tokenised financial ecosystem. Nevertheless, their adoption and success depend on coordinated industry efforts and a balanced evaluation of benefits versus costs,” the WFE says.

On the plus side, CBDCs could offer efficiency gains in settlement, enhance the resilience of the payments sector by offering alternative rails, carve out a role as collateral and reduce counterparty risk. They could also improve audit trails and make cross-border payments more efficient than the current set-up involving traditional banking rails. CBDCs are also building blocks of tokenised ecosystems. 

Transaction speeds are slower than what low-latency trading and markets demand, however, and costs could outweigh benefits during periods of low activity. For efficient cross-border use, updates to the regulatory and legal frameworks around the world would be necessary, the paper says, adding this could only work with significant cooperation from authorities. Integrating these digital tokens with existing systems and ensuring they operate across infrastructures are also difficult challenges, the WFE says.

“CBDCs are necessary to enable digital ledger technology adoption in traditional financial markets. However, achieving widespread public market transformation may be limited due to high costs, technological demands, and extensive regulatory adaptation required. Its success is not guaranteed simply by its existence,” the paper states.

Crypto


              The Digital Rupee is more of a statement of intent than an innovation in technology. It is a sign that India will soon be entering an era when digital finance will be reliable, inclusive, and transparent. 
            

In a world quickly moving digital with blockchain and cryptocurrencies no longer something on paper but everyday currency, India has taken a big step in this direction with Digital Rupee or Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) vision. Cash being in short supply and digital payments the new norm, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set the stage for the currency to become fully digital in the future—every bit as secure and sovereign as the rupee in our wallet.

But what exactly is this Digital Rupee? Why is India opting to step into the age of CBDCs? And what does it mean for the average man on the street? Let us plunge into this paradigm shift and how it aligns with India's digital vision.

The Digital Rupee is India's digital currency, created and managed by the Reserve Bank of India. In contrast to decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum with no governing authority, the Digital Rupee is a centralized and government-backed digital currency. It is therefore a currency of the same value and denomination as physical rupee.

It is, in one sense, a secure and easy replacement for cash, particularly in an age that tilts increasingly toward electronic payments. It is, of course, virtual money, but money still, and digital wallets or cell phone applications can access it and draw upon it to make consumer and commercial purchases.

India's journey to digital cash is more than just keeping pace with the times abroad. It's an extrapolation of a vision for economic strength, inclusion, transparency, and security on an even greater platform. A few of the best arguments for launching the Digital Rupee are:

Reducing currency management cost: Printing, transporting, and storing currency in physical form is expensive. One stored digitally obliterates these cost-of-doing-business costs by an enormous margin.

Creating digital infrastructure: With UPI and other digital payment infrastructures already transforming Indians' payment habits, a government digital currency is the next addition to this digital infrastructure.

Combating illicit operations: As virtual currencies can be traced, unlike cash money, monitoring and avoiding money laundering, tax evasion, and currency counterfeiting is easier.

Simplifying cross-border payments: CBDCs could help enable cross-border payments by cutting back on intermediary dependence and minimizing cost and time of payment.

Digital Rupee is based on a tamper-evident and secure digital ledger, where all transactions are made in real time. This ledger may be blockchain or allied technologies such that each digital rupee is traced and cannot be duplicated or altered.

The Digital Rupee will be made available on mobile wallets offered by banks or certified service providers. Mobile wallets will facilitate ordinary transactions like buying something, paying a bill, or transferring money to some other person in the same way as usual apps—but with the extra confidence of knowing that the money is RBI-insured.

Retail CBDC: Designed for consumption by the general public in a regular form.

Wholesale CBDC: Designed for consumption by banks as payment and settlement among banks.

Both are intended to bring about speed, efficiency, and safety of transactions within their domains.

The introduction of the Digital Rupee is a milestone in India's financial history. For the man on the street, it means greater convenience, quicker payments, and access to a money stock that cannot be shredded or destroyed or lost.

From a macroeconomic standpoint, it strengthens the RBI's ability to monitor and manage the money supply in real time. This can improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, especially during economic downturns or financial crises.

Additionally, for millions of Indians who remain outside the formal banking system, the Digital Rupee could become a gateway to easier access to financial services—helping bridge the gap in financial inclusion.

While the possibility of a complete digital currency is exciting, it also has issues. Cyber security, privacy of information, and public trust are important concerns to be resolved so that the technology becomes viral. India's introduction of its CBDC is gradual, pilot and trial launches in geographies and sectors selected to test user experience and system dynamics.

Public awareness and education are needed. There is a need to educate people that the Digital Rupee is neither a commodity asset nor cryptocurrency but digital Indian rupees with the purpose to make life easy, fast, and secure.

The Digital Rupee is more of a statement of intent than an innovation in technology. It is a sign that India will soon be entering an era when digital finance will be reliable, inclusive, and transparent. As the country goes about the implementation of its CBDC, it will be necessary to balance the need for regulation and innovation so that benefits of a digital currency trickle down all layers of society.

Ultimately, the Digital Rupee is not so much about cash replacement as it is about reinventing it for the digital world.

A deal for a state-backed Emirati firm to use a Trump-affiliated digital coin was announced in a panel that included the president's son and his business partner, who promised, “This is only the beginning.”

By David Yaffe-Bellany

Reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates

Sitting in front of a packed auditorium in Dubai, a founder of the Trump family cryptocurrency business made a brief but monumental announcement on Thursday. A fund backed by Abu Dhabi, he said, would be making a $2 billion business deal using the Trump firm's digital coins.

That transaction would be a major contribution by a foreign government to President Trump's private venture — one that stands to generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the Trump family. And it is a public and vivid illustration of the ethical conflicts swirling around Mr. Trump's crypto firm, which has blurred the boundary between business and government.

Zach Witkoff, a founder of the Trump family crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, revealed that a so-called stablecoin developed by the firm, would be used to complete the transaction between the state-backed Emirati investment firm MGX and Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Virtually every detail of Mr. Witkoff's announcement, made during a conference panel with Mr. Trump's second-eldest son, contained a conflict of interest.

MGX's use of the World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, brings a Trump family company into business with a venture firm backed by a foreign government. The deal creates a formal link between World Liberty and Binance — a company that has been under U.S. government oversight since 2023, when it admitted to violating federal money-laundering laws.

And the splashy announcement served as an advertisement to crypto investors worldwide about the potential for forming a partnership with a company tied to President Trump, who is listed as World Liberty's chief crypto advocate.

HOUSTON, May  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (NYSE American: KULR) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a global leader in advanced energy management solutions, today announced the launch of a blockchain-secured supply chain initiative to safeguard product-related data being offered to their customers. Moving supply chain verification and custody tracking from proprietary software onto a distributed ledger will increase transparency and security.

Decentralizing the inventory tracking system on a blockchain offers enhanced transparency, security, and real-time visibility across the entire supply chain. By recording each inventory item as a tamper-proof, timestamped entry on a distributed ledger, KULR eliminates the risk of data manipulation and ensures that all stakeholders have access to a single source of truth. This reduces reliance on centralized systems that are vulnerable to outages or unauthorized access. Additionally, blockchain's traceability features enable KULR to verify product authenticity, monitor asset movement, and streamline audits.

One of the initial products that will be recorded on the blockchain will include lithium-ion batteries screened to meet NASA's WI 37A rigorous methodology. Utilizing the blockchain to create a secure and immutable record of the testing data will benefit all future users of these batteries, who will have access to proven testing results.

""After launching our bitcoin treasury strategy last December, we became curious about what other aspects of the crypto ecosystem could benefit our business operations. Moving our supply chain tracking onto the blockchain seemed like a natural move for us,” KULR CEO Michael Mo commented on today's news. “We are leveraging proven blockchain technologies to deliver commercial applications that provide our customers with a trustworthy data source and improved operational efficiency. I firmly believe many aerospace products and commercial products could benefit from an immutable and verifiable chain of custody.”

Each battery that KULR manufactures will have its metadata minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain. When a battery is purchased, the NFT can be transferred to the buyer's on-chain wallet or moved to a “burn” wallet maintained by KULR to indicate ownership has been transferred. For large quantity customers, KULR will establish wallets to easily transfer NFTs associated with their orders. KULR designed an internal UI tool that synchronizes with encrypted KULR-owned wallets to view the current inventory.

The Company has built a customized rollup to Coinbase's Base L2 chain, which is ultimately built on Ethereum.

On December 4, 2024, KULR announced board approval to commit up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves to be held in bitcoin. To date, KULR has acquired 668 BTC. As a result of KULR's Bitcoin Treasury, CEO Michael Mo will be speaking at Strategy World next week in Orlando, Florida. Mr. Mo will be presenting a case study on KULR's experience establishing and maintaining a bitcoin treasury.

In our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, we estimated that illicit cryptocurrency addresses received $40.9 billion in 2024. At first glance, this appears to mark a decline from the previous year's $46.1 billion. However, our 2024 figures reflect-lower bound estimates based on identified illicit addresses — when accounting for likely undiscovered activity, the true number is closer to $51.3 billion. In other words, crypto crime intensified.



As blockchain adoption accelerates and decentralized infrastructure expands, so does the attack surface. With every new protocol, smart contract, and wallet user added to the ecosystem, the need for robust blockchain security grows more urgent. Innovation has opened the doors to remarkable possibilities, but also to a new era of sophisticated threats.

From smart contract exploits and cross-chain bridge hacks, to phishing campaigns that drain users wallets, the risks facing blockchain technology are evolving in real time. However, with the right tools, many attacks can be stopped before they strike. In this blog, we'll explore the most pressing blockchain security challenges and the steps participants can take now to build more resilient infrastructure.

Keep reading to learn more about the following topics:

Blockchain security refers to the combination of cybersecurity principles, tools, and best practices aimed at mitigating risk, avoiding malicious attacks, and preventing unauthorized access while operating on blockchain networks.

While all blockchains run on distributed ledger technology (DLT), not all blockchains are functionally the same or equally secure. Both public and private blockchains have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, and their security models are fundamentally different due to the open versus closed nature of their networks.

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open, permissionless networks where anyone can join and participate in validating transactions. The codebase of public blockchains is open source — publicly available and continually vetted by developers who review the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. By leveraging the expertise of open-source communities, the security, features, and efficiency of these blockchains are continuously examined and improved. At the same time, hackers and malicious entities also examine code to search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

In contrast, private blockchains are exclusive, permissioned networks with limited access, making them more centralized. Securing a private blockchain is the sole responsibility of the operating entity. The centralized nature of these blockchains means that there is a single point of failure, making it crucial for the institution to implement strong security measures.

Although private blockchains may not benefit as much from the decentralized and security-by-numbers approach of public blockchains, they are generally faster and more efficient due to less computational work required for consensus algorithms. However, because the entity granting permission also has authority over the network, there is a theoretical risk of the network being shut down or manipulated.

Blockchain technology runs on a distributed digital ledger system. A blockchain network is made up of a worldwide network of computers, known as nodes, validating and recording transactions. Every participant maintains a copy of the ledger, so there is no centralized authority or point of failure. Each time a transaction occurs — such as sending or receiving cryptocurrency — it is recorded on a block.

Before a block (made up of a group of transactions that occurred during a given time frame) is added to the chain, it must first be verified by consensus. That's where consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, come into play. In a Proof-of-Work system, miners compete to solve computationally intensive algorithms to validate transactions. In a Proof-of-Stake system, network participants lock up a certain quantity of tokens to run a node to validate transactions. Miners and stakers are incentivized with rewards to secure the network. This process ensures everyone agrees (or reaches consensus) on the validity of each transaction. Once a block is full, it is sealed and linked to the previous block using a cryptographic code, forming a chain. By linking each block using cryptography and distributing the ledger across numerous computers, any attempt to tamper with a block would disrupt the entire chain.

Unlike traditional finance — which operates on permissions to pull funds — a crypto transaction is a push transaction, initiated peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediary. Participants in blockchain networks control their digital assets on the blockchain with a private key — a cryptographically secured method of authentication and access.

Crypto requires you to be deliberate. Because no intermediary is required, personal responsibility becomes much more important when transferring value on-chain. Once transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, they are irreversible. This makes it notoriously difficult to recover funds that are lost or stolen.

The notion that blockchain technology is inherently immune to security threats is somewhat misleading, but several of its unique structural features bolster its intrinsic security:

While these defining characteristics are the reason blockchain technology is considered so revolutionary, there are still vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Paradoxically, some of the traits of blockchain (e.g. immutability) can introduce unique complexities if the system itself is compromised. Next, we'll look at challenges in securing blockchains and some of the most common threats currently shaping the landscape.

A major challenge in securing blockchain systems is that the pace of innovation continues to outstrip the development of security tools. New protocols, features, and use cases emerge faster than they can be thoroughly vetted, leaving gaps that attackers are quick to exploit.

The permissionless nature of blockchain adds another layer of complexity. Anyone can deploy a contract, launch a token, or interact with protocols, creating low barriers for malicious actors to operate at scale. Scams can proliferate with little friction, often faster than detection systems can respond.

Cross-chain activity only compounds the problem. As users move assets across multiple blockchains, visibility into transactions can become fragmented. Monitoring and securing these flows requires coordination across protocols — something the current infrastructure isn't fully equipped to handle.

Finally, one of the most persistent challenges is real-time detection. On-chain behavior can look similar, whether it's part of a legitimate arbitrage strategy or a coordinated exploit. This ambiguity makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between malicious and benign actions before damage is done.

The following threats target applications operating on-chain — such as DeFi protocols, bridges, and phishing tokens — rather than the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself.

Smart contracts are self-executing code that power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But once deployed, a single bug can expose millions in locked assets. Attackers often exploit logical flaws, reentrancy vulnerabilities, or unchecked access controls to drain funds or manipulate protocol behavior. Without code audits, even well-intentioned projects can become exposed.

Between January and November 2024, approximately 8.5% of funds stolen were due to smart contract vulnerabilities and code exploits.

Oracles feed real-world data into smart contracts. If attackers influence or corrupt these inputs, they can trigger faulty contract logic. For instance, manipulating the reported price of an asset could allow an attacker to buy it at a discount or trigger a liquidation cascade. In DeFi, where value is algorithmically tied to oracle data, the consequences can be immediate and catastrophic.

Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains, but they've also become prime targets for attackers. Many bridge architectures rely on complex smart contracts and custodial mechanisms, creating large honeypots of funds. A single vulnerability can be exploited to mint or release wrapped tokens without backing, leading to massive losses.

Not all threats in blockchain are technical. Some of the most damaging attacks are social in nature. Rug pulls occur when developers abruptly withdraw liquidity or abandon a project after attracting user investment, leaving holders with worthless tokens. These schemes often masquerade as legitimate startups, leveraging hype, influencer marketing, and anonymous teams to build trust before vanishing with user funds.

We identified that 3.59% of all launched tokens in 2024 displayed patterns that may have been linked to rug pull schemes. Moreover, approximately 94% of DEX pools involved in suspected pump-and-dump schemes appear to be rugged by the address that created the DEX pool. The other 6% appear to be rugged by the addresses that were funded by the pool or token deployer.

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors in crypto. As we recently revealed in our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, nearly $10 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraud and scams, although we estimate this number is likely closer to $12.4 billion, which would be a slight increase from amounts stolen in 2023.

Whether through fake wallet apps, malicious airdrops, or impersonated support accounts, attackers trick users into revealing private keys or signing malicious transactions. These scams are growing more targeted and convincing, often exploiting community trust and platform UX loopholes.

Preventing cyberattacks before they happen starts with visibility. On-chain data provides an invaluable window into blockchain activity, helping security teams identify red flags early — whether that's unusual transaction patterns, interactions with known malicious contracts, or sudden liquidity movements. Real-time monitoring and transaction analysis are essential for catching threats in motion.

Key components of blockchain analytics include:

Chainalysis plays a critical role in blockchain analytics by connecting activity across chains and platforms, enabling faster detection, deeper investigations, and more coordinated responses.

Sam Altman's controversial blockchain project, World, is launching in the U.S. – and said it intends to roll out 7,500 eye-scanning “orbs” in cities across the country by the end of the year.



World's orbs — chrome, bowling ball-shaped devices that scan a person's eyeballs to confirm their identity — will initially be available to Americans in six “key innovation hubs,” the company said: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Those who decide to take the plunge and gaze into the orb will gain access to the World app and receive an airdrop of World's WLD token. By the end of the year, the project aims to have enough orbs spread throughout the U.S. to give 180 million Americans, more than half the population, access to World's network.



Altman and other executives at World's parent company Tools for Humanity announced the U.S. expansion at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, along with a dizzying slew of new features and partnerships for the project.



The World app will now offer its users access to crypto-backed loans through non-custodial lending protocol Morpho and prediction markets through Kalshi. Later this year, WLD holders will be able to spend their tokens like cash with a new World-linked Visa debit card. The project is even integrating its identity-verification technology into some online dating apps. Starting with Tinder users in Japan, online dating giant Match Group will pilot using World ID to verify the ages of its users.



Altman said that the idea for World predated OpenAI, his generative artificial intelligence (AI) company.



“We needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of [artificial general intelligence],” Altman said during the press conference. “We needed a way that we could know what content was made by humans, [and what was made] by AI. We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.”



Altman's initial ideas about how to solve the problem of human verification were “very crazy,” he said – World and its eye-scanning orbs, only a little.



World is the latest crypto project to announce a U.S. expansion. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the regulatory environment has become much friendlier to crypto projects.



The company announced it would be building a factory in Richardson, Texas – a suburb of Dallas – to help produce the orbs needed for its coming U.S. expansion. After the initial rollout, other major cities including Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas will receive the second wave of orbs.



“They will really be everywhere,” said Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity's co-founder. “They will be in gas stations, convenience stores, and you will be able to verify within 10 minutes wherever you are.”

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, said that World Liberty Financial's dollar denominated stablecoin (USD1) has been officially selected as the official stablecoin to close MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance.

Speaking at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Trump also announced that USD1 will be integrating with the Tron ecosystem, which is backed by billionaire Justin Sun.

Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX put $2 billion to buy a stake in Binance, marking one of the first institutional investment in the world's largest exchange.

The Trump-family backed World Liberty Financial, announced its plans for launching a dollar-backed stablecoin with BitGo in March. 

“USD1 will become one of the most transparent and regulated stablecoin in the world. It is backed by short term treasury and cash equivalent, not only do we want to create a product in our stable point USD, one that can be sent across borders in a very seamless way, but transparency and frankly, consumer safety is paramount, right?” Trump added.World Liberty's co-founder, Zach Witkoff, speaking at the same event teased more future partnerships for the DeFi protocol. 

“We have a lot on the way at World liberty, so stay tuned. We're working on, you know, a lot of different DeFi integrations. Right now, we do aim to establish USD1 as the preferred stablecoin in the DeFi and CeFi ecosystem. Working really hard on, you know, getting integrations into traditional retail point of sale systems,” Witkoff said.

UPDATE (May 1, 2025, 09:50 UTC): Adds additional comment from Zach Witkoff on World Liberty.

The crypto market remains in prolonged consolidation with the overall market cap approaching $3 trillion as analysts eye a possible bitcoin (BTC) breakout that could push the market higher.

Bitcoin hovered near $95,00 on Thursday, while ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB and Solana's SOL remained stagnant. XRP and Cardano's ADA dropped 2%, while dogecoin (DOGE) fell 3%.

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) lost $56 million on Wednesday, breaking an eight-day streak that saw nearly $3 billion flow into these U.S.-listed products.

Markets have been generally range-bound in the past week, setting the course for what could be an explosive move higher, some say.

“Such long consolidations usually accumulate strength for further movement. The next major trigger is likely to be Friday's labour market data,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. 

“For the past five days, the market has fluctuated in a very narrow range, with some tendency towards shallower declines. Still, it has been unable to exceed its 200-day moving average, which is now passing through $3.01 trillion. A global positive is needed for a breakout, but it would open the way to the $3.5 trillion area,” Kuptsikevich added, indicating strong movements in altcoins.

Pat Zhang, head of research at WOO X, mirrored the sentiment. “BTC continues to experience volatility, forming a consolidation range between $93,000 and $95,000 since April 25, building momentum for a potential breakout,” he said in a Telegram message.

“The average funding rate for BTC has been negative over the past week, which is rare, indicating intense whale activity both on and off exchanges,” Zhang added.

Over the past two years, the financing rate for bitcoin contracts has been negative only four times, specifically during Sept. 19- Sept. 22, 2023, Oct. 20-Oct. 27, 2023, Aug. 16- Aug. 24, 2024, and Sept. 10- Sept. 17, 2024.

“Following these periods of negative financing rates, BTC experienced strong upward trends, suggesting that whale accumulation could be positioning BTC for a potential upward move,” Zhang noted.

Macroeconomic sentiment remains dented as traders globally eye the next steps made by President Donald Trump in the ongoing tariff tussles.

Per Bloomberg, Trump acknowledged Wednesday that his tariff program had a perception problem and posed a significant political risk, but he remained determined to push on. He said “potential deals” with South Korea, India, and Japan were already in place and that a deal with China was progressing in his favor.

Swiss asset manager 21Shares has filed a S-1 registration form for a SUI exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

SUI is currently trading at $3.68, rising by 10.9% over the past 24 hours and 5% after the filing went live on the SEC's website.

“Since our earliest research into Sui, we believed it could become one of the most exciting blockchains in the industry, and we're seeing that thesis play out,” said Duncan Moir, President of 21Shares, speaking at Sui's annual Basecamp conference.

SUI is a layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta engineers. The network's native token has a market cap of $11.8 billion, leaving it just outside the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies.

21Shares' filing comes six weeks after Canary Capital filed paperwork to launch a SUI ETF.

The Sui Foundation also announced on Thursday that it signed a deal with Fireblocks to enhance institutional-grade infrastructure across the network.

The integration will allow institutions to engage with Sui using native SUI custody and access to DeFi protocols on the network.

Sam Altman's controversial blockchain project, World, is launching in the U.S. – and said it intends to roll out 7,500 eye-scanning “orbs” in cities across the country by the end of the year.



World's orbs — chrome, bowling ball-shaped devices that scan a person's eyeballs to confirm their identity — will initially be available to Americans in six “key innovation hubs,” the company said: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Those who decide to take the plunge and gaze into the orb will gain access to the World app and receive an airdrop of World's WLD token. By the end of the year, the project aims to have enough orbs spread throughout the U.S. to give 180 million Americans, more than half the population, access to World's network.



Altman and other executives at World's parent company Tools for Humanity announced the U.S. expansion at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, along with a dizzying slew of new features and partnerships for the project.



The World app will now offer its users access to crypto-backed loans through non-custodial lending protocol Morpho and prediction markets through Kalshi. Later this year, WLD holders will be able to spend their tokens like cash with a new World-linked Visa debit card. The project is even integrating its identity-verification technology into some online dating apps. Starting with Tinder users in Japan, online dating giant Match Group will pilot using World ID to verify the ages of its users.



Altman said that the idea for World predated OpenAI, his generative artificial intelligence (AI) company.



“We needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of [artificial general intelligence],” Altman said during the press conference. “We needed a way that we could know what content was made by humans, [and what was made] by AI. We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.”



Altman's initial ideas about how to solve the problem of human verification were “very crazy,” he said – World and its eye-scanning orbs, only a little.



World is the latest crypto project to announce a U.S. expansion. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the regulatory environment has become much friendlier to crypto projects.



The company announced it would be building a factory in Richardson, Texas – a suburb of Dallas – to help produce the orbs needed for its coming U.S. expansion. After the initial rollout, other major cities including Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas will receive the second wave of orbs.



“They will really be everywhere,” said Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity's co-founder. “They will be in gas stations, convenience stores, and you will be able to verify within 10 minutes wherever you are.”

 Tokenized assets still lack institutional backing, Chris Yin said, who believes the real-world asset market is much smaller than current estimates suggest. 

Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.

“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA's currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.

“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

Yin questioned the accuracy of existing market estimates, which suggest the RWA sector is worth more than $21 billion.

“I tend to think that one, all the data is wrong, and two, the perspective that most people have is wrong with this, which is I take this $21 billion in assets,” Yin said.

According to the exec, the real RWA market cap figure is “more like” $10 billion, mostly including Treasury bills and gold, and just a “bit of private credit.”

RWA.xyz suggests that the total market capitalization of the RWA market amounted to roughly $17.4 billion as of April 27, with private credit accounting for almost 60% of all RWAs, while Treasury's and commodities share was 27% and 8%, respectively.

Estimating the size of the global RWA market is extremely difficult, especially on the private side, where data is “fragmented and often inaccessible,” Stobox co-founder Ross Shemeliak told Cointelegraph.

According to Stobox's estimations, tokenized Treasurys and bonds must account for the majority of RWAs today, or between 60–65%.

“Crucially, 99.9% of all companies in the world are private, and nearly all of them are untapped candidates for tokenization,” Shemeliak said, adding that such companies typically struggle with access to capital and liquidity.

“Tokenization provides an entirely new mechanism for fundraising, investor engagement, and cap table transparency,” he noted.

Plume CEO Yin highlighted the nature of institutional capital, which tends to move in while markets reach a bigger scale in order to make some money.

“I think people tend to forget what's going on with institutions and the real world,” Yin said. “So the reason why tokenized assets are interesting to them is because they are looking for an angle to make more money, not to save money, not to do efficiency.”

“Nobody cares about that, especially Larry Fink, who runs a $12 trillion asset manager,” Yin said, adding that BlackRock's money market fund has been successful, but its $2.5 billion assets are tiny given the company's net assets.

With the current modest size of the RWA market, the industry should currently rely more on the native community, Yin said, adding:

“Yes, RWA tokenization is small today, just like Bitcoin was in 2013,” Stobox's Shemeliak admitted.

However, tokenized assets are “fundamentally institutional from day one” as they provide regulated securities, yield-bearing instruments, and financial contracts that require legal compliance and governance.

“Tokenizing RWAs without institutional involvement is like trying to build a stock exchange without regulators, custodians or settlement layers,” he said, adding:

 Bitcoin's “base case” for the end of 2025 is $200,000 without further government adoption, Bitwise's head of research told Cointelegraph. 

Bitcoin's expanding institutional adoption may provide the “structural” inflows necessary to surpass gold's market capitalization and push its price beyond $1 million by 2029, according to Bitwise's head of European research, André Dragosch.

“Our in-house prediction is $1 million by 2029. So that Bitcoin will match gold's market cap and total addressable market by 2029,” he told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on April 30.

Gold is currently the world's largest asset, valued at over $21.7 trillion. In comparison, Bitcoin's market capitalization sits at $1.9 trillion, making it the seventh-largest asset globally, according to CompaniesMarketCap data.

For the 2025 market cycle, Bitcoin may surpass $200,000 in the “base case” and $500,000 with more governmental adoption, Dragosch said.

“So the base case is $200,000, conditional on the US government not stepping in. If they step in, it will move closer toward $500,000,” said Dragosch, referring to the US government's plan to potentially make direct Bitcoin acquisitions through “budget-neutral” strategies.

The US is looking at “many creative ways” to fund its Bitcoin investments, including from tariff revenue and by reevaluating the US Treasury's gold certificates, creating a paper surplus to fund the BTC reserve without selling gold, Bo Hines of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets said in an interview on April 14.

The US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed all expectations during their first year of trading, exceeding record trading volumes as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF became the fastest-growing ETF in history.

The first year is usually the “slowest” for ETFs, Dragosch said, highlighting the launch of the gold ETF:

The Bitcoin cycle may also be prolonged when US wirehouses start gaining exposure to Bitcoin and ETFs.

“In the US, the major distribution channels go via Wirehouses, which are essentially the big banks like Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. [...] Not even half of these wirehouses have opened up their distribution channels to US Bitcoin ETFs,” the analyst said.

Adoption from US wirehouses may bring a “huge amount of capital,” since these control over $10 trillion worth of customer assets, Dragosch added.

 21Shares files to launch a spot Sui ETF in the US, joining over 70 crypto ETF applications awaiting SEC review amid growing institutional demand. 

Major European cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares has filed for a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, marking another step in its expansion to the US market.

21Shares on April 30 submitted the Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui (SUI) ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares' US subsidiary.

The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam.

The 128-page filing does not specify on which US exchange the new SUI ETF is expected to debut trading. The ETF also doesn't have a ticker symbol yet.

“There is no certainty that there will be liquidity available on the exchange or that the market price will be in line with the NAV [net asset value] or the principal market NAV at any given time,” it states.

The filing highlighted that the ETF aims to provide exposure to SUI by holding the tokens directly, without utilizing leverage, derivatives or engaging in speculative trading.

21Shares is not the first company to file for a Sui ETF in the US. Canary Capital, a US-based crypto investment firm, filed a Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui ETF on March 17.

Subsequently, Cboe BZX Exchange asked US regulators for clearance to list Canary's Sui ETF in early April.

Sui-based ETPs have already been trading in Europe, with some of such products including 21Shares Sui staking ETP and VanEck Sui ETP.

According to the latest CoinShares update, Sui-based ETPs had $400 million in assets under management as of April 25.

Year-to-date, Sui ETPs have seen $72 million of inflows, with a fresh $20.7 million coming in just last week.

The latest ETF filing by 21Shares is yet another product joining a massive list of crypto ETFs awaiting the SEC's decision.

According to Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, there were at least 72 new crypto ETF filings on the SEC's table as of May 1.

Latest Dark Energy Study Suggests the Universe Is Even Weirder Than We Imagined

If dark energy is weakening, as suggested by recent results, then the cosmos is far stranger than most physicists had supposed

By Lyndie Chiou edited by Lee Billings

In 2024 a shockwave rippled through the astronomical world, shaking it to the core. The disturbance didn't come from some astral disaster at the solar system's doorstep, however. Rather it arrived via the careful analysis of many far-distant galaxies, which revealed new details of the universe's evolution across eons of cosmic history. Against most experts' expectations, the result suggested that dark energy—the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion—was not an unwavering constant but rather a more fickle beast that was weakening over time.

The shocking claim's source was the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), run by an international collaboration at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. And it was so surprising because cosmologists' best explanations for the universe's observed large-scale structure have long assumed that dark energy is a simple, steady thing. But as Joshua Frieman, a physicist at the University of Chicago, says: “We tend to stick with the simplest theory that works—until it doesn't.” Heady with delight and confusion, theorists began scrambling to explain DESI's findings and resurfaced old, more complex ideas shelved decades ago.

In March 2025 even more evidence accrued in favor of dark energy's dynamic nature in DESI's latest data release—this time from a much larger, multimillion-galaxy sample. Dark energy's implied fading, it seemed, was refusing to fade away.

Soon afterward, however, Daniel Green, a physicist at the University of California, San Diego, took to social media to argue over the DESI team's preferred interpretation of the data.

“I'm particularly skeptical of DESI's press release,” Green says. “The tendency should be to say, ‘Hey, why don't we explore all the possible interpretations?' DESI didn't do that many analyses.” The situation, Green says, is akin to looking for a lost set of car keys in a dark parking lot—but only where the light is bright: “When all you look under is one lamppost, you only see what you find there.”

Other explanations exist for DESI's measurements, Green says, and not all of them require the cosmos-quaking prospect of an evolving dark energy. His preferred model instead invokes the putative decay of another mysterious aspect of cosmology, dark matter—thought to be a substance that gravitationally binds galaxies together but otherwise scarcely interacts with the rest of the universe at all. Yet his and other alternative proposals, too, have drawbacks, and the resulting scientific debate has only just begun.

The standard cosmological model at the heart of all this is known as “LCDM.” The “CDM” component stands for “cold dark matter,” and the “L” stands for the Greek letter “lambda,” which denotes a constant dark energy. CDM is the type of dark matter that best accounts for observations of how galaxies form and grow, and—until DESI's proclamation suggested otherwise, that is—a constant dark energy has been the best fit for explaining the distributions of galaxies and other patterns glimpsed in large-scale cosmic structures. “Once they had this constant, everything snapped into place,” Green says. “All of the issues that had been around for 20 years that we'd been hoping were just small mistakes were really resolved by this one thing.”

But dark energy's constancy has always been more of a clever inference rather than an ironclad certainty. DESI is an effort to clarify exactly what dark energy really is by closely monitoring how it has influenced the universe's growth. Since 2021 the project has been meticulously measuring the motions and distributions of galaxies across some 11 billion years of cosmic time.

DESI's data on galactic motions come from measurements of redshift, the stretching out of galaxies' emitted light to the red end of the spectrum by the universe's expansion. And its tracing of spatial distributions emerges from spying enormous bubblelike arrangements of galaxies thought to have formed from more primordial templates, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). BAOs are essentially ripples from giant sound waves that coursed through the hot plasma that filled the early universe, which astronomers can glimpse in the earliest light they can see, the big bang's all-sky afterglow known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The waves' matter-dense crests sowed the seeds of future galaxies and galaxy clusters, while galaxy-sparse voids emerged from the matter-poor troughs. Combined with CMB data as well as distance-pegging observations of supernovae, DESI's measurements offer a reckoning of the universe's historic growth rate—and thus the action of dark energy.

A virtual “flight” through a portion of the largest 3D map of the universe to date, using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

DESI co-spokesperson Nathalie Palanque-Delabrouille, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, recalls the private December 2023 meeting where she and the rest of the DESI team first learned of the project's early results. Up until then, the researchers had worked on blinded data, meaning the true values were slightly but systematically altered so as to ensure that no one could deliberately or inadvertently bias the ongoing analysis to reach some artificially preordained result. These blinded data showed a huge divergence from LCDM. But when the real data were unveiled, “we saw all the points came very close to LCDM, and that was initially a huge relief,” she recalls. That alignment suggested “we did things right.”

Those feelings quickly changed when the group noticed a small, persistent deviation in DESI's estimate for the value of lambda. Still, there was a considerable chance that the results were a statistical fluke. But in DESI's latest results, which were posted to the preprint server arXiv.org last March and incorporated much larger and richer data sets, the statistical robustness of the unexpected lambda value soared, and most talk of flukes dwindled.

Theorists could scarcely contain their excitement—or their profound puzzlement. The results rekindled preexisting ideas about dynamic dark energy first formulated decades ago, not long after dark energy's discovery itself in 1998. One popular theory posits a fifth fundamental force in addition to the known four (electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces), emerging from some as-yet-undiscovered dark matter particle that can influence dark energy. Frieman says the data from DESI is so precise that if this particle is the correct explanation, physicists already know its crucial parameters.

Constrained by the DESI data, Frieman says, the best-fitting model that would support this “fifth force” hypothesis “tells us that this [hypothetical] particle has a mass of about 10–33 electron volts.” To put that into perspective, this means such a particle would be 38 orders of magnitude lighter than an electron—which, Frieman notes, is “by far the lightest stable particle we know of that doesn't have zero mass.”

But while some theorists used DESI's data to revive and sharpen intriguing theories of yesteryear, Green and others issued a warning. The problem: an evolving dark energy would seem to defy well-founded physical principles in other cosmic domains.

The first major point of controversy involves something called the null energy condition, under which—among other things—energy can't propagate faster than light. If circumstances were otherwise, then perilous paradoxes could emerge: time machines could violate causality, matter could repel rather than attract, and even spacetime itself could be destabilized. Theorists have mathematically proven the condition's apparent necessity in numerous circumscribed scenarios within quantum and relativistic domains—but not for the universe at large. Appealing to this sort of theoretical incompleteness, however, “is like a lawyer saying there's a loophole,” Green says. “Most physicists would say that's totally crazy.”

A discovery that something in the universe violates the null energy condition would be groundbreaking, to say the least: a more impolitic term would be “nonsensical.” This astounding violation is exactly what Green and others say most of DESI's analyses are showing, however. On this point, several theorists push back. The controversy goes all the way down to the foundations of modern cosmology, centering on a parameter unceremoniously known as w(z).

In 1917 Albert Einstein first introduced lambda as a way to ensure that a static universe would pop out of his equations. But after work led by Edwin Hubble proved the universe was expanding, Einstein abandoned his fudge factor (even calling it his “greatest blunder”). It wasn't until the late 1990s, when astronomers found that the universe's expansion wasn't constant but in fact accelerating, that lambda once again returned to theoretical prominence. This time theorists interpreted it to represent the magnitude of the universe's dark energy density, a constant that doesn't change with time.

But if there's one thing modern cosmology has shown, it's that little, if anything, about the universe is ever so neat and tidy. So, despite a lack of evidence, theorists of the time reimagined LCDM as w(z)CDM, where w(z) is a time-varying term representing the ratio of dark energy's pressure to its energy density. When w(z) has a value of exactly –1, w(z)CDM is equivalent to LCDM. For w(z) greater than –1, the universe's dark energy dilutes over time, consistent with DESI's findings. On the other hand, w(z) less than –1 leads to devastating consequences: dark energy's pressure overpowers its density, ultimately causing everything from galaxies all the way down to atoms to be ripped apart—a “big rip” that violates the null energy condition and would seemingly doom the universe to a violent death.

The DESI group collaboration's March preprint includes a graph that shows w(z) with values below –1 for later epochs in the universe's history, seemingly validating the criticisms of Green and others. But all is not as it seems. Such criticisms “draw the wrong conclusions,” says Paul Steinhardt, a cosmologist at Princeton University.

That's because in a second graph in the DESI paper, w(z) never crosses the critical –1 line. The difference: despite DESI's curved data, the first chart uses a simple line fit for w(z). Steinhardt and Frieman both say that because of the poor fit, the linear w(z) isn't physically meaningful. Researchers merely find it convenient for comparing different dark energy models and experiments.

The second graph shows a curved fit for w(z) that more closely matches the data. It rolls down to, but never crosses, the critical –1 value, consistent with a weakening dark energy that would avoid the universe ending in a big rip.

But Gabriel Lynch, a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis, who has an alternative explanation for the DESI data, says that even if any of DESI's w(z) estimates are physical, coaxing out a theory to support them leads to incredibly fraught circumstances. “This is saying something weird,” Lynch says. “It's not impossible, but maybe it would be good to look into some alternatives.”

Whether or not DESI's results would violate the null energy condition, everyone agrees on another problem. Models that accommodate a changing dark energy inevitably conclude that a class of tiny fundamental particles known as neutrinos have a negative mass. Yet multiple generations of empirical experimentation have indisputably shown that neutrinos do have mass. Frieman suggests that something else, perhaps an unknown particle, might be mimicking a negative-mass neutrino.

But a new approach by Lynch and his thesis advisor Lloyd Knox, detailed in a preprint that was posted to arXiv.org in March, sidesteps this “negative neutrino” problem altogether. If some of the mass in the universe somehow disappeared over time, its influence on DESI's data would be the same as a weakening dark energy—without necessitating a negative mass for neutrinos. Although physicists have good reasons to believe that certain seemingly stable subatomic particles could contribute to this notional effect by decaying over time, this process is thought to be far too slow to account for DESI's observations. For instance, experiments have shown the proton to be so stable that its half-life must be at least a hundred trillion trillion times the age of the universe. But no one knows what the half-life of putative particles of dark matter would be. So, Lynch asks, what if dark matter has a half-life of roughly a billion years? Fast forward about 14 billion years to today, and some would have decayed into dark radiation, erasing the heavy matter signal.

If the idea holds true, DESI's data might be a way to find the exact value for neutrino masses as well as for dark matter particles, which would be a big deal. “That is a breakdown of LCDM that we totally expected,” Green says. “And we were just waiting to detect it.”

Owing to dynamic dark energy's paradoxes, “you really need to explore every alternative explanation [for the results], because evolving dark energy is the absolute last one that I would be willing to believe,” Green says.

Despite such strong words, all parties caution that this debate is still in its early days. “This is only the first round of the fight,” Steinhardt says, and no model currently explains all of DESI's results. More data are needed, especially from even bigger and better cosmic surveys by planned next-generation telescopes. And, naturally, more analyses are needed, too, before the community can reach any consensus. Whether a resolution comes from dynamic dark energy, dark matter decay or something entirely different, the LCDM model has seemingly been stretched to its breaking point. Every reasonable explanation for DESI's data involves new, scarcely explored physics. “They are all exotic models. We're beyond LCDM both ways,” Palanque-Delabrouille says. “We just want to know the truth.”

An increase in physical activity between the ages of 45 and 65 could help prevent Alzheimer's disease, while inactivity may be detrimental to brain health. This is the main conclusion of a scientific paper published in Alzheimer's & Dementia, which highlights the need to promote physical activity among middle-aged adults. The study is the result of a collaboration between the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a center promoted by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation, and the Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center (BBRC), a research centre of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation.

It is estimated that 13% of Alzheimer's disease cases worldwide can be attributed to physical inactivity. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity per week. While extensive research has shown that exercise reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by improving cardiovascular and mental health, recent studies suggest that physical activity may have a direct impact on the development of brain pathology associated with the disease.

The study, led by Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, researcher at ISGlobal, included 337 participants from the ALFA+ longitudinal cohort, part of the ALFA study (ALzheimer's and FAmilies) at the BBRC, supported by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation. ""We conducted a four-year follow-up of middle-aged residents of Catalonia with a family history of Alzheimer's disease,"" explains Müge Akıncı, doctoral researcher at ISGlobal and the BBRC at the time of the study and first author of the paper. ""We used physical activity questionnaires to assess changes in activity over a four-year period and neuroimaging tests to analyse the effects of exercise on brain structure and function,"" she adds. Participants were classified as adherent (meeting WHO recommendations), non-adherent (doing less than the recommended amount of physical activity), and sedentary (doing zero minutes of physical activity per week).

Benefits of physical activity on brain mechanisms

Beta-amyloid (Aβ) is a protein that can impair neural communication when it accumulates in the brain and is considered the first pathological event in Alzheimer's disease. Participants who increased their physical activity to meet WHO-recommended levels showed less beta-amyloid accumulation than those who remained sedentary or reduced their physical activity. Moreover, this effect appeared to be dose-dependent; the greater the increase in activity, the greater the reduction in amyloid burden.

Non-sedentary participants also showed a greater cortical thickness in brain regions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cortical thickness in the medial temporal area is crucial for memory, so its thinning or atrophy (loss of volume) is an early sign of neurodegeneration.

""Even those who did less physical activity than recommended had greater cortical thickness than sedentary people, suggesting that any amount of exercise, no matter how minimal, has health benefits,"" explains Müge Akıncı.

More exercise as a prevention strategy

The research team looked at both the increase in physical activity and the adherence to WHO recommendations. They observed that the benefits of physical activity appear to be related to increasing activity over time, rather than reaching a specific activity threshold.

""These findings reinforce the importance of promoting physical activity in middle age as a public health strategy for Alzheimer's prevention,"" emphasises Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, ISGlobal researcher and lead investigator of the study. ""Interventions aimed at promoting increased physical activity could be key to reducing the incidence of the disease in the future,"" she concludes.

Marine plastic pollution is a global crisis, with 9 to 14 million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean every year. Tiny fragments called microplastics -- ranging from 1 micron to 5 millimeters -- make up the vast majority of plastic pieces found and pose serious risks to ocean health.

Most research has focused on surface waters, usually sampling just the top 15 to 50 centimeters using net tows. However, microplastics come in many forms with different properties, influencing how they move and interact with their surroundings.

A researcher from Florida Atlantic University is among an international team of scientists who has moved beyond just ""scratching the surface,"" marking a turning point in our understanding of how microplastics move through and impact the global ocean.

For the first time, scientists have mapped microplastic distribution from the surface to the deep sea at a global scale -- revealing not only where plastics accumulate, but how they infiltrate critical ocean systems. For the study, researchers synthesized depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to map microplastic distribution patterns by size and polymer type, while also evaluating potential transport mechanisms.

Results, published in Nature, reveal that microplastics are not just surface pollutants -- they're deeply embedded in the ocean's structure. Ranging from a few to thousands of particles per cubic meter, their size determines how they move: smaller microplastics (1 to 100 micrometers) spread more evenly and penetrate deeper, while larger ones (100 to 5,000 micrometers) concentrate near the surface, especially within the top 100 meters of gyres. Gyres act like massive, slow-moving whirlpools that trap and concentrate floating debris -- especially plastic.

Strikingly, microplastics are becoming a measurable part of the ocean's carbon cycle, making up just 0.1% of carbon particles at 30 meters but rising to 5% at 2,000 meters. This suggests that microplastics are not only persistent pollutants but may also be altering key biogeochemical processes in the deep sea.

""Microplastics are not just floating at the surface -- they're deeply embedded throughout the ocean, from coastal waters to the open sea,"" said Tracy Mincer, Ph.D., co-author and an associate professor of biology and biochemistry in FAU's Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College.

Researchers identified more than 56 types of plastic polymers in their synthesized microplastic dataset. While buoyant plastics dominate overall, denser microplastics are more prevalent offshore -- likely because they fragment more readily. Dense polymers become brittle and break down faster, particularly after prolonged exposure to environmental weathering. These small, persistent particles -- often originating from fishing gear and containers like polyester bottles -- can remain in the ocean for decades.

Polypropylene, commonly found in items like yogurt containers and rope, photodegrades more quickly than polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags and water bottles. This may account for its lower abundance in offshore waters. Nonetheless, significant uncertainties remain in subsurface microplastic data due to inconsistent sampling techniques and limited coverage, highlighting the need for specialized equipment and greater collaboration to improve data reliability.

The ocean's water column -- the largest habitat on Earth -- plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling, supporting half of the planet's primary production and absorbing human-made CO?. As microplastics move through this vast space, they interact with natural particles and processes, potentially affecting how the ocean functions.

""Our findings suggest microplastics are becoming a measurable part of the ocean's carbon cycle, with potential consequences for climate regulation and marine food webs,"" said Mincer. ""This work sets the stage for taking the next steps in understanding the residence time of plastic in the interior of the ocean.""

The study was led by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in collaboration with FAU; Aotearoa Blue Ocean Research in New Zealand; Northeastern University; East China Normal University; NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, The Netherlands; The Ocean Cleanup, The Netherlands; Egger Research and Consulting, Switzerland; University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Utrecht University, The Netherlands; Universidad Catolica del Norte, Chile; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Harvard University; University of Siena, Italy; and the National Biodiversity Future Center, Italy.

Several authors were FAU researchers in the Mincer lab including Luisa Galgani, Ph.D., who served as a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow and is now faculty at the University of Siena; Ryan Bos, Ph.D., who was a Ph.D. student in the integrative biology program at FAU and is now a postdoc at Harvard; and Shiye Zhao, Ph.D., the lead author, who was an FAU postdoc for several years and is now tenured faculty at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Restoring oil wells back to nature with moss","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250430142002.htm","Thu, 01 May 2025 01:39:23 GMT","

In what could represent a milestone in ecological restoration, researchers have implemented a method capable of restoring peatlands at tens of thousands of oil and gas exploration sites in western Canada.

Researchers from the University of Waterloo led the project that involves lowering the surface of these decommissioned sites, known as well pads, and transplanting native moss onto them to effectively recreate peatlands. This is the first time researchers have applied the method to scale on an entire well pad. The study found that the technique results in sufficient water for the growth of peatland moss across large portions of the study site.

Historically, restoration efforts involved planting trees or grasses to establish upland forests or grasslands. This newmethod returns a well pad to its condition before drilling occurred and supports the ongoing development of peatland restoration techniques. The discovery can help the oil and gas industry and its regulators better mitigate the long-term impact of resource extraction on Canadian peatland ecosystems.

""These results are the first to suggest that the re-establishment of peatland vegetation on full-scale lowered well pads is possible. through peatlands, which can negatively affect the ecosystem in surrounding areas,"" said Murdoch McKinnon, PhD candidate in the Faculty of Environment. ""Well pads bury all of the native peatland vegetation under clay or sand, negatively impacting the ability of the peatland to sequester carbon and also reducing the availability of habitat for wildlife.""

The researchers plan to continue monitoring ecosystem development on the tested well pads to confirm that the transplanted mosses will be self-sustaining over the coming decades. Partners at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology's Centre for Boreal Research are now applying some of the study's recommendations at sites across northern Alberta.

""Preserving peatlands is critical because of the role they play storing and supplying water in the landscape,"" said Dr. Richard Petrone, a professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Management at Waterloo. ""They are also our best choice for nature-based climate change solutions because of the vast amounts of carbon that they store.""

In the future, researchers will focus on increasing the amount of water that flows from surrounding natural peatlands into well pads to further optimize soil moisture. This will be an essential step given the sensitivity of the native mosses to drying out and might therefore improve regrowth.

Mount Royal University, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and Athabasca University also contributed to this work. The study, Hydrologic assessment of mineral substrate suitability for true moss initiation in a boreal peatland undergoing restoration, appears in Ecological Engineering.

As the global population ages, supporting older adults in maintaining their cognitive and memory functions has become a pressing concern. The United Nations estimates that by the 2070s, there will be over 2.2 billion people aged 65 or older, surpassing the global number of children under 18. This demographic shift is especially pronounced in Japan, the fastest-aging country, where 28.7% of the population is 65 or older.

One promising strategy to counter cognitive decline is through olfactory stimulation -- engaging the sense of smell. Smell signals travel directly to brain regions involved in memory and emotion. Building on this knowledge, a joint research team from Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), University of the Arts London, Bunkyo Gakuin University, and Hosei University, Japan, has developed the world's first cognitive training method for older adults by combining olfactory stimulation with virtual reality (VR). The study was published in Volume 15 of the journal Scientific Reports on March 28, 2025.

""VR provides a promising platform to simulate sensory conditions in a controlled yet engaging manner. By combining goal-oriented tasks with real-time feedback, our VR-based olfactory training approach can increase cognitive engagement and maximize its therapeutic impact,"" says Professor Takamichi Nakamoto from Science Tokyo.

The method involves an olfactory display that emits specific scents during immersive VR gameplay, activating memory- and emotion-related brain regions. In the activity, participants are asked to memorize and later match scents within a virtual environment. The experience begins in a virtual landscape. Using a VR controller, participants interact with a scent source represented by a stone statue. When touched, the statue releases a specific scent, accompanied by a white vapor cloud as a visual cue to reinforce memory.

Participants then explore the virtual landscape to locate a scent source. As they move through the landscape, the olfactory display emits subtle traces of the scent to guide them to the location. Upon reaching the odor source, shown as a stone lantern, they encounter three colored vapor clouds, each emitting a different scent. Their task is to compare the smells and identify the one that matches the original scent they memorized.

""The smell memory phase strengthens odor recognition and memory encoding by linking the olfactory stimulus with a visual cue. The navigation phase challenges players to integrate spatial navigation with odor recognition while retaining memory of the initial scent. The final odor comparison phase engages olfactory discrimination and working memory retrieval, reinforcing cognitive function,"" explains Nakamoto.

The activity led to noticeable cognitive improvements in 30 older adults aged 63 to 90. After just 20 minutes of playing the VR game, participants showed improvements in visuospatial rotation and memory. Visuospatial processing and cognitive function were assessed through different tasks. In the Hiragana Rotation Task, where they had to decide if rotated Japanese characters matched the original, scores improved from 19-82 to 29-85. In a word-based spatial memory recall task, where participants memorized word positions in a grid, scores rose from 0-15 to 3-15. These improvements were validated through statistical analysis.

With continued research and development toward more affordable olfactory displays or alternate scent delivery methods, olfactory-based VR activities could become an accessible and engaging tool for supporting mental health in older adults.

Geologists led by the University of Maryland and the University of Hawai'i finally connected the dots between one of the largest volcanic eruptions in Earth's history and its source deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.

In a paper published in the journal Nature on April 30, 2025, the team revealed that the same underwater hotspot created both a chain of underwater volcanoes in the southern Pacific region and the massive Ontong-Java Plateau, the largest volcanic platform on Earth.

""Up until now, we've had this extremely disconnected picture of the Pacific and its volcanoes,"" said the study's corresponding author Val Finlayson, an assistant research scientist in UMD's Department of Geology. ""But for the first time, we're able to make a clear connection between the younger southern and older western Pacific volcanic systems. It's a discovery that gives us a more complete history of how the Pacific Ocean basin has evolved over millions of years to become what it is today.""

For years, scientists wondered whether the southern Pacific Ocean's Louisville hotspot -- an area where hot and chemically distinct material from deep inside the Earth rises to the surface to create volcanoes -- formed both the underwater mountain chain bearing its name and the 120-million-year-old Ontong-Java Plateau, a submerged seafloor platform located what is now north of the Solomon Islands. Previous theories and models on how the Pacific seafloor moved attempted to explain the connection between the two major geological features but failed to provide a definitive answer.

""Much of the physical evidence for a connection between Louisville and Ontong-Java has disappeared because part of the Louisville hotspot track was subducted, or pushed, under tectonic plates in the Pacific region,"" Finlayson said. ""We had to sample deeply submerged volcanoes from a different long-lived hotspot track to find evidence from tens of millions of years ago that suggested our models for the Pacific plate needed revision.""

Finlayson and her team made their first breakthrough when they discovered a series of underwater mountains near Samoa that were much older than expected for volcanoes in the area. By analyzing the age and chemical makeup of ancient rock samples taken from the area, the researchers concluded that these mountains were part of a much older segment of the Louisville volcanic track, which Finlayson compared to a volcano's ""footprints."" As the Earth's crust (tectonic plates) moves over hotspots, they form these volcanic tracks.

""We can track these 'footprints' across time and space,"" Finlayson explained. ""The footprints get progressively older as you move away from an active hot spot, similar to how your own footprints will fade away in the sand as you walk. But you can still tell that these prints belong to the same source. Thanks to this new evidence, we were able to revise current models of Pacific plate motion and gain a better understanding of how the seafloor has moved over millions of years.""

Finlayson's team now plans to apply their improved models to better understand other ancient volcanic features scattered across the ocean floor and above its surface. As many Pacific island nations currently sit atop volcanic platforms and underwater volcanic chains, Finlayson hopes that her work furthers understanding of the very foundations of those countries. She also believes that her team's discovery will help scientists develop a better understanding of volcanism and geological evolution, not just in the Pacific region, but around the world.

""We've solved one mystery, but there are countless more waiting to be unraveled. This finding offers us a more accurate history of the Pacific and its volcanic activity and helps us understand more about the dynamics and style of volcanism that occurs there,"" Finlayson said. ""Everything new we learn about the Earth's tumultuous past helps us better understand the dynamic planet we live on today.""

An experiment seven years in the making has uncovered new insights into the nature of consciousness and challenges two prominent, competing scientific theories: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). The findings were published today in Nature and mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness.

IIT suggests that consciousness emerges when information inside a system (like the brain) is highly connected and unified, for as long as the information is consciously perceived, acting as a single whole. On the other hand, GNWT suggests a network of brain areas will spotlight important pieces of information in the brain -- bringing it to the forefront of our minds -- broadcasting it widely the moment it enters consciousness, and this produces conscious experience. The two competing theories were tested against one another in 2019 in a collaborative experiment involving 256 human subjects, and the findings were just released.

""Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute's mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,"" said Christof Koch, Ph.D., meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute. ""Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.""

The Findings 

Research showed that there's functional connection between neurons in early visual areas of the brain (the areas that process vision, which are at the back of the brain) and the frontal areas of the brain, helping us understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts. The findings de-emphasize the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it's important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception. In other words, intelligence is about doing while consciousness is about being.

This discovery has implications for how we understand consciousness and may shed light on disorders of consciousness such as comas or vegetative states. Identifying where consciousness comes from could help detect ""covert consciousness"" in unresponsive patients with severe injuries -- a condition known to occur in about one-quarter of cases as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year.

Neither Theory Came Out on Top 

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) says consciousness comes from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work together to integrate information, like teamwork. It arises from how these parts are connected and how they share information with each other rather than any one individual area or part of the brain generating consciousness. The study, however, did not find enough lasting connections in the back of the brain to support this idea. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) supports the idea that consciousness happens in the front of the brain, but the study didn't find enough support for this idea either.

""It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory. The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another,"" said Anil Seth, Ph.D., a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex. ""Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable -- much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from.

The study involved 256 subjects, which is unprecedented for this kind of experiment. Researchers showed them various visual stimuli and then used three common human brain measurement tools that track blood flow as well as magnetic and electrical activity to study their brains while they looked at the stimuli.

The highly collaborative experiment is the result of a large-scale, open science collaboration that began at a workshop at the Allen Institute in 2018. This innovative approach brought together researchers with differing perspectives to test two theories in a collaborative, yet critical, environment aimed at reducing confirmation bias and accelerating scientific progress.

""Adversarial collaborations are a powerful social process, little used because of its challenging nature, within any field that has competing theories,"" said Koch. ""The bio-medical field could hugely profit by 'friendly' competition among theories -- neurobiological or others. But it requires a great deal of cooperation and work.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Engineers advance toward a fault-tolerant quantum computer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250430142617.htm","Thu, 01 May 2025 01:48:53 GMT","

In the future, quantum computers could rapidly simulate new materials or help scientists develop faster machine-learning models, opening the door to many new possibilities.

But these applications will only be possible if quantum computers can perform operations extremely quickly, so scientists can make measurements and perform corrections before compounding error rates reduce their accuracy and reliability.

The efficiency of this measurement process, known as readout, relies on the strength of the coupling between photons, which are particles of light that carry quantum information, and artificial atoms, units of matter that are often used to store information in a quantum computer.

Now, MIT researchers have demonstrated what they believe is the strongest nonlinear light-matter coupling ever achieved in a quantum system. Their experiment is a step toward realizing quantum operations and readout that could be performed in a few nanoseconds.

The researchers used a novel superconducting circuit architecture to show nonlinear light-matter coupling that is about an order of magnitude stronger than prior demonstrations, which could enable a quantum processor to run about 10 times faster.

There is still much work to be done before the architecture could be used in a real quantum computer, but demonstrating the fundamental physics behind the process is a major step in the right direction, says Yufeng ""Bright"" Ye PhD '24, lead author of a paper on this research.

""This would really eliminate one of the bottlenecks in quantum computing. Usually, you have to measure the results of your computations in between rounds of error correction. This could accelerate how quickly we can reach the fault-tolerant quantum computing stage and be able to get real-world applications and value out of our quantum computers,"" says Ye.

He is joined on the paper by senior author Kevin O'Brien, an associate professor and principal investigator in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT who leads the Quantum Coherent Electronics Group in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), as well as others at MIT, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and Harvard University. The research appears in Nature Communications.

A new coupler

This physical demonstration builds on years of theoretical research in the O'Brien group.

After Ye joined the lab as a PhD student in 2019, he began developing a specialized photon detector to enhance quantum information processing.

Through that work, he invented a new type of quantum coupler, which is a device that facilitates interactions between qubits. Qubits are the building blocks of a quantum computer. This so-called quarton coupler had so many potential applications in quantum operations and readout that it quickly became a focus of the lab.

This quarton coupler is a special type of superconducting circuit that has the potential to generate extremely strong nonlinear coupling, which is essential for running most quantum algorithms. As the researchers feed more current into the coupler, it creates an even stronger nonlinear interaction. In this sense, nonlinearity means a system behaves in a way that is greater than the sum of its parts, exhibiting more complex properties.

""Most of the useful interactions in quantum computing come from nonlinear coupling of light and matter. If you can get a more versatile range of different types of coupling, and increase the coupling strength, then you can essentially increase the processing speed of the quantum computer,"" Ye explains.

For quantum readout, researchers shine microwave light onto a qubit and then, depending on whether that qubit is in state 0 or 1, there is a frequency shift on its associated readout resonator. They measure this shift to determine the qubit's state.

Nonlinear light-matter coupling between the qubit and resonator enables this measurement process.

The MIT researchers designed an architecture with a quarton coupler connected to two superconducting qubits on a chip. They turn one qubit into a resonator and use the other qubit as an artificial atom which stores quantum information. This information is transferred in the form of microwave light particles called photons.

""The interaction between these superconducting artificial atoms and the microwave light that routes the signal is basically how an entire superconducting quantum computer is built,"" Ye explains.

Enabling faster readout

The quarton coupler creates nonlinear light-matter coupling between the qubit and resonator that's about an order of magnitude stronger than researchers had achieved before. This could enable a quantum system with lightning-fast readout.

""This work is not the end of the story. This is the fundamental physics demonstration, but there is work going on in the group now to realize really fast readout,"" O'Brien says.

That would involve adding additional electronic components, such as filters, to produce a readout circuit that could be incorporated into a larger quantum system.

The researchers also demonstrated extremely strong matter-matter coupling, another type of qubit interaction that is important for quantum operations. This is another area they plan to explore with future work.

Fast operations and readout are especially important for quantum computers because qubits have finite lifespans, a concept known as coherence time.

Stronger nonlinear coupling enables a quantum processor to run faster and with lower error, so the qubits can perform more operations in the same amount of time. This means the qubits can run more rounds of error correction during their lifespans.

""The more runs of error correction you can get in, the lower the error will be in the results,"" Ye says.

In the long run, this work could help scientists build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is essential for practical, large-scale quantum computation.

This research was supported, in part, by the Army Research Office, the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, and the MIT Center for Quantum Engineering.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Think Twice Before Creating That ChatGPT Action Figure","https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-image-generator-action-figure-privacy/","Thu, 01 May 2025 13:56:00 GMT","

At the start of April, an influx of action figures started appearing on social media sites including LinkedIn and X. Each figure depicted the person who had created it with uncanny accuracy, complete with personalized accessories such as reusable coffee cups, yoga mats, and headphones.

All this is possible because of OpenAI's new GPT-4o-powered image generator, which supercharges ChatGPT's ability to edit pictures, render text, and more. OpenAI's ChatGPT image generator can also create pictures in the style of Japanese animated film company Studio Ghibli—a trend that quickly went viral, too.

The images are fun and easy to make—all you need is a free ChatGPT account and a photo. Yet to create an action figure or Studio Ghibli-style image, you also need to hand over a lot of data to OpenAI, which could be used to train its models.

The data you are giving away when you use an AI image editor is often hidden. Every time you upload an image to ChatGPT, you're potentially handing over “an entire bundle of metadata,” says Tom Vazdar, area chair for cybersecurity at Open Institute of Technology. “That includes the EXIF data attached to the image file, such as the time the photo was taken and the GPS coordinates of where it was shot.”

OpenAI also collects data about the device you're using to access the platform. That means your device type, operating system, browser version, and unique identifiers, says Vazdar. “And because platforms like ChatGPT operate conversationally, there's also behavioral data, such as what you typed, what kind of images you asked for, how you interacted with the interface and the frequency of those actions.”

It's not just your face. If you upload a high-resolution photo, you're giving OpenAI whatever else is in the image, too—the background, other people, things in your room and anything readable such as documents or badges, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI product marketing at risk management firm GRC International Group.

This type of voluntarily provided, consent-backed data is “a gold mine for training generative models,” especially multimodal ones that rely on visual inputs, says Vazdar.

OpenAI denies it is orchestrating viral photo trends as a ploy to collect user data, yet the firm certainly gains an advantage from it. OpenAI doesn't need to scrape the web for your face if you're happily uploading it yourself, Vazdar points out. “This trend, whether by design or a convenient opportunity, is providing the company with massive volumes of fresh, high-quality facial data from diverse age groups, ethnicities, and geographies.”

OpenAI says it does not actively seek out personal information to train models—and it doesn't use public data on the internet to build profiles about people to advertise to them or sell their data, an OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED. However, under OpenAI's current privacy policy, images submitted through ChatGPT can be retained and used to improve its models.

Any data, prompts, or requests you share helps teach the algorithm—and personalized information helps fine tune it further, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET, who created his own action figure to demonstrate the privacy risks of the trend on LinkedIn.

In some markets, your photos are protected by regulation. In the UK and EU, data-protection regulation including the GDPR offer strong protections, including the right to access or delete your data. At the same time, use of biometric data requires explicit consent.

However, photographs become biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification of a specific individual, says Melissa Hall, senior associate at law firm MFMac. Processing an image to create a cartoon version of the subject in the original photograph is “unlikely to meet this definition,” she says.

Meanwhile, in the US, privacy protections vary. “California and Illinois are leading with stronger data protection laws, but there is no standard position across all US states,” says Annalisa Checchi, a partner at IP law firm Ionic Legal. And OpenAI's privacy policy doesn't contain an explicit carve-out for likeness or biometric data, which “creates a grey area for stylized facial uploads,” Checchi says.

The risks include your image or likeness being retained, potentially used to train future models, or combined with other data for profiling, says Checchi. “While these platforms often prioritize safety, the long-term use of your likeness is still poorly understood—and hard to retract once uploaded.”

OpenAI says its users' privacy and security is a top priority. The firm wants its AI models to learn about the world, not private individuals, and it actively minimizes the collection of personal information, an OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED.

Meanwhile, users have control over how their data is used, with self-service tools to access, export, or delete personal information. You can also opt out of having content used to improve models, according to OpenAI.

ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro users can control whether they contribute to future model improvements in their data controls settings. OpenAI does not train on ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, and Edu customer data⁠ by default, according to the company.

The next time you are tempted to jump on a ChatGPT-led trend such as the action figure or Studio Ghibli–style images, it's wise to consider the privacy trade-off. The risks apply to ChatGPT as well as many other AI image editing or generation tools, so it's important to read the privacy policy before uploading your photos.

There are also steps you can take to protect your data. In ChatGPT, the most effective is to turn off chat history, which helps ensure your data is not used for training, says Vazdar. You can also upload anonymized or modified images, for example, using a filter or generating a digital avatar rather than an actual photo, he says.

It's worth stripping out metadata from image files before uploading, which is possible using photo editing tools. “Users should avoid prompts that include sensitive personal information and refrain from uploading group photos or anything with identifiable background features,” says Vazdar.

Double-check your OpenAI account settings, especially those related to data use for training, Hall adds. “Be mindful of whether any third-party tools are involved, and never upload someone else's photo without their consent. OpenAI's terms make it clear that you're responsible for what you upload, so awareness is key.”

Checchi recommends disabling model training in OpenAI's settings, avoiding location-tagged prompts, and steering clear of linking content to social profiles. “Privacy and creativity aren't mutually exclusive—you just need to be a bit more intentional.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Your Favorite New Coworker Is an AI-Enhanced Operative From North Korea","https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-stole-your-tech-job-ai-interviews/","Thu, 01 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

On paper, the first candidate looked perfect. Thomas was from rural Tennessee and had studied computer science at the University of Missouri. His résumé said he'd been a professional programmer for eight years, and he'd breezed through a preliminary coding test. All of this was excellent news for Thomas' prospective boss, Simon Wijckmans, founder of the web security startup C.Side. The 27-year-old Belgian was based in London but was looking for ambitious, fully remote coders.

Thomas had an Anglo-Saxon surname, so Wijckmans was surprised when he clicked into his Google Meet and found himself speaking with a heavily accented young man of Asian origin. Thomas had set a generic image of an office as his background. His internet connection was laggy— odd for a professional coder—and his end of the call was noisy. To Wijckmans, Thomas sounded like he was sitting in a large, crowded space, maybe a dorm or a call center.

Wijckmans fired off his interview questions, and Thomas' responses were solid enough. But Wijckmans noticed that Thomas seemed most interested in asking about his salary. He didn't come across as curious about the actual work or about how the company operated or even about benefits like startup stock or health coverage. Odd, thought Wijckmans. The conversation came to a close, and he got ready for the next interview in his queue.

Once again, the applicant said they were based in the US, had an Anglo name, and appeared to be a young Asian man with a thick, non-American accent. He used a basic virtual background, was on a terrible internet connection, and had a single-minded focus on salary. This candidate, though, was wearing glasses. In the lenses, Wijckmans spotted the reflection of multiple screens, and he could make out a white chatbox with messages scrolling by. “He was clearly either chatting with somebody or on some AI tool,” Wijckmans remembers.

On high alert, Wijckmans grabbed screenshots and took notes. After the call ended, he went back over the job applications. He found that his company's listings were being flooded with applicants just like these: an opening for a full-stack developer got more than 500 applications in a day, far more than usual. And when he looked more deeply into the applicants' coding tests, he saw that many candidates appeared to have used a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows you to mask your computer's true location.

Wijckmans didn't know it yet, but he'd stumbled onto the edges of an audacious, global cybercrime operation. He'd unwittingly made contact with an army of seemingly unassuming IT workers, deployed to work remotely for American and European companies under false identities, all to bankroll the government of North Korea.

With a little help from some friends on the ground, of course.

christina chapman was living in a trailer in Brook Park, Minnesota, a hamlet north of Minneapolis, when she got a note from a recruiter that changed her life. A bubbly 44-year-old with curly red hair and glasses, she loved her dogs and her mom and posting social justice content on TikTok. In her spare time she listened to K-pop, enjoyed Renaissance fairs, and got into cosplay. Chapman was also, according to her sparse online résumé, learning to code online.

It was March 2020 when she clicked on the message in her LinkedIn account. A foreign company was looking for somebody to “be the US face” of the business. The company needed help finding remote employment for overseas workers. Chapman signed on. It's unclear how fast her workload grew, but by October 2022 she could afford a move from chilly Minnesota to a low-slung, four-bedroom house in Litchfield Park, Arizona. It wasn't fancy—a suburban corner lot with a few thin trees—but it was a big upgrade over the trailer.

The pandemic dramatically expanded the number of remote jobs, and Pyongyang saw the perfect opportunity.

Chapman then started documenting more of her life on TikTok and YouTube, mostly talking about her diet, fitness, or mental health. In one chatty video, shared in June 2023, she described grabbing breakfast on the go—an açaí bowl and a smoothie— because work was so busy. “My clients are going crazy!” she complained. In the background, the camera caught a glimpse of metal racks holding at least a dozen open laptops covered in sticky notes. A few months later, federal investigators raided Chapman's home, seized the laptops, and eventually filed charges alleging that she had spent three years aiding the “illicit revenue generation efforts” of the government of North Korea.

For maybe a decade, North Korean intelligence services have been training young IT workers and sending them abroad in teams, often to China or Russia. From these bases, they scour the web for job listings all over, usually in software engineering, and usually with Western companies. They favor roles that are fully remote, with solid wages, good access to data and systems, and few responsibilities. Over time they began applying for these jobs using stolen or fake identities and relying on members of their criminal teams to provide fictional references; some have even started using AI to pass coding tests, video interviews, and background checks.

But if an applicant lands a job offer, the syndicate needs somebody on the ground in the country the applicant claims to live in. A fake employee, after all, can't use the addresses or bank accounts linked to their stolen IDs, and they can't dial in to a company's networks from overseas without instantly triggering suspicion. That's where someone like Christina Chapman comes in.

As the “facilitator” for hundreds of North Korea–linked jobs, Chapman signed fraudulent documents and handled some of the fake workers' salaries. She would often receive their paychecks in one of her bank accounts, take a cut, and wire the rest overseas: Federal prosecutors say Chapman was promised as much as 30 percent of the money that passed through her hands.

Her most important job, though, was tending the “laptop farm.” After being hired, a fake worker will typically ask for their company computer to be sent to a different address than the one on record—usually with some tale about a last-minute move or needing to stay with a sick relative. The new address, of course, belongs to the facilitator, in this case Chapman. Sometimes the facilitator forwards the laptop to an address overseas, but more commonly that person holds onto it and installs software that allows it to be controlled remotely. Then the fake employee can connect to their machine from anywhere in the world while appearing to be in the US. (“You know how to install Anydesk?” one North Korean operative asked Chapman in 2022. “I do it practically EVERYDAY!” she replied.)

In messages with her handlers, Chapman discussed sending government forms like the I-9, which attests that a person is legally able to work in the US. (“I did my best to copy your signature,” she wrote. “Haha. Thank you,” came the response.) She also did basic tech troubleshooting and dialed into meetings on a worker's behalf, sometimes on short notice, as in this conversation from November 2023:

Worker: We are going to have laptop setup meeting in 20 mins. Can you join Teams meeting and follow what IT guy say? Because it will require to restart laptop multiple times and I can not handle that. You can mute and just follow what they say ...

Chapman: Who do I say I am?

Worker: You don't have to say, I will be joining there too.

Chapman: I just typed in the name Daniel. If they ask WHY you are using two devices, just say the microphone on your laptop doesn't work right ... Most IT people are fine with that explanation.

Sometimes, she got jumpy. “I hope you guys can find other people to do your physical I9s,” she wrote to her bosses in 2023, according to court documents. “I will SEND them for you, but have someone else do the paperwork. I can go to FEDERAL PRISON for falsifying federal documents.” Michael Barnhart, an investigator at cybersecurity company DTEX and a leading expert on the North Korean IT worker threat, says Chapman's involvement followed a standard pattern—from an innocuous initial contact on LinkedIn to escalating requests. “Little by little, the asks get bigger and bigger,” he says. “Then by the end of the day, you're asking the facilitator to go to a government facility to pick up an actual government ID.”

By the time investigators raided Chapman's home, she was housing several dozen laptops, each with a sticky note indicating the fake worker's identity and employer. Some of the North Korean operatives worked multiple jobs; some had been toiling quietly for years. Prosecutors said at least 300 employers had been pulled into this single scheme, including “a top-five national television network and media company, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an iconic American car manufacturer, a high-end retail store, and one of the most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the world.” Chapman, they alleged, had helped pass along at least $17 million. She pleaded guilty in February 2025 to charges relating to wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing.

Chapman's case is just one of several North Korean fake-worker prosecutions making their way through US courts. A Ukrainian named Oleksandr Didenko has been accused of setting up a freelancing website to connect fake IT workers with stolen identities. Prosecutors say at least one worker was linked to Chapman's laptop farm and that Didenko also has ties to operations in San Diego and Virginia. Didenko was arrested in Poland last year and was extradited to the United States. In Tennessee, 38-year-old Matthew Knoot is due to stand trial for his alleged role in a scheme that investigators say sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to North Korea via his laptop farm in Nashville. (Knoot has pleaded not guilty.) And in January 2025, Florida prosecutors filed charges against two American citizens, Erick Ntekereze Prince and Emanuel Ashtor, as well as a Mexican accomplice and two North Koreans. (None of the defendants' lawyers in these cases responded to requests for comment.) The indictments claim that Prince and Ashtor had spent six years running a string of fake staffing companies that placed North Koreans in at least 64 businesses.

before the hermit kingdom had its laptop farms, it had a single confirmed internet connection, at least as far as the outside world could tell. As recently as 2010, that one link to the web was reserved for use by high-ranking officials. Then, in 2011, 27-year-old Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as the country's dictator. Secretly educated in Switzerland and said to be an avid gamer, the younger Kim made IT a national priority. In 2012, he urged some schools to “pay special attention to intensifying their computer education” to create new possibilities for the government and military. Computer science is now on some high school curricula, while college students can take courses on information security, robotics, and engineering.

The most promising students are taught hacking techniques and foreign languages that can make them more effective operatives. Staff from government agencies including the Reconnaissance General Bureau— the nation's clandestine intelligence service—recruit the highest-scoring graduates of top schools like Kim Chaek University of Technology (described by many as “the MIT of North Korea”) or the prestigious University of Sciences in Pyongsong. They are promised good wages and unfettered access to the internet—the real internet, not the intranet available to well-off North Koreans, which consists of a mere handful of heavily censored North Korean websites.

The earliest cyberattacks launched by Pyongyang were simple affairs: defacing websites with political messages or launching denial-of-service attacks to shut down US websites. They soon grew more audacious. In 2014, North Korean hackers famously stole and leaked confidential information from Sony's film studio. Then they targeted financial institutions: Fraudulent trades pulled more than $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh's accounts at the New York Federal Reserve. After that, North Korean hackers moved into ransomware—the WannaCry attack in 2017 locked hundreds of thousands of Windows computers in 150 countries and demanded payments in bitcoin. While the amount of revenue the attack generated is up for debate—some say it earned just $140,000 in payouts—it wreaked much wider damage as companies worked to upgrade their systems and security, costing as much as $4 billion, according to one estimate.

Governments responded with more sanctions and stronger security measures, and the regime pivoted, dialing back on ransomware in favor of quieter schemes. It turns out these are also more lucrative: Today, the most valuable tool in North Korea's cybercrime armory is cryptocurrency theft. In 2022, hackers stole more than $600 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether by attacking the blockchain game Axie Infinity; in February of this year, they robbed the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit of $1.5 billion worth of digital currency. The IT pretender scam, meanwhile, seems to have been growing slowly until the pandemic dramatically expanded the number of remote jobs, and Pyongyang saw the perfect opportunity.

In 2024, according to a recent report from South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the number of people working in North Korea's cyber divisions—which includes pretenders, crypto thieves, and military hackers—stood at 8,400, up from 6,800 two years earlier. Some of these workers are based in the country, but many are stationed overseas in China, Russia, Pakistan, or elsewhere. They are relatively well compensated, but their posting is hardly cushy.

Teams of 10 to 20 young men live and work out of a single apartment, sleeping four or five to a room and grinding up to 14 hours a day at weird hours to correspond with their remote job's time zone. They have quotas of illicit earnings they are expected to meet. Their movements are tightly controlled, as are those of their relatives, who are effectively held hostage to prevent defections. “You don't have any freedom,” says Hyun-Seung Lee, a North Korean defector who lives in Washington, DC, and says some of his old friends were part of such operations. “You're not allowed to leave the apartment unless you need to purchase something, like grocery shopping, and that is arranged by the team leader. Two or three people must go together so there's no opportunity for them to explore.”

The US government estimates that a typical team of pretenders can earn up to $3 million each year for Pyongyang. Experts say the money is pumped into everything from Kim Jong Un's personal slush fund to the country's nuclear weapons program. A few million dollars may seem small next to the flashy crypto heists— but with so many teams operating in obscurity, the fraud is effective precisely because it is so mundane.

in the summer of 2022, a major multinational company hired a remote engineer to work on website development. “He would dial in to meetings, he would participate in discussions,” an executive at the company told me on condition of anonymity. “His manager said he was considered the most productive member of the team.”

One day, his coworkers organized a surprise to celebrate his birthday. Colleagues gathered on a video call to congratulate him, only to be startled by his response—but it's not my birthday. After nearly a year at the company, the worker had apparently forgotten the birth date listed in his records. It was enough to spark suspicion, and soon afterward the security team discovered that he was running remote access tools on his work computer, and he was let go. It was only later, when federal investigators discovered one of his pay stubs at Christina Chapman's laptop farm in Arizona, that the company connected the dots and realized it had employed a foreign agent for nearly a year.

Agents have even been known to send look-alikes to pick up a physical ID card from an office or to take a drug test required by an employer.

For many pretenders, the goal is simply to earn a good salary to send back to Pyongyang, not so much to steal money or data. “We've seen long-tail operations where they were going 10, 12, 18 months working in some of these organizations,” says Adam Meyers, a senior vice president for counter adversary operations at the security company CrowdStrike. Sometimes, though, North Korean operatives last just a few days— enough time to download huge amounts of company data or plant malicious software in a company's systems before abruptly quitting. That code could alter financial data or manipulate security information. Or these seeds could lay dormant for months, even years.

“The potential risk from even one minute of access to systems is almost unlimited for an individual company,” says Declan Cummings, the head of engineering at software company Cinder. Experts say that attacks are ramping up not just in the US but also in Germany, France, Britain, Japan and other countries. They urge companies to do rigorous due diligence: speak directly to references, watch for candidates making sudden changes of address, use reputable online screening tools, and conduct a physical interview or in-person ID verification.

But none of these methods are foolproof, and AI tools are constantly weakening them. ChatGPT and the like give almost anyone the capacity to answer esoteric questions in real time with unearned confidence, and their fluency with coding threatens to make programming tests irrelevant. AI video filters and deepfakes can also add to the subterfuge.

At an onboarding call, for instance, many HR representatives now ask new employees to hold their ID up to the camera for closer inspection. “But the fraudsters have a neat trick there,” says Donal Greene, a biometrics expert at the online background check provider Certn. They take a green-colored card the exact shape and size of an identity card—a mini green screen—and, using deepfake technology, project the image of an ID onto it. “They can actually move it and show the reflection,” says Greene. “It's very sophisticated.” North Korean agents have even been known to send look-alikes to pick up a physical ID card from an office or to take a drug test required by prospective employers.

Even security experts can be fooled. In July 2024, Knowbe4, a Florida-based company that offers security training, discovered that a new hire known as “Kyle” was actually a foreign agent. “He interviewed great,” says Brian Jack, KnowBe4's chief information security officer. “He was on camera, his résumé was right, his background check cleared, his ID cleared verification. We didn't have any reason to suspect this wasn't a valid candidate.” But when his facilitator—the US-based individual giving him cover—tried to install malware on Kyle's company computer, the security team caught on and shut him out.

Back in london, Simon Wijckmans couldn't let go of the idea that somebody had tried to fool him. He'd just read about the Knowbe4 case, which deepened his suspicions. He conducted background checks and discovered that some of his candidates were definitely using stolen identities. And, he found, some of them were linked to known North Korean operations. So Wijckmans decided to wage a little counter exercise of his own, and he invited me to observe.

So far, everything matches the hallmarks of a fake worker—his virtual background, his slow connection, his good but heavily accented English.

I dial in to Google Meet at 3 am Pacific time, tired and bleary. We deliberately picked this offensively early hour because it's 6 am in Miami, where the candidate, “Harry,” claims to be.

Harry joins the call, looking pretty fresh-faced. He's maybe in his late twenties, with short, straight, black hair. Everything about him seems deliberately nonspecific: He wears a plain black crewneck sweater and speaks into an off-brand headset. “I just woke up early today for this interview, no problem,” he says. “I know that working with UK hours is kind of a requirement, so I can get my working hours to yours, so no problem with it.”

So far, everything matches the hallmarks of a fake worker. Harry's virtual background is one of the default options provided by Google Meet, and his connection is a touch slow. His English is good but heavily accented, even though he tells us he was born in New York and grew up in Brooklyn. Wijckmans starts with some typical interview questions, and Harry keeps glancing off to his right as he responds. He talks about various coding languages and name-drops the frameworks he's familiar with. Wijckmans starts asking some deeper technical questions. Harry pauses. He looks confused. “Can I rejoin the meeting?” he asks. “I have a problem with my microphone.” Wijckman nods, and Harry disappears.

A couple of minutes pass, and I start to fret that we've scared him away, but then he pops back into the meeting. His connection isn't much better, but his answers are clearer. Maybe he restarted his chatbot, or got a coworker to coach him. The call runs a few more minutes and we say goodbye.

Our next applicant calls himself “Nic.” On his résumé he's got a link to a personal website, but this guy doesn't look much like the profile photo on the site. This is his second interview with Wijckmans, and we are certain that he's faking it: He's one of the applicants who failed the background check after his first call, although he doesn't know that.

Nic's English is worse than Harry's: When he's asked what time it is, he tells us it's “six and past” before correcting himself and saying “quarter to seven.” Where does he live? “I'm in Ohio for now,” he beams, like a kid who got something right in a pop quiz.

Several minutes in, though, his answers become nonsensical. Simon asks him a question about web security. “Political leaders ... government officials or the agencies responsible for border security,” Nic says. “They're responsible for monitoring and also securing the borders, so we can employ the personnel to patrol the borders and also check the documents and enforce the immigration laws.”

I'm swapping messages with Wijckmans on the back channel we've set up when it dawns on us: Whatever AI bot Nic seems to be using must have misinterpreted a mention of “Border Gateway Protocol”—a system for sending traffic across the internet—with national borders, and started spewing verbiage about immigration enforcement. “What a waste of time,” Wijckmans messages me. We wrap up the conversation abruptly.

I try to put myself in the seat of a hiring manager or screener who's under pressure. The fraudsters' words may not have always made sense, but their test scores and résumés looked solid, and their technical-sounding guff might be enough to fool an uninformed recruiter. I suspect at least one of them could have made it to the next step in some unsuspecting company's hiring process.

Wijckmans tells me he has a plan if he comes across another pretender. He has created a web page that looks like a standard coding assessment, which he'll send to fake candidates. As soon as they hit the button to start the test, their browser will spawn dozens of pop-up pages that bounce around the screen, all of them featuring information on how to defect from North Korea. Then loud music plays—a rickroll, “The Star-Spangled Banner”—before the computer starts downloading random files and emits an ear-splitting beep. “Just a little payback,” he says.

Wijckman's stunt is not going to stop the pretenders, of course. But maybe it will irritate them for a moment. Then they'll get back to work, signing on from some hacking sweatshop in China or through a laptop farm in the US, and join the next team meeting—a quiet, camera-off chat with coworkers just like me or you.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Sam Altman's Eye-Scanning Orb Is Now Coming to the US","https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-eyeball-scan-launch-us/","Thu, 01 May 2025 02:24:31 GMT","

Sam Altman's iris-scanning, identify-verification technology startup says it will begin expanding to the US starting May 1 and will launch a phone-like hardware device by next year. Those changes—and a promised World-branded debit card—signal the company's ambitions to develop a “super app”—a goal shared by Elon Musk.

Altman and Alex Blania, a German physics researcher, announced at an event in San Francisco Wednesday evening that their venture-backed company, Tools for Humanity, is updating its “World” products to include a new, smaller, eye-scanning orb. The device-and-app combo scans people's irises, creates a unique user ID, stores that information on the blockchain, and uses it as a form of identity verification. If enough people adopt the app globally, the thinking goes, it could ostensibly thwart scammers.

Altman has expressed concern about the amount of fakery that new AI tools will enable, including the generative AI tools pioneered by his other startup, OpenAI, which is valued at $300 billion. So the World app, and its hardware component, are Altman's solution to the problem.

“Proving personhood” is a hard thing to productize, and whiffs of a scam have plagued the startup since it launched. The project has also been scrutinized by foreign governments for its biometric data-capture and storage policies. But Altman and Blania haven't been deterred.

The bizarre identity verification process requires that users get their eyeballs scanned, so Tools for Humanity is expanding its physical footprint to make that a possibility. The company will open six Apple-like stores in cities across the US, including one in San Francisco, where the floor around a wooden structure holding about eight orbs was being polished on Wednesday night. The orbs will also be accessible in Razer stores. Future scanning sites could include cafes and college campuses, the company said.

World first launched as Worldcoin in July 2024, the brainchild of Altman, Blania, and Max Novendstern, who is no longer at the company. Blania serves as CEO, while Altman remains his most prominent backer. As of March 2025 the company had raised $240 million in venture capital funding from big-name firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Bain Capital, and Coinbase Ventures, as well as individual investors like Reid Hoffman and the now-imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried.

World's network of users has “nearly doubled” in size in the last six months to roughly 26 million, the startup claims, and 12 million users have been verified with the orb. The company says it expects to generate revenue starting later this year through fees paid by apps that benefit from having users' identities verified.

At the event on Wednesday—in a crowd filled with founders, engineers, and paid-to-attend-influencers—World said that it's opening an Orb assembly line in Richardson, Texas with a US manufacturer, and estimates there will be a total of “7,500 orbs across the US by the end of this year.” But World wants to scale it beyond that, it said, and put more orbs “in the hands of the people.”

The startup's solution to that is the Orb mini, a portable handheld device with two large camera “eyes” on it that will scan people's irises on the go. This means this Orb is not actually an orb, in case the enterprise wasn't weird enough. (Blania and Altman showed off the new device onstage, but journalists and other attendees didn't have the opportunity to demo it.) The device is expected to ship in 2026.

At the event Wednesday night, World announced a World-branded, Visa-backed debit card that it plans to launch in the US later this year. The card is supposed to be a bridge between the kind of crypto tokens that World issues and standard fiat-backed currencies. The company says the debit card will let you spend your World currency at any location where Visas are accepted. Card users “may earn enhanced rewards on their AI subscriptions and services,” the company said, which could encourage signups of services like ChatGPT Plus, the $20 a month upgrade from OpenAI.

Oddly enough, World's official announcement around this Visa card twice refers to it as a “proposed” product: “This proposed card and rewards program will be a first-of-its-kind – optimized for the AI era.” Spokespeople for Tools for Humanity and Visa did not respond to inquiries about what this means.

The World mobile app is being updated to support more financial transactions, the company says, in an effort to make it useful for people who aren't steeped in crypto. The new version will support more stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat currency. The company is also partnering with the payments processor Stripe so that people can use the World app to make payments on Stripe-supported websites.

The app offers access to a number of what it calls third-party “mini apps” that let people put their newly verified identity or freshly minted coins to work, including by playing games like Wordle against verified humans. Among the new options World announced on Wednesday was access to prediction betting app Kalshi.

World and Match Group also announced they're pairing up on a pilot project in Japan so Tinder users can verify their identity using World's technology. The goal is to combat the rise of dating app scams. As with almost all of the other World use cases, this will require a person to not only be signed up for the World app, but to go through the process of sharing their biometric data in order to be officially verified. (Once a person is verified by staring into the void of an Orb device, the app indicates that their personal data has been wiped from the device itself.)

The identity problems that Altman and Blania are looking to solve are legitimate—particularly in an era when AI tools are being used in an ever-increasing number of scams. But World is also a for-profit cryptocurrency company that wants to build a borderless, “globally inclusive” financial network. And its approach has been criticized by privacy advocates and regulators. In its early days, World was explicitly marketing its services to countries with a high percentage of unbanked or underbanked citizens, and offering free crypto as an incentive for people to sign up and have their irises scanned.

Brazil and Hong Kong have banned Worldcoin or features associated with the service. Kenya, Portugal, and Spain all instituted temporary restrictions after World rolled out in those countries. The ban in Kenya lasted a full year, after a parliamentary committee found the company had violated Kenyan data-regulation rules.

Even with its expansion into the US, there appear to be roadblocks. The fine print on World's announcement says that World is “not available for distribution via World App to people, companies or organizations who are residents of, or are located or incorporated in the State of New York or other restricted territories.” World has not yet responded to inquiries about why it apparently won't operate in New York. At the time of writing, New York's Department of Financial Services had not yet responded to WIRED's request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Apple May Face Criminal Charges for Allegedly Lying to a Federal Judge","https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-judge-asks-doj-prosecute-apple/","Thu, 01 May 2025 00:20:26 GMT","

Apple “willfully chose not to comply” with a court order to loosen its app store restrictions—and one of its executives lied under oath about the company's plans, a federal judge wrote on Wednesday.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has referred the situation to the US Attorney's Office in San Francisco “to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.”

In 2021, Gonzalez Rogers presided over a lawsuit brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games over the iPhone maker's allegedly anticompetitive practices that hampered the ability of developers to generate revenue from the App Store. This included Apple's policy of taking a 30 percent commission on certain in-app purchases.

While Gonzalez Rogers ultimately ruled in favor of Apple on most counts, she ordered the company to begin allowing developers to market ways to make in-app purchases outside of the App Store ecosystem. Apple responded by lowering its commission to 27 percent on purchases made elsewhere, but it also introduced a series of other changes, including showing so-called scare screens, to dissuade users from making purchases outside its ecosystem.

Last year, Epic challenged in court how Apple was responding to the order, leading Gonzalez Rogers to require the tech giant to turn over documents that contributed to Wednesday's contempt ruling.

Apple pursued its noncompliance strategy “with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. “That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.”

She also said that Apple executives tried to hide the real motivations for the changes. “In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” Gonzalez Rogers said. She went as far as accusing Alex Roman, a vice president of finance at Apple, of lying during testimony in which he talked about how Apple came to its decision to go with a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store. “The testimony of Mr. Roman was replete with misdirection and outright lies,” the judge said.

“We strongly disagree with the decision,”  Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement to WIRED. ""We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal."" Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Citing internal Apple documents from 2023, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple's App Store chief Phillip Schiller “had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction” but that CEO Tim Cook “ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.”

The judge demanded that Apple immediately comply with her earlier order. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition.”

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X that the new ruling would bring an end to “Apple's 15-30% junk fees.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump's Quest for Crypto Riches Is a Constitutional Scandal Waiting to Happen","https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-quest-for-crypto-riches-is-a-constitutional-scandal-waiting-to-happen/","Thu, 01 May 2025 11:19:03 GMT","

When Donald Trump agreed to attend a dinner with the largest investors in his own-brand cryptocurrency, he transformed the TRUMP coin into something else entirely: a means of access to the sitting president. As a consequence, Trump could find himself at odds with constitutional prohibitions of bribery and corruption, experts claim.

Trump's dinner announcement on April 23 instigated a trading frenzy that, on paper, added hundreds of millions of dollars to his net worth. Two subsidiaries of the Trump Organization, a conglomerate owned by the president, control 80 percent of the total supply of the coin, which shot up in price by almost 60 percent after the announcement. Those subsidiaries also profit from any surge in trading volume as rent-seeking intermediaries.

However, the dinner maneuver may have political consequences for Trump. In creating the opportunity for anybody with sufficient wealth to purchase an audience, Trump risks falling foul of a part of the US Constitution—the emoluments clauses—that prohibit the president from accepting gifts or financial compensation from foreign and domestic state actors. In a worst-case scenario for the president, the potential for negative optics could add fuel to calls for his impeachment.

“Trump has built an entire life prodding the border of what a powerful person can get away with,” claims Jeff Hauser, executive director at the Revolving Door Project, an organization that seeks to scrutinize the behavior of elected officials. “But at some point in time, he could push a little too far and it comes back on him. This [dinner] has the possibility of being that.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump announced his coin on January 18, a few days prior to his inauguration. At the time, he pitched it as a memecoin, a type of asset whose only purpose is to enable financial speculation. The price of memecoins tends to whipsaw dramatically with swings in public sentiment toward the person, meme, or concept they are based upon.

The dinner gambit puts the TRUMP coin in a different class entirely. In establishing an explicit quid pro quo—a large investment in exchange for an audience—the maneuver has effectively turned TRUMP into a utility coin, an asset that bestows on holders some perk or advantage.

That change was immediately felt in the markets, when the price of TRUMP surged in the hour after the dinner was announced. The expectation of further opportunities to spend time with Trump may continue to prop up the price.

“The door to utility has been opened. The market will expect further utility to come from holding that coin,” says Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon. “Before, you were speculating on a TRUMP coin with no utility. Now you're speculating on future access to Trump. That has to be worth a bit more money.”

The act of transmuting his cryptocurrency into a utility coin is unlikely to have immediate regulatory implications for Trump. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial regulator that policed the crypto industry most tightly under the Biden administration, made clear that it does not consider memecoins to fall within its jurisdiction. Likewise, during Trump's first term, the agency reached a similar conclusion about utility coins.

“Whether it's a utility token or a memecoin, it's not regulated by the SEC,” says Lisa Bragança, attorney at Bragança Law and former branch chief at the SEC. Therefore, to avoid the attention of regulators, Trump need only refrain from fraud and unfair trade practices, she says.

However, experts wonder whether it could have legal implications. Though critics have argued from the beginning that TRUMP could create a pathway for bribery—by investing large sums into the coin, driving up its price, politically motivated actors could theoretically curry favor with the president—the dinner brings the risk of violating emoluments restrictions into stark relief.

“If the government of Yemen buys up oodles of memecoins, we won't know,” says Bragança. “If it's a utility coin and, say, a representative of Russia shows up for dinner with the president, we know it's an emoluments issue.”

Today, access to the sitting US president carries a greater potential political currency than ever. “Trump is amalgamating even more power in the executive branch than anyone has before,” claims Hauser. “With ever greater power comes a larger warehouse of favors that can be sold.”

At present, the names of the TRUMP holders set to win a place at the dinner are concealed behind pseudonyms and alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses. The White House did not respond when asked whether the attendee list will be made public.

Whether Trump would face any consequences for theoretically violating foreign emoluments laws depends on the strength of his grip on Congress, the political class tasked with upholding the Constitution, including through impeachment.

In the halls of Congress, calls for Trump's impeachment are already growing. “He is granting audiences to people who buy the memecoin that directly enriches him,” said Democrat senator Jon Ossoff in a town hall meeting on April 25. “There is no doubt that this president's conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.”

For now, the Republican congressional majority and Trump's command of his party mean impeachment calls are unlikely to go anywhere. Equally, Trump has previously prevailed in multiple lawsuits alleging that he violated emoluments clauses during his first time in connection with his hotel business, which were later dismissed.

“The violation of the Constitution should be a big deal, but how to make it consequential is challenging,” says Hauser. “Right now, Trump rules the Republican party with such an iron hand that the notion of a successful impeachment leading to a guilty verdict is just somewhat fanciful.”

However, in its potential to paint Trump in an unflattering light—as a president who puts his own financial interests over those of the nation—the TRUMP coin dinner could contribute to shifting the dial. With the midterm elections only a year away and the Republican House majority only slim, public perception matters.

“The opportunity for corruption is not meaningfully changed by the dinner. But the optics are potentially much worse for Trump,” says Hauser. “The unseemliness changes the odds of there being any ramifications to Trump violating the emoluments clause. It creates more vulnerability.”

According to a new, brow-raising WSJ report, Tesla's board quietly began searching for Elon Musk's potential successor about a month ago, approaching executive search firms as the carmaker faced protests, plummeting sales, and shrinking profits while Musk waded into Washington to slash government spending.

Board members reportedly met with Musk to express concerns about his divided attention, telling him he needed to spend more time on Tesla and to publicly commit to doing so; per the Journal report, Musk didn't push back and subsequently told investors he would “allocate far more time to Tesla” starting in May.

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a statement released overnight that it was “absolutely false” that the company approached recruitment firms. She also claimed “this was communicated to the media before the report was published.” Musk shared the statement and argued it was an “EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS.” The WSJ has since said Tesla never responded to the reporters' questions.

Musk's government work led to Tesla's first annual sales decline in over a decade; it also tarnished the company's brand image among some consumers due to his political alignment. The impact has been fast and furious: Tesla's market value dropped from $1.5 trillion in December to about $900 billion currently.

Despite these challenges, Musk sounded optimistic about Tesla's future during last week's earnings call, where the company reported a 71% profit decline and 9% revenue drop.”We're not on the ragged edge of death,” Musk assured investors, “not even close.”

The current status of the succession planning remains unclear, according to the Journal. It adds that it's unclear whether Musk, who has run Tesla for nearly 20 years, was aware of the effort.

This story has been updated to include statements from Tesla and the WSJ.

Epic Games has notched a win in an ongoing legal dispute with Apple, as a result of which Fortnite could return to the U.S. iOS App Store as early as next week.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in a ruling on Wednesday that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction that prohibited the company from imposing anticompetitive pricing.

Apple won many of the arguments in the trial with Epic Games. One notable exception was a ruling prohibiting the iPhone maker from collecting fees on purchases made outside of apps. At the time, Apple was told to change its app store to allow developers to direct customers to their websites, where users could then make purchases.

Per the ruling, Apple not only failed to comply, it did so “willfully” and with the intent of creating new anticompetitive barriers.

“That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple,” Rogers said in the ruling. She went a step further and referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to review it for possible criminal contempt proceedings.

An Apple spokesperson said the company would fight the court's decision, saying “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.” 

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took to X to announce his company would bring Fortnite back to the U.S. App Store as soon as next week.

As The Verge reported, Sweeney also extended a proposal to Apple: “If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,” he wrote.

The ruling was celebrated by other tech companies affected by Apple's policy. “This landmark court ruling is a victory for developers everywhere,” Spotify Spokesperson Jeanne Moran said in an emailed statement. “Spotify will move quickly to submit an app update to Apple, enhancing the experience for our consumers across the United States.”

After nearly 13 years in business, Fivetran will now be able to offer its customers an end-to-end data movement solution.

Fivetran, which helps enterprises move data from a variety of sources into cloud databases, announced on Thursday it has acquired Census, a reverse extract, transform, and load (ETL) platform that enables companies to transfer data out of databases and into operational tools. Census was founded in 2018 and raised more than $80 million in venture funding from firms including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Tiger Global.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Census was last valued at $630 million in 2022. Once the acquisition closes, the entire Census team will migrate over to Fivetran and the Census brand will eventually be integrated into the Fivetran platform.

George Fraser, the co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, told TechCrunch that the deal made sense for Fivetran for a lot of reasons. For one, customers have been asking Fivetran for a reverse ETL solution for years.

The company thought about developing an offering of its own, going so far as to build a prototype. But Fraser said Fivetran realized it would be a better use of resources to bring on a company that had already figured it out instead.

“Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they're actually pretty different,” Fraser said. “You have to solve a pretty different set of problems in order to do this.”

Once Fivetran decided it made more sense to add reverse ETL via an acquisition, Census was a natural choice, Fraser said, because the two companies shared many of the same customers and the two platforms are very similar stylistically.

“People who like Fivetran, as compared to Informatica or building their own connectors, they are going to be people who also like Census,” Fraser said. “The two products make broadly similar philosophical choices, and so they tend to appeal to the same customers, which is very important when you're thinking about synergy.”

It didn't hurt that the founding teams of Census and Fivetran go way back, either. Fraser said he met the Census team, which includes CEO Boris Jabes and Anton Vaynshtok, during Y Combinator's 2013 winter batch.

Fraser and his co-founder, Taylor Brown, were going through the YC program while Jabes and Vaynshtok were building Meldium, a password and account management system, that was acquired by LogMeIn in 2014. They all stayed in touch and even talked about Census as a concept years before the company was founded. 

Now, close to a decade later, everything is coming under one roof.

“We talked to the Census founders about their idea before they even started the company, and Taylor [Brown] and I joked at the time that it might end up in an acquisition, because there's a lot of synergy between the two things,” Fraser said. “In some ways, this has been fated, I think.”

Google is expanding access to AI Mode, its experimental feature that allows users to ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search. The tech giant is also adding more functionality to the feature, including the ability to pick up where you left off on a search.

Google launched AI Mode back in March as a way to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search. The updates announced today are designed to allow AI Mode to better compete with the aforementioned services.

With this expansion, Google is getting rid of the waitlist for AI Mode. Now, anyone in the U.S. who is at least 18 years old can access the feature if they're enrolled in Labs, Google's experimental arm. 

Google is also going to make AI Mode accessible outside of Labs, as it's testing an AI Mode tab in Google Search that will be visible to a small percentage of people in the U.S.

As for the new functionality, Google is making it possible to go a step beyond asking detailed questions about places and products. Now, you can use AI mode to do things like find a new restaurant or things you need for your next trip. You will now start to see visual place and product cards in AI Mode that you can tap on to get more details.

When looking at local spots like restaurants or salons, you can quickly see info like ratings, reviews, and opening hours. For products, you will be able to see details like real-time prices and promotions, images, shipping details, and local inventory. 

For example, if you're searching for the best vintage shops with mid-century modern furniture, AI Mode can highlight nearby stores, provide real-time details like how busy they are, and let you quickly call or get directions. 

Or, if you're planning a camping trip, you try searching for something like “best foldable camping chair that would fit in a backpack for under $100.” AI Mode will then give you a breakdown of recommended products, alongside product details and links to retailers.  

Google is also making it possible to pick up where you left off when using AI Mode, which should be helpful in cases where you're working on longer-running projects and tasks. On desktop, you can now click the new left-side panel in AI Mode to get to your past searches to see the information you were already given, and to ask follow-up questions.

Epic Games is taking a victory lap. After notching a big win against Apple in a years-long legal dispute, Epic announced that its Epic Games Store will allow developers to open webshops, which can offer players out-of-app purchases to circumvent fees from Apple and Google.

Epic has been in a long legal battle with Apple over its iOS App Store fees, which take 30% of a developer's earnings. A judge had ruled in 2021 that Apple couldn't stop developers from directing customers to buy digital goods outside of the Apple ecosystem. But Wednesday night, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in a seething filing that Apple was intentionally violating her 2021 ruling. 

Now, Epic is bringing its flagship game Fortnite back to the iOS App Store, where it will incentivize users to buy Fortnite's digital goods through Epic directly, since they'll get a better price.

With the Epic Games Store's new webshops feature, other developers will be more easily able to follow suit.

Usually, Epic takes a 12% share of a developer's earnings from the Epic Games Store, which is still a better deal than what developers get from Apple. But starting in June, Epic Games will not take a cut from the first $1 million each game earns annually. Only after a game eclipses $1 million in revenue will Epic begin taking a cut. 

“With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States,” Epic said.

If you are going to use these on a computer at all you need some sort of high refresh mode. Things like scrolling and typing are just way too annoying without it.

In fact there already are some projects of eInk-orientd OSes (e.g. MuditaOS). I don't know how good they really are though.

I hate scrolling and hardly ever scroll really - I just use multiple vertical displays to fit every page fully, only switching pages. Surely this whole discussion thread can't be fit in a screen but I'm perfectly comfortable ""scrolling"" it with PgDn.I'm used to slow-response typing (waiting for seconds before a word I typed appears when using modern software on old PCs). In fact I don't even look at the screen when I type until I finish a sentence - despite typing fairly fast I have a habit of looking at the keyboard. I don't mean this is a right way to type yet it proves seeing characters displayed immediately is not essential.

Slow monochrome eInk panels have been around for 2 decades.

Only the regions which actually change are supposed to redraw. 1 Hz doesn't mean the whole panel is fully reset 60 times every minute, only that it takes a second to display a change.

The biggest cons for me are:- without using the backlight, the battery lasts on the order of days vs e-ink which can last on the order of weeks or longer. With the backlight I can drain it in a day.- The display is not as reflective as traditional e-ink, so there are lots of lighing environments where e-ink can be comfortably used without a backlight, but the Daylight would be difficult to use. Natural outdoor daylight (as the name suggests) or well lit indoor environments are perfectly fine to get away without the backlight though.- The lack of a camera can lead to tricky situations sometimes. I have to use an alternative client for Signal (Molly) to be able to use it as my primary device, because the Signal app requires you scan a QR code to pair with a desktop. USB cameras are arbitrarily blocked too, I tried.For me, the fact that it's smooth enough to be able to watch videos without a hiccup, be smooth for any kind of input, and treats me like an adult out-weigh the cons. I use it more than any other computer, but I also don't feel the same attachment to it like I used to have with my phone. It's great and I highly recommend it if you can afford it.

My first thought was ‘this already existed, I could have bought virtually the same product already.' …Which the article acknowledges even. Odd title.I really wish that e-ink could be unshackled.

My smart[ish] watch has an e-ink display. I'd love to see more products and more competition in the space, but sadly that doesn't seem like it'll happen.

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

China has once again beat everyone else to a clean energy milestone—its new nuclear reactor is reportedly one of the first to use thorium instead of uranium as a fuel and the first of its kind that can be refueled while it's running.

Global shifts, advancing tech, and data center demand: Here's what's coming in 2025 and beyond.

It's an interesting (if decidedly experimental) development out of a country that's edging toward becoming the world leader in nuclear energy. China has now surpassed France in terms of generation, though not capacity; it still lags behind the US in both categories. But one recurring theme in media coverage about the reactor struck me, because it's so familiar: This technology was invented decades ago, and then abandoned.

You can basically copy and paste that line into countless stories about today's advanced reactor technology. Molten-salt cooling systems? Invented in the mid-20th century but never commercialized. Same for several alternative fuels, like TRISO. And, of course, there's thorium.

This one research reactor in China running with an alternative fuel says a lot about this moment for nuclear energy technology: Many groups are looking into the past for technologies, with a new appetite for building them.

First, it's important to note that China is the hot spot for nuclear energy right now. While the US still has the most operational reactors in the world, China is catching up quickly. The country is building reactors at a remarkable clip and currently has more reactors under construction than any other country by far. Just this week, China approved 10 new reactors, totaling over $27 billion in investment.

China is also leading the way for some advanced reactor technologies (that category includes basically anything that deviates from the standard blueprint of what's on the grid today: large reactors that use enriched uranium for fuel and high-pressure water to keep the reactor cool). High-temperature reactors that use gas as a coolant are one major area of focus for China—a few reactors that use this technology have recently started up, and more are in the planning stages or under construction.

Now, Chinese state media is reporting that scientists in the country reached a milestone with a thorium-based reactor. The reactor came online in June 2024, but researchers say it recently went through refueling without shutting down. (Conventional reactors generally need to be stopped to replenish the fuel supply.) The project's lead scientists shared the results during a closed meeting at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I'll emphasize here that this isn't some massive power plant: This reactor is tiny. It generates just two megawatts of heat—less than the research reactor on MIT's campus, which rings in at six megawatts. (To be fair, MIT's is one of the largest university research reactors in the US, but still … it's small.)

Regardless, progress is progress for thorium reactors, as the world has been entirely focused on uranium for the last 50 years or so.

Much of the original research on thorium came out of the US, which pumped resources into all sorts of different reactor technologies in the 1950s and '60s. A reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee that ran in the 1960s used Uranium-233 fuel (which can be generated when thorium is bombarded with radiation).

Eventually, though, the world more or less settled on a blueprint for nuclear reactors, focusing on those that use Uranium-238 as fuel and are cooled by water at a high pressure. One reason for the focus on uranium for energy tech? The research could also be applied to nuclear weapons.

The company's technology could usher in a new era of reactors that are cheaper and safer to operate.

But now there's a renewed interest in alternative nuclear technologies, and the thorium-fueled reactor is just one of several examples. A prominent one we've covered before: Kairos Power is building reactors that use molten salt as a coolant for small nuclear reactors, also a technology invented and developed in the 1950s and '60s before being abandoned. 

Another old-but-new concept is using high-temperature gas to cool reactors, as X-energy is aiming to do in its proposed power station at a chemical plant in Texas. (That reactor will be able to be refueled while it's running, like the new thorium reactor.) 

Some problems from decades ago that contributed to technologies being abandoned will still need to be dealt with today. In the case of molten-salt reactors, for example, it can be tricky to find materials that can withstand the corrosive properties of super-hot salt. For thorium reactors, the process of transforming thorium into U-233 fuel has historically been one of the hurdles. 

But as early progress shows, the archives could provide fodder for new commercial reactors, and revisiting these old ideas could give the nuclear industry a much-needed boost.

Last year, D23 wowed collectors with one of the coolest Star Wars toys we'd seen in a very long time: a massive, 3.75″-figure-scaled replica of the original ride vehicle from Star Tours, the StarSpeeder 3000, that could seat 25 figures and even included a video screen playing back parts of the iconic Disney ride. But if your memory of Star Tours leans a little towards its modern rejuvenation (itself nearly a decade-and-a-half old now!), then this weekend you're going to be in luck.

io9 has got your exclusive first look at the return of the excellent Star Tours Starspeeder toy as part of the Disney Store's Star Wars Day offerings for May 4 this year. Except, this time the electronically-enhanced vehicle has a brand new orange-hued paint job, reflecting it as a replica of the StarSpeeder 1000, the cosmetic update given to the ride vehicle when Star Tours evolved into The Adventures Continue in 2011, updating the ride experience to incorporate new footage inspired by locations from the prequel trilogy as well as the original saga.

Aside from the new paint job–and a matching new piece of box art inspired by The Adventures Continue–the toy remains largely the same as the one that debuted at D23 last year with some minor changes. The ship still features a display stand, as well as seats to hold up to 25 3.75″-scaled figures (complete with those all-important seatbelts!), and a suite of electronic enhancements, including opening doors that play the classic chime from the ride, lights in the display stand as well as the headlights, thrusters, and cannons on the ship itself, and a 4.75″ LCD screen housed at the front of the StarSpeeder's interior that plays authentic Star Tours ride sequence footage (although as of writing, whether this has been updated to include Adventures Continue footage, compared to the classic Star Tours footage found in the StarSpeeder 3000 toy, remains to be seen).

One key difference is that while the StarSpeeder 3000 playset featured a suite of voice phrases from the beloved original Star Tours droid pilot, Captain Rex, the 1000 will further reflect Adventures Continue by featuring lines from C-3PO, who took over in the refresh as Star Tours' latest unwitting pilot. This is also reflected in the included figures, which will feature an R2-D2 and C-3PO from the ‘Droid Factory' 3.75″ figure line Disney sells in the parks, replacing the Captain Rex included in the D23 StarSpeeder 3000 release.

At least this time you won't have to make the trek to an event like D23 to get your hands on the vehicle this time. The Star Tours: The Adventures Continue StarSpeeder 1000 play set will be available from direct from the Disney Store at this link starting from 11am ET/8am PT this Sunday, May 4.

Welcome to the era of $80 games. Xbox is the first major game publisher after Nintendo to promise a sweeping price increase for its entire portfolio, save for Game Pass. Consoles, controllers, and other accessories will cost more, but the real cherry on top is the promise that some of the company's first-party games will start at $80 later this year. It sounds like the sort of thing that would hurt sales, but all it really means is Xbox will push Game Pass even harder than before.

In a note published to the Xbox support site, Microsoft detailed a new pricing structure it's recommending to retailers. Starting Thursday, May 1, all Xbox consoles will see price increases. The Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage increases from $300 to $380, and a 1TB version jumps from $350 to $430. An Xbox Series X Digital console now costs $550 compared to its previous $450, and the model with an optical drive now costs $600, $100 more than its previous $500 MSRP. An Xbox Series X Galaxy Black Special Edition with a 2TB SSD now runs $730, or $120 more than its previous $600 price tag, and even more than a $700 PlayStation 5 Pro.

The Xbox Wireless Controller, which remains a staple for both console and PC gaming, now costs $65. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller now starts at $150, up from $145. The official Xbox Wireless Headset will set you back $120, $10 more than before. Microsoft's gaming hardware will see price hikes outside the U.S. as well.

First-party Xbox games will hit the $80 price point “this holiday season,” according to Xbox. Microsoft's gaming brand is the first to jack up prices since Nintendo introduced its $70, $80, and $90 pricing structure for first-party Switch 2 titles. It's only a matter of time before other major publishers take the hint and raise their prices as well.

“We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,” the company wrote on its support page. Gizmodo reached out to Xbox for comment on whether this had anything to do with Trump's tariffs, but we did not immediately hear back.

As much as Xbox wants to point the finger at market conditions, the game price gouging has been a long time coming. Major publishers have been gnashing their teeth for years over how game prices have not increased with inflation. For instance, Halo: Combat Evolved retailed for $50 back in 2001, equivalent to $91 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation. However, publishers have been looking hard at Nintendo and its Switch 2 pricing. The Japanese console maker is promoting digital editions of Donkey Kong Bananza at $70 and Mario Kart World at $80. The Switch 2 is already sold out in most shops that are doing preorders, which is likely indicating to the industry that players are willing to bite the bullet on more expensive games.

Xbox Game Pass remains the only service that's not going up in price. Last year, Microsoft changed up its gaming subscription service, increased the cost of most tiers, and nixed access to day-one games from its lower-priced console tier. With more expensive games on the horizon, Game Pass may look like an even better deal than before, but Microsoft can always change its policies in the future.

If it isn't clear already, Microsoft's Game Pass will be its bread and butter going forward. Xbox is no longer interested in using hardware to push exclusive titles. This month, it brought once-exclusive games like Forza Horizon 5 to PlayStation 5. Xbox head Phil Spencer recently said he would put Game Pass on Nintendo and Sony platforms if he's given the opportunity.

Based on Microsoft's Q3 earnings report released this week, Xbox hardware sales were already down compared to the rest of its portfolio. Meanwhile, revenue from Xbox “services,” namely Game Pass, was up by 8% year-over-year. Microsoft now sees Xbox as a service model, and hardware will inevitably fall by the wayside. Rather than make a handheld itself, Microsoft will partner with hardware experts like Asus on an Xbox handheld. Higher prices on all hardware and games, even those from other publishers and console makers, will inevitably push more people to Game Pass. In that way, the entire games industry is feeding into Microsoft's hands.

          You won't just be haggling over Nintendo Switch 2's $450 price tag or $80 games, but its limited storage space.
        


          Be careful: Cheaper Switch 2 gear like the new GameCube controller or Hori's third-party cameras may not work exactly as you think.
        


          GameStop's Switch 2 preorders page shows the console is now sold out, though you should check your orders page in case you got lucky.
        


          Judging by these sales numbers, the U.S. Switch 2 preorder scene will be hectic midnight on Thursday.
        


          GameStop will give you less money if you trade in an original Switch that suffers from Joy-Con drift or has any blemishes.

Remember that short period of time when phone sizes actually trended downward each year? We wanted smaller and smaller phones. We wanted a device that could easily fit in our pockets and be unobtrusive to the rest of their lives. It was only when phones became smart that screen sizes started trending upwards again. It makes sense that folks would want to have a larger display when their entire lives exist on that screen as social media grew and phone cameras became more powerful.

And yet, all the benefits to having a tiny phone that existed prior are still there. We've just decided that the benefits of a big one outweigh the benefits of a small one. But maybe you don't think that way. Maybe all you need is something small that fits in your pocket without issue. That's where this NanoPhone comes into play — a miniaturized smartphone currently 55% at just $90.

See at StackSocial

This fully functional smartphone comes in an incredibly compact design. Its touchscreen is only 3 inches across, but is still HD. The phone weights under three ounces and can fit easily in just about any pocket or handbag. I mean, I supposed all smartphones are designed to fit in a pocket but this one can fit comfortably in your pocket.

The cameras are powerful with a 5 MP lens on the rear, and a 2 MP on the front for selfies and video calls. The phone has a 2,000mAh battery to last you awhile and can be recharged with the standard USB-C charging port.

The phone is SIM card-ready, supporting 4G LTE and data plans with most cellular providers — able to be used with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and all other US carriers including budget and no-contract service providers such as Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint. The interface runs Android 10 so that means it is compatible with all your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and more.

Inside the box, you'll find the NanoPhone unit itself, a screen protector, a protective phone case, the SIM tray ejector, a charge cable, and instructions.

Not only is this phone small in size, but it's also small in price. Most phones nowadays will run you over a thousand dollars in many cases. That's just an absurd amount of money to have to spend on something that's pretty much a basic need in modern life. Well, you can still fill that need but do it while only spending $90. That's right, the NanoPhone — which is normally priced at $200 — is currently being sold for 55% off over at StackSocial.

Flowers are pretty. I don't believe that to be a controversial statement. They can brighten any room, adding some color to even the dullest of environments. And yet, there's one glaring matter that can get in the way of you incorporating flowers into the decor of your home.

They die.

Over time, flowers will wither away into nothing but a dried up or soggy mess before they need to be tossed away. Tossed outside in the dirt where they decompose into nothing. So if you're trying to build an aesthetic around the floral centerpiece on your coffee table, good luck. You'll be buying a new bouquet every couple of weeks. Or, you can get something better. This Lego Icons flower bouquet building set of artificial flowers can become a permanent staple of any room in your house. This decorative floral arrangement of plastic pieces is even on sale. Normally the set goes for $60, but right now you can save 20%. That brings the price to just $48, a mark down for $12.

See at Amazon

The Lego flower set doesn't just act as a lovely display. It's also a fun activity you and your mother can do together for Mother's Day. The set contains 756 pieces for your and Mom to assemble. Or just get it for yourself. There's nothing quite like popping on a playlist or podcast, kicking back and putting together some Lego. It's pretty mindful and therapeutic as you put this cool thing together in front of you while your mind wanders and your real-life stressors momentarily go away. And then at the end, you have a fun little display to put on your shelf or table.

The Lego set contains 15 stems with flowers and leaf varieties that include roses, snapdragons, poppies, asters, daisies, and different sorts of grasses. Realistic petal shapes make each flower unmistakable from their real life counterparts. Each stem comes in a variety of lengths. The snapdragon measures in at the longest at a length of over 14 inches.

The petals and leaves are all posable and the lengths can be adjusted so you can assemble the bouquet to your exact liking.

The Lego Icons flower bouquet is part of a larger botanical collection. The flowers in this set can be combined with those from other sets including Wildflower Bouquet (10313), Dried Flower Centerpiece (10314), and Orchid (10311). This one is 10280 for reference.

For a limited time, you can save 20% on this Lego Icons flower bouquet building set. Get your own Lego floral arrangement for just $48.

Elon Musk may be leaving Washington D.C., but his DOGE initiative continues to rampage through the government, causing chaos and cutting vital federal programs that millions of Americans rely on.

Case in point: Wired now reports that the initiative has hired a “young man with no government experience” to help revise federal regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That man, Christopher Sweet, hasn't even completed his undergraduate degree yet, the outlet claims.

Wired cites internal emails and people with knowledge of Sweet's recruitment show how he was recently welcomed onboard at the agency: “I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,'” an email sent by DOGE staffer Scott Lanmack reads. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”

Sweet's role with the government will apparently involve an effort to use software to revise and downsize government regulations at the housing agency. The outlet writes:

Sweet's primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD's regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD's data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)

Sweet's recruitment is very much in line with DOGE's overall modus operandi, which seems to be this: hire young, expendable tech nerds who don't know what they're doing, hurl them into legally sketchy activities that involve complex government processes, watch them flail and tell the public what a great job they're doing. Indeed, DOGE's army of pimply-faced government deconstructionists often seems so out of their depth that it's a wonder that Washington D.C. isn't literally on fire right now. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Elon Musk admitted the initiative has fallen far short of his promise to cut $2 trillion in spending and had made many mistakes. “I think we're probably getting things right 70-80% of the time,” he said. That's not a great hit rate when millions of people's lives depend on government programs.

All of it seems to support the working theory that DOGE isn't really interested in making the government more efficient, but is actually trying to destroy a large number of agencies. Such a mandate would better align it with the policy blueprint laid out during Trump's campaign: the right-wing libertarian Project 2025, which has sought to cut all but bare necessities of government.

Further supporting this theory is the fact that, despite DOGE's apparent mission to cut government spending, the U.S. spent $220 billion more during Trump's first 100 days compared to the spending rates during the same period in 2024.

Two astronauts are gearing up for some orbital maintenance work outside the International Space Station (ISS) during a rare all-woman spacewalk.

NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers are set to begin their spacewalk on Thursday at 8 a.m. ET, exiting the space station for a planned six hours and 35 minutes. NASA will broadcast the spacewalk live on NASA+ and the agency's YouTube channel. You can also tune in through the live feed below.

During their spacewalk, the astronauts will work to relocate a space station communications antenna and install a mounting bracket ahead of the installation of an additional set of ISS Rollout Solar Arrays, also called IROSA. The arrays will be installed during another upcoming spacewalk. IROSA is designed to boost power generation capability on the ISS by up to 30%, which would increase the station's total available power from 160 kilowatts to up to 215 kilowatts, according to NASA. The pair will also work to upgrade the station's power systems while tethered to the ISS.

So far, astronauts have conducted five all-women spacewalks outside the ISS. The first took place nearly six years ago after several delays due to a poorly fitting spacesuit. Finally, on October 18, 2019, NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir stepped outside of the ISS for a historic spacewalk that cemented the role of women in spaceflight. Earlier this year, NASA astronaut Suni Williams broke the women's record for total spacewalking time after completing a 5.5-hour spacewalk outside the ISS, bringing her total spacewalking time to 62 hours and six minutes.

Thursday's spacewalk will be the first time astronaut Ayers has stepped outside the ISS for extravehicular activity and McClain's third spacewalk.

The best of both worlds


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Taking your first steps into the world of Linux can be a scary proposition. After all, we have a whole new world of terminal commands, desktop environments and applications to learn. Thankfully Linux installation has improved leaps and bounds from the earliest text based installers used in the late 1990s (Where I started my journey with Mandrake, Corel Linux) via graphical installers in the early 2000s (Ubuntu, Open Suse). From the 2010s we have seen better graphical installers providing clearer and easier means to install the latest Linux distro.

The first steps into Linux now fall under two paths.: a single board computer such as the Raspberry Pi or more traditionally a dual boot setup, where Windows and Linux are installed to the same machine, often on the same boot drive. Using a custom boot menu, GRUB, we can choose between the two operating systems when we power on our PC.

In this how to, we shall learn how to dual boot Linux with Windows, using Ubuntu and Windows 11.

Before we kick-off, a word of caution. Ensure that you have backed up your drive before moving forwards. There is always a chance that you will accidentally overwrite your drive.

Our Linux distro is typically downloaded as an ISO image (ISO originally being used to reference CD / DVD sized images) of a live Linux OS that we can test on our machine. To use the ISO with a UEFI / Secure Boot system we need to use Rufus, a popular free utility that writes ISO files to USB Flash drives.

Our goal is to create a bootable USB stick containing our chosen Linux OS. A minimum capacity of 8GB is recommended for your USB drive.

1. Download and install Rufus for your operating system.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

2. Insert a USB drive into your machine and open Rufus.

3. Select your USB drive using Device, and then click SELECT and select the Linux OS that you wish to install. In our case it was Ubuntu.



4. Select the GPT partition scheme and click START to write the OS to the USB drive. GPT is the latest partition scheme and necessary for installing Ubuntu on a UEFI system. It is gradually replacing MBR.



5. When prompted select “Write in ISO image mode” and click OK.



6. Read and understand the prompts to ensure that Linux OS will be written to the correct drive. There is no going back should you make a mistake.



7. Click CLOSE to exit Rufus and remove the USB drive from the machine.



The Linux installer has come a long way. Gone are the old days of scary user interfaces and in their place are inviting and easy to use installers that guide you through the process. We're going to use the Ubuntu 22.04.1 installer to split our 256GB NVMe drive in half. Giving Windows and Ubuntu enough space for a basic dual boot install. Then we will follow a typical Ubuntu installation.

1. Insert the USB drive into your computer and boot from it. Each computer is a little different, Some will offer a function key to select a boot device, some need to be selected from the BIOS.

2. From the GRUB menu select “Try or Install Ubuntu” (or your Linux OS of choice) and press Enter . The GRUB menu is a custom boot menu used on Linux devices. It can also be customized to show a background image.



3. When prompted, click Try Ubuntu to load the OS into RAM as a “Live Distro”. Live Distros give us enough of the operating system to test on our machine without making any changes to the system. They are also useful as recovery devices to boot broken computers.



4. Test your hardware to make sure that everything you need is working. Check audio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc before moving onwards.



5. Double click on the Install icon to launch the installer application.



6. Select your language and click Continue.



7. Configure your accessibility requirements and click Next.



8. Select your preferred keyboard layout and click Continue.



9. Choose how you connect to the Internet and click Next to move on. If you have wired or Wi-Fi Internet access, choose the most appropriate method. Later, part of the install process will require Internet access to download software updates.



10. Select an Interactive Installation and click Next. Interactive installations will prompt the user for input as the install progresses. The automated install option is used for users who have a configuration script that automates the process.



11. Select either Default or Extended and click Next. The Default option will install just the basic applications (file manager, web browser, and some basic utilities.) This is useful for creating a base install for use in specific projects. If you require more apps, such as office tools, image editors etc, opt for the Extended selection. This option is also useful for those new to Linux.



12. Tick the boxes to choose whether you require proprietary software and click Next. Ubuntu comes with no proprietary software as part of the ISO image, but here we can install software and drivers that make Ubuntu easier to use.

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a 100-mg liquid formulation vial of thiotepa (Tepylute), according to a press release from its maker, Shorla Oncology.

Tepylute is an alkylating agent that does not require reconstitution like the freeze-dried powder form of thiotepa, which has been a standard-of-care oncology drug since the 1950s.

Shorla's new formulation is the only “ready-to-dilute multi-dose vial” of thiotepa for treating breast and ovarian cancer, the press release says. Once opened, it's stable for 2 weeks when properly stored, “giving providers the flexibility they need when preparing and administering this very important treatment.”

The new approval saves clinicians the time it takes to inject saline into the vial of thiotepa made by other companies to reconstitute the powder. Shorla, a US-Ireland specialty pharmaceutical company, didn't announce the price of this convenience in its press release, but it said the formulation might also reduce dosing errors.

A 15-mg vial is also now available, in addition to the 100-mg vial, the company said.

“We are excited to bring Tepylute to the US Market. It provides consistent dosing accuracy and allows for ‘just in time' preparation, which benefits everyone, especially patients,” Rayna Herman, chief commercial officer of Shorla, said in the press release.

An analysis of data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database revealed differences in patterns of ocular events associated with oral and injectable formulations of semaglutide, with injectable formulations linked to a higher frequency of retinal complications.

""It is advisable that patients be closely monitored for symptoms such as blurred vision and visual impairment during the first month of treatment, especially concerning retinopathy linked to subcutaneous injections,"" the researcher wrote.

The study was led by Tao Zhao, of Nanfang Hospital and Southern Medical University in Guangzhou, China. It was published online on April 28, 2025, in BMC Ophthalmology.

The FAERS database is a spontaneous reporting system, which may have affected the quality and quantity of analyzed information. The analysis did not account for the effect of potential confounding factors such as drug interactions, previous health conditions, and use of multiple medications.

The introduction of intravenous (IV) alteplase almost 30 years ago changed ischemic stroke care. The recent approval of TNKase (tenecteplase), a second tissue plasminogen activator thrombolytic medicine, raises the question of whether there are patient characteristics or circumstances that would make one thrombolytic a better choice than the other. 

TNKase is delivered as a single 5-sec IV bolus, while Activase (alteplase) is administered as an IV bolus followed by a 60-min infusion. 

There are some data favoring the newer agent. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, 202 patients eligible for thrombectomy were randomized to either tenecteplase or alteplase. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients treated within 4.5 h after symptom onset. 

A comparative effectiveness study using data from the nationwide Get With the Guidelines-Stroke registry of 79,550 patients — who received tenecteplase or alteplase, with or without thrombectomy — showed similar safety and efficacy between the two drugs. 

Overall, there were no significant differences in the effectiveness outcomes measured:

The safety outcomes of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and-hospital mortality or hospice discharge also did not differ overall.

However, patients who were eligible for endovascular thrombectomy but who did not receive it had better outcomes with tenecteplase than with alteplase, notably for:

Reasons why these patients did not receive endovascular thrombectomy included clinical improvement after thrombolysis, significant baseline disability, advanced age, patient or family refusal, and no availability of an endovascular specialist. 

While some of the reasons above are tied to older age, there is no strong evidence that either thrombolytic is safer for elderly adults. A secondary analysis from the AcT trial found that those aged 80 years or older had worse outcomes with either treatment than younger patients. This included significantly lower rates of excellent functional outcome or return to baseline status, lower quality-of-life, and higher mortality rates. The authors reported that neither medication modified the age-related risk of worse outcomes.

Type of vascular occlusion is another factor that affects patient outcomes; might there be differences between the drugs on that basis? A systematic review and meta-analysis compared tenecteplase and alteplase in the treatment of tandem occlusions, a challenging type of large vessel occlusion stroke characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of both extracranial and ipsilateral intracranial arterial occlusions. Outcomes were similar for both thrombolytics in terms of improving functional outcomes and recanalization rates, and there was no significant difference in rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality. 

Takeaway 

While efficacy and safety of tenecteplase and alteplase seem generally comparable, the bolus administration dosing of tenecteplase offers an advantage in providing faster treatment without an increased risk of hemorrhage. This may also allow more efficient transfer for on-site endovascular thrombectomy or to another hospital better equipped to manage stroke patients. 

Nevertheless, it is important to note that tenecteplase has not been shown to be superior to thrombectomy, so the comparative effectiveness study mentioned above should not be interpreted to mean that tenecteplase might replace endovascular thrombectomy for patients who are afraid of the risk or who might have heard of a new cure for stroke.

In a cohort of 395 preterm infants (median gestational age, 29.6 weeks), maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) affected 43% of cases and were associated with reduced cognitive and language development scores at 2 years corrected age, with stronger negative associations observed in preeclampsia-exposed infants.

“In this preterm cohort study, maternal HDP was independently associated with adverse cognitive and language development, with accentuated associations observed in preeclampsia-exposed preterm infants, emphasizing the clinical importance of recognizing HDP as a risk, enabling targeted risk management strategies for closer monitoring and aggressive early intervention in affected populations,” the study authors wrote.

The study was led by Nehal A. Parikh, DO, MS, of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center It was published online on April 29 in JAMA Network Open.

The observational study design presents challenges in establishing causation and potential residual confounding by maternal comorbidities. HDP diagnosis relied primarily on maternal electronic medical records as determined by obstetricians, with only eight of 170 cases identified through clinical blood pressure criteria. The researchers used modified social risk scores owing to data constraints, which may have introduced differences between intended and implemented methods. A 13% attrition rate could have introduced selection bias, though multiple imputation sensitivity analyses showed similar results to original findings.

The study received support through National Institutes of Health grants ROI-NSO94200 and RO1-NSO96037 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and RO1 EBO29944-01 from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering to Parikh.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) saw more success in guiding adjuvant therapy decisions, in a study presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025.

The phase 2 trial screened for ctDNA in 174 patients with early-stage mismatch repair–deficient solid tumors — 16 types in all, the majority colorectal cancer — within 10 weeks of R0 resections and standard-of-care adjuvant therapy. Twenty-two were ctDNA positive. 

Among the 22 ctDNA-positive patients, 13 were treated with pembrolizumab for 6 months. The remaining nine positive patients had experienced recurrence by the time they were screened and were not put on pembrolizumab. 

Eleven of the 13 ctDNA-positive patients cleared their ctDNA by the finish of pembrolizumab, and the two others cleared it by 9 months. 

Clearance was a good sign for most. Eight of the 13 (62%) were recurrence-free at a median follow up of 32.1 months, and overall survival (OS) among the group was 92% at 2 years. 

Their OS results were similar to the 2-year survival rates (98%) among the 152 patients in the study who were ctDNA negative after surgery and observed, but 2-year recurrence free survival was a bit higher among patients who were ctDNA-negative, at 94%.

Meanwhile, among the nine patients who were ctDNA positive after surgery and not treated with pembrolizumab, median time to recurrence was just 0.8 month and 2-year OS was 78%.

In the end, “the study suggests ctDNA-guided treatment strategies may help prevent relapse in patients whose tumors would otherwise recur,” said lead investigator Yelena Janjigian, MD, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. 

Using ctDNA to make the call on added treatment after surgery is the subject of much research in oncology. The idea is that patients with ctDNA after surgery are at higher risk for recurrence because they have microscopic cancer that needs to be treated, whereas patients who don't have ctDNA in their blood are truly free of disease and can avoid the risks and costs of additional treatment. 

The approach was supported by the DYNAMIC trial, a groundbreaking placebo-controlled study in stage 2 colorectal cancer that suggested that ctDNA negative patients don't need added treatment after surgery. Numerous placebo-controlled trials are hoping to replicate the results in other tumor types. 

Janjigian's study was originally intended to be one of those placebo-controlled trials, but the placebo arm was closed early because patients and their doctors didn't want to risk being randomized to a sham treatment, she said. 

Despite the setback, Janjigian said her “study demonstrates that treating these patients with a ctDNA-guided adjuvant immunotherapy approach can effectively eliminate residual disease before macroscopic recurrence occurs.”

The findings “lay the groundwork for future trials to validate ctDNA as a predictive biomarker…ensuring that high-risk patients receive timely intervention while avoiding overtreatment,” she said. 

The fact that some ctDNA-negative patients in the study still had tumor recurrences means that the largely in-house ctDNA testing used in the study had false negatives and that testing for ctDNA needs to improve, said trial discussant Maximilian Diehn, MD, PhD, a radiation oncologist at Stanford University in California.

“Hopefully, newer, ultrasensitive tests will really let us maximize the promise of” the approach, he said. 

Diehn was also concerned that the trial wasn't placebo-controlled. It's unclear what a comparison would have looked like had there been a placebo group, he said. 

Still, the approach holds promise, he said. 

The study was funded by Merck, the maker of pembrolizumab, and Cycle for Survival. Janjigian is a consultant and speaker for Merck. Diehn isn't involved with Merck but has other industry ties.

 May 01, 2025  

MANCHESTER, England — In real-world practice, the use of avacopan (Tavneos) is much broader than it was in the phase 3 clinical trial that led to its approval for the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis (AAV), according to a retrospective, multicenter cohort study presented at the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Compared with individuals who were treated with the C5a receptor inhibitor avacopan as part of the phase 3 ADVOCATE trial, patients treated in the real-world setting had more severe renal disease, were generally treated later, and received concomitant immunosuppressants. They also underwent a variety of glucocorticoid-tapering protocols, unlike the set tapering protocol that was used in the clinical trial.

Study presenter Samuel Wood, a rheumatology trainee and clinical research fellow at Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, England, said that real-world data were lacking so far for avacopan, particularly in people with severe end-organ manifestations such as reduced renal function, after the drug was first licensed for use in England and in the European Union in 2022 and after initial approval in the United States in 2021. Avacopan is licensed for use in combination with standard therapy (rituximab or cyclophosphamide), including glucocorticoids.

To look at how the drug had been used since its approval, Wood and associates created a cohort of 123 patients with AAV, 61 of whom has been treated with avacopan at seven centers in England. The remaining 62 patients were taken from a historical cohort treated with rituximab or cyclophosphamide between 2017 and 2019. The researchers employed a statistical method used to adjust for confounding bias in observational studies, inverse probability weighting, to compare the groups in terms of rates of clinical response (Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score [BVAS] v3.0 ≤ 3 and a prednisolone dose ≤ 5 mg/d or equivalent) and complete remission (BVAS of 0 and not on oral prednisolone).

Looking first at how the 61 avacopan-treated patients in the real-world cohort compared with people who had been treated in the clinical trial (n = 166), Wood reported that avacopan had been started a mean of 2.9 weeks from the initial induction therapy with rituximab or cyclophosphamide.

“Admittedly, this study was performed in the very early phases of using avacopan. So, these delays are likely to be related to both clinician awareness of treatment and also the pharmacy getting hold of the actual treatment itself,” Wood said.

Notably, the real-world avacopan cohort differed from the ADVOCATE trial population at baseline in that 12 (19.7%) patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, and concomitant immunosuppression was used in 17 (27.9%), vs none of the trial participants. Moreover, 14 (22.9%) of the real-world patients had received a combination of cyclophosphamide and rituximab, compared with none in ADVOCATE. 

Wood reported that clinical response criteria were met in 32 (64%) of the patients treated with avacopan in the real-life setting who had 6 months of follow-up data available, and in 14 (78%) of 18 patients who had follow-up data available at 12 months.

Just over one third (36%) of patients had stopped glucocorticoid therapy, and only two of these had experienced a flare of their symptoms by 12 months. 

However, only seven (14%) patients would have met the ADVOCATE primary endpoint of clinical remission at 6 months, Wood pointed out. 

Looking more closely at how avacopan fared in people with severe renal impairment, Wood noted that 10 of the 12 patients with a baseline eGFR ≤ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 had follow-up data available at 6 months. Eight of those 10 exhibited an increase in eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean increase in eGFR at 6 months was 13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Safety appeared comparable between the real-world and trial-treated patients. Out of 12 patients, just two stopped avacopan treatment because of side effects and three had a serious adverse event during follow-up, including one infection, one hospital admission with heart failure, and one hospital admission with epistaxis.

﻿﻿ Wood pointed out that even in patients with any renal involvement, there were significant improvements between baseline and 6 months in eGFR, serum creatinine level, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio.

Comparing the real-world avacopan-treated patients vs the historical cohort of patients who only had a glucocorticoid taper following induction therapy with rituximab or cyclophosphamide, avacopan-treated patients were found to be significantly older (mean age, 60 vs 53 years), have a significantly shorter disease duration (median, 6.14 vs 41.9 weeks), have a significantly higher baseline BVAS v3.0 score (16.2 vs 12.3), and use a significantly higher mean dose of prednisolone (41.6 vs 20.8 mg).

After inverse probability weighting, however, avacopan-treated patients were 4.6 times more likely to have a clinical response at 6 months than the steroid taper group (P = .015). Despite looking at multiple variables, no predictors of clinical response to avacopan at 6 months were found.

In terms of safety, avacopan was discontinued in 29 patients, but this was due to completion of a 12-month course of treatment in approximately half of cases (n = 15; 51.7%). Other reasons for discontinuation were raised aminotransferase levels in three patients; gastrointestinal intolerance in two patients; and one case each of leg swelling, breathlessness, anemia, and infection. Two deaths occurred: one due to chest infection and one due to myocardial infarction. There was one case of drug intolerance, and two cases in which the clinician considered the drug to be ineffective and so stopped the treatment. 

Twenty-five serious adverse events were reported, but the severe infection rate in the avacopan-treated and non–avacopan-treated groups were similar, with 11 infections in nine patients and 14 infections in 12 patients, respectively. This yielded rates of serious infections per 100 patient-years of 19.2 and 20.8. 

In commenting about the study for Medscape Medical News, session chair Christopher Denton, MD, PhD, professor of experimental rheumatology at UCL Medical School and head of the Centre for Rheumatology at the Royal Free Hospital, London, England, spoke of the importance of gathering real-world data.

“One of the challenges, of course, when you do clinical trials is that they are necessarily restrictive and there is use of a drug over relatively short time,” he said. “In the real world, you've got the opportunity to see how a drug fits in with background treatment over a much longer period of time.”

Denton added, “The two approaches are really complementary, and postmarketing surveillance and observational studies in the real world are really, really important, because often they show that drugs work outside the population or context that they were tested in the trial.”

The study was independently supported. Wood reported having no conflicts of interest. Denton had no relevant financial relationships to report.

Individuals with hidradenitis suppurativa had a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, substance use disorder (SUD), and suicide, than the general population. The findings indicated a need to raise awareness of psychiatric illnesses in those with hidradenitis suppurativa.

""In conclusion, this study found a significantly higher risk of different PDs [psychiatric diseases] in patients with HS [hidradenitis suppurativa] compared to the general population including depression, anxiety, BD, schizophrenia, psychosis, SUD, alcohol abuse, ADHD [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder], personality disorder, and suicide with a GRADE rank of moderate to high certainty. These findings emphasise the need for an integrated approach to address physical and mental aspects of HS. Further, our findings reflect a need to raise awareness of psychiatric illness in patients with HS,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Caroline L. Folkmann, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on April 19, 2025, in the British Journal of Dermatology.

This study included a large number of subgroup analyses, which increased the risk for type 1 errors. The use of crude estimates for meta-analysis potentially led to an overestimation of associations. Language bias may have been introduced by including only English and Danish studies. Assessment methods for psychiatric diseases varied between studies, affecting the interpretation of the results, with questionnaire-based assessments showing higher prevalence rates than physician assessments.

Healthcare workers who wash their uniforms at home may unwittingly contribute to hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance, UK researchers warned.

An observational study by the Infectious Disease Research Group at De Montfort University, Leicester, found that domestic laundering may not sufficiently remove harmful microbes from healthcare clothing. 

Infection prevention measures often focus on hand hygiene and surface disinfection. However, the researchers explained that textiles can also serve as reservoirs for pathogens.

HAIs affect 10%-15% of hospitalised patients. Outbreaks have been linked to contaminated privacy curtains, surgical scrubs, medical equipment, mop heads, beds, and hospital linens. 

Studies have demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus can survive over 20 days on cotton. E faecium and S aureus remained viable for 7 days on polyester.

In the UK, hospital uniforms and linens are typically processed through in-house or industrial laundering systems designed to minimise microbial contamination. 

However, a recent study found that 86% of nurses in the UK washed their uniforms at home, where these infection control standards do not apply.

NHS recommendations for domestic laundering include:

Senior study author Professor Katie Laird noted that the United Kingdom is the only country in Europe where nurses routinely launder uniforms at home.

Her previous research showed that microorganisms can survive 40 °C washes and transfer between textiles during laundering.

“When healthcare workers launder their uniforms at home, they risk bringing microorganisms into their household environment,” she said. “[This]could be particularly serious if they live with vulnerable individuals,” Laird added.

To assess decontamination, researchers tested six domestic washing machines using E faecium bioindicators on contaminated fabric swatches under various wash cycles and detergent conditions. They used shotgun metagenomics to analyse bacterial communities and resistance genes. Detergent tolerance and antibiotic cross-resistance were tested in S aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P aeruginosa.

The study, published in PLoS ONE, found that only three of the six machines achieved sufficient decontamination (≥ 5 log10 colony-forming unit reduction) at 60 °C during full-length wash cycles. Rapid cycles showed inconsistent results. 

Microbiome analysis revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter species. 

Resistance genes linked to efflux pumps and target modification were also detected.

The researchers found increased bacterial tolerance to detergents. Cross-resistance to antibiotics observed in S aureus and K pneumoniae, including to carbapenem and beta-lactam groups. 

Whole genome sequencing identified mutations in genes encoding efflux pump function following detergent exposure.

“Domestic laundering of healthcare uniforms may be insufficient for decontamination, posing risks for HAI transmission and antimicrobial resistance,” the researchers concluded. 

They said that owing to concerns about inadequate disinfection standards and the risks posed by biofilms in domestic washing machines, there was an “urgent need for stricter guidelines” and improved validation of washing parameters.

Alternatives such as on-site or industrial laundering should be considered to protect patient safety and reduce HAIs, they said.

The research was funded by De Montfort University and the Textile Services Association.

In a large US cohort study, patients with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (pCBCL) had significantly higher risks of developing hematologic and prostate cancers.

""Patients with pCBCL have increased second primary hematologic and prostate cancer risk,"" which “may inform patient counseling,” the study authors wrote. “Future studies,” they added, “should consider patient factors associated with secondary cancers when developing screening guidelines.”

The study was led by Vrusha K. Shah, MPH, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was published online on April 30 in JAMA Dermatology.

From 2010 to 2024, the rate of surgeries declined more than fivefold in patients with pathologic grade group 1 (pGG1) prostate cancer, a cohort study found. The small proportion that were performed increasingly involved patients with higher-risk features. 

""Our analyses show that the proportion of prostatectomies that are pGG1 has decreased more than fivefold since 2010, and the pGG1 prostatectomies that are now performed are more likely to have higher-risk preoperative features,"" the authors wrote.

""Although further improvement in surgical overtreatment of prostate cancer is necessary, these results reflect a dramatic shift in how low-risk prostate cancer has been managed in the US during the past 2 decades,"" they concluded.

This study, led by Steven M. Monda, MD, MSCI, Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

The retrospective nature of the study and potential coding inaccuracies inherent to registry data may have introduced bias. Additionally, these findings based on SEER and MUSIC data may not be generalizable to all regions and populations in the United States.

MUSIC received support from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan as part of its Value Partnerships Program. Two authors received funding support through grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Advanced Training in Urologic Oncology and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, of whom one also received the Clark Family Fellowship in Kidney Cancer Research.

A substantial proportion of patients admitted to hospitals in Italy experienced acute kidney injury (AKI), which was associated with worsened in-hospital mortality outcomes, longer hospital stays, and more frequent admissions to intensive care units (ICUs).

""In these high-risk patients, establishing specialised post-AKI outpatient clinics, in collaboration with nephrologists and general practitioners, is crucial in warranting a proper follow-up. In this setting, given the advanced age of many AKI patients, incorporating telemedicine and digital health approaches could further enhance post-AKI care,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Pasquale Esposito, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. It was published online on April 24, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

The usage of serum creatinine–based AKI definitions may have missed some cases, particularly community-acquired AKI. Clinical conditions such as sepsis and prolonged hospitalisation, especially in critical care settings, may affect serum creatinine production and its reliability as a kidney function marker. This study lacked information about AKI aetiology.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Ileana L. Piña, MD, MPH: Hello. We've been at the American College of Cardiology in Chicago, celebrating 75 wonderful years of this organization. It's been great, because there are so many good papers being presented and I've been able to capture a few of them. 

One of them is today, with Dr Andrew Sauer from Kansas City, from Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute with the IMPLEMENT-HF study. I have to disclose that I'm one of the authors. 

Andrew, we try so hard to get people to do the right thing. We're constantly asking our colleagues to start guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), but so many things have not worked.

I'm the quality chief now, and I'm always trying to get the same thing. People, please start the drugs. Don't wait too long. Don't wait until they're an outpatient. Start it in the inpatient setting. 

Tell our audience about IMPLEMENT-HF. I know it's a very complex system when you get right down to it. What is IMPLEMENT-HF, actually? 

Andrew J. Sauer, MD: The IMPLEMENT-HF initiative was sponsored by the American Heart Association (AHA). It was really a spinoff from, or an addition to, the Get With The Guidelines initiative. What was really added to it in terms of quality improvement was that, first, importantly, we measured 30-day GDMT, which is in addition to the usual measures measured during hospitalization and at discharge.

The other thing we did is we defined defect-free, quadruple medical therapy a little differently from what you see in other studies. Specifically, to be considered defect-free at discharge and at 30 days, patients needed to be on a beta-blocker. They needed to be on angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril-valsartan, as opposed to just being on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), because that's the class I recommendation.They needed to be on a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and they needed to be on a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. 

This is, of course, patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ultimately, the idea was that there would be seven regions invited to participate. That included Kansas City, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Chicago, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and North Carolina.

This involved 61 hospitals and over 40,000 patients over 3 years, from 2021 to 2023. Ultimately, the initiative was really leveraging an opportunity to do a quality improvement project across all seven regions using the true approach, essentially “all learn, all teach.” 

All hospitals within their regions would be inputting those data points, those measures that we talked about, at discharge as well as at 30 days; participating in their region, reviewing dashboards; and then participating in model sharing to allow them to create opportunities for improving implementation. 

That's basically the premise. We were very proud to participate in Kansas City and then lead the report of the quality metrics.

Piña: What were the data points like in that segment? 

Sauer: If you look at the first quarter of 2021, at the time of the initiation of IMPLEMENT-HF, defect-free, quadruple medical therapy at discharge was only 5% across all systems, all hospitals. 

Piña: By “defect-free,” you mean all the drugs on board?

Sauer: All four drugs. Again, this was carefully articulated as to what that meant. At 30 days, it was 0%. There wasn't a single amount of defect-free, quadruple medical therapy at 30 days. If you fast-forwarded through 2.5 to almost 3 years of the initiative, that discharge defect-free, quadruple medical therapy rate went from 5% to 45%, and the 30-day initiative, after 2.5 years, was actually up to 45% as well. 

What we can be particularly proud of is that sites were able to improve individual therapies. MRA use was over 70%.

Piña: Which is huge right now.

Sauer: It's huge.

Piña: I can't get it up to 50%.

Sauer: We keep seeing 30%, 40% reported in a number of the Get With The Guidelines papers and the Veterans Affairs cohorts, so 70% for a US cohort in the real world, involving Get With The Guidelines–type hospitals, is huge. 

We also saw ARNI use over 60% when we looked at individual therapies. The last thing that we measured was social determinants of health utilization at discharge as well as at 30 days.

Piña: Give me an example of which social determinants were used. 

Sauer: It's the usual ones, looking at access to food and access to transportation, those types of determinants. This adoption of social determinants of health, as being captured by IMPLEMENT-HF, also exceeded 70% at hospital discharge and at 30 days.

Piña: Which is amazing, because we never get that.

Sauer: The other thing that was really great to see was there were no sex-based disparities, no race-based disparities, and no urban- or rural-based disparities. There were some geographic disparities at first, but they kind of leveled out as we got further into the initiative. Again, I think much of this is because sites were learning from each other and they were being competitive.

Many people ask, how was this so successful? We've never seen very many implemented initiatives that have led to this dramatic of an improvement over this short period of time. It begins with having willing participants. Nobody was forced to participate in this initiative.

In my city, only three systems out of multiple systems participated, but we had very strong participation energy, if you will, in saying, we want to do this. This is important to us as a health system for a number of incentivized reasons. 

The second thing I think really works is the dashboarding.As they say, you don't manage what you don't measure. You see your data put up locally, your institution's data compared with your peers in your region in Kansas City, and then compared with the larger regions at large and also the US. At a minimum, there were quarterly meetings where these dashboards were presented to sites. That is very motivating in terms of nudging behavior. 

Piña: You can embarrass some people by showing they're not doing the right thing. 

Sauer: People are competitive. They feel maybe a little bit ashamed, and they pick it up. We see this with clinical trials. We put institutional names on the dashboard, and guess what? People will start to optimize their performance and they'll figure out what they have to do to get better results. I think that was a big part of it. 

I think the other thing was the model sharing. There were over 200 examples of models shared over the course of the initiative, either at quarterly meetings or at the AHA or the American College of Cardiology sessions, and they'd have opportunities for teams to come together and participate in model sharing.

When you think about what were the lessons learned, for example, in Kansas City at the time, SGLT2 inhibitors were struggling to get on inpatient formulary. We would teach each other the best practices for going to pharmacy and therapeutics committees and getting this on formulary.

For example, using the EMPULSE data when those came out was very compelling for many of our pharmacy and therapeutic committees to say that we have safety data now and some efficacy data for starting SGLT2 inhibitors. 

Piña: At lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs).

Sauer: Exactly — lower GFRs in nondiabetic patients with heart failure. That was really helpful. Teaching sites how to do that led to increased adoption of SGLT2 inhibitors when traditionally the concern was payers. 

Another example was sites would figure out how to tailor order sets and dot phrases, soft stops, prompts, and these types of things, which have been shown in other studies like PROMPT-HF. Best practice alerts are effective nudges, they're modestly effective, but again, on a willing participant where you have clinicians that are saying, we want to do better. I'm about to discharge this patient and my electronic medical record is forcing me to document what their GDMT will look like at discharge and specifically call out these specific therapies.

The programs were given the checklist reminders to improve their habits, essentially, as a site. As James Clear says, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your system.” When you put a system in place, you know that becomes the common denominator.

I ultimately think that was a big reason why you had these ingredients for success. Willing participants, obviously dashboarding and seeing data, and then the model sharing of “All teach, all learn” allowed for individualized system interventions that would help with essentially the mundane practice of overcoming clinical inertia.

Piña: What did you do with, for example, one of our complaints that we hear: “When you start the MRAs, the potassium's gonna go off the chart”? 

Sauer: I think we try to educate folks that, for one, participated in helping lead the CARE-HK in Heart Failure registry, from which we have some report-outs coming, we showed that much of the concern about hyperkalemia may be a little bit overblown. 

Piña: Absolutely. 

Sauer: When we see hyperkalemia, it tends to be modest. We shouldn't dismiss it. It is real, but we're talking about 5.1 to 5.5, and you could argue that you don't need to do anything with that.You just watch. 

Piña: I don't do anything.

Sauer: Just watch. That's the majority of the hyperkalemia out there. When it is over 5.5 or even 6, there are mitigating strategies such as making sure they're on the SGLT2 inhibitor. That's been shown or at least observed in clinical trials, that if you have SGLT2 plus MRA, they're complementary and you're less likely to get hyperkalemia.

Piña: We have the potassium binders.

Sauer: We have the binders. We also showed in the CARE-HK in Heart Failure registry that the Europeans are much more progressive with using the binders. 

Piña: Absolutely. 

Sauer: In the US, we have this reluctance to use them. I think we have to start talking about binders as part of GDMT because if you de-escalate GDMT in the patients who have the highest risk for hyperkalemia, those happen to be the patients who stand to benefit the most from GDMT. 

Piña: And have the highest risk of dying, actually. 

Sauer: That's right. We shouldn't be de-escalating; we should be advancing.I will say, though, IMPLEMENT-HF probably didn't capture much of that because again, the focus was on the performance measures at discharge and then at 30 days. There was no extended follow up. 

There is a plan, at least that's what the AHA is telling me, to see if we can look at claims data so we can get a sense of what happens to these patients in the real world.

Piña: That would be cool.

Sauer: We can tie the performance measures and the adherence to the individual patient in the claims data. We're hoping to see that data output soon. 

Piña: That's what the CDC did with their famous New England Journal of Medicine paper showing us the terrible readmission rates. They had the administrative data and they paired it. 

Sauer: Right. 

Piña: That's how they did it. Well, we're going to have to end here, but I could talk about this all day. It's fascinating. 

Right now, I'm arguing with my teams that we've created all these dot phrases to have notes be simple, easy to follow, and have some consistency, but they're not being used. When I hang up with you today, I'm going to fire off an email to the heart failure attendings to say to them, we've gone through all this work and nobody's using it. This is meant to make life easier. 

Sauer: That's the take-home message. These prompts and nudges work best when you have buy-in from the teams. That usually requires at least one or two champions, saying, we're really going to do this. This is important so we're going to find a way to incentivize this behavior. There are many creative ways to do it, and that's what we learned. Each region and each site had their own tailored best practice, but they learned from each other. 

Piña: And their own culture. I really believe in the culture aspect of it all. 

I love this. I am passing it around to everybody on the team so that they can see what can be done, that it can be done, and not to get despondent about it. 

I want to thank you, Andrew, for spending these minutes with us here, and I'm really hoping that, for the audience that hears me talking about doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time — this is the right time. There is no other time. We have now these wonderful drugs that actually work, but we have to use them. They're not going to exist on a shelf somewhere. 

Sauer: Absolutely. What we showed is that it can be done. 

Piña: It can be done. Congratulations to all of us.

Sauer: Yes. To all the regions, of course. I had the privilege of reporting it out. That's all I did. Thank you for having me. 

Piña: To my audience, thank you for joining us. This is Ileana, and I am signing off.

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) appears to significantly increase the survival rate for pregnancies complicated by antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an autoimmune thrombo-inflammatory disorder, when added to standard therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and low-dose aspirin (LDA), according to results from the first trial of its kind.

In the IMPACT trial, treatment with certolizumab led to an 18% rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared with rates of 44% in similar patients from a previous research study who met participation criteria and 37% in those patients who were taking LMWH and LDA, Jane Salmon, MD, of Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), New York City, and coauthors reported on April 10, 2025, in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The placental-mediated adverse pregnancy outcomes defined by the single-arm open-label, phase 2 trial were otherwise unexplained fetal death ≥ 10 weeks' gestation or preeclampsia with severe features or placental insufficiency requiring delivery before 34 weeks' gestation.

The average gestational age at delivery was 36.5 weeks in certolizumab-treated pregnancies of patients with APS compared with 24 weeks for prior pregnancies of patients participating in IMPACT, said Salmon, a physician-researcher who specializes in lupus and other autoimmune diseases at HSS. [Editor's note: Read a related Q&A with Salmon about IMPACT at the end of this article.]

The IMPACT study called for administration of certolizumab 400 mg subcutaneously beginning by 8 weeks and 6 days of gestation, 400 mg at 2 and 4 weeks later, and 200 mg every other week until 28 weeks' gestation. Each patient also received LMWH (at either therapeutic or thromboprophylactic doses) plus LDA under the supervision of their physician. A total of 61% were also receiving hydroxychloroquine at enrollment.

The trial enrolled 51 pregnant patients in the United States and Canada with APS and lupus anticoagulant as an intention-to-treat population, losing six participants later from analysis because of a pregnancy loss at < 10 weeks' gestation and fetal deaths due to genetic abnormalities. A total of 10 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus.

The researchers reported that 93% of participants included in a modified intention-to-treat analysis completed their pregnancies with live births and brought their infants home. That compares with a 38% survival rate for their previous pregnancies while taking only LMWH and LDA.

Patrick Schneider, MD, assistant professor and medical director for inpatient obstetrics at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, who was not involved with this research, said the trial's findings reinforce the need to check for APS after women experience stillbirth, although this is a rare condition. 

“I always try to remind my residents when I'm teaching them that this is one of the most crucial tests that you can do. And even though it's not likely to come back positive, if it does, you have potentially a modifiable element to manage this condition,” Schneider said.

Salmon and coauthors made a convincing case for designing IMPACT as a single-arm intervention study, Schneider said.

“There are always going to be strengths and weaknesses of different studies. Ideally, it would be great if we could have the gold standard, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, but that's just not really practical in this particular patient population,” Schneider said.

“We already have a pretty good compendium of understanding of the kind of the outcomes for these patients,” in terms of their use of aspirin and LMWH to try to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, he added.

IMPACT was the first clinical trial to evaluate biologic therapy to prevent serious adverse outcomes in pregnant patients, Salmon and coauthors wrote. 

It's part of broader efforts to study how medical treatments affect both pregnant patients and fetuses. 

For many decades, researchers have steered away from enrolling pregnant patients in clinical trials, resulting in a dearth of information about drugs and treatments in these patients. This reluctance was due in part to concerns raised by the early 1960s cases of thalidomide-linked birth defects, according to a 2024 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report.

Yet about 70% of pregnant patients take one or more prescription medications, often related to nonobstetric conditions, the NASEM report said. NASEM urged the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to encourage companies to design clinical trials to allow safe enrollment of pregnant patients. 

In 1977, the FDA issued guidance recommending against including women of childbearing potential in early phases of clinical research. But in recent years, the FDA has sought to identify ways in which pregnant patients may be safely enrolled in studies. It held a workshop in 2021 addressing this issue. 

The aim was to change the “default response” against enrolling pregnant patients in trials, FDA staff wrote in a 2021 website post about the workshop. 

“Pregnant patients may not be included in clinical studies for scientific, legal, logistical, and financial reasons. But these reasons do not apply to every clinical study,” the FDA staff wrote. “At the beginning of each research endeavor, we need to consider if and how to enroll pregnant patients as safely as possible.”

“The cultural change may be our most daunting task,” the staff added.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also has urged changes in clinical trials to allow more pregnant patients to participate.

In a 2024 statement, ACOG said there's “an ethical imperative” to increase participation in clinical research by people who can become pregnant, who are pregnant, and who are lactating, because this will improve maternal and fetal health.

“The risk status for pregnant people and fetuses is unknown for the vast majority of FDA-approved medications. Had these drugs been studied in pregnancy early in their use, data on risk may have provided an opportunity to better balance the risks and benefits of their use,” ACOG said in the statement. 

Louise P. King, MD, JD, director of reproductive bioethics at the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, helped develop ACOG's 2024 statement regarding inclusion of more pregnant patients in clinical trials. 

She told Medscape Medical News that companies have incentive to try to skew enrollment in clinical trials toward men because it makes this research both less risky and somewhat easier to manage.

“It makes everything more complicated the more diverse your population is,” said King, who is also a surgeon in the Division of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital. 

The ACOG statement was intended to encourage drugmakers and scientists involved with clinical research to take on the challenges of enrolling more pregnant patients, King said.

“The onus is really on the researchers and the companies to ensure that we include people, [and] that we educate people so that they can make good, informed decisions about whether to participate” in clinical trials while pregnant, she said.

Medscape Medical News spoke with Salmon about the uniqueness of the IMPACT trial and the tenacity of its participants, supporters, and investigators in seeing it to completion.

Before proceeding to this trial, Salmon and colleagues completed an observational study of 775 pregnancies to determine the strongest predictors of pregnancy complications in patients with lupus and/or APS. They found that the presence of certain autoantibodies in women with APS with or without lupus was associated with a nearly 50% risk for serious adverse pregnancy outcomes and established a model to predict risk for adverse outcomes in pregnant persons with APS.

Historically, it was believed clotting caused the pregnancy problem. APS is associated with thromboses in arteries and veins, so why not the placenta? Patients with APS are treated with aspirin and LMWH during pregnancy, but it's not very effective. We still see a high rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In our experimental mouse models, we discovered that inflammation was necessary and sufficient for pregnancy complications. 

I can't say clotting is irrelevant, but inflammation is very important. We defined the specific inflammatory pathways that mediate injury at the maternal-fetal interface and discovered that TNF blockade rescued pregnancies in pregnant mice treated with human APS — the autoantibodies that cause pregnancy complications in patients. 

The ability to use our risk stratification algorithm to identify risky pregnancies in APS, taken together with the mouse studies, allowed us to design a study to test the hypothesis that the addition of a TNF blocker to standard of care therapy would improve pregnancy outcomes.

There are many TNF blockers, but certolizumab is unique: Because of its structure, it doesn't cross the placenta and enter the fetus. Although TNF blockers have not been shown to be dangerous in pregnancy, this one made us most comfortable.

Despite the historic challenges of trials in pregnant people who were considered a vulnerable population excluded for research, we obtained approval from the FDA and our institutional review board. We believe this is the first trial of biologic therapy to prevent pregnancy complications. 

Patients in the IMPACT trial were part of our research team. We were in contact with them at least every 2 weeks through their pregnancies. Our study patients were very committed to the trial, as were our study coordinators. Most of the patients — 88% — had suffered severe complications in past pregnancies, such as preeclampsia and fetal deaths, and only 37% had a live birth survive to hospital discharge. Their most recent pregnancy before they were enrolled in our trial ended with an average gestational age of 24 weeks, whereas the average gestational age of pregnancies in these women in the IMPACT trial was 37 weeks. 94% of the patients brought home healthy babies. 

These women were anxious to enroll and accept the risk of taking a biologic therapy to protect their pregnancies. They were willing to be partners, to help themselves and to help others. A number of them wanted to have subsequent pregnancies but have had difficulties obtaining coverage for certolizumab. Some who were able to obtain the medication have had successful second pregnancies. We hope that publication of the IMPACT trial makes access to this promising therapy easier for the appropriate patients.

IMPACT was feasible and successful because it was a partnership between academia, the National Institutes of Health, foundations, and industry. We had support from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the Lupus Foundation of America, and an investigator-initiated grant from UCB (the manufacturer of certolizumab). These were bold to support our trial.

APS is uncommon, and APS patients at the highest risk for pregnancy are rare. It took 6 years to enroll 51 patients, using a rare disease trial approach. The co–principal investigator of IMPACT is Dr Ware Branch, a maternal-fetal medicine expert and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. 

University of Utah has experience with remote consenting for interventional trials. We presented the study to conferences with experts in management of high-risk pregnancies and rheumatologists who cared for patients with APS and waited for them to refer complex APS patients to us. We ultimately enrolled patients from 18 states and one Canadian province.

Every patient was screened by Dr Branch and consented by a credentialed individual in his institution over the phone. Then my team at HSS would take over. We collected the clinical data from monthly obstetric visits, called the patients every 1-2 weeks to remind them to administer the study medication (which was an injection every 2 weeks) and assess their general health and side effects of the study medication. Patients sent their blood samples to HSS for analyses and future biomarker studies.

The study was initially proposed to go for 3 years. We were unrealistic. It took a year to obtain all of the regulatory approvals. Then when enrollment began, it took time to inform our colleagues in rheumatology, hematology, and obstetrics and hematology about the trial. Once we gained momentum, the pandemic struck. 

Despite this, our patients stayed the course and new ones enrolled. The study took 6 years instead of 3 years. That's a long time, but it was worth the wait.

The IMPACT trial was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Lupus Foundation of America, the Morris and Alma Schapiro Fund, the James R. and Jo Scott Research Endowment at the University of Utah, and UCB. Salmon reported receiving funding grants from the Morris and Alma Schapiro Fund and Lupus Foundation of America; serving as a board member and performing consulting or advisory work with UCB; receiving speaking and lecture fees from Washington University, St. Louis, Atkinson Lecture; and holding equity or stocks in Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb, Biogen, and Eli Lilly. Schneider and King had no relevant financial disclosures.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved a subcutaneous injectable version of the cancer drug nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol Myers Squibb). 

NHS England said it would be the first health service in Europe to offer this therapy.

The injection takes just 3-5 min to administer, compared with 30-60 min for the intravenous (IV) infusion. 

Patients will still attend hospital every 2-4 weeks but will spend significantly less time there. 

The subcutaneous formulation can treat 15 types of cancer, including:

Julian Beach, MHRA interim executive director of healthcare quality and access, said the new option may improve treatment access and reduce pressure on NHS services.

It is also expected to enhance patient experience by offering more flexibility in care.

The MHRA approval  was based on evidence from the CheckMate 67T study . 

This randomised, open-label phase 3 clinical trial compared subcutaneous and IV nivolumab in patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

The results showed comparable efficacy between the two formulations, with objective response rates of 24.2% vs 18.2% for subcutaneous and intravenous nivolumab, respectively. 

Safety profiles were consistent between the two arms, with patients preferring subcutaneous over intravenous treatment.

Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding to a protein called PD-1 on T-cells. This blocks cancer cells from switching off T-cells, allowing the immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells.

Nivolumab is increasingly being recommended as a cancer treatment. In April, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended the drug  for some patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 

NHS England said the injection will be available to patients later this month, pending the arrival of supplies.

An estimated 1200 people in England are expected to benefit each month.

Two in five patients who currently receive IV nivolumab should be eligible, and most new patients are likely to start on the injectable version.

Use of the injectable version could save around 1000 hours of treatment time every month for patients and clinicians, according to NHS England. This equates to more than one full year of treatment time annually across patients, clinicians, nurses, and pharmacy teams. 

“Being able to offer it as an injection in minutes means we can make the process far more convenient,” said Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England national clinical director for cancer in a statement. “It will free up thousands of valuable clinicians' time every year, allowing teams to treat even more patients and helping hospital capacity.”

The new formulation comes at no extra cost to the NHS. A price was secured through a negotiated agreement between NHS England and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Despite a global surge in plant-based eating, a new review reveals that most studies still lack consistent definitions and validated tools to assess plant-based food diversity, thereby undermining efforts to link these diets to health outcomes.

Review: Diversity of Plant-Based Food Consumption: A Systematic Scoping Review on Measurement Tools and Associated Health Outcomes. Image Credit: Antonina Vlasova / Shutterstock

In a recent scoping review published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, researchers at King's College London, United Kingdom, conducted a systematic scoping review to investigate the definitions, assessment tools, methodologies, and health outcomes assessed in previous studies on plant-based diet diversity. The review focused on research conducted in high-income countries and identified 43 eligible studies, 88% (38/43) of which were observational in design.

Plant-based foods are any dietary components derived from plant sources, including grains, herbs, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. The oils extracted from plants and beverages, which use plant products as their primary constituents, also fall under this category.

Studies on plant-based foods have highlighted their health benefits, including a reduced risk of all-cause mortality associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which has triggered a surge in their global consumption. Reports estimate a 60% increase over just three years, between 2017 and 2020. Several national and international guidelines now recommend incorporating a variety of plant-based foods into a balanced human diet.

Unfortunately, despite decades of research in the field, no standard definition for ‘plant-based food diversity' exists. The aforementioned dietary guideline recommendations primarily recommend consuming fruits and vegetables, and omit other plant-derived food sources. Furthermore, standardized methodologies and validated assessment tools for measuring plant-based food consumption and subsequent health outcomes are also lacking, potentially resulting in reduced study reliability and complicating comparisons between independent works.

The present scoping review has four primary objectives concerning previous plant-based foods publications: 1. to identify the definitions of plant-based foods; 2. to identify variations in assessment tools employed; 3. to characterize the methodologies used; 4. to elucidate the findings (health outcomes) of previous works. The review conforms to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.

Study data (publications) were obtained from Web of Science and Medline using a custom search strategy, encompassing all publications in these online repositories from the databases' inception until October 2022. Study inclusion eligibility criteria were designed using the Patient, Exposure, Comparators, Outcome, and Study Design (PECOS) approach and included observations or intervention studies reporting measurements, effects, or health-related outcomes of plant-based food consumption. Studies were restricted to high-income countries (as classified by the World Bank) to ensure a homogeneous sample population.

Potential publications were manually screened for eligibility through a cascade of title, abstract, and full-text reviews. Data extraction comprised study design, population characteristics, methodology, dietary assessment tools (if available), diversity assessment tools (if available), and health outcomes. Review syntheses were both qualitative and descriptive in nature.

Of the 6,569 publications identified using the custom search strategy, 95 were deemed eligible after screening the titles and abstracts. Full-text screening excluded a further 52, resulting in a final dataset of 43 publications. Included studies comprised cross-sectional studies (40%, n = 17), prospective cohort studies (33%, n = 14), case-control studies (16%, n = 7), secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials (5%, n = 2), non-randomized controlled trials (5%, n = 2), and a case study (2%). Per-study sample cohorts ranged from 63 to 452,269 participants across the USA, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia.

An assessment of the definition of plant-based foods in studies revealed that almost three-fourths (74%) restricted the definition to comprise only fruits and vegetables, 12% included grains, and 7% included cereals. Only one study extended the definition to grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. None of the studies explicitly included herbs, spices, plant-based oils, or plant-derived beverages in their definitions.

Plant-based food consumption was primarily assessed via food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) (49%), 24-hour dietary recalls (23%), and food diaries (26%). The three dedicated diversity indices (VIC, FAVI, FAVVA) were validated against food and nutrient intakes or dietary assessment tools; however, none were specifically validated for measuring plant-based food diversity itself—a subtle but important distinction. The durations of plant-based food diversity assessments varied substantially between studies, ranging from 24 hours to three months.

Measurements of plant-based food diversity were similarly varied, with 59% of studies restricting their dietary assessments to only plant-based dietary components, while 40% included non-plant-based foods as well. For those studies that included non-plant foods in their diversity assessment, plant-based diversity scores were typically reported separately. Only three studies utilized dedicated dietary assessment tools, and although these were validated against dietary intake or nutrient biomarkers, none were specifically validated for assessing the diversity of plant-based foods. “Due to the variation in definitions, methods of measurement, and reporting of plant-based diversity outlined above, it is challenging to compare levels of diversity and subsequent associations with health outcomes, across studies.”

The present review highlights significant methodological limitations in previous research on plant-based foods, underscored by a lack of consensus in the definitions of ‘plant-based foods' and ‘plant-based food diversity.' Glaring methodological limitations, particularly in measurement and assessment, were also observed, which prevented comparisons between studies and reduced the robustness of their findings regarding health outcomes. This review, therefore, calls for the standardization of definitions and methodologies in the field, as well as the development of dedicated assessment tools.

“While the impact of plant-based food diversity has been investigated for several health outcomes, findings are limited by contradicting evidence and the limitations in study designs. These, in combination with the increased interest in plant-based food diversity among the general population, highlight the urgent need to improve assessment and reporting of plant-based food diversity.”

The Global Virus Network (GVN) is highly concerned that the world is unprepared for the next pandemic and has not incorporated the lessons learned from COVID-19. The GVN, comprised of 80+ Virology Centers of Excellence and Affiliates in 40+ countries, whose mission is to facilitate pandemic preparedness against viral pathogens and diseases that threaten public health globally, believes that systemic inadequacies and vulnerabilities persist, which threaten public health on a global scale. Furthermore, the need for governments and health organizations worldwide to invest and collaborate in developing and implementing an effective, comprehensive, and integrated pandemic response program is critical.

According to research by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank presented to the Group of Twenty (G20), or international forum of major economies, in 2022, an estimated USD $31.1 billion in annual funding is required to establish a comprehensive Pandemic Preparedness and Response (PPR) system. This falls at least USD $10.5 billion short of what is needed today to meet global preparedness requirements. To close this gap, urgent focus must be placed on strengthening systems that protect humanity from future, inevitable pandemic threats.

Past pandemics have shown that failing to invest in sustainable health infrastructure can devastate healthcare systems, economies, and societies. Moreover, the reductions in global health programs and grant funding have led to major setbacks in pandemic preparedness. Without stable and reliable funding, the world risks losing hard-won progress in disease surveillance, research, training, and emergency response capabilities.

As evidenced by the ongoing avian influenza (H5N1) outbreak, and described in GVN's Lancet Regional Health-Americas publication, which was published Monday, mutations and genetic reassortment, where two influenza viruses combine, pose a significant risk of increased transmissibility and mortality, and the potential emergence of another global pandemic. These risks are further exacerbated by inadequate biosafety measures and the absence of a robust, coordinated global surveillance system capable of detecting and responding to such threats in real time.

To mitigate these dangers, the GVN believes immediate action is crucial to close the critical gaps in global preparedness and ensure a world ready to respond to future pandemics GVN will continue to promote sustained investment in pandemic preparedness throughout the world, especially for research and training, to ensure scientists, public health experts, and first responders have the necessary resources to detect, prevent, and control viral threats. Strengthening partnerships with global health organizations, governments, and the scientific community remains essential in addressing cross-border health challenges.

Additionally, clear and transparent communication and efforts to deal with a lack of knowledge and understanding, counter misinformation, and address vaccine hesitancy are critical to ensuring public health, restoring public trust, and ensuring compliance with health measures. The rapid spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now in measles outbreaks seen globally, highlights the necessity of reliable, science-based public health information.

Children with low vitamin D levels face a greater risk of early heart disease, according to a decades-long Finnish study. Could early supplementation shift the tide on cardiovascular prevention?

Childhood 25-OH-vitamin D Levels Predict Early Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adulthood: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Image Credit: Ekaterina Markelova / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers in Finland investigated whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D) levels in childhood are associated with the development of adult-onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Their findings suggest that low childhood vitamin D levels are independently associated with the development of early-onset ASCVD in adulthood. This research may identify an important early-life risk marker for cardiovascular disease, informing targeted prevention efforts.

Previous observational studies in adults have shown that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

In an earlier paper, this team of Finnish researchers found that low vitamin D levels in childhood correlated with higher intima-media thickness of the carotid artery in adults. This is an established marker of atherosclerosis, indicating that plaque is gradually building up in artery walls. Eventually, this will cause the arteries to narrow and block the flow of blood. If the plaque bursts, it could lead to blood clots.

Due to these mechanisms, vitamin D deficiencies could increase the risk of heart disease. However, it remains unclear whether low vitamin D levels during childhood could predict actual cardiovascular events in adulthood.

Researchers examined whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in childhood are associated with ASCVD. The hypothesis is grounded in emerging evidence that early-life exposures may affect long-term cardiovascular health. Given that vitamin D influences vascular and inflammatory pathways, this study aimed to investigate its potential role as an early-life risk marker for later cardiovascular events.

The prospective cohort study used data from 3,516 participants of the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Serum 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations were assessed in 2010 using frozen serum samples originally collected in 1980, when participants were between 3 and 18 years old.

The average childhood vitamin D level was 51.3 nmol/L, with a mean age at baseline of 10.5 years. Childhood measurements also included body mass index (BMI), lipid levels (specifically low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoproteins [HDL], and triglycerides), blood pressure, dietary habits, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and physical activity.

Cardiovascular events were tracked through linkage with national Finnish health registries, including the National Health Index and the Care Register for Health Care, up to 2018. A total of 95 participants (2.7%) experienced at least one ASCVD event, with a median age at onset of 47 years.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations between different cut-off levels of childhood vitamin D and ASCVD risk in adulthood, adjusting for sex, age, and other conventional early-life risk factors.

The study specifically analyzed several thresholds (cut-points) of vitamin D levels—31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, and 43 nmol/L—to assess which concentrations were most strongly associated with future ASCVD events.

Researchers found that low levels of 25-OH-vitamin D during childhood were significantly associated with a higher risk of adult-onset ASCVD events. Specifically, having childhood vitamin D levels below 31, 33, 35, or 37 nmol/L was linked to an increased risk of ASCVD in adulthood. For example, children with vitamin D levels below 35 nmol/L had more than double the risk of developing ASCVD compared to those with higher levels (hazard ratio, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.30–3.69]; adjusted for multiple risk factors). These associations remained significant even after adjusting for numerous childhood risk factors, including BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, diet, and physical activity.

These associations remained consistent in additional analyses, including propensity score matching and adjusting for adult vitamin D levels. Nearly one-fifth of the cohort had vitamin D levels below 37 nmol/L during childhood.

The results suggest that suboptimal vitamin D status in early life is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk decades later, independent of other known risk factors.

The study also explored potential mechanisms, noting that vitamin D receptors are present throughout the vascular system and that vitamin D's active form may help reduce inflammation, regulate blood pressure, and slow vascular aging, all of which could influence long-term cardiovascular health.

This study suggests that low levels of vitamin D in childhood are independently associated with early-onset ASCVD in adulthood, highlighting a potential early-life risk marker for cardiovascular disease.

The findings support current recommendations for maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in children and could inform preventive strategies. The study's strengths include a large, population-based cohort with long-term follow-up, robust health registry data, and a comprehensive assessment of childhood cardiovascular risk factors.

However, limitations include potential measurement error from using serum samples stored for 30 years, though vitamin D is relatively stable under such conditions. The cohort was ethnically homogenous (white Europeans), limiting generalizability. Also, at follow-up, the participants were still relatively young, and many had not yet reached the ages at which ASCVD becomes more prevalent, warranting continued observation.

Additionally, the study's observational nature precludes establishing a direct causal relationship between childhood vitamin D levels and subsequent cardiovascular events.

In conclusion, the study provides early-life evidence linking vitamin D status with adult cardiovascular health. Optimizing vitamin D intake during childhood may offer a low-cost and easily implemented strategy for reducing long-term ASCVD risk; however, further research, including randomized trials, will be needed to confirm causality and refine recommendations.

Background and goal: This study evaluated the performance of an artificial intelligence–enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) and an AI-powered digital stethoscope to see how well they could detect early signs of heart dysfunction in women of reproductive age.

Study approach: In this cross-sectional pilot study, researchers examined two groups of women aged 18 to 49 who were considering pregnancy. Women who were currently pregnant or within one year postpartum were also included. The first group included 100 women already scheduled for an echocardiogram. The second group of women with no indication for an echocardiogram were seen at a primary care appointment for routine care. All participants received two tests: a standard 10-second 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and a digital stethoscope recording that captured a 15-second, single-lead ECG and phonocardiogram (heart sounds) from up to three locations on the chest. AI models analyzed the ECG and stethoscope recordings to estimate each participant's risk of having left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), a type of heart dysfunction. 

Main results: 

Group 1 (diagnostic cohort, women scheduled for echocardiograms):

Five percent of women had LVSD.

The AI-ECG showed a negative predictive value of 96.8% and the AI-stethoscope achieved 100%.

Among women who screened positive using the AI tools, 33.3% (using the AI-ECG) and 22.7% (using the AI-stethoscope) truly had LVSD.

Group 2 (screening cohort, women seen during routine primary care visits):

Using the AI-ECG, only 1% of women in this low-risk sample screened positive. A follow-up echocardiogram in that patient showed a normal ventricular ejection fraction. With the AI-stethoscope, 3.2% of the sample had a positive screen.

Why it matters: The findings from this study highlight the potential of quick, low-cost AI tools to help detect early signs of heart dysfunction during regular primary care visits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Virtual reality game using scents boosts cognitive function in older adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250430/Virtual-reality-game-using-scents-boosts-cognitive-function-in-older-adults.aspx","Thu, 01 May 2025 02:26:00 GMT","

As the global population ages, supporting older adults in maintaining their cognitive and memory functions has become a pressing concern. The United Nations estimates that by the 2070s, there will be over 2.2 billion people aged 65 or older, surpassing the global number of children under 18. This demographic shift is especially pronounced in Japan, the fastest-aging country, where 28.7% of the population is 65 or older.

One promising strategy to counter cognitive decline is through olfactory stimulation-engaging the sense of smell. Smell signals travel directly to brain regions involved in memory and emotion. Building on this knowledge, a joint research team from Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), University of the Arts London, Bunkyo Gakuin University, and Hosei University, Japan, has developed the world's first cognitive training method for older adults by combining olfactory stimulation with virtual reality (VR). The study was published in Volume 15 of the journal Scientific Reports on March 28, 2025.

VR provides a promising platform to simulate sensory conditions in a controlled yet engaging manner. By combining goal-oriented tasks with real-time feedback, our VR-based olfactory training approach can increase cognitive engagement and maximize its therapeutic impact.""

Professor Takamichi Nakamoto from Science Tokyo

The method involves an olfactory display that emits specific scents during immersive VR gameplay, activating memory- and emotion-related brain regions. In the activity, participants are asked to memorize and later match scents within a virtual environment. The experience begins in a virtual landscape. Using a VR controller, participants interact with a scent source represented by a stone statue. When touched, the statue releases a specific scent, accompanied by a white vapor cloud as a visual cue to reinforce memory.

Participants then explore the virtual landscape to locate a scent source. As they move through the landscape, the olfactory display emits subtle traces of the scent to guide them to the location. Upon reaching the odor source, shown as a stone lantern, they encounter three colored vapor clouds, each emitting a different scent. Their task is to compare the smells and identify the one that matches the original scent they memorized.

""The smell memory phase strengthens odor recognition and memory encoding by linking the olfactory stimulus with a visual cue. The navigation phase challenges players to integrate spatial navigation with odor recognition while retaining memory of the initial scent. The final odor comparison phase engages olfactory discrimination and working memory retrieval, reinforcing cognitive function,"" explains Nakamoto.

The activity led to noticeable cognitive improvements in 30 older adults aged 63 to 90. After just 20 minutes of playing the VR game, participants showed improvements in visuospatial rotation and memory. Visuospatial processing and cognitive function were assessed through different tasks. In the Hiragana Rotation Task, where they had to decide if rotated Japanese characters matched the original, scores improved from 19–82 to 29–85. In a word-based spatial memory recall task, where participants memorized word positions in a grid, scores rose from 0­–15 to 3–15. These improvements were validated through statistical analysis.

With continued research and development toward more affordable olfactory displays or alternate scent delivery methods, olfactory-based VR activities could become an accessible and engaging tool for supporting mental health in older adults.

Background and goal: Many adults aged 65 and older never receive a cognitive check during regular primary care visits. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a digital cognitive assessment for Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening into primary care. 

Study approach: From June 2022 to May 2023, seven Indiana University Health clinics offered the five-minute Digital Clock & Recall test on an iPad to every patient 65 and older. Each site set its own rules on which visit types and which staffers would run the screen and upload results to the electronic record for the physician to review. In month three, researchers introduced a registered-nurse role to support patients for completing care pathways if they were flagged for cognitive impairment. Physicians retained discretion over follow-up.

Main results

Of the 16,708 patients identified as eligible for screening, a total of 1,808 digital cognitive assessments (10.8%) were completed by 1,722 unique patients.

More than one-half (55.3%) of eligible visits never offered the digital cognitive assessment because PCPs declined or the encounter was deemed out of scope. 

Screening outcomes: Among 1,808 tests, 44.3% were categorized as unimpaired, 36.5% as borderline, and 13.7% as impaired.

During follow-up within 90 days for the impaired group, 2.1% received a new Alzheimer or related-dementia diagnosis. Additionally, 5.1% received a new mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, 16.9% had brain imaging ordered, and 62.7% were referred to the brain health navigator.

Why it matters: Digital cognitive assessments may offer a feasible way to screen older adults during routine visits, helping identify those who may benefit from early diagnosis, treatment, and care planning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study links impaired synaptic pruning to autism","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250430/Study-links-impaired-synaptic-pruning-to-autism.aspx","Thu, 01 May 2025 02:33:00 GMT","

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition in which affected individuals experience difficulties in social communication and exhibit restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. A growing body of research suggests that neurobiological changes, particularly abnormalities in dendritic spines, tiny protrusions on nerve cells where synapses form, may be a hallmark of ASD. In particular, studies have found an unusually high number of these spines in individuals with autism. This overabundance of synaptic connections could disrupt normal communication pathways in the brain, potentially contributing to the behavioral and cognitive features seen in ASD.

Under normal circumstances, the brain undergoes synaptic pruning, a process involving the removal of unnecessary or weak synaptic connections to make way for more efficient neural networks. This pruning is crucial during early development and adolescence. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, play a critical role in this process. In addition to defending the brain against infection or injury, they act like gardeners by trimming away excess synapses to help shape healthy neural circuits. However, studying how microglia function in the human brain, especially in individuals with autism, has proven difficult. Unlike in animal models, directly observing and measuring microglial activity in living humans poses technical and ethical challenges, leaving many questions about their precise role in ASD unanswered.

To study immune-related mechanisms in ASD, researchers used macrophages-immune cells derived from blood monocytes-as stand-ins for brain microglia. Then, they differentiated the macrophages into two subtypes using specific colony-stimulating factors (CSFs): granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) induced a pro-inflammatory ""M1-like"" phenotype, while macrophage CSF (M-CSF) induced an ""M2-like"" phenotype associated with tissue repair and immune regulation. To assess the ability of macrophages to clear synaptic material, the researchers introduced synaptosomes-fragments of neuronal connections-generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The study entailing the breakthrough results was published online in the journal Molecular Psychiatry on April 4, 2025.

The study found that M-CSF-induced macrophages (M-CSF MΦ) from typically developed individuals were more efficient at phagocytosis-engulfing and clearing synaptosomes-compared to GM-CSF-induced macrophages (GM-CSF MΦ). However, when derived from individuals with ASD, the M-CSF MΦ exhibited a significantly reduced ability to perform phagocytosis. This impairment in synaptic phagocytosis was associated with lower expression of the CD209 gene, which may play a critical role in the ability of macrophages to phagocytose synaptic proteins. These findings suggest that dysfunctional phagocytosis could contribute to the synaptic pruning deficits seen in ASD, with the CD209 gene potentially serving as a molecular mediator.

""This study is the first to reveal lower phagocytosis capacity of synaptosomes in ASD-M-CSF macrophages compared to typically developed-M-CSF macrophages, with a correlation to CD209 gene expression,"" said Dr. Michihiro Toritsuka, Senior Assistant Professor at the Division of Transformative Psychiatry and Synergistic Research, International Center for Brain Science, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Japan, and lead author of the study.

This pioneering research adds to a growing body of evidence implicating immune dysfunction in the neurodevelopmental alterations of ASD. While previous postmortem and imaging studies have reported increased dendritic spine density and hyperconnectivity in the brains of individuals with ASD, this study provides the first direct evidence of impaired synaptic pruning activity in human immune cells outside the brain.

Given these findings support the idea that dysfunctions in synapse elimination may extend beyond microglia to peripheral immune cells such as macrophages, Dr. Manabu Makinodan, who is the Professor at the same institution and co-corresponding author of the study, noted, ""If the decreased phagocytosis capacity of synaptosomes and decreased CD209 expression are similarly identified in the microglia of individuals with ASD in future studies, it may lead to more effective drug discovery targeting core symptoms of ASD.""

By identifying a measurable impairment in macrophage function associated with ASD, this research opens a new avenue for understanding the immune-synapse interface in autism, which can find potential applications in therapies aimed at restoring proper phagocytic function, which could be a promising future direction.

Reduced levels of a critical protein are linked to devastating brain diseases like Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Surprisingly, the protein shortage primarily affects the brain's blood vessels.

University of Connecticut researchers report in the April 16 issue of Science Advances that mutations in the TARDBP gene that reduce TDP-43 protein levels also impair the cells lining blood vessels in the brain. Called endothelial cells, they play a vital role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. When endothelial cells lack enough TDP-43 protein, they don't stick together as tightly. This creates gaps in the blood vessel walls, allowing large or toxic molecules to leak into the brain. The resulting damage may play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS.

To look more closely at this, the researchers used a mouse model carrying a TARDBP mutation known to be associated with both ALS and frontotemporal dementia. They also used a second model with genetically modified mice that deleted the protein TDP-43 only from endothelial cells, not other cells in the brain. Both mouse models showed clear signs of blood-brain barrier breakdown, brain inflammation, and behavioral deficits. This adds to the growing body of evidence that the defects in TDP-43 first observed in neurons of patients with ALS and frontotemporal dementia are also found in other cells of the brain. This may explain the varied presentations of these diseases. ALS is primarily defined by increasing paralysis, while frontotemporal dementia involves cognitive impairment. But in many cases the two overlap. Understanding cell-type specific vulnerabilities is likely to provide answers to the complex human presentations of these diseases. It may also shed light on less genetically linked diseases, like Alzheimer's, where TDP-43 dysfunction is also observed.

And although genetic mutations seem to play a role in some of these devastating brain diseases, they don't tell the whole story.

""While some people with ALS or frontotemporal dementia carry mutations in the TDP-43 protein, most patients do not-yet the protein still becomes dysfunctional in nearly all cases. This tells us that other unknown factors in the body might be causing TDP-43 disfunction,"" says School of Medicine researcher Ashok Cheemala. ""In the next phase of our research, we aim to understand what causes TDP-43 dysfunction in endothelial cells in the absence of mutations in the gene."" Cheemala and UConn School of Medicine biologist Patrick Murphy and their colleagues are working on finding other genes that might limit TDP-43 dysfunction. Some of these might provide new approaches to limit or slow the progression of these diseases.

The team is also testing whether TDP-43 disfunction may spread between the endothelium and other cells in the brain. Brain blood vessels are in constant contact with neurons and support cells like astrocytes. When TDP-43 becomes dysfunctional, it can clump, and these clumps can spread between cells. The researchers have shown that endothelial TDP-43 dysfunction occurs early in the disease. That suggests that abnormal TDP-43 might be able to infect neighboring cells, in a chain reaction.

""By discovering how TDP-43 becomes harmful and spreads, we hope to uncover new ways to protect the brain, preserve the blood-brain barrier, and stop the progression of diseases like ALS, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's,"" Murphy says.

Every year, more than 100 million animals are used globally in biomedical research, yet over 90% of drugs that appear effective in animal trials fail during human clinical testing.1 This staggering disconnect raises a critical question: Are we relying on the wrong models to understand and treat human diseases?

In response, a new frontier in biomedical science has emerged — organoids. Organoids are miniaturized, simplified versions of human organs that are grown in vitro from stem cells. These three-dimensional cellular structures self-organize to mimic the architecture and function of their tissue of origin, offering a promising new avenue for studying human development, disease, and drug responses.2,3



Schematic (A) and workflow (B) of the reported fetal and postnatal/adult tissues used for the derivation of primary human organoids (generated with BioRender).2

Ethical concerns, high attrition rates in drug development, and significant advances in stem cell technology drive this mounting interest in reducing or even replacing animal models. However, the growing popularity of these models in academic, regulatory, and industrial settings also poses the question of whether organoids can fully replicate the complexity of human disease and ultimately replace animal models in biomedical research.

Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures that are grown in vitro and mimic key functional and structural aspects of real human organs. They are typically derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or adult stem/progenitor cells isolated from tissue biopsies.2

The process begins by guiding these stem cells through a series of developmental cues using growth factors, extracellular matrix components, and mechanical signals to induce them to self-organize into complex structures resembling the target organ. These cues mirror embryonic development and are tailored to produce specific tissue types. The resulting organoids exhibit cell diversity, polarity, and in some cases, rudimentary organ-level functions.2,4

Numerous types of organoids have been successfully developed since the inception of this technology, including brain organoids with layered neural tissues, liver organoids displaying metabolic and detoxification functions, intestinal organoids with crypt-villus structures, and kidney, pancreatic, and tumor-derived models.3,4

Organoids are distinct from traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures, which lack spatial complexity, and from spheroids, which are less organized and do not mimic organ-specific architecture or function. Moreover, their ability to retain patient-specific genetic and epigenetic profiles also makes them valuable tools for personalized medicine. However, the reproducibility and scalability of organoid culture systems remain ongoing technical challenges.4,5

Organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human diseases and evaluating therapeutic responses in a physiologically relevant, human-specific context. Their ability to recapitulate the 3D structure, cellular diversity, and gene expression patterns of native tissues makes them especially valuable in studying complex diseases that are difficult to model in animals or 2D cultures.

For example, brain organoids have been instrumental in uncovering how the Zika virus disrupts neurodevelopment, leading to microcephaly. These models showed that the virus preferentially targets neural progenitor cells — a finding that was not observed in studies that used traditional murine models.6

Similarly, gut organoids have transformed cystic fibrosis research by offering personalized platforms for drug testing. Patient-derived intestinal organoids can predict cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator response, including the response for rare mutations, which has enabled the development of tailored therapeutic strategies.7

In oncology, patient-derived tumor organoids preserve the molecular and histological characteristics of the original tumor, offering a highly personalized platform for drug screening. Liver cancer organoids, for example, have been used to identify subtype-specific vulnerabilities and novel therapeutic targets, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitors.2–4

Beyond individual case studies, organoids are also increasingly being used in high-throughput drug screening to assess toxicity and efficacy profiles. Their ability to model patient-specific responses allows researchers to stratify treatment regimens, reducing trial-and-error in clinical settings and advancing the goals of precision medicine.2,5

Animal models, especially mice, have long been the cornerstone of biomedical research due to their physiological similarities to humans and their manipulability. However, cross-species differences in gene expression, developmental timing, and immune responses have been a limiting factor in the relevance of animal models for human disease.3

Organoids present several advantages over animal models:

However, organoids also have certain limitations. They lack the systemic interactions found in whole organisms, such as immune system interplay, hormonal regulation, and blood flow dynamics, which are critical for studying infections and immunotherapies. Most organoids are also limited in size, vascularization, and longevity, which constrains their utility in studying chronic conditions or whole-body pharmacokinetics 3,5

Nevertheless, organoids surpass animal models in capturing species-specific disease processes. For example, mouse models failed to replicate Zika-induced microcephaly unless the virus was injected directly into fetal brain tissue, whereas brain organoids naturally recapitulated the condition due to human-specific cellular responses.3,6

The integration of organoids with in silico models and microfluidic platforms like organs-on-a-chip further enhances their physiological relevance. These hybrid systems can mimic multi-organ interactions and dynamic microenvironments, bridging the gap between in vitro models and in vivo biology.8

With increasing regulatory recognition, organoid models are gaining traction in the pharmaceutical industry. The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act 2.0, passed in 2022, reduced mandatory animal testing requirements for preclinical drug development, allowing for validated non-animal alternatives such as organoids to be used for investigating new drug applications.1

Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are now actively integrating organoid models into their research and development strategies. Hubrecht Organoid Technology, a spin-off of the Hubrecht Institute, has partnered with global pharmaceutical companies to provide patient-derived organoids for drug screening and biomarker discovery. Similarly, Emulate Inc. uses organoids in conjunction with organ-on-chip systems to simulate tissue interfaces and physiological responses with high precision.9

These platforms are also attracting significant investment. Venture capital and public-private partnerships have channeled substantial funding into 3D tissue technologies, particularly in oncology, gastrointestinal disease, and neurology. This growing financial commitment underscores industry confidence in organoid systems as scalable, predictive, and ethically advantageous alternatives to animal models.9

However, regulatory agencies still require robust standardization and validation before organoid data can fully replace animal studies. Moreover, issues such as batch-to-batch variability, scalability, and reproducibility remain significant hurdles.9

Organoids are poised to become indispensable tools in integrated research strategies. Future improvements, such as vascularization, the incorporation of immune cells, and automation for high-throughput screening, could expand their applicability.5

Furthermore, initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas are advancing the field through the development of standardized protocols, funding, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.10 As technologies such as gene editing, single-cell sequencing, and bioengineering evolve, organoids will continue to further our understanding of the complexity of human tissues and diseases.

a, Single-cell profiling of human organoids (left) and of human primary tissue samples (right) provides complementary information. Data integration between single-cell profiles from organoids and primary tissues makes it possible to investigate the same cell type in both contexts, allowing each approach to play to its strengths. b, The Organoid Cell Atlas Portal will implement key features for analyzing and interpreting single-cell data from human organoids in the biological context provided by HCA profiles of their in vivo counterparts. 10

Organoids represent a transformative step in the field of human disease research. Their ability to replicate key features of human tissues offers an opportunity to reduce reliance on animal models, increase experimental relevance to humans, and personalize medicine.

Furthermore, although organoids are not yet ready to entirely replace animal models, their strengths in human-specific biology, drug testing, and disease modeling make them vital to biomedical research. The future of disease modeling lies in integrating organoids, animal studies, and computational models to accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early detection of primary progressive aphasia through speech and hearing tests","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250430/Early-detection-of-primary-progressive-aphasia-through-speech-and-hearing-tests.aspx","Thu, 01 May 2025 03:44:00 GMT","

Difficulty finding words or the habit of substituting them with others that are similar semantically – such as knife and cutter – or phonologically – such as knife and wife – are usually the first symptoms of a type of dementia known as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Another sign is a subtle difficulty in forming sentences, evidenced by verbal and nominal agreement errors that have never been made before, or reversal of word order, for example. Writing errors (dysgraphia) and reading difficulties (dyslexia) may also occur, so that writing and reading become increasingly difficult tasks, as does expressing ideas and thoughts.

Primary progressive aphasia is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose neurodegenerative disease that begins with language problems that affect communication and progresses to more serious cognitive changes that may resemble Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. The neurological diagnosis of this dementia syndrome requires a complete analysis that includes other cognitive functions in addition to language and communication problems.

Now, a study supported by FAPESP and published in the journal PLOS ONE has shown that this condition can be detected early using a set of speech and hearing tests known as the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Battery (MTL-BR).

The possibility of early and more accurate diagnosis is great news because the earlier treatment is started, the slower the progression of the disease tends to be. The earlier the rehabilitation, the greater the chance that the patient will be able to maintain their communication, speaking, reading and writing skills for longer. But of course we're not talking about a complete diagnosis, just a part of the assessment that can allow us to identify patients who need more monitoring and attention.""

Karin Zazo Ortiz, professor in the Department of Speech and Hearing Therapy at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) in Brazil and corresponding author of the article

In the study, the researchers evaluated 87 individuals, including 29 diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and 58 healthy individuals matched for age and educational level.

""We compared the performance of participants with and without the syndrome on a large number of tasks involving different linguistic processes. As a result, we observed marked differences in some tasks, and at this stage of the work we were able to identify the most relevant tests among the 22 tasks that make up the MTL-BR battery,"" says Ortiz.

As this is a very comprehensive and complete battery, the researcher says that identifying the key tests can help simplify the assessment, making preliminary detection quicker and more accessible.

According to the results, the tasks in which patients with primary progressive aphasia performed worst on the MTL-BR were: directed interview, oral comprehension of sentences, oral narrative discourse, written comprehension of sentences, dictation, repetition of sentences, semantic verbal fluency, naming of nouns and verbs, manipulation of objects on verbal command, phonological verbal fluency, recognition of body parts and left-right orientation, written naming of nouns, comprehension of oral text, numerical dictation, comprehension of written text, and numerical calculation (mental and written).

Ortiz explains that the battery of tests was chosen as the object of study because it provides a broad assessment of oral (speech) and written comprehension and production, as well as being the only validated test in Brazil for acquired language disorders of neurological origin.

The research is now entering a new phase, which aims to identify the most important linguistic tasks for identifying each variant of the syndrome.

The partial or total loss of the ability to understand and express spoken or written language came into the spotlight in 2022 when Hollywood actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with aphasia, which later developed into frontotemporal dementia. In the same year, Brazilian cartoonist Angeli announced that he was quitting his job because of the syndrome.

Primary progressive aphasia is a different condition from aphasia, which can arise as a result of strokes, brain tumors and traumatic brain injuries. PPA belongs to the group of diseases known as dementias. It affects the frontotemporal part of the brain and is considered even more aggressive than Alzheimer's disease.

Nevertheless, PPA is difficult to diagnose, mainly because the initial symptoms can be very similar to those of other dementia syndromes – although language impairment is much greater in relation to other cognitive domains. Another complicating factor is the heterogeneity of the cases. ""Despite the importance of language in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, there's still a lack of language assessment tools for all types of dementia, including primary progressive aphasia,"" he says.

To further complicate diagnosis, there are four subtypes of PPA. One is non-fluent or agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, which is characterized by changes in the syntactic structure of sentences, difficulty understanding complex sentences, and may be accompanied by apraxia of speech, in which the patient makes speech errors due to motor planning deficits.

Another variant is semantic primary progressive aphasia, which is characterized by difficulty understanding words due to semantic impairment, anomia, and difficulty reading and writing irregular words. Logopenic primary progressive aphasia is considered to be more similar to Alzheimer's dementia and in these cases the patient has difficulty understanding long content and commits exchanges and omissions of sounds in speech.

There is also mixed or unclassifiable PPA, characterized by language alterations in which a specific language profile cannot be identified because either the patients do not have the characteristics predicted for one of the variants or they have characteristics of several of the variants, making it difficult to specifically diagnose one of them.

""And it's in this sense that our study contributes to diagnosis, as it allows early identification of changes in language, highlighting the differences between primary progressive aphasia and other dementia syndromes,"" says Ortiz.

“I remember telling him that I'm striving to be the best player in the world. And I mean it,” Lloyd recalled in a recent conference call with reporters. “That was my individual goal. And my team, collective goal was always to be at my best so I could have helped the team win championships. So that's what I was striving for.”





For the next 14 years after that, Lloyd often flirted with that lofty status. Last December, a little more than three years after playing her final soccer match, Lloyd welcomed Alexi Lalas to her New Jersey home to conduct an interview. It turned out Lalas was actually there to let her know she has been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame Class of 2025.

The fullback is impressing with Orlando City.

While a breakthrough will sometimes appear to have happened overnight, the actual journey occurs over several seasons in relative obscurity with a lengthy development process. Players rise through multiple youth clubs and reserve sides while receiving a gradual introduction into the professional level with a few appearances per annum as managers judge their readiness. After a steady elevation, Alex Freeman is making an impact in Major League Soccer with what is looking to be a standout campaign. The 20-year-old Orlando City right fullback has impressed with his play on the wing and, in time, could provide an additional attacking dimension for the United States Men's National Team.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland and the son of former First-Team All-Pro wide receiver Antonio, Freeman relocated to Florida and attended American Heritage School. At the club level, he spent three seasons with Weston FC before joining the Orlando City SC academy. His eight goals and 15 assists helped the Under-17 team claim the MLS Next Cup, while the burgeoning prospect also suited up for the Under-23 side in the United Premier Soccer League. Eschewing a commitment to the University of Louisville, the Lions signed the “exciting young player” to a four-year contract with a one-year option.

Freeman began with the reserves in March of 2022, starting in a 2-0 win over Chicago Fire II. That season, he made 19 MLS Next Pro appearances and contributed three assists while also being included on the first-team bench for four fixtures. The following year included four goals, four assists, and a 79.1% passing accuracy in 25 matches along with his senior debut, a cameo substitution to close out an early 2-0 victory over the LA Galaxy after performing well in training.

Splitting time between the senior and reserve levels helped him to develop in higher level training and gain match experience, respectively. “I just want to get better,” Freeman told the club's official website. “I'll come down here and I just try my hardest to make an impact. I feel like every day I'm training with MLS players that have been in the league for so long. I feel like I want to learn from them every time I get a chance. I feel like I'm still kind of new to this, but I feel like I'm getting the hang of it and I'm trying to learn from so many people and put it in my game.”

Last year, Freeman increased his production with eight goals and nine assists in 27 reserve matches, becoming “more clinical” and improving his passing accuracy and defensive contributions. The “strong, fast fullback provided energy going forward” for the B team and earned the MLS Next Pro's Player of the Month award for September. He also featured in three first-team fixtures, adding an assist to close out a 5-0 rout of D.C. United; however, there were some concerns as to whether his development was being held back.

This season, Freeman is fully incorporated into the MLS squad, substituting into the opener and starting the nine successive matches. He picked up a goal in the 4-2 victory over Toronto FC, a finish and an assist in a 4-1 win over D.C. United, and another in the 3-0 rivalry romp topping Atlanta United; the first conversion involved “slipping behind the defense, running onto a long ball, and blasting a low shot from just inside of the box,” the second a header at the far post on a free kick, and the third a slotted conversion after ghosting past the back line. His manager, Oscar Pareja, believes that his player has the potential to “become one of the best fullbacks in the country,” having demonstrated his “readiness” for the level and a lack of timidity. 

“I played a lot in preseason, which was very good,” Freeman shared with local media. “It's just about taking the best out of your chances at the end of the day. In the first game, that's one of the things I did. I came in 40 minutes. I just gave him all and Oscar saw that. Now he's just trying to give me a chance, and I'm just continuing to prove to myself that I want this... I feel like for me is just gaining confidence and just perfecting my skills because when I first came here, I wasn't the best, and that's what I want to be. I want to be the best I can be, and I'm still not the best.”

At the international level, Freeman received his first United States call-up to the Under-19 team in April of 2022 and was in the squad that won the Slovenia Nations Cup. He was on the roster for the 2023 Pan American Games, led by Michael Nsien. The defender started in all five matches at the competition on the way to a fourth-place finish. 

Standing at a rangy six-foot-three, Freeman is an athletic right fullback who can also line up at winger, looking to push the tempo, displaying excellent “recovery speed,” completing a high percentage of his passes, and registering several blocks, clearances, and successful aerial duels per 90 minutes. Scouts praise him as an “amazing athlete” and “technical,” “doing things going forward at [his position that] no other American can.” His manager describes the young defender as “mature,” with the ability to “understand the moment” and “his place,” using his size and strength to dominate duels while also creating for himself and his teammates. 

“We're very happy to see the development on Alex,” Pareja said recently. “Kids play when they deserve to play. They know that when they play, they have to match the level and keep it, and that's what he's doing. Alex is growing. The opportunity that came to him, he has been taking it… I'm excited with him, and the competition that he has behind him is not easy… He's growing at the point that I think he needs to be seen by the national team.” 

Many players have enjoyed a breakout season and failed to build, but Freeman appears primed for long-term success with multiple years of experience and an appealing skill set. He has time to continue developing and could be on the receiving end of European transfer interest in the very near future, particularly if his goal-scoring production continues at a similar rate. With the fullback position often valued for form and dynamism, his name could also soon end up in the USMNT rotation, either during this World Cup cycle or more likely the next.

Real Madrid has been left with little to play for this season. The Whites suffered a resounding defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals against Arsenal. They were knocked out of their favorite competition, looking very inferior to Mikel Arteta's side, who won 5-1 on aggregate. After the blow, they turned their attention to the Copa del Rey, but Barça won that in a good game that was decided in the final stages of extra time.

With this scenario, the only option for the Whites is to cling to La Liga, which looks complicated as Barça are four points ahead and have both the head-to-head record and the overall goal difference. There is one Clásico left between the two sides on Sunday 11 May at Montjuic, which looks vital in deciding the champion.

In addition, once LaLiga is over, Real Madrid also has the incentive of fighting for the Club World Cup. This is a new title that the Whites want to add to their trophy cabinet and, as with LaLiga, it has been complicated by the many injuries that the team has suffered.

Throughout the season, Real Madrid's infirmary has always had many occupants. Since the start of the season, Dani Carvajal has been out of action with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, torn lateral collateral ligament, and torn popliteal tendon in his right leg, and Eder Militao has suffered a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, affecting both menisci in his right leg.

Both players have worked very hard and are nearing the end of their recovery in order to be fit for the World Cup. The team will need them because the last few days have been catastrophic in terms of injuries. In the last 48 hours, Rüdiger, Alaba, and Mendy have all undergone surgery.

In principle, the German center back will miss the rest of the domestic competition, but he should be available for the club tournament. However, it remains to be seen in what condition he will be and whether the excruciating pain he was suffering has improved. On the other hand, Alaba's operation went well and he is expected to be out for 6-8 weeks. The club is confident that he will make it to the Club World Cup.

The same cannot be said for Ferland Mendy, who has also undergone surgery. The full-back has suffered a tear of the proximal tendon of the rectus femoris in his right quadriceps. Mendy will be out for between 10 and 12 weeks. He will not make it to the Club World Cup.

In addition to the injuries, it remains to be seen what will happen with two players whose contracts are expiring, Lucas Vázquez and Luka Modric. There is talk that both have had their contracts extended so that they can play in the Club World Cup regardless of what happens with their contracts afterwards.

With a depleted defense ahead of the Club World Cup, Real Madrid has to make decisions. In addition to the expected arrival of Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the tournament to strengthen the back line, the Whites will have to draw on their youth academy to compete in the World Cup. José Félix Díaz has told Marca which players will be promoted to the first team to help out during this competition.

“Yusi and Valde will be responsible for helping Fran García at left-back for Real Madrid for the rest of the season,” the journalist revealed in Marca, also confirming the presence of Jacobo Ramón, Mario Rivas, and Diego Aguado.

A new format and building familiarity before the FIFA world cup are major motivating factors says Kane.

Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane is pumped for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. The month long tournament will be taking place in the USA from mid June to mid July. Yes, the fixture loaded tournament will be taking place in the break season. It however does bring its benefits, namely, to build familiarity with the conditions and crowds for the international World Cup set to happen in 2026.

Who doesn't love more football? Striker Harry Kane shares the excitement of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. A World cup style tournament but for clubs from all over the world is as global as club football can get. The revamp of the format has lent more appeal to the CWC per Harry Kane. Also, there is the factor that the actual 2026 FIFA World Cup( in which the countries play) will take place in USA. The CWC offers a great opportunity to be at the venues around the same time of the year to familiarize oneself with the conditions and spark a connection with the local fans.

In an interview with Goal , Harry Kane was asked to give his views on the CWC, the prospect of playing in the new format and in the USA. He said “ I think it's going to be great. The Club World Cup is going to be unique, playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past, but I think it's going to be a good experience. Going out to the U.S., as well, a year before the World Cup itself will be a great chance to get to know some of the stadiums and get to know the fans out there. I'm very much looking forward to it.”

While it is great to have more football, the welfare of the players is not to be taken lightly. The strain from the already heavy load of fixtures during the season warrants a sufficient rest period. However, the interest of expanding the sport globally and the money coming from it, continues to push the interest of the players to the back seat.

Bayern Munich have one hand on the league title with three games left to play. One more win, and the trophy is guaranteed to be in the possession of Die Roten. After the conclusion of the Bundesliga on May 17, the players will go into the preparation process for the FIFA Club World Cup, which starts in mid-June.

Vincent Kompany is looking to finalize the roster to bring to the USA. Apart from the current squad, Bayern Munich will also showcase some young talents from the academy. Jonah Kusi-Asare, Wisdom Mike, and Lennart Karl are all expected to have minutes in the tournament. 

Bayern fans are also looking forward to the highly anticipated debut of another young star in the summer transfer, Tom Bischof from TSG Hoffenheim. The young German's contract only expires on June 30, which makes him unavailable for the first phase of the Club World Cup. However, Bayern Munich are in negotiations with Hoffenheim to release Bischof ahead of schedule.

The talks have been going well. While talking to  Sky Sports (via iMiaSanMia), Hoffenheim director Andreas Schicker has shown great willingness to let Tom Bischof join Bayern early.

Tom Bischof has enjoyed a breakout campaign this year. He tallied six goals and three assists across all competitions. Bayern have managed to scoop up Germany's top midfield talent for a price of $0 (€0 for our European readers). The deal has been confirmed in the January transfer window. The 19-year-old will join Bayern's exciting haul of young talents and is expected to be the club's midfield maestro in the near future. And, hopefully, his legacy in red and white will all start at the FIFA Club World Cup in the coming months.

According to TyC Sports, Bayern Munich are having links with Independiente's midfielder Filipe Loyola. The Chilean international is also a very versatile player, capable of playing both as a center midfielder and as a right-back - a similar archetype as Konrad Laimer. The 24-year-old also fancies this move to the German giant.

The expected fee for this deal might fall around €15-20 million. Bayern are considered to be serious about the move and are in the advanced phase.

A 5-1 aggregate defeat in the Concacaf Champions Cup semi-final comes after a shock failure to win main domestic title

A dejected-looking Lionel Messi walked off the pitch in defeat on Wednesday after his Inter Miami team were exposed in emphatic fashion by a young Vancouver Whitecaps.

The 3-1 loss in the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup semi-final meant a 5-1 aggregate defeat to the Canadian side and no one who watched the games would question whether the scoreline was a fair reflection of the games.

A Miami team built around Messi and ageing former teammates from his Barcelona heyday – Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba – backed up mainly by journeymen players from South America, showed their age against a Whitecaps team that was faster and sharper in all areas.

Last year Miami won the Supporters Shield – for the best regular season record in Major League Soccer, with a record-breaking campaign but were surprisingly beaten by Atlanta United in the first round of the MLS Cup play-offs.

The 38-year-old Suarez, who like Messi scored 20 goals in MLS last year, now appears totally spent, his legs no longer able to get him in the positions his experience tells him he needs to be.

Busquets is a sorry shadow of the outstanding midfielder he once was and Alba, while still an attacking threat, appears to have been given permission to ignore his defensive duties.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","soccer"

A new format and building familiarity before the FIFA world cup are major motivating factors says Kane.

Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane is pumped for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. The month long tournament will be taking place in the USA from mid June to mid July. Yes, the fixture loaded tournament will be taking place in the break season. It however does bring its benefits, namely, to build familiarity with the conditions and crowds for the international World Cup set to happen in 2026.

Who doesn't love more football? Striker Harry Kane shares the excitement of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. A World cup style tournament but for clubs from all over the world is as global as club football can get. The revamp of the format has lent more appeal to the CWC per Harry Kane. Also, there is the factor that the actual 2026 FIFA World Cup( in which the countries play) will take place in USA. The CWC offers a great opportunity to be at the venues around the same time of the year to familiarize oneself with the conditions and spark a connection with the local fans.

In an interview with Goal , Harry Kane was asked to give his views on the CWC, the prospect of playing in the new format and in the USA. He said “ I think it's going to be great. The Club World Cup is going to be unique, playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past, but I think it's going to be a good experience. Going out to the U.S., as well, a year before the World Cup itself will be a great chance to get to know some of the stadiums and get to know the fans out there. I'm very much looking forward to it.”

While it is great to have more football, the welfare of the players is not to be taken lightly. The strain from the already heavy load of fixtures during the season warrants a sufficient rest period. However, the interest of expanding the sport globally and the money coming from it, continues to push the interest of the players to the back seat.

An abandoned World Cup stadium that cost $55 million to build was sold for 'less than a house' and slammed by a former England manager. 

In 1993, USA hosted England, Germany and Brazil in a round robin tournament.

Five stadiums across America hosted games, including the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan.

Advert

The Silverdome, an 80,300-seat stadium, cost $55 million to build in 1975 and when it opened, it featured a fiberglass fabric roof held up by air pressure - the first use of the architectural technique in a major athletic facility.

The state-of-the-art stadium played host to Germany vs. England in the 1993 US Cup.

Germany beat England 2-1 in a fixture that was contested indoors and had no uncertainties.

At the time, the Three Lions were managed by Graham Taylor, and he hit out at the stadium's dome feature.

Advert

""The beauty of football is its uncertainties,"" he explained.

""The more uncertainties you take away, the more boring it gets. Weather and climate play a part in our game. I wonder, when I look at a stadium like this: Is it taking away some of the uncertainties and beauty of the game?""

The grass drew criticism, too. Both teams practiced on the 14,000 square feet of hybrid grass that hosted four games at the 1994 World Cup.

Advert

The surface was left with the divots and spots, which were carefully repaired before the game with green-dyed sand.

Roger Faulkner, president of the Michigan World Cup Host Committee, said: ""People are going to be out there looking for divots with microscopes. But if you look at Soldier Field (where USA and Germany played) after the game, I'm sure there were hundreds of them.""

The Pontiac Silverdome - once home to the NFL's Detroit Lions between 1975 and 2001 - was sold for $583,000 in 2009.

  Imagine you see soccer legends like Lionel Messi or Kylian Mbappé practicing a bicycle kick with their teammates from the Argentina or France national teams. But you're not watching television, you're seeing it live on the soccer field at Gonzaga University as the team prepares for the World Cup.



  That once-in-a-lifetime experience is what Washington legislators, the city of Spokane, Visit Spokane and Spokane Sports are hoping Spokanites can experience as the city has been selected to host a team base camp for one of the teams. National soccer teams will use team base camps in the months leading up to the World Cup and during the group phase as a primary location for training, rest and preparing for their matches.



  Spokane is also slated to serve as one of nine fan zone sites across the state, featuring large screens to watch matches streamed live and acting as a local hub for the FIFA World Cup.



  Visit Spokane is helping market the fan zone, working with Seattle's World Cup organizing committee, which selected the city as a fan destination. Visit Spokane CEO Rose Noble says the fan zone will be geared toward locals in the region.



  At the heart of downtown Spokane, Riverfront Park is the ideal spot for people to enjoy the park, as well as watch the matches and purchase official merchandise without heading to Seattle, Noble says.



  ""Riverfront Park makes perfect sense, and we have the infrastructure to support a large viewing party, and being designated an official fan zone means we get all of the official branding and merchandise for FIFA,"" Noble says. ""We envision it being a very welcoming, inclusive, vibrant space that has large screens to watch some of the key games with the branding that no one else will have anywhere on the east side.""



  Spokane Sports will handle the fan zone operations. The organization's CEO Ashley Blake says via email that Spokane has always been a sports town, and the FIFA fan zone will be a great chance to curate lasting memories.



  In March, Spokane Sports created fan sites for travelers and locals to enjoy during the Women's March Madness games. They'll be able to build on that work to create unique experiences in Spokane during the World Cup.



  ""Spokane Sports is proud to work alongside partners across the region to deliver a memorable fan zone,"" Blake writes. ""Our organization has a rich history in event execution, and we're looking forward to building an electric atmosphere.""



  Currently on Gov. Bob Ferguson's desk is House Bill 1515, which will allow local governments to ask the Liquor and Cannabis Board to approve expanded outdoor alcohol service on civic campuses, such as parks, for liquor licensees within their jurisdiction.



  The bill was designed for fan zone sites like Spokane, and Seattle, which is a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The bill, if signed by Ferguson, would allow the Gesa Credit Union Pavilion to serve alcoholic beverages outside of a confined, age-restricted beer garden, with up to 100 acres of space to maximize mobility for event guests and families. It will allow Washington cities with a population over 220,000 to produce up to 25 expanded alcohol service events a year until December 2027.



  For Mayor Lisa Brown, it's a natural evolution of what can be done in Spokane, with places like Brick West already offering a large outdoor area for families to enjoy live music, drinks and food.



  ""The ability for people to come, for adults to have alcohol, and for kids to play is something we already have going on in Spokane,"" Brown says. ""I go to Brick West every year when my son plays music on the stage. I've got my little grandson there, and I just think it's something we've already shown we can do.""



TEAM BASE CAMP



  In Olympia, despite a tough biennial budget cycle, legislators also included $100,000 in the state capital budget to make improvements at Gonzaga University's practice field so it can host the team base camp.



  Alexander Scott, city administrator for Spokane, says all the qualifying national teams need to make their base camp selections by March 2026. He says that national teams may already be scouting without the city knowing.



  Currently, the three host countries including Mexico, the United States and Canada, qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Japan, New Zealand, Iran and Argentina have qualified as well. Other qualifying countries are expected to be determined by the fall.



  For Scott, a dream scenario would be to host one of the nations with a Spokane sister city, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy or Ireland.



  Scott says FIFA had to do a lot of back-and-forth with Gonzaga about their practice field, also known as a pitch. The international soccer organization has strict requirements for their pitches to have natural grass with a synthetic stitched base.



  ""FIFA technical crews were out here looking at the Gonzaga pitch and signing off on that,"" Scott says.



  Looking at past World Cups, Scott believes that there would be some collaboration for event planning between the national team that opts to stay here and the city. There will be opportunities to watch practices or youth clinics.



  ""The public would possibly be invited to attend an open practice, or they might put on clinics for youth,"" Scott says. ""For the most part, they're going to be very much going about their business and getting ready for the World Cup.""



  FIFA ruled out using university dormitories for teams to stay in while they practice during the months ahead of the World Cup, and when they're not competing in one of the host cities, Scott says.



  The official FIFA website lists Northern Quest Resort & Casino as the official hotel partner for a potential team stay in Spokane.



  Brown says she's looking forward to experiencing the fan zone sites and for people not from the region to experience all that Spokane has to offer. She says that even with the current issues around immigration, Spokane can be a connector of different cultures and languages united through soccer.



  ""Soccer — there's just something about it as an international sport that I think connects us to the world in a positive way, and I think we need that right now,"" Brown says.



  The Seattle FIFA World Cup organizing committee is excited to have Spokane on board.



  ""Spokane's fan zone is an incredible opportunity to bring the energy of the FIFA World Cup to Eastern Washington,"" says Hana Tadesse, vice president of communications for Seattle's FIFA World Cup committee. ""We're thrilled to be able to bring the celebration of soccer to everyone across the state — and especially in Spokane, the beating heart of soccer in the Inland Northwest."" ♦

The Basque club are living through their latest golden age and will make formidable opponents for the Red Devils

For Manchester United, winning the Europa League is not just about lifting another trophy. It is about survival. After their worst season since being relegated in 1974, hoisting Europe's second-biggest prize in Bilbao on May 21 would take the club back to where they both want to be and - financially - need to be: the Champions League.

For the last 30 years, United have been run as if they were always in or at least aiming to be in Europe's top competition, meaning the wage bill hasn't been altered even when they missed out on qualification. Failing to win the Europa League, though, would mean missing out on the Champions League for two consecutive seasons, something that has never happened since the club first entered the competition in 1993.

But more than pride is at stake for United. Being in Europe's top competition is worth around £100 million ($134m) and could ward off fears about financial meltdown and meeting the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability obligations. It would also make United more attractive to players in the summer transfer window, which is crucial to shaping next season. As manager Ruben Amorim put it last month: ""Being in the Champions League can change everything.""

Things are very different for Athletic Club, the team who stand in United's way of reaching the final. Athletic are having their best La Liga season in 11 years and already on course to return to the Champions League after more than a decade away. That will be their only third campaign in Europe's top competition, and they will savour it. And so with fourth-place domestically all-but secured, the Europa League is fundamentally about glory to the Basques who have the chance to win a European trophy for the first time in the club's history.

But this season's compettion is even more important than the UEFA Cup final in 1977 or the Europa League final in 2012, both of which they lost. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lift the trophy on home soil - and they are not going to give it up without a real fight.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Rodri's season-ending injury means he won't be defending the trophy he won in 2024 - so who are the main contenders to succeed the Spaniard?

If you thought the days of the Ballon d'Or generating headlines were over after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's era of dominance came to an end, then think again. After one of the most closely-fought races for a number of years, Rodri came out on top in 2024, beating Vinicius Jr into second place as Real Madrid dramatically boycotted the ceremony in Paris in protest at their star player missing out.

Unfortunately for Rodri, he will be unable to defend his crown in 2025, with the Manchester City midfielder having suffered a season-ending knee injury in September. The door, then, is open for a whole host of players to succeed the Spain star, and the race for the Golden Ball is heating up as we enter the final weeks of the European campaign.

The 2024-25 season doesn't have the same international tournaments as its two predecessors, and so the destination of the Ballon d'Or will be decided solely by club performances. That opens it up to all sorts of individuals who might not share the same success with their countries as others, while there is also the prospect of the new-look Club World Cup to consider.

So, who are the favourites for the most prestigious individual prize in world football? As always, GOAL is here every step of the way to track the contenders and the pretenders with our Ballon d'Or Power Rankings - check out who is in contention...

The Dutchman was directly involved in all of the Nerazzurri's goals as they claimed a fully deserved draw in Catalunya

Denzel Dumfries almost singlehandedly kept Inter's season alive in Barcelona on Wednesday, with the Dutchman scoring two goals and creating another in an extraordinary 3-3 draw at Montjuic.

The Nerazzurri had gone into this eagerly-awaited Champions League semi-final first leg on the back of three consecutive defeats that saw them replaced by Napoli at the top of Serie A, and dumped out of the Coppa Italia by city rivals AC Milan. Consequently, many fans feared the worst for Simone Inzaghi's side against Europe's form team.

However, Inter raced into a 2-0 lead thanks in no small part to Dumfries, who was making his first start for a month due to injury. The wing-back crossed for the fit-again Marcus Thuram to open the scoring with a stunning back-heeled finish before Dumfries doubled the visitors' advantage himself with a sensational scissors-kick.

Barca were level by the break, however, thanks to the irrepressible Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres, who did a fine job filling in for Robert Lewandowski, but Dumfries put Inter back in front when he climbed highest to head home a Hakan Calhanoglou corner midway through the second half.

The Blaugrana drew level almost immediately when Yann Sommer unwittingly deflected Raphinha's thumping drive into his own net, but Inter held on quite comfortably to ensure that a win of any variety of San Siro next week will send them through to their second final in three years.

Musetti's Top 10 breakthrough should come as no surprise given his week-to-week consistency on the tour over the last year.He's now reached the quarterfinals or better 11 times in the last 12 months, and the semifinals or better nine times—highlighted by his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon last summer, as well as his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo last month.He also won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, but that didn't contribute to his ranking as there were no ranking points there.On Thursday night he'll try to reach his 10th semifinal in the 12 months as he takes on Canadian rising star Gabriel Diallo in the quarterfinals in the Spanish capital. Diallo, who got into the draw as a lucky loser, took out another Top 20 player, Grigor Dimitrov, en route to his first career Masters 1000 quarterfinal.The two have met twice before, and they've actually split those meetings, with Diallo prevailing in a Davis Cup match in 2023, 7-5, 6-4, and Musetti getting revenge in Hong Kong this year, 6-4, 6-3.Both of those meetings were on hard courts.

The quarterfinals are set at the ATP Mutua Madrid Open, and it's a great lineup despite the top 4 seeds getting bundled out. Since there isn't a clear favourite, all eight players have a good chance of winning the title. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But which players will advance to the semifinals?

Head-to-Head: Mensik 0-1 Cerundolo

Jakub Mensik extended his win streak in the Masters 1000 to 10 matches as he displayed a fantastic performance against Alexander Bublik in the fourth round. Mensik has not been broken in his last two matches, which is a testament to his great serve. However, he will face his biggest test in the quarterfinals against Francisco Cerundolo, who is going through the best phase of his career.

Cerundolo took out the top seed, Alexander Zverev, and will look to reach his first Masters semifinal of the season. Both players are in fantastic form, but Mensik's significant advantage on serve could be the deciding factor in this matchup.

Prediction: Mensik in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Matteo Arnaldi played another solid match to defeat Frances Tiafoe in straight sets. This will be the second quarterfinal for the Italian in the Masters event and the first on a clay Masters. Arnaldi badly needed a week like this to get his game going and improve his rankings. Being seeded at Roland Garros would be his goal, and another win here would certainly get him closer to achieving that. However, beating Jack Draper is going to be a huge task. The Brit is demolishing players as every aspect of his game is working in fine order. I expect him to continue his great form and win this in straight sets.

Prediction: Draper in 2

Head-to-Head: Musetti 1-1 Diallo

Gabriel Diallo won the biggest match of his life after saving three match points in the second set tiebreak against Grigor Dimitrov. Dimitrov got a little tight, and Diallo took advantage by playing brave tennis. The Canadian player has had his fair share of luck this season, with multiple main draw appearances as a lucky loser. However, this time he has taken advantage of the second opportunity and is in his first Masters quarterfinal.

Lorenzo Musetti continues his brilliant form on clay and got the better of Alex de Minaur again. This time, he didn't let the Australian win a set, as he dominated from start to finish. If he keeps playing like this, he will put himself in a position to make another Masters final. Diallo is playing fearless tennis and has been brilliant behind his serve. However, Musetti is a good returner and can make Diallo play a lot of balls. I am going with the Italian in this one.

Prediction: Musetti in 3

Head-to-Head: Medvedev 3-0 Ruud

Daniil Medvedev made a good comeback after losing the first set to defeat Brandon Nakashima in three sets. Medvedev made the necessary adjustment and started playing aggressively in the last two sets. He makes it back-to-back quarterfinals in Madrid and would be pleased to have defended the points from last year. Medvedev has never lost a set to Casper Ruud, but this will be the first time that these two will face each other on a clay court. Ruud has played brilliantly in all his matches so far and should like his chances to get his first win against the Russian player. Medvedev will need to serve well to have a chance, as Ruud is a better player on clay from the baseline.

Prediction: Ruud in 3

Tennis legend Jim Courier did not hold back when addressing the recent doping ban imposed on Max Purcell. On a recent episode of the Tennis Channel Live podcast, Courier expressed his disbelief and frustration over the heavy-handed punishment, arguing that the current rules around doping enforcement in tennis are outdated and in dire need of reform.

“What are we doing banning people when they're not doing things that are performance enhancing?” Courier questioned. “What are we doing, banning people when they're not doing things that are performance enhancing and don't take my word for that, that's what the CEO of doping organization said herself”, said Jim.

“I don't quite understand exactly why we're punishing someone for an IV infusion. I know it's against the rules-the rules should change,” he continued. “This doesn't make sense- if you use something that effects on court performance and things that are performance enhancing, I get it we want to police it, but the rules need to change.”

The punishment extends beyond the ban itself: Purcell has also been ordered to forfeit $200,000 in prize money earned earlier this season.

“Yeah, he's also got to turn back $200,000 that he earned since the beginning of the year, so this is brutal,” Courier said. “I don't really understand it, but what I can say, I'm glad I'm retired. These rules are insane — I would not have liked to deal with these rules.”

Courier's irritated defense highlights a growing debate in professional tennis- whether the sport's anti-doping rules are truly protecting the integrity of competition, or unfairly punishing players for minor, non-performance-related infractions.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Casper Ruud extended his perfect streak in ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finals on clay to 7-0 on Thursday at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he fought past an attack-minded Daniil Medvedev.

The Norwegian rebuffed Medvedev's assertive approach with a confident display of his own to prevail 6-3, 7-5 and reach the semi-finals. Medvedev fired 23 winners and advanced to the net on 23 occasions, but Ruud remained resolute to seal a one-hour and 39-minute victory.

“I looked at our stats last night and saw he beat me on grass, outdoor hard and indoor hard. The last surface was clay so I thought ‘Please don't make it 4-0',” said Ruud. “I tried to use the surface to my advantage. I thought the level was pretty good from both players, I was impressed with Daniil's ability to produce power here on clay.

”Today it felt like he was decisive and firing from the forehand, he hit some great winners. He didn't bring what I expected.”

While Medvedev led 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Ruud, Thursday's quarter-final clash marked their first since 2021, and first on clay. Medvedev shifted to a more aggressive approach, aiming to combat Ruud's heavy topspin groundstrokes by taking them on the rise or even out of the air.

Yet Ruud remained patient, crucially saving each of the two break points he faced in the first set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and converting the only one he carved out at 5-5 in the second to advance. The 26-year-old is the first player born in 1990 or later to reach 30 tour-level semi-finals on clay.



Ruud was unable to defend his title at the ATP 500 in Barcelona two weeks ago and subsequently dropped out of the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since last February. But with his run to a ninth Masters 1000 semi-final, Ruud is up three spots to No. 12 in the Live Rankings and will return to the Top 10 if he reaches the final in Madrid.

“I came here after a tough defeat in Barcelona… I worked a little bit with myself and especially the mental aspect,” Ruud added. “I think I am coming into the tournaments with a better version of myself. I've been playing with good intensity [in Madrid] and I would like to keep it going. There has been a fire missing lately, so I am happy to bring it here in Madrid.”

He will next continue his quest for a maiden Masters 1000 trophy against the winner of Thursday afternoon's quarter-final between 20th seed Francisco Cerundolo and 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.

Novak Djokovic is not looking in great shape heading towards the French Open, which begins on May 25, according to pundit Annabel Croft; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Annabel Croft admits the pressure of what Novak Djokovic is trying to achieve by winning a landmark 100th ATP Tour title and record 25th Grand Slam is getting harder and harder.

Djokovic is already out of the Italian Open in Rome next week following a three-match losing streak, having crashed out of the Madrid Open following defeat by Matteo Arnaldi.

After defeat by Arnaldi, 37-year-old Djokovic said he had to adapt to a ""new reality"" where he's just happy to win ""a match or two"".

He faces arriving at the French Open without having won a match on clay since his emotional victory over Carlos Alcaraz last summer in the Olympic final.

Djokovic has played a fuller schedule than last season, when his bid for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title fell short, but it has not helped him find any consistent form, with the world No 5 losing his opening match in four of his last five tournaments.

Speaking to Sky Sports Tennis, former British No 1 Croft said: ""His total focus is on adding to that Grand Slam tally. He wants to move above Margaret Court [24 Grand Slam titles]; he wants to become the greatest tennis player, but it's getting harder and harder, and actually, I always feel like he's just gone a bit flat on the court as well.

""He just can't find it, he can't find that winning formula. He didn't win a major last year, which was extraordinary, but all four majors were split between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, and actually, when I look at his results, he's had some extraordinary losses to very low-ranked players - to Alejandro Tabilo [in Monte-Carlo] and Matteo Arnaldi here. Lots of different players who he wouldn't normally lose to, so he's definitely losing confidence.

""The last great match that I think he played was against Alcaraz in Australia [Djokovic won in four sets to reach the semi-finals].

""It was absolutely phenomenal but then he had to pull out after that epic tie-break first set against [Alexander] Zverev, and he hasn't been the same since, so I don't quite know what's going on, whether there's distractions, or he's just not happy, or he's lost confidence, but whatever's happening, he's not looking in great shape heading towards the French Open, and we know he's now pulled out of Rome.""

""I think he's not in great shape, so I don't know if he can sort it out ahead of the French Open.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



The Serbian has said his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon.

Djokovic began working with his long-time rival, who retired from playing in August, on a trial basis at January's Australian Open.

Djokovic still has hopes of achieving his 100th tour-level title to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admits his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams.

Colin Fleming said: ""I think he's still got an inner confidence that when the time comes, the ones that he's really motivated for the most, the Grand Slams now, to get to 25, I still think he thinks he can turn it on. I don't think he was in the right headspace to compete here [in Madrid]. It was a sort of flat and even the way he took the loss was a bit like, 'nah, whatever, yeah, on to the next one. I've pulled out of Rome, I've got to get my head right for Roland-Garros.'

""He doesn't need to be playing the tennis to beat Alcaraz and Sinner in round one in Paris. He's the master of the two-week event, building his way in, get through the first few matches, find his feet, find his form, and he'll still back himself.

""It's not ideal for him, but I wouldn't rule him out just yet of getting number 25 and indeed title number 100, but I think the 25 is the big thing for him.""

With Djokovic turning 38 on May 22, he will be searching for a fourth title at Roland-Garros but won't be a top-four seed at the second Grand Slam of the year which could lead to a blockbuster quarter-final encounter.

""His body has been tending to break down. He's 37, I think nearly 38, not going to get any easier,"" said Croft. ""I think everything is just looking very, very tough and uphill. And I think you mentioned the word aura, but you know, a lot of players now walk onto court thinking, 'well, I do have a chance against him because he's not playing great tennis'.

""They would have been panicking about whether they were going to get games on the board and now they all feel they have a chance. And that makes it doubly difficult for him.""

For the 2025 edition of New Balance's Grey Days, the brand is unveiling a special edition of the Coco CG2, the latest version of Coco Gauff's signature tennis shoe. 

Dropping on May 25th, the Grey Day model features a pale blue grey color over the New Balance logo and outsole against the cream of the rest of the shoe in place of the CG2's latest green and white colorway. 

The contrast between the softer blue grey and the lightness of the cream offset the harsh reds of clay courts, ensuring the shoe will stand out at Roland-Garros. 

The special edition shoe is a part of New Balance's Grey Days celebrations, which kick off on May 1st. Grey Days is a long tribute to the timeless quality of the brand's lasting legacy in its signature color: grey. New Balance introduced the color in the 1980s as a part of its quest to create the superior running shoe.

Grey was the defining color given the concrete pavement and asphalt roads that served as a background for many runners, eliminating the ragged look of white running shoes after they've hit the streets. And while the brand's styles evolved to embrace modern technology and creative innovation, the color continues to represent New Balance's style legacy.

The month-long event will bring together the brand's ambassadors and athletes for a variety of special-edition products, VIP events, and stories that embrace the meaning of the color grey. 

New Balance will launch the shade across 21 footwear styles and 11 apparel designs throughout May, ranging from all-time classics to modern favorites.  

The CG2 introduces a mid-cut silhouette, providing a bold, non-traditional look that differenciates it from the typical tennis shoe. The shoe is designed to improve court-ready performance while elevating the creative vision of Gauff's signature model. 

The shoe's dual-density FuelCell midsole not only provides exceptional cushioning, but it also grants energy returns to assist a player's response when recovering to the baseline. Lastly, a carbon fiber plate adds stability, ensuring the shoe meets the demands of every aspect of the game. 

This is the second time Gauff will bring the Grey Day celebration to grand slam tennis. The Coco CG2 ($160) is currently available in multiple colorways on newbalance.com.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Why Rafael Nadal became the king of clay","https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/the-warrior-by-christopher-clarey-review-x527lg0hc","Thu, 01 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Q: 

Maybe it's because I'm a Brit, so didn't spend my tennis youth bashing balls on sun-baked clay, but I've always instinctively regarded the French Open as the least important of the four grand slams. When I was growing up, the players I liked best — McEnroe, Becker, Sampras — tended not to do that well at Roland Garros. Instead, it was “clay-court specialists” who excelled, particularly, it seemed, on the men's side. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the event was dominated by a roll call of now largely forgotten players who never achieved much on other surfaces, but whose looping groundstrokes and grinding styles made them capable of bagging a French title or two: Andrés Gómez, Albert Costa, Thomas Muster, Gastón Gaudio. 

Christopher Clarey's new book is a corrective to such sniffiness. Being a biography of Rafael Nadal, it is, quite properly, much concerned with clay, and in particular the clay of Roland Garros. Clarey, formerly the tennis correspondent of The New York Times and the author of a 2021 biography of Roger Federer, The Master, doesn't just make the uncontroversial case that Nadal — winner of 14 titles in Paris — is the best clay-court player in history. 

Clarey goes further, suggesting that there was a symbiosis between Nadal and the red stuff that operated at a tactile and metaphorical level. Arriving at a new venue, Nadal would bend down and rub the clay with his hands, getting a feel for its properties. Whenever he won at Roland Garros, he would fling himself on the ground, practically grinding his glistening body in the dirt. Clay is the grittiest, most punishing of surfaces; excelling on it requires fortitude, determination and perseverance — qualities that Nadal exemplified in abundance. He and the terre battue — or “beaten earth”, as clay is known in France — truly were as one. 

Nadal, like many tennis players, came from a well-heeled family, with resources to ease his progress up the tennis ladder. He was born in 1986 on Mallorca. His father, Sebastian, is a successful businessman; his mother, Ana Maria Parera, ran a perfume shop in the family's home town of Manorca before devoting herself to bringing up Nadal and his younger sister. 

The Nadals were very much a clan — family gatherings were large — and in keeping with this, two of Nadal's uncles played a crucial role in his development. One, the footballer Miguel Ángel Nadal, a defensive midfielder for Barcelona and Spain, provided a role model of athletic success; the other, Toni Nadal, a tennis coach, was a more hands-on figure. Introducing his nephew to the game at the age of three, Toni recognised his remarkable talent and set about moulding Rafa's technique and temperament according to his own, somewhat idiosyncratic, values. 

• Rafael Nadal: Playing me was the wrong call

Uncle Toni's methods, Clarey tartly observes, wouldn't pass muster with educationalists today. An adherent of Stoic philosophy (about which he even once wrote a book), he instilled in his pupil the conviction that suffering and adversity must be embraced. Praise was rare; criticism was constant. Although his nephew was far more talented than any of the other children he taught, Toni would pointedly make him sweep the courts at the end of each session and hit balls at him whenever he was inattentive.

Most importantly, he encouraged Nadal not to take a single thing for granted, to avoid complacency at all costs. As a result, throughout his career Nadal went into each match with an underdog's mentality — a belief that calamity was round the corner. He played every point as if it were match point. Although Clarey acknowledges that all this left “scar tissue” — most obviously in Nadal's extensive range of pre-serve tics, including the infamous bottom-tugging — there's no denying that, as a tennis player, Toni's schooling served him brilliantly. 

Unlike Clarey's book about Federer, The Warrior isn't a cradle-to-retirement biography. It darts about all over the place — one chapter concentrates on Nadal's lasso-like forehand, another on his rivalry with Novak Djokovic — and chunks of it aren't really about Nadal at all: Clarey treats us to sections on different methods of clay court preparation, the early history of French tennis and the 2019 reconstruction of Roland Garros. Many of these asides are fascinating — I had no idea that clay courts in India used to be topped with dried cow's dung — but a few do seem of questionable relevance. When it came to an account of an interview Clarey once conducted with an ageing Jean Borotra, a French tennis star of the 1920s, I had a sense of him desperately scrabbling to meet his word count.

About his main man, however, Clarey is shrewd and informative. He has watched hundreds of Nadal's matches and was there, courtside, when he first emerged — an astonishing prospect, with his “unsleeved biceps and kabuki self-exhortations”, to quote David Foster Wallace's memorable phrase. As Clarey notes, Nadal wasn't just an outlier in terms of his talent, but in the very way he played the game. No one had ever imparted so much topspin to the ball, resulting in groundstrokes that kicked viciously up from the baseline; no one had played with such physical intensity. “It's a style of tennis no one up to that point had ever faced,” Mats Wilander told Clarey in 2005, after practising with Nadal at Roland Garros the day before his first grand-slam semi-final. 

• Rafael Nadal's dignity in defeat is what I will treasure the most

Where does Nadal stand in the pantheon of tennis, and particularly alongside his two great rivals, Federer and Djokovic? Clarey, while acknowledging Djokovic's superior overall numbers (and remember, the Serb is still going), suggests that no individual tennis record is more astonishing than Nadal's tally of 14 Roland Garros titles. And he has a point. 

There is a temptation to downplay that achievement, suggesting that it was somehow easy for Nadal, as a mere clay-courter, to emerge victorious in Paris year after year. But tennis history rebuts that viewpoint. Very few players have won Roland Garros multiple times; after Nadal, the male record holder is Bjorn Borg, with six — an achievement sufficiently impressive for Ilie Nastase to predict in the 1990s that it would never be bettered. Meanwhile, Federer won eight Wimbledons, and Djokovic has ten Australian Opens.

At a certain point, however, in respect of these three greats, the numbers stop mattering very much — a point that Nadal, the most humble of the “Big Three”, clearly grasped some time ago. As he once told Clarey: “I don't need to get to 21 or 22 or 23 grand slams to pass or match someone. What will happen will happen … I cannot always be looking at the outside because it's a recipe for constant unhappiness.” Uncle Toni, I'm sure, would be proud.

Nick Kyrgios is making headlines once again as he shakes up the tennis world with his unexpected return to the French Open after an eight-year hiatus. But hold on to your seats, folks, because there's a twist in this comeback story that will leave you shocked!

While fans were ecstatic to hear about Kyrgios' Roland Garros appearance, it has been revealed that the Australian star will not be competing in the singles competition. That's right, Kyrgios will be gracing the courts of Paris, not for singles, but for doubles alongside his compatriot Jordan Thompson.

The decision to skip singles is not a matter of choice for Kyrgios, as he does not possess the required ranking or protected ranking to secure a spot in the singles draw. This unexpected turn of events has left many scratching their heads, wondering what prompted this strategic move by the fiery Aussie.

Despite the disappointment of not seeing Kyrgios in singles action, fans can still look forward to a dynamic duo on the doubles court as Kyrgios and Thompson team up to take on the competition at Roland Garros. With Thompson in need of a new partner following Max Purcell's ban from the sport, the pair is set to bring their A-game to the doubles tournament.

Criticism has been directed towards the French Tennis Federation (FFT) for their strict wildcard policy, which often favors homegrown talents over international players. This policy has put players like Kyrgios in a tough spot, forcing them to explore alternative routes to participate in prestigious tournaments like the French Open.

As the tennis world buzzes with speculation and anticipation, one thing is for sure – Nick Kyrgios is back, and he's ready to make a statement in Paris. Stay tuned as the enigmatic Australian star prepares to light up the doubles court at Roland Garros, promising an exciting and unpredictable storyline in the world of tennis.

By Natalia Lobo

April 30, 2025 11:16PM EDT

Jana Novotna's Wimbledon victory in 1998 stands as one of the most emotional and memorable Grand Slam moments in tennis history. The Czech star enjoyed a decorated career, lifting 100 titles, 76 in doubles and 24 in singles, including 12 Grand Slam doubles crowns. But for many, she was long defined by a heartbreaking loss at the All England Club in 1993, and the emotional win that followed five years later.

Novotna turned professional in February 1987 and quickly made her mark with an elegant serve-and-volley game that was rare and stood out in the women's game. By 1990, she had cracked the top 15, and in 1991, she reached her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, losing to Monica Seles after notching wins over Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.

That was the first of four major singles finals she would reach. But none were as unforgettable as Wimbledon in 1993. “If I could do it again I would – all of it – except I would win Wimbledon three times this time around,” she once said.

En route to the final, Novotna defeated both Monica Seles and Martina Navratilova. In the title match, she led Steffi Graf 4-1 in the third set and held a point for 5-1. Then came a double fault, and a sudden collapse. Graf rallied to win 7-6, 1-6, 6-4.

Novotna, devastated, wept on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder during the trophy ceremony, which is one of the most remembered images in the history of Wimbledon. “I know you will win it one day, don't worry,” the Duchess whispered to her.

She was World No. 2, a Wimbledon finalist, has a unique WTA record and retired at only 29

Years later, Novotna reflected on that loss not as a failure, but a turning point. “It wouldn't sound great to say the 1993 final was the one I was most proud of because I lost the match when I was ahead,” she told Wimbledon, as cited in a 2018 article. “But it meant so much for me and maybe it made me a better player, a better person and maybe that match helped me to accomplish a lot more in my career.”

Novotna came close again in 1997, reaching the final but falling to Martina Hingis in three sets. By then, she had developed into a more complete player, but still couldn't convert the big moment into victory.

Then came 1998. After beating Hingis in the semifinals, Novotna entered the final as the favorite against France's Nathalie Tauziat. Just weeks away from turning 30, she held her nerve, winning 6-4, 7-6 and clinching the tiebreak 7-2. She was the oldest first time Grand Slam champion in the Open Era until 2010.

It was a full-circle moment, not just for Novotná but for everyone who had watched her journey. Once again, she stood beside the Duchess of Kentthis time holding the Venus Rosewater Dish.

While her singles journey is the most famous chapter, Novotna was also one of the greatest doubles players of her era. She won 12 major titles and completed a double career Grand Slam in doubles, partnering with some of the best players of the 1990s.

She retired from professional tennis at the end of 1999, having reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals one last time. She continued to be a regular presence at the tournament, playing in the Invitation Doubles and working as a BBC commentator.

In 2005, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Later, she turned to coaching, mentoring future French Open and Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.

Novotna lived in Florida until 2010, then moved back to the Czech Republic with her partner, former Polish tennis player Iwona Kuczyńska. They settled in the village of Omice, near her hometown of Brno.

She died of cancer on November 19, 2017, at age 49. She had kept her diagnosis private, sharing the news only with those closest to her. Her death prompted a wave of tributes from across the tennis world, who remembered not only a champion, but a player who inspired generations.

Across the course of their legendary careers, champions of the sport win hundreds of matches – for the most prolific, more than 1000.

Some of those wins stand clear as having greater impact than others, an invaluable career-boosting shot of confidence.

These 10 match victories this century changed the course of the winner's career for the better.

Serena Williams may have won 23 Grand Slam singles titles and cemented her status as arguably the greatest women's player in tennis history, but at the time of this match, she'd only won one major, and many were wondering if she'd win another, given it was nearing three years since her 1999 US Open title.

In six previous meetings with sister Venus, she'd lost five.

This is why her 6-2 6-2 Miami semifinal thumping of Venus – who'd recently peaked at world No.1 and had won three of the previous four Miami titles – was so significant.

“I think that was the biggest win of my career,” she declared. “I was just playing unbelievable … My gosh, I was really focused.

“I think it definitely removed a mental block for me. But this is just one match of many. Just one win. You can't just beat someone one time. You have to beat them several times.”

That's exactly what she did, beating Venus the next five times – all in Grand Slam finals.

Ranked No.9 at the time of the Miami Open in 2002, she swept the remaining three Slams of the season to become a dominant world No.1. Her subsequent win at Australian Open 2003 meant she simultaneously held all four major titles to complete the ‘Serena Slam'.

Roger Federer had long been touted as a future superstar, but prior to Wimbledon 2003, he had played 16 Grand Slam main draws and never gone beyond the quarterfinal stage.

Everything clicked at the All England Club that year when Federer won his final 13 sets to storm to his first major title. After outplaying No.8 seed Sjeng Schalken for his first major quarterfinal win, he beat Andy Roddick in straight sets in the semis, and Mark Philippoussis 7-6(5) 6-2 7-6(3) in the final.

“I proved it to everybody, you know. It is a big relief to me because there was pressure from all the sides, also from myself. I wanted to do better in Slams,” Federer said.

It was a result that well and truly released the shackles. Federer went on to win five consecutive Wimbledon titles, and eight overall, among his staggering eventual haul of 20 Grand Slam singles titles.

Before winning Wimbledon 2003, the Swiss' win-loss record in his first 16 Grand Slam main draws was 29-16 (64.44%).

His next 16, after Wimbledon 2003? He won 10 of them and built a win-loss record of 95-6 (94.06%).

Like Federer, Nadal was a prodigious talent but was especially formidable on clay. So when he met Federer in the third round at Miami in 2004, aged 17, few expected him to beat the world No.1 – the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion – on a quick hard court.

Instead, Nadal completely outplayed Federer, surprising the Swiss 6-3 6-3 in their first professional meeting.

“I played almost perfect tennis today because I was playing inside the court, dominating the exchanges and pressing him so he couldn't play his game,” Nadal said. “I served extremely well today, probably I never served like this in my life.

“I'm very happy because I played one of the best matches in my life.”



The result also meant Nadal had created a blueprint for approaching matches against Federer, one he steadfastly and successfully followed to win six of their first seven meetings.

Little more than a year after that result, Nadal hoisted his first Grand Slam singles trophy at Roland Garros, having beaten Federer again, en route in the semifinals.

Novak Djokovic's two singles victories in the Davis Cup final of 2010 helped deliver Serbia a 3-2 victory over France, and its first Davis Cup title.

Roared on by a passionate crowd at Belgrade Arena, Djokovic described the triumph as the “number one” moment in his career at the time. “It was two days and two nights celebration,” he said. “It was an historical win, maybe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play and win the Davis Cup at home in front of almost 20,000 people.”

TWO DECADES OF AO DOMINANCE: Novak down the years

It was a result that buoyed him. Those victories in Belgrade were the first two in an outstanding 43-match winning streak, which delivered seven straight titles (Australian Open, Dubai, Indian Wells, Miami, Belgrade, Madrid and Rome).

“The Davis Cup win may have a big role in my great performance here in this tournament,” Djokovic said after his AO 2011 triumph. “After we won Davis Cup title I was feeling great on the court, just eager to compete.”

Djokovic's 41-0 start in 2011 remains the best start to a season since John McEnroe in 1984.

Entering the London 2012 Olympic Games gold medal match, Andy Murray had several negative records to overcome.

He'd lost his past three finals, and six of his past eight meetings with Roger Federer, his opponent in the Olympic final. Just three weeks earlier, Federer had beaten Murray on the same court for the 2012 Wimbledon title, his third straight win over the Brit.

With the backing of a parochial crowd at Centre Court this time around, Murray overwhelmed the Swiss 6-2 6-1 6-4.

“When I look back on the match, it will be one that I'll look at as the biggest win of my career for sure. It's definitely one of the best matches I played,” Murray assessed.

“I think come US Open time, I hope that this will have given me the confidence to go in there and believe in myself a bit more than I have in the past, give myself a shot at winning there.”

Having slipped to 0-4 in his first four major finals, Murray won the US Open just six weeks later. When he returned to the All England Club, he won the 2013 Wimbledon title, ending a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion.

After he won gold, Murray won 24 of his next 25 Grand Slam matches, including two of the four majors.

Angelique Kerber had never beaten Victoria Azarenka when they entered Rod Laver Arena for their AO 2016 quarterfinal. She'd lost all six meetings, including one two weeks earlier in the Brisbane International final.

Despite losing the first set, Azarenka gained control of this meeting too, when she led 5-2, 40-0 on serve in the second set, with a bundle of set points to force a third.

Kerber significantly increased the speed and intensity of her ball striking and erased those set points, and two more at 4-5, to completely change the course of the match for a 6-3 7-5 win.



“She doesn't lose it, I actually won it,” Kerber said. “It's changed. It was not always like this. In the past I had a lot of matches where I was hoping, just trying to move, catching every ball. But against top players, like also Vika, you must [be] going for it.”

Kerber went on to win her first Grand Slam title two matches later over Serena Williams. It commenced a banner season during which she also reached the Wimbledon final, won the US Open, and ended the year at world No.1.

Naomi Osaka had long been earmarked as a future star, and started to show real promise with her Indian Wells title in 2018.

But she kept hitting a mid-tournament block at the Grand Slams – until later that year at Flushing Meadows.In the match of the fortnight, and in what remains their only meeting, Osaka upstaged another future star, Aryna Sabalenka, in a gloriously big-hitting battle. She wept after clinching a 6-3 2-6 6-4 victory, which landed her in a Slam quarterfinal for the first time in 11 attempts.

“Every time I play a Grand Slam, people ask me am I going to go farther than the third round. Then in Australia I went to the fourth round, then people were like, ‘Are you going to go farther than that or is that where you're going to stop?'” Osaka explained.

“I've always dreamed of playing here and going to the quarterfinals and further. So I'm just glad I could do one of my goals.”

Osaka went on to win the tournament over Serena Williams, the first of four Slams she won between 2018 and 2021.

Each time the Japanese star has won a fourth-round match at a Grand Slam tournament, she has gone on to win the title.

Ash Barty had climbed the rankings in the past two seasons and recently reached her first major quarterfinal at Australian Open 2019.

Two-time major champion Petra Kvitova trounced her there, which made her Miami victory over the Czech two months later all the more resonant.

Barty entered their quarterfinal meeting in Florida 0-4 against the powerful lefty. But she earned a 7-6(6) 3-6 6-2 triumph and a few days later went on to win the title.

“It's amazing that I have been able to achieve it,” the Aussie said after being Kvitova, which assured her top-10 debut. “But there is still a long way to go, and I'm not satisfied. I'm still hungry to get better as a person and as a player. If that means that the ranking gets higher and higher, that's pretty cool, as well.”

The Miami title was her first at WTA 1000 level. Two months later, she claimed her first major title at Roland Garros and hit world No.1 – an extraordinary rise in the space of just half a year.

The Kvitova win was the first of four consecutive victories over the Czech, and Barty ultimately won five of their last six meetings.

For all of her power and big-match abilities, Sabalenka struggled for the first few years of her career at the majors.

By mid-2021 she'd won 10 career titles, including four at WTA 1000 level – two in Wuhan, plus Doha and Madrid – but she had failed to pass the fourth round in her first 14 Grand Slam main-draw appearances.

This changed when she won a pulsating last-16 encounter with Elena Rybakina at Wimbledon in 2021. 

“I'm really happy I finally broke this wall. I'm in the quarterfinals,” she said after her 6-3 4-6 6-3 win. “Really looking forward for the next match. Hopefully I can keep going.”

The upswing in her Grand Slam record was instantaneous. Sabalenka went on to reach the semifinals that fortnight, and from Wimbledon 2021, she reached at least the semifinals at eight of her next 10 majors.

The zenith came at Australian Open 2023, when she won another incredible match against Rybakina for her first Slam title.

She defended her title at AO 2024 and won the US Open title that year, ending the season at world No.1.

Any belief Jannik Sinner may have lacked to break his Grand Slam duck at Australian Open 2024 was attained with his win over the great Novak Djokovic just two months earlier.

In the 2023 Davis Cup semifinals, a trophy the patriotic Serbian had openly targeted, Sinner stared down three match points before emerging a 6-2 2-6 7-5 winner.

Italy went on to secure the trophy and Sinner entered the 2024 season brimming with confidence.

“At the end of the year I played really good. I have still the confidence inside me, for sure,” he said upon arriving in Melbourne.

“It gives you a good feeling when you lose so many times and then you win finally because it shows also the progress you're making as a player.”

Sinner had lost four of his first five meetings with Djokovic before flipping the script in that Davis Cup encounter, which ended Djokovic's unbeaten 21-match run in Davis Cup singles matches.

When they met again in the Australian Open 2024 semifinals, Sinner repeated the feat, stunning Djokovic in four sets to reach his first major final. Djokovic had never previously tasted defeat in an AO semifinal.



Sinner went on to win the title and also the US Open in a season in which he won 73 of 79 matches and rose to world No.1.

Former Tennis Star Reveals Shocking Insights on Novak Djokovic's Partnership with Andy Murray

In a surprising turn of events, former tennis star Steve Johnson has come forward to share his thoughts on Novak Djokovic's current struggles and his partnership with Andy Murray. Despite Djokovic's recent setbacks, Johnson believes that Murray will continue to support the Serbian player, especially at Wimbledon.

Since teaming up with Murray, Djokovic has faced mixed results on the court. While he managed to reach the Australian Open semifinals, an unfortunate injury halted his progress. Subsequent tournaments have seen Djokovic falter, with a three-match losing streak and early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

Johnson expressed his skepticism about the effectiveness of Djokovic and Murray's partnership, stating, “It is very strange to watch him lose matches like this consecutively. I don't see the Murray partnership paying off.” Despite his doubts, Johnson acknowledged the importance of Murray's presence, particularly during the upcoming grass court season.

Fellow tennis player Sam Querrey echoed Johnson's sentiments, emphasizing the significance of maintaining consistency leading up to Wimbledon. Johnson concurred, highlighting the need for Djokovic to have Murray in his corner to avoid any potential backlash from the Wimbledon crowd.

Djokovic himself has been candid about his form, admitting after a loss in Madrid that he doesn't consider himself a top contender for the French Open. However, with seven Wimbledon titles under his belt, Djokovic remains a formidable force on the grass courts. Amidst uncertainties surrounding his partnership with Murray, Wimbledon may prove to be Djokovic's best chance for success this season.

As Djokovic navigates through a challenging period in his career, all eyes will be on how he and Murray tackle the upcoming tournaments, with Wimbledon looming large on the horizon.

Merseyside once again will be playing host to the 23rd Liverpool International Tennis Tournament in what is expected to be a huge week for the city.

The event will take place on June 19 and run until June 21 at the Liverpool Cricket Ground in Aigburth, as it has done since 2014. Players from all over the world will be coming to compete ahead of the run up to the Wimbledon Championships, which begin later in the month.

Previous competitors include the likes of former world number one, Novak Djokovic, Emma Raducanu and Wimbledon Champion, Neal Scupski who was present in Liverpool just last year.

The tournament was first introduced by Northern Vision Sporting Events in 2002 as a warm up event for players before Wimbledon. Since then, Northern Vision has introduced tennis to over 100,000 local juniors through its Liverpool-based events, including the Liverpool International Tennis Tournament and Liverpool Junior International Tennis Tournament.

After last year's event, organisers at Northern Vision have evolved and become more engaged with the community. As a result of this, organisers are now in a position to give local players wildcards to junior tournaments that can give their career a chance to ignite.

Event organiser Anders Borg, is delighted with the progress Northern Vision has had over the last year regarding community aspects.

He said: “It is great. It is very important for us. Being the organiser, we are able to give local players wildcards. It is a real community value for us.”

A positive from Northern Vision's community development involves Liverpool's very own, Abi Redman, who will be competing at the event this year. The local star is looking forward to being back in the city after victory in November at the Liverpool Tennis Centre.

She said: “I'm so excited to come back to the Liverpool International this year. It is an event unlike any other I have played in so far in my career.

“The atmosphere is so fun, and I love playing on grass. Growing up locally, my Grandad used to umpire at this event so I used to come and watch, hoping one day I would also play here.”

After a successful period, Redman is now ranked around 600th in the world as she looks ahead to Liverpool Internationals in June. The teenager is coming into the tournament off the back of a third set tiebreak win at the Liverpool Tennis Centre, in which she was selected as a wildcard.

Her victory meant she was offered a full scholarship in America, a great achievement for her and a showcase of the importance of community value.

Opportunities for Redman first soared when she had the chance to compete internationally in 2022 after she received a wildcard from event organiser Borg, to compete in her first ITF main draw in Liverpool.

On the international experience, Redman said: “I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to travel the world playing tennis. One of the most uncomfortable but important lessons I have learned is that tennis is a brutal sport.

“I've learned how vital self-belief is when playing at these high levels. The difference between winning and losing can be a single point, which can be disheartening.”

Redman is also extremely grateful for the opportunity that was handed to her by Borg especially with the unfortunate circumstances that were in front of her.

“Investing in young talent is incredibly important. It's especially difficult to progress in the North as there are nowhere near as many opportunities as in the South. Having someone like Anders [Borg] to support you with Wild Cards can help with confidence and progress my game to what it is today,"" she said.

After progress off the court, this year's tournament promises to be better than ever and Borg can not wait.

“I am always very excited when the spring and summer comes around, the grass court season has started. We want to bring tennis out of a little bit of a snobbish environment and bring it out to the people,"" he said.

“This year we are hosting it at the legendary Liverpool Cricket Club, which is one of the oldest sporting grounds in England.

“It is certainly the highlight of our tennis schedule throughout the other organised events in Norway and in Spain. The Liverpool National is definitely my favourite. I have been there for 23 years and saw how the city has evolved over the years- it has become a fantastic place.”

With excitement already building, full focus is on the tournament, starting on the 19th June. Players are set to be announced in the next few weeks during the build up to the event.

Tickets start at just £22 with children able to go for free and VIP access also available.

Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas' Participation in Upcoming Tennis Exhibition Hangs in the Balance Due to Scheduling Conflict

The anticipation is high as Spain's renowned tennis duo, Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas, are slated to showcase their talent in an exhibition match scheduled to take place in Huelva this July. The couple, known for their prowess on the court and off, is set to dazzle fans at the event organized to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Spain's oldest tennis club. Joining them on the court will be Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, promising an exciting display of skill and sportsmanship.

However, the event faces a major hurdle as it coincides with the second week of Wimbledon, one of the most prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the tennis calendar. With players from around the world vying for the coveted title, there is a looming question mark over the participation of the four stars in the exhibition match. Should they progress to the main draw of Wimbledon, they may opt out of the event to focus on the Grand Slam competition.

Adding to the uncertainty is Paula Badosa's current physical condition, as she is recuperating from a recent back injury. Sustained during the third round of the Miami Open in a match against Clara Tauson, Badosa displayed her resilience by clinching victory in straight sets with a score of 6-3, 7-6. In a recent interview with the WTA, Badosa shared insights into her recovery journey, expressing optimism about her progress. She revealed, “My back is good, slowly getting better. It's been a tough injury, honestly, this one because it was totally different from the last one. It was an injury that was touching the nerves, so I was constantly having pain.”

As fans eagerly await further updates on Badosa's recovery and the final decision regarding the Huelva exhibition, the tennis world is brimming with excitement and speculation. Will the dynamic duo of Badosa and Tsitsipas grace the courts in Huelva, or will their focus shift to the prestigious Wimbledon tournament? Stay tuned for more developments as the tennis season unfolds.

Novak Djokovic's Career in Jeopardy: Former World No.8 Reveals Shocking Revelation

In a stunning turn of events, Novak Djokovic's once illustrious career seems to be spiraling out of control. The former World No.1 has suffered a series of unexpected defeats, including a recent loss to Matteo Arnaldi in the Madrid Open. Djokovic, known for his dominance on the court, has been struggling to find his form this season, with four opening match losses in his last five tournaments.

Former World No.8, John Isner, has dropped a bombshell by suggesting that Djokovic has his sights set on only one title – the prestigious Wimbledon Championship. Is Djokovic's singular focus on Wimbledon a sign of his waning passion for the sport? Is he ready to concede defeat at other major tournaments like the Roland Garros?

Despite mounting pressure from former players urging him to retire, Djokovic remains defiant. With his eyes set on clinching one more career Grand Slam, the Serbian star is determined to defy the odds and secure victory on the grand stage once again. But with each passing tournament, doubts loom larger over Djokovic's ability to reclaim his former glory.

As Djokovic withdraws from the Italian Open in Rome following his shocking loss in Madrid, fans and critics alike are left wondering – is this the beginning of the end for the tennis legend? With a string of unprecedented defeats and a wavering hunger for titles, Djokovic's future in the sport hangs in the balance.

Stay tuned as the tennis world holds its breath, waiting to see if Djokovic can rise from the ashes and prove that he still has what it takes to reign supreme on the court. The stakes have never been higher for the Serbian superstar as he navigates this turbulent chapter in his storied career.

Follow:


            Former tennis world No. 1 Andre Agassi's pro pickleball debut at the US Open Pickleball Championships has come to an end, after he and partner Anna Leigh Waters fell in their second match to Len Yang and Trang Huynh-McClain.
    


            Agassi – an eight-time grand slam singles champion on the tennis court – and Waters clinched a victory in their first match over Stevie Petropouleas and Tristan Dussault with a 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 win in the mixed pro division on Wednesday in Naples, Florida.
    


            But the winning start, which marked the 55-year-old Agassi's pro debut in the sport, was short-lived with the dynamic duo losing out in their next match to Yang and Huynh-McClain in three sets: 11-7, 4-11, 7-11.
    


            Agassi had nothing but praise for Waters – the 18 year old No. 1-ranked player in the world – ahead of the tournament, saying: “She's right up there with the greatest ever in what she does and the idea of challenging myself to not screw things up for her is daunting,” per Reuters.
    


            Once relatively niche, pickleball – a mashup of tennis, table tennis and badminton that can be played indoors or outdoors, by single players or in pairs – now claims to be the United States' fastest-growing sport.
    


            An estimated 48.3 million adults played it at least once between 2022 and 2023, according to the Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP), which is nearly 19% of the total US population.

            “He's so good,” she told CNN Sports earlier this year. “And he's played a little more, he's physically so much stronger and quicker (than me). His sense for this game, how quickly he picked it up, was absolutely phenomenal to watch.
    


            “Not that I didn't see it in the other sports that he's so good at, but he picked it up and he loved the analysis of it, from the beginning on watching videos and other clips. When he goes out and plays with some of the professionals, he will have very specific questions that he needs answered to get better.”
    


            Since discovering his love for pickleball, Agassi has become a vocal advocate of the sport. Promoting the game in India recently, he defended tennis as “the most difficult racket sport in the world” but lauded pickleball as a more accessible alternative.
    


            “It's going to grow like you can't even imagine,” Agassi said, adding that he could “absolutely” see pickleball at the Olympics.
    


            However, regardless of his aptitude for the sport, Agassi is unlikely to be pursuing full-time pro status anytime soon.
    


            “If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now,” he said, per Reuters.

What to know about his Florida pickleball debut","https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/2025/05/01/andre-agassi-pickleball-results-anna-leigh-waters-us-open-tennis/83385512007/","Thu, 01 May 2025 15:54:01 GMT","

Andre Agassi, the eight-time tennis Grand Slam champion, made his professional pickleball debut at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championship in Naples, Florida on April 30.

Agassi, was partnered with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked female pickleball player in the world. Waters, 18, had the idea to play with Agassi after seeing him play pickleball on YouTube.

""She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,"" Agassi told CNBC.

Agassi and Waters played their first pro mixed doubles match April 30, a day after Agassi's 55th birthday.

Here's what to know about Andre Agassi, the tennis legend's pickleball debut and results at the U.S Open:

Agassi and Waters were pushed to three games in their first match at noon, where they faced the teen duo of Tristan Dussault, 16, and Stevie Petrpouleas, 13.

""Coming out here with Anna Leigh, I was more nervous than a gypsy with a mortgage,"" Agassi told CBS Sports. ""This is a metaphor for life: choose your partners well.""

While Agassi struggled early, he and Waters settled down to avoid an upset.

Tied 7-7 in the final game, Agassi and Waters scored four consecutive times, with Agassi scoring the game-winning point for a 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 victory.

Agassi and Waters didn't fare as well in the second match at 6:30 p.m., losing to Len Yang and Trang Huynh-McClain in three sets, 7-11, 11-4, 11-7.

""I'm really excited,"" Huynh-McClain said on the YouTube Pickleball Channel. ""Andre Agassi was my growing up idol. So it's really phenomenal. I did say in the beginning of the tournament, I wish I could play them in mixed so it came true and really fun playing with Len. And he just did a phenomenal job. And I'm happy that we went out with a win.""

Agassi is 55 years old. Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas.

His pro pickleball debut at the U.S. Open in Naples came one day after his 55th birthday.

Agassi's wife is fellow tennis legend Steffi Graf, 55. They met at Wimbledon in 1992.

The pair married in 2001 and have two children: son Jaden Gil Agassi, 23, and daughter Jaz Elle Agassi, 21.

Aggasi and Graf live in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Agassi was married to actress Brooke Shields from 1997 to 1999.

Agassi was asked by Us Weekly where he stands with Shields after the release of her book, ""Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old.""

“I have always wished nothing but the best for her,” Agassi told the outlet. “I guess maybe one of the reasons why I don't know much about it is because I don't want to be in a position to necessarily comment on it one way or another, except rooting for her. I mean, at the end of the day love wins and I try to love everyone.”

Agassi's net worth is estimated at $145 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

His pro tennis career earnings total $31,152,975, per the ATP Tour.

During his tennis career, Agassi had deals with Nike and Adidas, worth millions. According to the LA Times, Agassi's Nike deal, which ended in 2005, was reportedly worth $120 million over 10 years.

In a moment that pickleball fans won't soon forget, tennis legend Andre Agassi made his pro pickleball debut Wednesday night alongside world No. 1 Anna Leigh Waters at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships.

The superstar duo delivered a thrilling three-set win in their exhibition match against teenage talents Stevie Petropouleas (13) and Tristan Dussault (16). Agassi and Waters took the first set 11-8, dropped the second 11-9, but stormed back to clinch the third 11-7 in front of a packed and energized crowd.

“When Anna Leigh Waters asks you to do anything, you say yes,” Agassi said on Tuesday before the match. “That's how much I respect what she's managed to do in this great game.”

The 18-year-old Waters has long been one of the sport's brightest stars, but even she admitted that teaming up with Agassi was a surreal experience.

“Honestly, my mom and I were the ones who came up with the idea,” Waters said. “I was like, ‘Andre's been playing so well. We watched him on YouTube. This will be so much fun.'”

The partnership isn't just about star power — it's also about performance. And despite a few early jitters, Agassi proved he's no stranger to pressure.

“When was the last time you ever did something for the first time?” Agassi said. “I'm going to categorize it as — I'm going to have more fun [than Waters].""

The crowd certainly had fun. The match delivered both high-level competition and plenty of entertainment.

Waters, who made her debut at the age of 11 with her grandfather at the same tournament, saw the moment as a full-circle milestone. “Seven years later, I am here playing with Andre Agassi, which is pretty crazy.”

As for Agassi, the experience may not end here. “A win for me will be when this is over, that Anna Leigh looks at me and says, ‘Do you want to play again?'” he said.

Waters didn't hesitate. “Run it back. Run it back next year.”

Sinner accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him.

The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol, which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy.

Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis.

""Yes, yes. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping,"" Sinner said.

""I didn't feel really comfortable in the locker room, where I ate. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently, and I didn't like it at all. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way.

""I didn't feel comfortable, and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense that I take a little break, it will do me good.""

Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month.

""Slowly, I'm getting back into the rhythm of real training with a goal in front of me,"" Sinner said.

""Sometimes it goes very well, sometimes there is a drop, and I don't know why, so I will certainly be very happy to return to the court.

""Especially in Rome, it is a special tournament for me, but I certainly enter with a slightly different mentality. I miss the competition. 

""I am certainly very happy that this phase is now over and we are ready to start again.""

Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion.

""I mean, I don't even want to answer. Everyone is free to say what they want, everyone can judge, but that's okay,"" Sinner said.

""It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all, also what I went through, and it was very difficult.

""I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Across the course of their legendary careers, champions of the sport win hundreds of matches – for the most prolific, more than 1000.

Some of those wins stand clear as having greater impact than others, an invaluable career-boosting shot of confidence.

These 10 match victories this century changed the course of the winner's career for the better.

Serena Williams may have won 23 Grand Slam singles titles and cemented her status as arguably the greatest women's player in tennis history, but at the time of this match, she'd only won one major, and many were wondering if she'd win another, given it was nearing three years since her 1999 US Open title.

In six previous meetings with sister Venus, she'd lost five.

This is why her 6-2 6-2 Miami semifinal thumping of Venus – who'd recently peaked at world No.1 and had won three of the previous four Miami titles – was so significant.

“I think that was the biggest win of my career,” she declared. “I was just playing unbelievable … My gosh, I was really focused.

“I think it definitely removed a mental block for me. But this is just one match of many. Just one win. You can't just beat someone one time. You have to beat them several times.”

That's exactly what she did, beating Venus the next five times – all in Grand Slam finals.

Ranked No.9 at the time of the Miami Open in 2002, she swept the remaining three Slams of the season to become a dominant world No.1. Her subsequent win at Australian Open 2003 meant she simultaneously held all four major titles to complete the ‘Serena Slam'.

Roger Federer had long been touted as a future superstar, but prior to Wimbledon 2003, he had played 16 Grand Slam main draws and never gone beyond the quarterfinal stage.

Everything clicked at the All England Club that year when Federer won his final 13 sets to storm to his first major title. After outplaying No.8 seed Sjeng Schalken for his first major quarterfinal win, he beat Andy Roddick in straight sets in the semis, and Mark Philippoussis 7-6(5) 6-2 7-6(3) in the final.

“I proved it to everybody, you know. It is a big relief to me because there was pressure from all the sides, also from myself. I wanted to do better in Slams,” Federer said.

It was a result that well and truly released the shackles. Federer went on to win five consecutive Wimbledon titles, and eight overall, among his staggering eventual haul of 20 Grand Slam singles titles.

Before winning Wimbledon 2003, the Swiss' win-loss record in his first 16 Grand Slam main draws was 29-16 (64.44%).

His next 16, after Wimbledon 2003? He won 10 of them and built a win-loss record of 95-6 (94.06%).

Like Federer, Nadal was a prodigious talent but was especially formidable on clay. So when he met Federer in the third round at Miami in 2004, aged 17, few expected him to beat the world No.1 – the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion – on a quick hard court.

Instead, Nadal completely outplayed Federer, surprising the Swiss 6-3 6-3 in their first professional meeting.

“I played almost perfect tennis today because I was playing inside the court, dominating the exchanges and pressing him so he couldn't play his game,” Nadal said. “I served extremely well today, probably I never served like this in my life.

“I'm very happy because I played one of the best matches in my life.”



The result also meant Nadal had created a blueprint for approaching matches against Federer, one he steadfastly and successfully followed to win six of their first seven meetings.

Little more than a year after that result, Nadal hoisted his first Grand Slam singles trophy at Roland Garros, having beaten Federer again, en route in the semifinals.

Novak Djokovic's two singles victories in the Davis Cup final of 2010 helped deliver Serbia a 3-2 victory over France, and its first Davis Cup title.

Roared on by a passionate crowd at Belgrade Arena, Djokovic described the triumph as the “number one” moment in his career at the time. “It was two days and two nights celebration,” he said. “It was an historical win, maybe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play and win the Davis Cup at home in front of almost 20,000 people.”

TWO DECADES OF AO DOMINANCE: Novak down the years

It was a result that buoyed him. Those victories in Belgrade were the first two in an outstanding 43-match winning streak, which delivered seven straight titles (Australian Open, Dubai, Indian Wells, Miami, Belgrade, Madrid and Rome).

“The Davis Cup win may have a big role in my great performance here in this tournament,” Djokovic said after his AO 2011 triumph. “After we won Davis Cup title I was feeling great on the court, just eager to compete.”

Djokovic's 41-0 start in 2011 remains the best start to a season since John McEnroe in 1984.

Entering the London 2012 Olympic Games gold medal match, Andy Murray had several negative records to overcome.

He'd lost his past three finals, and six of his past eight meetings with Roger Federer, his opponent in the Olympic final. Just three weeks earlier, Federer had beaten Murray on the same court for the 2012 Wimbledon title, his third straight win over the Brit.

With the backing of a parochial crowd at Centre Court this time around, Murray overwhelmed the Swiss 6-2 6-1 6-4.

“When I look back on the match, it will be one that I'll look at as the biggest win of my career for sure. It's definitely one of the best matches I played,” Murray assessed.

“I think come US Open time, I hope that this will have given me the confidence to go in there and believe in myself a bit more than I have in the past, give myself a shot at winning there.”

Having slipped to 0-4 in his first four major finals, Murray won the US Open just six weeks later. When he returned to the All England Club, he won the 2013 Wimbledon title, ending a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion.

After he won gold, Murray won 24 of his next 25 Grand Slam matches, including two of the four majors.

Angelique Kerber had never beaten Victoria Azarenka when they entered Rod Laver Arena for their AO 2016 quarterfinal. She'd lost all six meetings, including one two weeks earlier in the Brisbane International final.

Despite losing the first set, Azarenka gained control of this meeting too, when she led 5-2, 40-0 on serve in the second set, with a bundle of set points to force a third.

Kerber significantly increased the speed and intensity of her ball striking and erased those set points, and two more at 4-5, to completely change the course of the match for a 6-3 7-5 win.



“She doesn't lose it, I actually won it,” Kerber said. “It's changed. It was not always like this. In the past I had a lot of matches where I was hoping, just trying to move, catching every ball. But against top players, like also Vika, you must [be] going for it.”

Kerber went on to win her first Grand Slam title two matches later over Serena Williams. It commenced a banner season during which she also reached the Wimbledon final, won the US Open, and ended the year at world No.1.

Naomi Osaka had long been earmarked as a future star, and started to show real promise with her Indian Wells title in 2018.

But she kept hitting a mid-tournament block at the Grand Slams – until later that year at Flushing Meadows.In the match of the fortnight, and in what remains their only meeting, Osaka upstaged another future star, Aryna Sabalenka, in a gloriously big-hitting battle. She wept after clinching a 6-3 2-6 6-4 victory, which landed her in a Slam quarterfinal for the first time in 11 attempts.

“Every time I play a Grand Slam, people ask me am I going to go farther than the third round. Then in Australia I went to the fourth round, then people were like, ‘Are you going to go farther than that or is that where you're going to stop?'” Osaka explained.

“I've always dreamed of playing here and going to the quarterfinals and further. So I'm just glad I could do one of my goals.”

Osaka went on to win the tournament over Serena Williams, the first of four Slams she won between 2018 and 2021.

Each time the Japanese star has won a fourth-round match at a Grand Slam tournament, she has gone on to win the title.

Ash Barty had climbed the rankings in the past two seasons and recently reached her first major quarterfinal at Australian Open 2019.

Two-time major champion Petra Kvitova trounced her there, which made her Miami victory over the Czech two months later all the more resonant.

Barty entered their quarterfinal meeting in Florida 0-4 against the powerful lefty. But she earned a 7-6(6) 3-6 6-2 triumph and a few days later went on to win the title.

“It's amazing that I have been able to achieve it,” the Aussie said after being Kvitova, which assured her top-10 debut. “But there is still a long way to go, and I'm not satisfied. I'm still hungry to get better as a person and as a player. If that means that the ranking gets higher and higher, that's pretty cool, as well.”

The Miami title was her first at WTA 1000 level. Two months later, she claimed her first major title at Roland Garros and hit world No.1 – an extraordinary rise in the space of just half a year.

The Kvitova win was the first of four consecutive victories over the Czech, and Barty ultimately won five of their last six meetings.

For all of her power and big-match abilities, Sabalenka struggled for the first few years of her career at the majors.

By mid-2021 she'd won 10 career titles, including four at WTA 1000 level – two in Wuhan, plus Doha and Madrid – but she had failed to pass the fourth round in her first 14 Grand Slam main-draw appearances.

This changed when she won a pulsating last-16 encounter with Elena Rybakina at Wimbledon in 2021. 

“I'm really happy I finally broke this wall. I'm in the quarterfinals,” she said after her 6-3 4-6 6-3 win. “Really looking forward for the next match. Hopefully I can keep going.”

The upswing in her Grand Slam record was instantaneous. Sabalenka went on to reach the semifinals that fortnight, and from Wimbledon 2021, she reached at least the semifinals at eight of her next 10 majors.

The zenith came at Australian Open 2023, when she won another incredible match against Rybakina for her first Slam title.

She defended her title at AO 2024 and won the US Open title that year, ending the season at world No.1.

Any belief Jannik Sinner may have lacked to break his Grand Slam duck at Australian Open 2024 was attained with his win over the great Novak Djokovic just two months earlier.

In the 2023 Davis Cup semifinals, a trophy the patriotic Serbian had openly targeted, Sinner stared down three match points before emerging a 6-2 2-6 7-5 winner.

Italy went on to secure the trophy and Sinner entered the 2024 season brimming with confidence.

“At the end of the year I played really good. I have still the confidence inside me, for sure,” he said upon arriving in Melbourne.

“It gives you a good feeling when you lose so many times and then you win finally because it shows also the progress you're making as a player.”

Sinner had lost four of his first five meetings with Djokovic before flipping the script in that Davis Cup encounter, which ended Djokovic's unbeaten 21-match run in Davis Cup singles matches.

When they met again in the Australian Open 2024 semifinals, Sinner repeated the feat, stunning Djokovic in four sets to reach his first major final. Djokovic had never previously tasted defeat in an AO semifinal.



Sinner went on to win the title and also the US Open in a season in which he won 73 of 79 matches and rose to world No.1.

World number one men's tennis player Jannik Sinner will be making his return from a three-month doping ban in Rome on 4 May. However, there was a time the Italian felt he should walk away from the sport. Those thoughts came to Sinner's mind when he defended his Australian Open crown earlier this year.

Sinner
accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him.

The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy.

Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis.

“Yes, yes. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping,” Sinner said.

“I didn't feel really comfortable in the locker room, where I ate. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way.

“I didn't feel comfortable and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense where I take a little break it will do me good.”

Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month.

Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been
banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion.

“I mean, I don't even want to answer. Everyone is free to say what they want, everyone can judge, but that's okay,” Sinner said.

“It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all also of what I went through and it was very difficult.

“I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay.”

Jannik Sinner nearly walked away from tennis earlier this year, revealing he seriously considered quitting before accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

In an interview with Italy's RAI, the world No. 1 admitted, “Yes,” when asked if retirement had crossed his mind.




“Before the Australian Open, it wasn't a happy time,” Sinner said. “I didn't feel comfortable – in the locker room, at meals – players were looking at me differently. I told myself, ‘Maybe I need to step away after Australia.' But I never wanted the ban.”

Despite the inner turmoil, Sinner went on to defend his title in Melbourne, clinching a second straight Australian Open crown in January.




It wasn't until February that the settlement was reached in the doping case, after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March 2024.

“I had a tough time accepting these three months because I knew that I didn't do anything wrong. So why do I have to pay this price?” Sinner said. “But then we discussed it with my lawyer and about what could have happened in the worst-case scenario, and so we decided to accept it.”

The handling of Sinner's case raised questions about double standards. The positive tests weren't publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September.

The settlement also raised eyebrows, as it conveniently allows Sinner to return next week at the Italian Open – his home tournament – without missing any Grand Slams.




“The last year was definitely very stressful,” Sinner said in the interview, which aired late Tuesday. “But we were still able to obtain incredible results. We started this year really well, too. Then what happened, happened. At the start it was a bit strange to find myself in that situation. Also, a lot of things happened off the court that I didn't expect.”

Several top players suggested Sinner was treated too lightly.

“I don't even want to respond. Everyone is free to say what they want. For me, the important thing is that I know what happened,” Sinner said. “I don't wish it upon anyone who is innocent to go through what I went through.”

Despite having played just one tournament this year, Sinner held on to his top ranking during the ban because No. 2 Alexander Zverev and No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz didn't earn enough points in his absence to overtake him.

“I miss the competition,” Sinner said. “I'm very happy that this period is done, and I'm ready to play again.”","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","tennis"

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner says Australian Open atmosphere pushed him to the edge as he reflects on emotional toll of suspension.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has revealed that he contemplated stepping away from tennis during his doping suspension, citing emotional distress and isolation from the locker room atmosphere at the start of the 2025 season. “I remember before the Australian Open this year, it wasn't a very happy time,” said the 23-year-old. “I didn't really feel comfortable in the locker room, where we were eating. Players were looking at me differently. I said to myself: “maybe I need to take some time off after Australia.”

Sinner served a three-month suspension following a positive test for clostebol, which he and his team attributed to accidental contamination from a topical treatment during a massage. Though initially cleared by an independent tribunal, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the ruling, and Sinner ultimately accepted a negotiated ban to avoid risking a longer sanction.

“I had a tough time accepting these three months,” he said. “Because I knew that I didn't do anything wrong. So why do I have to pay this price? But then we discussed it with my lawyer and about what could have happened in the worst-case scenario, and so we decided to accept it.” Sinner leaned on his inner circle for support, crediting his family and lawyer for guiding him through the mental and legal battle.

Now cleared to compete again, Sinner is set to return at the Italian Open on May 7th. Despite the setback, he has held on to his No. 1 ATP ranking and is determined to turn the page. “This time away gave me perspective,” Sinner said. “Now I just want to compete again and do what I love.”

Inside the Baseline…

Sinner's honesty peels back the curtain on how off-court controversies can unravel even the sport's steadiest minds. His discomfort in Melbourne's locker room and the frustration of being punished for what he maintains was an innocent mistake offers a raw look at how fragile the balance is between public perception and personal truth in pro sports.

Coco Gauff lost her first seven matches to Iga Swiatek—at one point trailing their head-to-head 11-1—but the American is 3-0 since the end of 2024, stunning the former world No. 1 in a 6-1, 6-1 demolition to reach her first Mutua Madrid Open final.""[I'm proud of] the mentality I had through the whole match,"" she said on-court after the match.

She saved her most dominant performance for the Caja Magica, where she had never been past the fourth round in four previous appearances. After dropping a 6-0 first set to Dayana Yastremska in her opening match, Gauff has adjusted to the high-altitude conditions with aplomb, scoring back-to-back victories over Belinda Bencic and No. 7 seed Mirra Andreeva to book a rematch with Swiatek.By contrast, the No. 2 seeded-Swiatek has struggled throughout her title defense, playing three three-setter against Alexandra Eala, Diana Shnaider, and Madison Keys.

""So, for me, it was just about making sure my level stayed the same and actually trying to raise it. I knew in the second set, I had to raise it because she could come back!""

Two points from defeat, Swiatek snapped the streak of games with service hold but continued to struggle with her range—striking 21 unforced errors off the forehand side alone—as Gauff earned three match points with an ace. One more big serve brought her over the finish line and into the final.Standing between Gauff—who struck 18 winners to just seven from Swiatek—and the biggest clay-court final of her career will be the winner of the tournament's second semifinal between world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and streaking No. 17 seed Elina Svitolina, who came to Madrid fresh off a title run in Rouen.Gauff could become the third woman to beat both Swiatek and Sabalenka this year, having already done so en route to winning the WTA Finals last fall. If she wins the title, she will pass Swiatek for No. 2 in the WTA rankings.

After advancing at the Mutua Madrid Open on Thursday, Casper Ruud took time to acknowledge someone who didn't.The Norwegian, who defeated Daniil Medvedev to advance to the semifinals, sent a note on X to Iga Swiatek after the Pole's one-sided, 6-1, 6-1 loss to Coco Gauff in their semifinal.

Swiatek was once 11-1 against Gauff, including a 6-3, 6-1 victory in the 2022 French Open final.

Formula 1 is back in the 305 for the Miami Grand Prix and the second Sprint weekend of the season. With an extra session of scoring in F1 Fantasy on the table, there's plenty at stake.

It's not too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer each week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

F1 Fantasy points are also awarded in the 100-kilometre Sprint, so the right selection decisions continue to be as important as ever. The Strategist takes a look at seven F1 Fantasy assets that can be your north star this weekend in south Florida.

Remember to lock in your teams before the Sprint, commencing at May 3 at 1200 local time (1600 UTC).

Race Highlights: 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri arrives in Miami leading the World Drivers' Championship with three Grand Prix victories to his name so far in 2025.

In Fantasy terms, the Australian is second for points per one million dollars spent this season (1.41), representing great value for his 35% ownership.

Piastri's remarkable consistency of consecutive double-digit F1 Fantasy scores stretches all the way back to Las Vegas 2023 – exactly what you want from the most popular driver for the 2x DRS Boost this season.

However, the McLaren racer finished P13 in Miami last season. Can he make it three victories on the trot this year in Florida?

Piastri's impressive start to 2025 makes him a fantastic F1 Fantasy option

Alex Albon has scored 61 F1 Fantasy points this season, the most among all drivers not from the ‘Big Four' of McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari – the four squads above Williams in the Teams' Championship.

The Thai racer arrives in Miami on the back of four double-digit F1 Fantasy hauls in his first five races of this campaign.

Saudi Arabia was the second time this season (China being the other) where Williams secured a double-points finish in a 2025 Grand Prix, following a pre-season of promise.

Albon only requires 10 F1 Fantasy points for a price rise in Miami, which is very attainable with an extra point scoring session, in a car that now looks like it could help Williams establish themselves as the leading midfield outfit.

Albon has finished in the top 10 in four races this season

Liam Lawson's friendly price point makes him an attractive option in Miami.

The New Zealander is averaging 8 points in his last two appearances for Racing Bulls after a sluggish start to 2025.

He will be determined to rediscover the kind of form that turned in 54 F1 Fantasy points across four Sprint weekends for the Faenza-based team in 2024 and 2025.

With only 6% ownership, Lawson stands out as a great differential option this weekend.

Lawson has a solid record in F1 Fantasy on Sprint weekends

Fernando Alonso's two trips to Miami with Aston Martin have fetched top-10 finishes in each Grand Prix, including a podium in 2023.

With the car not quite performing like it was two seasons ago, the Spaniard has now sunk to the fourth-lowest priced driver in F1 Fantasy.

Many fantasy players would consider $6.4m a steal for a driver with his race craft and experience, and the Strategist agrees.

As Alonso only needs 11 points for the maximum $0.6m increase this weekend, this is very much within reach with the Sprint providing an extra point scoring opportunity.

Alonso is making his way back onto the F1 Fantasy radar

Gabriel Bortoleto once again features on the Strategist's radar this week.

Although 12 points over the last four races is nothing to get excited about, the Kick Sauber driver becomes an attractive option because of his price.

McLaren and Ferrari, the two most expensive constructors in the game, are drawing the attention of many an F1 Fantasy player and the Brazilian's friendly price makes him a compelling set-and-forget option that cannot go any lower than his current price.

Bortoleto can also be a great low-risk asset for those looking to preserve cost cap value whilst on Limitless – a popular chip to use in-game over the coming race weekends.

Other drivers to monitor: Lando Norris, Oliver Bearman

Bortoleto is worth picking up, with the Brazilian's price making him an attractive budget enabler

McLaren are on record-setting pace to start the year with four wins from the first five races in 2025.

In F1 Fantasy it's no different – the team has been the highest scoring constructor every weekend this year.

EXCLUSIVE: ‘I've always been very hard on myself' – Inside Lando Norris' battle to deliver his best on and off the track

In the most recent F1 Sprint in China, McLaren recorded 101 points – the highest score of any asset this season – and fell just short of the century mark again in Bahrain.

With the Sprint weekend being the best source of points for drivers and teams alike, expect the papaya squad to lead the charge once again.

McLaren continue to provide fantastic production week in, week out

The Scuderia have outscored their front-running rivals Mercedes and Red Bull in the last three race weeks, coming away with 193 points in that span.

Ferrari also rule the pit stop roost, contributing 45 points to their team score on the back of efficient tyre changes each race since the China double disqualification.

GALLERY: Ferrari reveal special co-designed livery for Miami Grand Prix

After starting out the season as the highest owned constructor in F1 Fantasy, their current ownership (21%) is now approaching differential territory.

With Ferrari responsible for the highest score by a constructor this season not named McLaren (73 – Bahrain), expect the team from Maranello to exceed this mark on a Sprint weekend.

Other constructors to monitor: Red Bull, Haas

Ferrari are building back into form after a slow start to the year

Limitless is an optimal chip to deploy for Sprint events. With the deadline coming at the start of the Sprint on these weekends, it provides an additional session of point-scoring opportunities for your team.

Playing this chip earlier in the season can prove to be advantageous, when team budgets are lower than they typically would be later in the year. If you haven't already played it in China, it might be advantageous to play it this weekend.

Alternatively, with rain in the forecast for the weekend, you might consider using No Negative or Autopilot if the weather takes a turn for the worse. These chips would protect against any unforeseen DNFs, which we saw unfold in spades during the Australian Grand Prix.

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Miami Grand Prix

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Miami is a bit of a mix of a couple of big braking events, which you get on a lot of modern circuits.

That's Turn 11 and Turn 17, at the end of really long straights, so you've got to be good on the brakes. They're obviously overtaking opportunities but also areas to make mistakes and lock up and blow a lap.

PALMER: Verstappen's Turn 1 penalty proved decisive in Jeddah, so were the stewards right?

The first sector is a fast, sweeping set of corners through S-Bends and you've got to pick your line, watch the kerbs – that's important – and if you get fractionally off line you can lose track grip.

The triple apex left-hander, Turns 6-8, is tough on the front-right tyre and a particular problem in the race, and the exit is crucial as it leads onto a long straight.

F1 NATION: Piastri to push on? Norris to bounce back? Verstappen the underdog? It's our Miami Grand Prix preview

Norris claimed his debut F1 victory at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix

Pirelli will bring a tyre range that is one step softer than the selection used during last year's Miami Grand Prix, with the C3 as the hard compound, the C4 the medium and the C5 the soft.

The fact that it is a Sprint weekend also means that the slick tyre allocation changes a little; each driver still receives two sets of hard tyres, but they receive four medium sets rather than three and six softs instead of eight, bringing the total to 12 sets rather than the standard 13. The number of wet-weather tyres remains the same.

READ MORE: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Miami Grand Prix?

Pirelli's weekend preview reads: “The surface of the track that runs around the stadium is very smooth, exposing the tyres to moderate longitudinal and lateral forces. Thermal degradation will be a major factor, as temperatures are expected to be very high, given that last year's track temperature exceeded 55C.

“The surface was relaid in 2023 and, as with the other temporary Grand Prix circuits, grip levels will increase significantly the more the track rubbers-in across the weekend. The presence of support races for the F1 ACADEMY and Porsche Carrera Cup North America will only add to this phenomenon.

“So far, the Miami Grand Prix has been a one-stop race, including last year's. The medium was the tyre of choice for the opening stint for 15 of the 20 drivers, before a switch mainly to the hard, with just a couple of drivers opting for the soft, which actually displayed relatively low degradation.

“The performance differential between all three of last year's compounds, C2, C3 and C4, was quite small. The strategy, particularly the timing of the pit stop, was affected by a Virtual Safety Car, which then morphed into a full Safety Car period.

READ MORE: What is the weather forecast for the 2025 Miami Grand Prix?

“It will be interesting to see if this year's softer compounds will open the door to a two-stop strategy.”

The Sprint will again feature as part of the Miami Grand Prix weekend

The Miami Grand Prix weekend will begin with a new name at the top of the championship standings, after Oscar Piastri's commanding performance last time out in Saudi Arabia saw him claim a third win of the season as well as moving up to the head of the leaderboard.

That off-track moment in the rain-affected Australian Grand Prix aside, Piastri has been in consistently strong form so far in 2025 – and while he now becomes the hunted rather than the hunter, McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes that the 24-year-old will only get stronger.

TECH WEEKLY: Why a key Ferrari trait is holding Sainz back at Williams – and the ‘muscle memory' he's now having to work to undo

However, the weekend ahead could pose some interesting challenges for Piastri from his rivals. Lando Norris might be trailing his team mate by 10 points in the standings, but the Briton scored a memorable debut victory at last year's race in Miami – could a return to the scene of his triumph help him to climb back to the top?

Max Verstappen, meanwhile, is another driver to experience past success at the Miami International Autodrome, having taken two Grand Prix wins as well as proving victorious in the Sprint back in 2024. After being hit with a five-second time penalty in Jeddah, the Red Bull man will likely be keen to make up for that disappointment this weekend.

Elsewhere, Ferrari arrive into the event off the back of Charles Leclerc claiming his first podium of the year in Saudi Arabia, while Mercedes faced a low-key outing at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. It will be fascinating to see which team has the better performance in Miami.

And behind them, the midfield battle remains thrillingly close. A double-points finish last time out has given Williams a firm grip on P5 in the standings – but Haas remain only five points behind, while Aston Martin, Racing Bulls, Alpine and Kick Sauber follow. Will the addition of the Sprint this weekend help any of those teams to grab some valuable extra points?

Race Highlights: 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

The Miami International Autodrome has provided plenty of memorable moments since its arrival onto the F1 calendar in 2022. On this occasion, though, we're rolling back just one year to the 2024 race, in which Lando Norris famously took his long-awaited first F1 victory.

Saturday's Sprint had not gone well for the Briton, who found himself out of the running on Lap 1 when a four-car squeeze at the first corner tipped his McLaren into a spin.

EXCLUSIVE: ‘I've always been very hard on myself' – Inside Lando Norris' battle to deliver his best on and off the track

However, Norris' fortunes dramatically improved come Sunday, with a mid-race Safety Car coming at the perfect time for the man who had originally started from P5 on the grid. Having extended his opening stint, Norris pitted to emerge as the race leader, a position that he maintained to the chequered flag to seal an emotional maiden win.

""Bad decision after bad decision was made,"" says writer-director Joel Souza. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	After several years and enormous tragedy, the ill-fated Rust will finally be released on Friday.


	And the Western's writer-director, Joel Souza, has complicated thoughts on his creation — given the death of the movie's cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was accidentally shot in 2021 by the film's star, Alec Baldwin. After much debate, Souza and the cast and crew returned to finish the film.




	“[Hutchins' family] wanted it completed,” Souza told The Guardian. “I'd been repelled by the thought of going back, but [then] it started to appeal. And I couldn't live with the idea of someone else doing it.”

					'Rust' Review: Alec Baldwin Leads a Competent but Uninspired Western Haunted by Death and Scandal		
			









	That said, Souza quite naturally wishes he could go back in time and have never made the film. “Talk about the butterfly effect — I wish I never wrote the damn movie,” he said. “You think about the chain of events that started that morning [of the shooting]. Bad decision after bad decision was made.”


	Prop armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter over this role in the shooting, but the charges were dismissed in December due to mishandled evidence. 


	“We're not friends,” Souza says of Baldwin. “We're not enemies. There's no relationship.” 


	Souza added that he hasn't watched the actor's recent cringey-cheerful family reality show on Max, The Baldwins, which has generated dismal ratings and audience scores. “I think I was busy hitting myself in the face with a frying pan that night [it aired],” Souza said.


	All told, the resumption of filming was an emotionally difficult time. The bullet that killed Hutchins also wounded Souza in the shoulder. So the director literally had to resume filming the actor who shot him, however unintentionally. 


	“I was a mess going in and a mess coming out,” Souza said. “The crew carried me through. My family carried me through. Emotionally, I was all over the map.”


The Hollywood Reporter‘s review of the film called it, a “no-frills Western, a classic story of cowboys and outlaws that revels in gorgeous scenery and the Puritanical moral dilemmas foundational to much of this nation's mythology. The film is competently made and absorbing at times, but there's a workaday quality that slows its momentum. It's a handsomely made project, but a story about such a complicated set of characters should make us feel more strongly, and Rust struggles to accomplish that.” The review also praises the cineamatography, which was started by Hutchins and completed by Bianca Cline. “It's not clear where Hutchins' work ends and Cline's begins, but the end result is harmonious and visually compelling. There are some impressive moments that play with shadows and silhouettes, and no shortage of dramatically staged gun battles.”

	











	Starting May 2, Rust is getting a limited theatrical release and will be available to buy for $14.99 to stream online on Apple TV, Prime Video and other video-on-demand platforms.

“I love all my children,"" the two-time Oscar winner says.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Robert De Niro is sharing nothing but “love and support” for his daughter, Airyn De Niro, after she came out as transgender.


	The two-time Oscar winner shared in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, “I loved and supported Aaron as my son, and now I love and support Airyn as my daughter. I don't know what the big deal is. I love all my children.”




	De Niro shares Airyn and her twin brother Julian with actress Toukie Smith. The legendary actor also has five other children, including his most recent baby, Gia, whom he welcomed in 2023 with his girlfriend, Tiffany Chen.

	Earlier this week, Airyn opened up about her transition during an interview with Them, saying that seeing other successful trans women helped her navigate her personal journey, despite being a self-proclaimed “late bloomer.”

	“Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success…I'm like, you know what? Maybe it's not too late for me,” she explained. “Maybe I can start.”


	Airyn added, “I think a big part of [my transition] is also the influence Black women have had on me. I think stepping into this new identity, while also being more proud of my Blackness, makes me feel closer to them in some way.”


	After the Them story was published, Airyn took to her Instagram Story to share her appreciation for the support she's received. “Thank you to everyone who's been so sweet and supportive! I'm not used to all these eyes on me,” she wrote. “Also for the folks asking if I have representation or signed to anyone, I am literally just a girl with a phone, so sorry if I miss your messages!”

In a scathing ruling, the judge who oversaw the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games blasted the tech giant for willfully ignoring the court's injunction. 'Fortnite' is set to return to the App Store next week. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Apple‘s antitrust woes are growing, with a judge referring a criminal case against the tech giant to federal prosecutors for violating court-imposed rules to maintain revenue from its borderline monopoly over segments of the App Store.


	Under the ruling, Apple is barred from imposing commissions on payments made outside an app or restricting developers from telling users about alternative payment options that allow them to bypass fees on sales in the App Store, where the company exacts a toll of up to 30 percent on all transactions.

	“Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court's Injunction,” wrote U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. “It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover-up made it worse.”


	In a statement, Apple said, “We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.”


	The court's ruling will allow companies across Hollywood, like Spotify, to link to discounted rates and payment methods, allowing them to bypass Apple's commission.


	After an antitrust trial between Apple and Fortnite creator Epic Games in 2021, Rogers found that Apple violated California's unfair competition law by implementing policies that “stifle consumer choice,” though she stopped short of finding an illegal monopoly. She allowed the company to delay implementing changes to App Store payment rules pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to review the case last year.


	The court's injunction was immediately supposed to go into effect, but Apple continued to engage in anticompetitive conduct, the order stated. It pointed to the company charging a 27 percent commission on off-app purchases, where it previously charged nothing.


	In contrast to Apple's in-court testimony, internal business documents revealed that it “knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” wrote Gonzalez, who stressed that Apple vice president of finance Alex Roman “outright lied under oath.” Internally, App Store chief Phillip Schiller advocated that Apple comply with the court's injunction but was overruled by chief executive Tim Cook.

	











	The court referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings should be initiated.


	For nearly 15 years, Apple has collected a tax in the form of a 30 percent commission on the price of apps downloaded from the App Store and on all in-app purchases. It's able to command these fees from companies across Hollywood that use its in-app payment system to charge users. This has sparked pushback from these firms, some of which depend on subscription revenue to produce content and pay creators.


	Netflix, which in 2018 ceased allowing customers to subscribe on iOS devices to get around paying the fee, in 2023 forced some users who still pay monthly fees through the App Store add a new payment method to keep their accounts active. In 2022, Spotify put up a brick wall for iPhone users who want to purchase an audiobook from within the app. They were met with the message, “Want to listen? You can't buy audiobooks in the app. We know, it's not ideal.”


	In a post on X, Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said that Fortnite will return to the App Store next week. He added, “Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”


	Last year, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, targeting, in part, its encroachment into Hollywood. Joined by 16 states and the District of Columbia, the government alleged that the company violates antitrust laws by wielding a monopoly over the smartphone market with practices meant to keep consumers dependent on iPhones and prevent them from switching to rival devices in ways that may have worsened conditions in the entertainment industry. If left unabated, it warned the company “poses significant risk” to reduce competition and innovation in areas that include the production and movies and TV shows, pointing to Apple's “rapidly expanding” role as a producer.

The London band's absence has only underlined its importance.


													By
												

	Sophie Williams



	Even the most patient and forgiving of Wolf Alice fans have had to learn how to love at a different rhythm than the fans of other artists. Waiting for a new record, without knowing if anything is coming at all, seems to have become a primary act of their devotion. “Is it over?” exclaimed one despairing Reddit user a few months back, exasperated by the British rock band's radio silence throughout 2024. “No more music?”

	On April 22, after a near four-year wait, an eon in an ever-changing industry, their qualms were put to rest. Breaking cover, all posts on the London four-piece's Instagram page were swiftly archived, while its previously dormant TikTok account began to flicker into life. Soon enough, a carousel of striking, retro-leaning images — including bassist Theo Ellis wearing a leather jacket adorned with a gem-encrusted ‘Wolf Alice' motif — was uploaded with a call-to-arms caption: “We've missed u.” Major festival slots at Glastonbury and Radio 1's Big Weekend, meanwhile, were also confirmed for the summer.

	










			Trending on Billboard		






A post shared by Wolf Alice (@wolfaliceband)


	Offering a glimpse of what may lie ahead, it's a new look for the band, and a new way of marketing its music, heralding in the group's next era with aplomb. Unlike most contemporary acts subject to mass idolatry, Wolf Alice's online presence (which, historically, has been minimal) has never been part of the appeal. Dozens of accounts have instead become dedicated to posting whatever updates they can find, often rehashing photoshoots from their early career. 


	In a world of algorithm game-playing and lyrics bundled with gossipy subtext, the band's songs — which deftly blend garage rock and shoegaze — function as talismans affirming the importance of standing tall by your convictions. The subtlety and class with which they choose to signal meaning to their audience is something that has long defined their music; in knowing relatively little about the band's own inner lives, fans' desire to get closer only grows stronger. 


	Young, terminally online pop fans feel drawn to the notion of artist folklore, having grown up watching the likes of Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande incorporate “Easter eggs” (hidden messages and references) into their videos. It's an idea that extends to other genres that are popular in stan culture forums, where lost songs and “will-they-won't-they” social media teasers are analyzed feverishly. In the case of Wolf Alice, the group has earned a committed Gen Z fanbase who gravitate toward them as much for the element of surprise as they do for the music.

	











	The anticipation around the band's next steps, therefore, couldn't be greater. Wolf Alice's last record, 2021's Blue Weekend, ushered in a new commercial zenith, landing a nomination for the Mercury Prize (which the group won for 2017's Visions of a Life), topping the Official U.K. Albums Chart and leading the band to its first-ever BRIT award the following year. The campaign steamrolled ahead across a further 12 months, during which they opened up for Harry Styles in stadiums across Europe and completed an extensive headline tour.


	In 2025, each of the members are now in their early 30s. No longer the wild-eyed 20somethings they emerged as with fiery 2013 EP Blush, they have spent the past decade quietly unlocking emotional discoveries in their songs, flowing with their shifting perspectives on ambition and desire. Across three studio LPs, it's become clear that guitarist and lead songwriter Ellie Rowsell focuses on growing privately in order to bloom publicly; she can do huge indie hooks with the best of them (2015's “Freazy” or the endlessly affecting “Don't Delete the Kisses”), but has never sounded quite like any of her peers because of the strength of character at the center of her work.


	Consistently ducking the expectations of indie's upper echelons — the ones which the band vaulted into with 2015's My Love Is Cool — has only further affirmed Wolf Alice's influence and longevity. You can see the band's gnarly, incisive showmanship in the likes of Wunderhorse or rising stars Keo, or hear the band's incandescent take on indie throughout You Can't Put a Price on Fun, the debut EP from Manchester-based artist Chloe Slater. “Seeing them live was the most joy I've ever felt,” the latter recently recalled of a formative Wolf Alice gig, which she credits with changing the course of her burgeoning career.

	











	Intriguingly, the band's period of downtime was interrupted last year with the announcement that it had left its longtime label home of Dirty Hit — home to The 1975 and Beabadoobee — to sign with Sony imprint Columbia. According to a report from The Independent, the move stemmed from the members wanting “to experience something different,” having previously been in the same deal for nearly a decade, and that Rob Stringer (CEO of Sony Music Group) “is a huge fan” of theirs.


	Though Blue Weekend was rapturously received by critics, with The Observer describing it as “alchemically good,” the question of whether the band can level up to festival headliner status has long hung over reviews of its electrifying live performances. Groundbreaking things can happen if a band is given the time and space it needs to truly develop into greatness, and one can hope that with the support of a major label and a new team around Wolf Alice, the group's music will be able to travel further than ever. It's fascinating to think what they might do next.

The rapper said a delay in locking down the guests for her ""Invasion of Privacy"" album is the reason you haven't heard it yet.

	Here's the thing. It's not Cardi B‘s fault that her long-in-the-works sophomore studio album hasn't been released yet. At least that's what Cardi said during an Instagram Live session with fans this week, in which the rapper claimed that the real hold-up is the feature verses she's waiting on from her guests.


	“I really need these f–king features,” she said in a repost of the session. “And it's like I'm not really trying to press or go crazy on these artists because I love them down. But it's like come on now! I need that! I need that right now! Helloooo! Y'all don't want to miss this opportunity. I'll sing this s–t myself! But I really need y'all and I need y'all to hurry up and I love y'all. I feel like nobody want to miss being on this album.”

	











	In an X Spaces chat on March 31 Cardi said, “the features on my album are really good… I don't have a lot of features but I'm working with artists, some that I have worked before and some that I haven't worked before. And the ones that I have not worked before, I feel like it's gonna really, really surprise y'all.”

	In the Insta chat this week, she admitted to  fans that she often doesn't “feel too confident” about a lot of things, but that she's “very confident” about the unnamed follow-up to her smash 2018 debut, Invasion of Privacy. “These motherf–kers almost cried listening to my s–t,” she said of her team, noting that they told her there were “no skips” on the album.


	“It's iconic! This album is so good!” Cardi raved. “I put my whole p–sy on it! I rapped with the bottom of my p–sy! So hurry up!” While Cardi did not specify who she is waiting on, she again encouraged them to get in the booth because, flipping her hair back and forth across her face she promised, “this album is for the books!… Like, the production, the production, the feelings, the words, the rap… it's just, it's really there. Y'all not even understanding.”


	At press time no release date or track list for the untitled album had been announced.

One report puts the purchase price for the minority stake at $200 million.

	Chris Eggertsen



Big Loud has sold a stake in Morgan Wallen‘s recording catalog to Chord Music Partners, Billboard has confirmed.


	“Big Loud has sold a minority stake in Morgan Wallen's master recording catalog to Chord Music Partners, as part of a strategic investment to expand the label's global footprint and fuel long-term artist development,” a Big Loud representative tells Billboard. “The deal was executed with the support of the internal Big Loud team, alongside partners at Chord Music, Republic Records & UMG, PLUS Capital, Eisner, Loeb & Loeb, DLA Piper, Dickinson Wright and Armanino.”


The Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the news, pegs the purchase price for the catalog stake at $200 million.


	Chord Music Partners was formed in 2021 by KKR and Dundee Partners. In February 2024, Universal Music Group (UMG) acquired a 25.8% interest in the company while also taking over distribution and publishing administration for Chord's catalog via Virgin Music Group and Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), respectively. KKR exited Chord following the transaction, with Dundee increasing its share to 74.2%. Notably, Big Loud struck a multi-year distribution deal with UMG's Mercury Records/Republic for all releases last March.

	Representatives for Chord Music Partners and UMG did not immediately respond to Billboard‘s requests for comment.


	At the time of the UMG acquisition, Chord owned more than 60,000 copyrights, including stakes in songs such as “Dreams” and “Landslide” by Fleetwood Mac, “La Grange” by ZZ Top, “Counting Stars” and “Apologize” by OneRepublic, “Redbone” by Childish Gambino, “I Like Me Better” by Lauv, “Pursuit of Happiness” by Kid Cudi, “All Of Me” by John Legend, “Girls Like You” and “Sugar” by Maroon 5, “Halo” by Beyonce and “A Thousand Years” by Christina Perri.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: After landing roles in the second seasons of two hit series — Daredevil: Born Again from Marvel and Amazon MGM's Cross — Matthew Lillard has entered talks to join the latter studio's series Carrie, based on the iconic debut novel from Stephen King, sources tell Deadline.


	No word on the role to be played by Lillard. The project reunites him with Mike Flanagan (The Fall of the House of Usher, Midnight Mass), his director on another King adaptation, The Life of Chuck, which won the coveted People's Choice Award at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival, and is slated for release via Neon on June 6.

	Lillard is the third actor to come aboard following relative newcomer Summer H. Howell, who plays the title character, and Siena Agudong, who will portray Sue Snell. Hailing from writer, executive producer and showrunner Flanagan, who will also direct select episodes, the show reimagines the story of Carrie White, a a shy, bullied teenage girl who discovers she has telekinetic powers, while contending with abuse at school and at home, under the scrutiny of her fanatically religious mother.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The show comes on the heels of four Carrie films, the most famous being Brian De Palma's from 1976, which starred Sissy Spacek. It'll consist of eight episodes and has come together quite quickly following Flanagan's opening of a writers room in late fall, getting the official greenlight in April. Trevor Macy will also exec produce, with Amazon MGM Studios producing.


	Recently entering production on Daredevil: Born Again Season 2, Lillard's other upcoming projects for film include a return to the Scream franchise with Scream 7 and Blumhouse/Universal's sequel to the hit horror video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy's. The actor is repped by Verve, Strand Entertainment, and Heller Law.

			By Mike Fleming Jr, Andreas Wiseman 


EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winners and husband-and-wife cinema royalty Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) and Penélope Cruz (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) are set to reunite on screen in psychological thriller Bunker from Oscar-winning writer-director Florian Zeller (The Father).


	FilmNation Entertainment will launch international sales on behalf of Blue Morning Pictures and MOD Producciones at the upcoming Cannes Market, with CAA Media Finance and WME Independent handling domestic rights.


	In Bunker, when an architect accepts a morally ambiguous project — building a survivalist bunker for a tech billionaire — his wife begins to question their marriage after 17 years together. The film is described as “a thriller that delves into the emotional and moral challenges a couple faces amid the tensions of the world around them, exploring the fears, doubts, and dilemmas that define our era.”

	











	Zeller wrote the English-language project specifically for Cruz and Bardem, who themselves have been married for close to 17 years.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Zeller said: “I wanted to tell the story of a marriage and was deeply compelled to work with a real-life couple. I immediately was drawn to the idea of working with Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz, two of the most gifted actors working today, who also happen to be one of the most iconic couples. I wrote Bunker for them. This film will push the boundaries of narrative and emotional truth, blurring the lines between reality and fiction in a way that feels thrilling and deeply human.”


	The iconic Spanish couple have starred opposite each other multiple times across more than three decades including in films Jamón, Jamón, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Loving Pablo and Everybody Knows.


	Blue Morning Pictures' Federica Sainte-Rose is set to produce alongside Fernando Bovaira and Simon de Santiago of MOD Producciones. Alice Dawson will also serve as a producer on the film. Mariano Cohn, Gaston Duprat, Andres Duprat, Emanuel Nunez and Fernando Sokolowicz will executive produce.


	“What excites me most about working with Florian on Bunker is the bold new direction he's taking as a filmmaker. This project marks a clear tonal shift — unsettling and cinematically daring, Bunker speaks to the glaring contradictions that exist in modern society,” said Sainte-Rose. “The exploration of fears of the future, from ecological threats to rising social inequality, makes this film both urgent and relevant.”

	











	Zeller is repped by CAA. Cruz is repped by CAA, Untitled and Kuranda. Bardem is repped by WME and Goodman Genow.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Shudder has acquired the distribution rights to the supernatural thriller Good Boy in the U.S,, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand following the film's premiere at SXSW in March.


Good Boy, which redefines the haunted house genre by telling its horror tale through the eyes of a family dog, is co-written and directed by Ben Leonberg. Alex Cannon also co-writes. 


	Leonberg's directorial debut stars his dog, Indy, who finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner — and best friend — Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country. From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering.

	Indy's new world is immediately filled with unease: he senses invisible presences, follows phantom tracks, receives chilling warnings from a ghostly dog, and is haunted by glimpses of the previous resident's gruesome demise. When a dark influence begins to grip Todd, Indy must fight a malevolence intent on pulling him into the afterlife.


	“We immediately recognized the immense potential of Leonberg's debut and are thrilled to strike this deal with Shudder, ” said Amy Beecroft, Head of Verve Ventures, who negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmakers. 


	 Emily Gotto, SVP of Acquisitions and Production for Shudder, represented the AMC Networks' horror streamer in the deal. In a statement of her own, she adds: “Ben Leonberg's debut is a singular experience in perspective-driven horror. Told entirely through the eyes of Indy, a devoted dog whose terror and determination to save his human become our own, the film delivers a haunting and emotional experience that introduces a surprising standout performance from Indy and a strikingly assured first feature from Leonberg.”


DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO: 


	Additionally, Leonberg has signed with Altitude, which is expected to launch international sales for the film in Cannes.


	After a sold-out premiere at SXSW (and the “Howl of Fame” award for Best Canine Performance for Indy), Good Boy received a warm welcome at Overlook Film festival in New Orleans, where it expanded from one to three theaters to satisfy audience demand, and earned an honorable mention for Scariest Feature Film. The film was also screened at Calgary Underground Film Festival.

	











	In a relatively quiet start to the year for festival film sales, Good Boy‘s acquisition speaks to its originality, as Leonberg and his wife Kari Fischer, who also produced the film, adapted their own home and acted as stand ins for three years to accommodate Indy's production schedule. In all, production with Indy took 400 days and a whole lot of patience, as he is not a trained animal actor. The result, however taxing it may have been to achieve, is an incredibly realistic and haunting portrayal of a dog's reaction to his house taking on a life of its own.


Good Boy also features horror legends Larry Fessenden (Blackout, Depraved, The Last Winter, Wendigo, and Habit) and Stuart Rudin (Silence of the Lambs).

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	It's been two and a half years since getting the proverbial offer he could not refuse from Disney Entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden, Eric Schrier left the tight-knit executive team at FX after two decades to take over Disney Television Studios, which houses 20th Television and 20th Television Animation.


	Over that time, he has spearheaded major deals with networks and talent including the recent four-season pickup of four 20th Animation series by Fox: The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers as well as American Dad! in its return to the network after an 11-year run on TBS. Schrier also oversaw the merger of 20th Television and ABC Signature five and a half years after the two studios became corporate siblings following Disney's acquisition of Fox assets, and took oversight of Disney's global originals strategy.

	











	In an interview with Deadline, Schrier speaks about all of that as well as 20th TV's current IP push with half a dozen reboots in the works, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Malcolm In the Middle and Scrubs, the studio's talent deal strategy amid industry contraction, and its new compensation model which is being embraced by talent, he says.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Schrier also addresses 9-1-1: Lone Star‘s cancellation, the business pressures impacting pickup decisions, the prospect of Bob's Burgers streaming originals and the future of Doctor Odyssey and The Great North. Additionally, he shares his thoughts on the industry post-Peak TV and selling outside of Disney. He discusses filming in Los Angeles and the status of the studio's productions on the Fox lot after Disney's lease comes to an end later this year, with executives relocating to the Disney headquarters in Burbank.


DEADLINE: How did the blockbuster 4×4 deal come about? Its length is obviously tied to Fox's current licensing deal with Disney-owned Hulu where the four animated comedies stream. 


SCHRIER: We've had a long-standing relationship with Fox on adult animation that goes back as long as The Simpsons has been on the air, which through this end of this deal will be over 40 seasons and over 860 episodes.


	When I took this job, I didn't really know that much about our adult animation business, and it's a fascinating business. The power of these shows is tremendous. They're global shows, and we have a really great partnership with Fox. So as they were coming to the end of the current window, we started conversations very early on with Fox about, how do we extend the relationship, and how do we keep these shows going for as long as possible? 

	











	[Fox Entertainment CEO] Rob Wade, [Fox Network President] Michael Thorn, [20th TV Animation head] Marci Proietto and I sat down and talked about, creatively, what was the right idea for these shows? How long can they sustain? How long could they commit to it? How long can we commit to it? And we came up with this historic deal, which was for 16 seasons of television. I don't think there's ever been an order of 16 seasons at one time. And it's a win-win for both companies. 


	From a Fox standpoint, adult animation has been a foundation of their schedule that they've had for a really long time. The shows do tremendously well on Sunday nights, that's a great platform to premiere the shows on, and then they go next day on Hulu, which benefits us as a larger company as well. That relationship has been very fruitful, and we wanted to figure out how to continue that on. And then there was a mutual desire to get it done and do it for all that time. 


	In the meantime, American Dad! was something that we really value at the company and see as a long-term asset for us as well. There was an opportunity to move it from Turner to Fox, which they were very supportive of. So in my mind, it's a win-win for everybody.


DEADLINE: In the past couple of years, you revived two other 20th Animation former Fox series, Futurama and King of the Hill but it was American Dad! that went to Fox while they became Hulu originals. How was the call made? Was it just the timing when American Dad! became available?


SCHRIER:  Yeah, it was timing. Futurama had already premiered as a Hulu original, and King of the Hill is premiering this summer, and it's really good, really excited about it. So it was timing and how much could fit on the Fox schedule with all the other shows that they're doing. We'll see how that works over time. But there's a very symbiotic relationship between Fox adult animation and Hulu and 20th Animation as a studio.


DEADLINE: Do you think that this would be the last animated renewal at Fox, especially for the older shows like The Simpsons? The studio and network are not affiliated, and I was thinking how old some of the voice actors will be in four years… 


SCHRIER: I think they would have said that 40 years ago or 35 years ago as well. I think as long as the shows are creatively vibrant and that the economics makes sense, we're going to figure out a way to continue to do them. I can't speak to Fox's long-term commitment to it, but I have no indication that they would want not to do these shows.


DEADLINE: So this was not done as a final deal?


SCHRIER: There's no plans that those would be the final seasons. I think three years from now, there'll be lots of conversations about what the future is for all of those shows. We'll have really robust conversations with the creative partners first, what they want to do, and then ultimately, with Fox and our partners at Hulu.  


DEADLINE: What is the status of the other animated comedy you have at Fox, The Great North? It's been on the bubble and seems like it may be going away.


SCHRIER: It's still under consideration. I don't think Fox has made a final determination on it; it's another show that we really love. It'd be great for it to continue, but I understand if they're not able to.


DEADLINE: Could it transition to Hulu?


SCHRIER: I'd have to look at the performance, I haven't looked at that recently, and I'd have to talk to the partners I have at Hulu about it, we'd have to see if it makes sense. We like the current relationship but ultimately, the core shows are these four core shows. 

	











DEADLINE: I've reported that you were able to maintain the returning series' license fees. The sizes of the orders are a little smaller than in years past but you have been keeping them at previous levels by making The Simpsons and Family Guy exclusive episodes for Disney+ and Hulu. Can you talk about that?


SCHRIER: We looked at it as a four-season order, so you're looking at the sum total of all the episodes that we were producing, and it was a conversation with the talent about, what do they think they can do? How many can they do per year? What makes the most economic sense? 


	On Family Guy and The Simpsons, we're doing exclusive episodes for Disney+ and for Hulu that won't air on Fox, and that made sense for us; we worked through it on a show-by-show basis. There's no cut specific parameters of how to do it, and this felt like the perfect order pattern for all four of them. But we looked at it not in a season-by-season basis but in sum total, so if you think about it in that way, it's a pretty extraordinary order.


DEADLINE: Will there be any exclusive episodes of Bob's Burgers for Hulu? It's doing well on the platform.


SCHRIER: Bob's Burgers does great. Nothing I can comment on at this time but hopefully down the road, there may be an opportunity to do it. 


DEADLINE: What about animated originals beyond the legacy shows? Currently, you have Solar Opposites, which is ending, and The Great North, which likely is ending too. What do you have in the pipeline?


SCHRIER:  I'm really excited about the stuff that Marci and her team are working on. We have projects in the pipeline that I'm really looking forward to; hopefully there's another great adult animated hit in there. 


	What I didn't understand when I took the job — and now I do understand — is how vibrant and how widely viewed these shows are. They're just tremendous, and there's nothing like them in all television. It's a great business.


	We are the most prolific studio in adult animation, and our plan is to continue to do that, working hard with our Hulu partners and our Disney+ partners, because I think there's some shows that we can do In the animation space, more adult for Hulu or young adult for Disney+, that I feel really good about, but I don't want to speak about any specific project.


DEADLINE: On the live-action side, the studio has Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Prison Break and Holes pilots, the Malcolm in the Middle revival, a potential Scrubs reboot and a Desperate Housewives offshoot across Hulu, Disney+, ABC and Onyx. That is some heavy leaning into IP. Is this conscious IP strategy or is the current volume coincidental? 


SCHRIER: I think it's more coincidental than a specific desire. Obviously, we have a great library of amazing IP within the Fox library that came over in the [2019] transaction, as well as the Disney library; ABC Studios has a tremendous library as well, Scrubs is one of those titles that comes in there. [20th TV President] Karey Burke and her team are always looking to see what's in that library, what our creative partners at the studio are interested in telling those stories and is there an organic way to reboot those stories. It's not like there was some sort of mandate, let's get a bunch of old IP and redo them. It's all if there's the right creative story to tell. 


	In the case of Buffy, it stemmed out of Karey Burke and [Hulu Originals and ABC Entertainment Scripted President] Simran Sethi had always wanted to try to figure out a way to reboot that show. Our partners at Searchlight Television, who I work with as well, have a deal with Chloé Zhao. It ends up that Chloé Zhao loves Buffy, so we put them together. And out of that came the idea. Sarah Michelle Gellar has been a part of it from the get-go as well; she is an executive producer. [Executive producer] Gail Berman is back; she's been behind the scenes trying to pull it all together. We have Nora and Lilla Zuckerman writing it, whom we have a deal with; they're great.

	











	So that's just an amazing package that came about organically because we were excited about retelling that story after so much time in a new way. I think all of these reboots come from that idea of, “What's the new way in which we can tell these stories?” Not “Okay, they're IP and let's go reboot them.”


DEADLINE: Is there any chance for Malcolm to go beyond the four-episode revival that you have commissioned? 


SCHRIER: That came out of [series creator] Linwood Boomer's brain of, is there a way to do this and put the band back together for a special four-episode run? I think the scripts are really funny and I'm really excited to see how it all comes together. It's designed to be four episodes. If it's a huge success, there's always a conversation to have, is there a way to do more of it? We'll see.


DEADLINE: How is the Scrubs reboot coming together? Is it going to happen?


SCHRIER: I'm optimistic that it will happen. I don't know exactly what the specifics are on it today, but ultimately, I think the creative team really wants to figure out how to do it. Obviously it's very complicated because of the business terms. So my feeling is, when there's a creative desire, you usually figure these things out, but we'll see.


DEADLINE: And the other pilots, Prison Break and Holes, how are they going?


SCHRIER: Prison Break. Elgin James, who I worked with on Mayans, is doing that, so very excited about that. He's also at the studio. The Holes pilot's in process. We're also doing Group Chat with Kenya Barris and Kim Kardashian for Hulu. A lot of really good pilots in development.


DEADLINE: Why was the decision made to fold ABC Signature into 20th Television after years of speculation, and why last fall? How have things changed and how is it working under Karey Burke? 


SCHRIER: When I first started in this role, there was a certain amount of volume that we felt like we needed to be able to produce, and it made sense to have two studios. But as we started to calibrate how much content we needed for our platforms, it just didn't make sense to have two studios and the infrastructure associated with them, so we merged them, and it's going really well.


	Inherently, there was always a little bit of friction by having two studios; this makes it a lot cleaner. It makes it cleaner for the talent, it makes it cleaner for the representatives, and it makes it cleaner for our platforms. Karey is doing a great job. We have an amazing roster of talent at the studio, and they're having a tremendous amount of success right now. Our legacy series are doing tremendously well, 9-1-1, Only Murders In the Building, Grey's Anatomy. 


	And in the last couple of seasons, we've launched a lot of new hit shows. Will Trent continues, going into its third season, Percy Jackson's in production on its second season. High Potential was a big win for us last year on ABC, that show's just doing great; Kaitlin Olson is amazing in it. Shifting Gears, the half-hour multi-cam, bringing that [genre] back, and it's performing very well.


Good American Family on Hulu, which recently launched, starting Ellen Pompeo, is doing great as well. And then we have Paradise, which was a breakout hit for us. It comes from Dan Fogelman, who's an amazing creator, he's been at the studio for a really long time. And then we have Tracker, which is super interesting. It's doing extremely well for CBS, it's their No. 1 show. We produce that for them, but we also have that show on Disney+ around the world, we have the international streaming rights to it, and it appears on Disney+ as well as Hulu in the SVOD window. So that's a model that works really well for us. Not only are we producing it as a traditional studio, but it also comes back to our Disney platforms.

	











DEADLINE: You didn't mention one recent hit, Nobody Wants This for Netflix. Will you continue to focus on your own platforms while still selling outside? Will you do more third-party business? 


SCHRIER: Our primary focus is for our own platforms, that's consistent. We know the demand there, it drives the overall business. But on a case-by-case basis, we'll examine third-party business, and does it make financial or business sense for us. Some of the third-party business makes a lot of sense for us, like Tracker, and others don't make as much sense. We have shows in production or development at multiple platforms around town, and those are all good businesses for us. We're really proud of Nobody Wants This, it's a big hit for Netflix. Erin and Sara Foster are talent that we were working with at the studio, and now we have an overall deal with them, so we're working on their next show.


DEADLINE: You mentioned 20th TV's pacts with the Fosters, Dan Fogelman and Elgin James. You used “calibrating” when talking about the merger of the two studios. Are you doing the same with your roster of talent, are you cutting back? Also, like others, you have converted some overall deals to first-look. How is that business going?


SCHRIER: I think as our volume has decreased, we've cut back the amount of overall deals and total talent deals we have, because we just don't need the volume as much as we did. With that said, we still have a tremendous roster of talent. And what we do, instead of blanket approach of how to approach all of our deals, we look at it on a case-by-case basis.


	Each creator is different, they're unique, and we try to design the deals to be the best environment for them to be the most successful. Some people like the security of an overall deal: they're highly prolific, they want to work exclusively with us, they've been at the studio for a long time, or they're excited about a specific show that's been ongoing. So that works very well for the overall deal side.


	On the first-look side, we have an awesome roster of not only writers but producers in first-look deals at our studio, and that works really well for them, because they can develop with our roster of talent at the studio, they can develop for multiple brands. And I think we have an environment where, basically, most of the shows that they're going to develop, we have a potential home for on our platforms, whether it's ABC or FX or Hulu Originals or Disney Branded Television, there are different opportunities across that landscape for all of our talent to work. So first-look deals work really well for producers like Ryan Reynolds or the Rock. We have an overall deal with Warren Littlefield that works really well for him, he's highly prolific, we have a ton of shows with him. It all depends on the creator.


DEADLINE: There's one creator that you used to work with on the network side at FX, Ryan Murphy. Now he's one of the biggest names on your talent roster. Talk about getting to work with him on the studio side?


SCHRIER: Ryan is one of one-of-a-kind creator. He's an amazing talent, highly prolific, highly inventive. He just has his finger on the pulse of what people want to watch. I've been working with Ryan for over 20 years; I worked with him on Nip/Tuck as a current executive, I've been working with him all the years I worked at FX, and it's been great to work with him in this different capacity at the studio. 

	











	I'm really excited about the shows he has upcoming. We have four new shows in the pipeline from him: All's Fair; The Beauty;  9-1-1: Nashville, which is a great franchise for us; and American Love Story. It's great to work with Ryan, and I'm really looking forward to more success with him.


DEADLINE: What about the mothership American Horror Story, which has been renewed through the upcoming Season 13. Can it continue for the foreseeable future?


SCHRIER: I think yes, as long as Ryan has an idea. The way we work with Ryan is different than with other creators, he's in a select few group of people that, if he has a great idea for another American Horror Story, and that's something that [FX Networks chairman] John [Landgraf] and the team at FX really want to do, we're going to figure it out. 


	We don't have another incarnation of American Horror Story ordered, but it's a franchise that, by design, can always be rebooted. And so when Ryan has an idea that is great and can figure it out with his schedule of all the things that he's doing, I could very well see us doing another installment.


DEADLINE: What's the latest on Ryan's Doctor Odyssey, which has been on the bubble at ABC? 


SCHRIER: I really love Doctor Odyssey, I think it's a wildly inventive show, and we're doing everything we can to support it. That decision ultimately lies with Ryan Murphy, whether Ryan wants to continue to do it, and he feels like there's stories to tell that he feels confident in.


DEADLINE: Were you involved in the decision to kill off Peter Krause's character on 9-1-1? I'm trying to see how high up the chain it went. Did you have to sign off?


SCHRIER: That was a decision that I was not involved in, that was [showrunner] Tim Minear, Ryan Murphy and everyone else involved in that show. So I'll leave it to that.


DEADLINE: 9-1-1 spinoff Lone Star recently ended on Fox. The reasons were financial as the show was still doing OK. Is it something that we'll see more of, when for studios, due to business reasons, it's hard to continue with a show?


SCHRIER: I think Lone Star is actually a good example of the pressures of the business in the current environment. As companies have to be profitable and have to justify the business behind all these shows, Lone Star became a very expensive show for what it was performing at and didn't make economic sense for the platform or the studio to continue with. 


	Ultimately, as these shows grow and become more and more expensive, that threshold for performance becomes higher and higher. And so unfortunately, Lone Star just wasn't achieving that level of success from a performance standpoint. As much as we loved the show and it was hard for us to see it leave, it was time.


DEADLINE: Lone Star was your last live-action series on Fox; it was vestige from the old times when the network and 20th TV were vertically integrated. Now that they are separated, is there a chance for you to do a drama for Fox under their current $3M-$4M an episode model?


SCHRIER: We've had a lot of conversations with Michael and Rob about us producing live-action shows for them. They're operating under a specific cost structure, so it's finding the right idea that can fit in there. But I'd very much like to do that.


DEADLINE: We referenced the challenging business environment that impacts pickup decisions. Does everything come down to money these days? How hard is it to manage the creative and business sides and to have to tell your creatives every year that the budgets have to be cut for the shows to get renewed? 












SCHRIER: We are not in the process of saying all the budgets have to be cut so that the shows get renewed, it's trying to decrease the increasing cost of the shows. We're trying to bend the cost curve down, and I look at that from a desire to support creativity. As shows become more and more expensive, there's a finite pool of money in which we can spend resources against those shows. So the more expensive the shows become, the fewer shows you get to make. 


	I think collectively, getting to a place where shows' cost matches their performance is something the entire industry is going through and something I'm really focused on: how do we maintain a wide variety of shows, and a number of shows for the industry? Because I think that's really good for creativity.


DEADLINE: Disney TV Studios changed the model for compensating talent before you started, replacing traditional backend with upfront payments and bonuses that allow Disney to exploit shows across platforms. How has it been dealing with creators over it? Are you fine-tuning the model, and is it working for you?


SCHRIER: Yeah, our backend model, I was actually involved in creating it alongside Craig Hunegs, who was running Disney Television Studios at the time, him and I, Josh Sussman, who now leads Business Affairs [for Disney Entertainment Television], and [FX Business Affairs EVP] Kelly Cline really worked with the representative community on how do we create a better structure that rewards people in success and is much more transparent.


	It was designed, first and foremost, [as] how do we give the best experience to our creators, and how we create a transparent environment for them to be compensated appropriately and in success. Now that we're a few years into it, it's actually working, and people are coming to us and asking on existing shows to convert to that model. It's proven to be a very successful model for us that I'm very very confident in. Of course, we're always evaluating what's the right way to compensate talent in the most productive way, and I think that the talent that's working here feels really good about the way in which they're compensated.


DEADLINE: How is your relationship with FX two and a half years after leaving the network? Do you continue to have a close relationship with your former boss John Landgraf?


SCHRIER: I still speak to them almost daily, work really closely with them, because in the other part of my job, which is the global original television strategy, I'm working on how that works, how much do we make and where do we make it, working with our platform partners and our studio partners on what's the best mix of product that we make. So I work with the FX team a lot, and 20th produces a lot of shows for them, so there's a lot of interaction. I love those guys, it's so great to work with them, and John's obviously an amazing partner, he has been my mentor.


DEADLINE: Since you mentioned global originals, let's talk about that. How was your learning curve in that area?


SCHRIER: First of all, it's been great working for Dana for the last two and a half years, she's just an amazing leader and amazing person and creative executive. 


	She asked me to take on overseeing our local originals two years ago. At the time, we were producing over 140 shows all around the world, and now we're producing about 100 shows around world for Disney+, all in their local languages, in 25 different countries. It's fascinating to see the creativity that's coming to fruition all around the world, and to help support that. 

	











	We have teams in all of these markets that we're producing shows that are selecting and developing shows to commission for their audiences. Our strategy is very unique, I think, in the marketplace, which is, we have global brands and global IP that travel the world. We have Star Wars, Marvel, Disney Branded, Pixar, FX, Hulu originals, ABC shows.


	These shows travel the world and are known really well. So we don't need to make an excess volume of local originals. But what we need to do is complement those global shows with locally relevant stories for the audiences in the markets in which we have Disney+. For example, in Spain, we produced a show last year called Invisible, which is based on a very well known book there; that was in Spanish, intended for a Spanish audience.


	If they ultimately travel, great, but they're really designed and built to work for the local audience. It's a local-for-local strategy that's really working. In Latin America, we have The Boss, which is a very big show in Argentina, and Amor da Minha Vida, which has performed really well in Brazil.


	We had 16 BAFTA nominations last year. In the UK, Rivals was a big hit for us. A Thousand Blows just finished its run, it's doing very well as well. And just two weeks ago, we premiered The Stolen Girl, which did really well in the UK, and is also doing very well in Hulu and Freeform here in the U.S. So we're looking at these titles on a global basis, but really designing them for the local markets to have local language and local flavor for that specific market.


	We produce a lot of Korean dramas that have traveled really well. Moving, created by Kang Full, and his second series, Light Shop, both have done tremendously well. He's a really inventive creator; he's actually a perfect example of the unique creativity that I'm finding all around the world. He's developing a subsequent season of Moving right now.


	In France, we had a big win this spring with Bref.2, a really unique half-hour show that was based on a series of 2011 shorts. Our team in France developed it with the producers, got them to do six 30-minute episodes, and it took France by storm. That's a good example of a show that was designed based on a title that had worked there, hadn't been done or seen in a long time, and the shorts were two- to three-minute episodes. It was rebooted and hit the zeitgeist in France, and that's exactly what we want to do.


DEADLINE: You mentioned that when you started, there were 140 shows and now there are 100. Why is that? Did you evaluate the entire slate and cut down the number to be more focused? 


SCHRIER: It was two things. One was, we were producing about 30 to 40 shows in India, and now India is part of a joint venture with Reliance. We are no longer working on those shows, so that's part of the decrease in the number. And then I think initially, we weren't as strategic as we needed to be. When [CEO] Bob [Iger] came back to Disney, he looked at all the programming we were doing, and we just needed to curate the programming more for the needs of the streaming platform.


	When I first came in, we were making lots of shows all around the world, and there wasn't a cohesive strategy. So Dana created this role where it's global original television strategy, and part of my role is to help create a cohesive strategy with our partners at the direct-to-consumer unit, with [Direct-to-consumer President] Joe Earley and his team, to be more strategic about what we're making. Disney is based on long-running IP, and our our goal is to create long-running IP that can help power the platform for many years to come.

	











DEADLINE: What is coming down the pike that you think may resonate globally? 


SCHRIER: I would be a psychic if I could predict which show would be a global phenomenon, but I have a lot of shows I'm bullish on that are in the pipeline. In France, The Lost Station Girls is a six-episode true crime limited series. In the UK, we have feature documentary Flintoff, about former cricket star Freddie Flintoff. There's a new show coming out in Korea called Tempest.


	In LATAM, we have Killer Nannies (working title) with John Leguizamo in his first Spanish-speaking role. It's a really good story about Juan, Pablo Escobar's son, who was raised by his henchmen; he calls them his killer nannies. I think we're just finishing production on it. I haven't seen it yet, but very excited about it.


DEADLINE: A question we always ask of your former boss, John Landgraf: Where is the television business going? Will the contraction ease up at some point, when can we see a bit of an expansion? Or are we just managing the decline? How are you planning for the future of the studio? 


SCRIER: I feel really bullish about our business, not only at the studio, but also for Disney and our direct-to-consumer businesses. We've gone through a transformative time over the last few years, and Dana and [Disney Entertainment co-chairman] Alan Bergman have done a great job leading our streaming services. I think we're now organized and set up for success, now we have to execute. And we are. 


	I went through earlier all the shows that are working, and in the future, I feel really good about Disney and Disney's commitment in the long term, and the amount of volume of shows that we're doing as we continue to fine-tune that.


	I think, as an industry, we have to continue to make compelling content that audiences want to watch, since there's so much choice. There are different platforms of choice for for audiences, especially younger audiences, and I feel really good about our place within that ecosystem.


DEADLINE: So life post-Peak TV is just fine?


SCHRIER: Yeah, we're still producing a very significant amount of shows. We're actually producing a lot of shows here in California. We have 16 shows in production in Los Angeles, and I'm really proud of that fact. 


	We really love producing here. The crew base in Los Angeles is excellent, our talent loves working here, we love working here. The Walt Disney Company is really committed to California, and I'm really excited about the increased tax incentive that is hopefully going to come to pass so that we can continue to do more shows here in Los Angeles.  


DEADLINE: You have a few shows that are filming on the Fox lot in West L.A. including High Potential. Are you going to keep series there after Disney's lease comes to an end? And how do you feel about leaving the Fox lot; a lot of you have offices there?


SCHRIER: We're only in one building on the lot now from an office standpoint. The FX and 20th teams will be moving over by the end of the year, and I think it's going to be great, because right now, in my job, I shuttle between the two. We'll have a true creative campus here in Burbank with all the teams, and I think it will be good for us all to be together.


	And Fox lot in terms of production, we're still going to have some productions there, but some of them will move, and that's an ongoing discussion with the teams at Fox.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Crunchyroll President On Hopes For ‘Solo Leveling' Season 3, ‘Ghost Of Tsushima' & New ‘Demon Slayer' Movies","https://deadline.com/2025/05/crunchyroll-solo-leveling-ghost-of-tsushima-demon-slayer-1236382143/","Thu, 01 May 2025 10:42:00 GMT","


					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini has talked about hopes for more Solo Leveling and given the latest on the new Demon Slayer trilogy of movies and Ghost of Tsushima, the upcoming anime series based on the PlayStation game of the same name.


Solo Leveling has popped on Crunchyroll, the anime SVOD service that has over 15M subs. It was the Sony-owned service's most popular show through 2024. Season 2 dropped in January, becoming Crunchyroll's top series in the first quarter of 2025. Fans are clamoring for more.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Purini attributes the success of the series to the strength of the source IP — it was already a popular manhwa (Korean comic) — as well as the quality of the visuals and production. A-1 Pictures animated the series and Shunsuke Nakashige directed.

	Noting that most anime fans are also gamers, Purini went on to pinpoint another reason he thinks the series has resonated so strongly. “The most important thing is the theme of the story, it has lot of themes from gaming. If you are an RPG player, or play first-person-shooting games, you understand it. When people see those themes in a narrative story format like this, it is new and it is different, and it is a language they speak and that makes it much more compelling.”


	Given the success is Season 3 coming? “We hope so,” Purini said when asked about a third outing. “The [series] creators want to work on lot of shows. Anime is really popular, so there's a lot of demand, and so we have to find the right time to get started on the next season.”


Ghost Of Tsushima & Demon Slayer


	Purini said the success of Solo Leveling is shaping Crunchyroll's wider programming strategy, highlighting Ghost of Tsushima, the upcoming project based on the Sucker Punch-produced PlayStation videogame about a Samurai warrior.


	“It definitely makes us want to take more experiments. Ghost of Tsushima is an example. It is a game IP that we know gaming fans love, and that's one of the reasons we want to bring it to anime; to see if we can recreate that same phenomenon.”


	Crunchyroll, Aniplex, Sony Music and PlayStation Productions have teamed for the series, which is slated to bow in 2027.


	The Sony family connections also reveal themselves in the new Demon Slayer movies. Sony is releasing Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle in U.S. theaters in September. Hopes are high for Haruo Sotozaki's adaptation of the Koyoharu Gotouge story after previous Demon Slayers notched strong openings. 2021's Mugen Train debuted to $21.2 million and 2023's Swordsmith Village opened to $10.1M.

	











	“The trilogy movies are the final arc of the story and, for fans, if they want to finish it, they have to watch it,” Purini said. Asked about the following chapters he added: “The production teams have not announced the exact release date.”


	The expectation in industry circles is that the subsequent films will be fairly evenly placed after the first movie.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Meghan Markle Shows Off Her Redheaded Kids [PHOTOS]","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-royal-family/meghan-markle-shows-off-redheaded-kids/","Thu, 01 May 2025 16:40:09 GMT","

Meghan Markle is giving her Instagram followers a rare glimpse of her adorable redheads- and we don't mean Prince Harry!

After a whirlwind trip to New York City to be a part of the TIME 100 Summit, Meghan celebrated being back home in Montecito, California with she and Prince Harry's two children- Archie, who turns 6 on May 6, and Lilibet, 3.

The Duchess of Sussex took advantage of California's sunny weather to spend time with her brood in the garden, posting pictures that show both kids' vibrant red hair, just like their dad!

While Meghan rarely posts pictures or videos of her kids, when she does she's careful to only show them from the back. But that was the perfect view to capture Lili's long red locks and Archie's dark Auburn hair.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

A post shared by @aseverofficial

We're guessing that navy blue shirt is a favorite of young Archie's, since he was also wearing it the last time Meghan posted a picture with her kids five weeks ago.

But it wasn't his shirt but his mouth that his mom was focused on while she was in the Big Apple.

While on stage speaking with Jessica Sibley, CEO of TIME Magazine at the Time 100 Summit, Markle admitted she expects Archie to lose his first tooth any day now, saying, “and I just hope we're back home in time for it!” 

In fact, while Prince Harry traveled with his wife to New York City for the TIME 100 Summit, the couple did not appear on the red carpet at the TIME 100 Gala. Instead they jetted back to California to keep from missing Archie's milestone moment. 

Neither Harry nor Meghan has revealed whether or not they made it in time– or if the tooth has come out just yet.

Meghan also gave fans a little hint at what's to come on season two of her Netflix lifestyle show “With Love, Meghan.”

When Sibley asked her what guests are on her wish list for her podcast and lifestyle show, Meghan let slip, ” I can apologize in advance for saying José Andrés is going to be on season two. We love José so much,” Meghan said. “So I think my wishlist has been, I've been fortunate to have the people that I want on the show… I've been really lucky. We have a great, great lineup.”

According to PEOPLE, Andrés is a longtime friend and collaborator of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In fact, Meghan and Harry's Archewell Foundation has supported the celebrity chef's charitable World Central Kitchen since Archewell's inception in 2020. 

The chef and restauranteur, 55, teamed up with the royal couple to participate in relief efforts following the Los Angeles wildfires in January.

A post shared by Sussex Royal Family (@sussexroyal_life)

Meghan tapes her “With Love, Meghan” show at a home owned by philanthropists Tom and Sherrie Cipolla near the $14-million mansion she shares with Prince Harry and their kids in Montecito, California.

And at the Time 100 Summit, she told Jessica Sibley there's a very good reason she doesn't shoot the show at her own home.

“On this show, it's a crew of 80 people,” Meghan said. “People said, ‘Why didn't you film the show in your house?' I said, ‘My kids are coming home for their nap.' Eighty people in the kitchen isn't really the childhood memory I would love for them to have.”

Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said.

In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen.

“I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. “No matter what happens with PK and I, he's always been my best friend, my husband, we're family. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.”

A post shared by PK (@paul_kemsley_pk)

In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began.

Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. But when he was invited to attend the reunion taping, he declined and sent a statement instead.

Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion.

“I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com.

“Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. “That statement is both heartbreaking and false. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.”

“Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. “Many have wanted to speak out, but I have asked them not to because the truth should never need a champion. I refused to stoke a fire I did not ignite. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. That woman embodied kindness, integrity, and grace. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.”

PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong.

In a confessional, Kemsley explained, “There are times that I think PK's the greatest father in the world. But is he the most hands-on father? The truth is, no. He would disappear and be gone for weeks and weeks without even calling the kids. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.”

Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. She explained that her comment came as she was still reeling from a multi-page email her ex had sent her.

Speaking with Rollacoaster, Kemsley said she never wants to go  “toe to toe” with PK.

“I know his feelings about what I had said in the moment about him not being a great dad, I not only apologized to him, but I – in my confessional and in the after show – immediately took it back and explained that this is after a couple of months of not speaking, I was really worried about the kids,” she explained. “I felt very, very bad. It was in a weak, vulnerable moment after a seven-page vicious email. You can only take the high road for so long.”

While her marital problems are still being sorted out, Kemsley said she is looking forward to her next chapter. “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.

Comedy queen Anna Faris is known for playing funny characters in scripted films and television series. Could she now be going off script and doing reality TV? She wouldn't ignore Andy Cohen if he called.

Speaking with Us Weekly earlier this week, Faris, 48, wondered if she would really ever join the Bravosphere. “I was thinking the other day if I would make a good ‘Real Housewife',” she said. “I don't know if I would put on the whole pretense of ‘there's no cameras.' I don't know.” She went on to compare being an actor versus being a personality: “The relief of what I do is the playing of a character… never acknowledging the camera… Like, I'm terrible at photoshoots. The idea of being one's self… I don't even know if I know exactly what that means because I feel like, fundamentally, I can be pretty quiet and reserved in my own skin.”

The actress, who rose to fame quickly with the spoof film “Scary Movie” 25 years ago, does think joining “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” would be her top pick if she had to choose. Maybe she could take over for Garcelle Beauvais? “They're so advanced,” she praised. “That's like going to graduate school when you're a freshman.” In addition to that series, Faris stated she loves “all things Bravo,” like hit series “Below Deck,” plus “all dating shows, too.”

So far, no call from executive producer Andy Cohen though. “I would totally take the phone call, oh my god! He hasn't courted me yet,” she said to Us Weekly with a laugh, but seems open to the conversation. This latest season of “Beverly Hills” unfortunately had some low ratings according to Collider, so perhaps Cohen and team should think outside the box with casting. Luckily, Faris is currently the hilarious face of Walmart's new Express Delivery campaign for their prescription delivery service. Plus, she has new exciting things on the horizon, after her last prominent job was the CBS sitcom “Mom,” which wrapped up in 2020.

Faris tragically lost her home in the Los Angeles fires earlier this year, telling Us Weekly, “It's surreal and has been tough, [but] we feel fortunate because we're safe. I'm really grateful to be working.” One of the jobs she's worked on recently is the new comedy film “Spa Weekend,” with fellow funny ladies Leslie Mann, Isla Fisher and Michelle Buteau. In March before the film wrapped, she stated, “I was thinking this morning how sad I'm going to be when this project is over because it's been so incredible to work with these women under these circumstances. We're all at this stage in life where we feel so appreciative of each other. We keep fantasizing about a sequel.”

A post shared by Anna Faris (@annafaris)

According to her IMDB page, Faris will also be seen in the live-action/animated hybrid drama “I, Object” and will be a voice in “Toy Story 5,” which feels like a perfect fit. Plus, “Scary Movie 6” is officially happening, with a release date set for 2026, so hopefully Cindy Campbell will be back on screen with the Wayans brothers. We're crossing our fingers for that announcement!

Warner Bros. Pictures is answering your “Sinners” prayers: The hit Ryan Coogler film will be back in IMAX theaters for a special re-release. The feature just opened April 18, Easter weekend, and grossed $48 million and has maintained steady success at the box office.

Now, “Sinners” will return to nine IMAX theaters across North America in 70mm from Thursday, May 15 to Wednesday, May 21. (The film is still playing in theaters, just not in as many IMAX screens.) Those theaters include the City Walk Stadium 19 + IMAX (Los Angeles), Irvine Spectrum and IMAX (Irvine), Lincoln Square 13 + IMAX (New York), Metreon 16 + IMAX (San Francisco), Indiana State Museum (Indianapolis), Arizona Mills IMAX (Phoenix), Autonation IMAX (Ft. Lauderdale), Webb Chapel IMAX (Dallas), and Colossus IMAX (Toronto).

“Audiences have spoken and we listened,” Jeff Goldstein, President of Global Distribution, Warner Bros. Pictures, said. “If ever a film needed to be experienced in this incredible larger-than-life format, it's ‘Sinners.' Ryan has delivered a film that has been embraced by fans who appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into creating a film for this screen-filling format and we wanted to give everyone the opportunity to see it — or see it again — in 70mm IMAX.”

“Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan as twin brothers who return to their hometown in Mississippi after surviving World War I, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, and Delroy Lindo co-star. 

Academy Award-nominated Coogler writes and directs the film, which was praised by fellow directors such as Spike Lee for being an “amazing” feature that is crucial to cinema at this time. “I don't think this is a horror film. I don't know exactly what the word is but he invented a new genre,” Lee said during Carmelo Anthony's Wave Original “7PM in Brooklyn” podcast. “I think we need this film now, too.”

Coogler thanked his “cinematic influences” for the film, crediting Lee for in part inspiring it. 

“I had the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry, but it was always a film that we wanted to make for audiences, in theaters,” Coogler wrote in a letter shared with IndieWire. “We always had our minds on you, the audience, and felt a deep responsibility to entertain you, and move you in the way only cinema can. I believe in cinema. I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society.”

 










He added of audiences, “We don't get to do what we do if you don't show up. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form. And together maybe we can expand the definition of what a blockbuster is, what a horror movie is, and of what an IMAX audience looks like.”

Adam Pearson is making history twice over. The “A Different Man” star and “Under the Skin” breakout actor is set to lead the film adaptation of Bernard Pomerance's Tony-winning play “The Elephant Man.” Pearson will be the first differently abled actor to star as Joseph Merrick; this also will be the first film version of Pomerance's play. (David Lynch's 1980 film of the same name was based on Merrick's life but had no direct relation to the play, and actually led to a lawsuit over the title.)

Variety first reported Pearson's casting. 

 










“Joseph Merrick is a man I have a long and complex relationship with,” Pearson said in a statement. “From having his name used as a term of derision to learning about the man himself in documentaries I've presented. It's been a cathartic journey of growing to love and respect a man who I as a child I avoided even thinking about. Now as a disability advocate and actor, I can think of no greater honor (yet heavy responsibility) than to tell the true story of Joseph Carey Merrick.”

“The Elephant Man” will be written by playwright Pomerance's son, Moby Pomerance. The shoot will begin in spring 2026. 

Eve Pomerance, who is producing the film, added, “My father never wanted prosthetics to be used on stage as he felt it took the audience out of the story. He wanted them to empathize fully with Merrick, to see themselves in him. Lines like, ‘I am not an animal, I am a man' which have become synonymous with the play, will take on greater meaning with Adam telling this story and enable the audience to finally stand in Merrick's shoes. My father would be beyond excited to see his dream becoming a reality.”

“The Elephant Man” is based on the diaries of Dr. Frederick Treves, who was Merrick's physician. The play spans Merrick's time at the London Hospital. The play first ran on the West End in London in 1977. Bradley Cooper, David Bowie, Billy Crudup, Mark Hamill, Philip Anglum, and David Schofield have all portrayed Merrick onstage. 

“The Elephant Man” will be produced by Stephen Nemeth for Rhino Films and Eve Pomerance for Major Motion Pictures.

Sarah Michelle Gellar is detailing how Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao changed her mind about a “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” reboot. 

Gellar, who has publicly been against a revival for years, officially is set to reprise her titular role as Buffy Summers for a new Hulu series, with Zhao directing the pilot. “Poker Face” scribes Nora and Lilla Zuckerman are writing the show, which hails from 20th Television and Searchlight TV where Zhao has a first-look deal. Both Gellar and Zhao will executive produce the series, along with original executive producer (and music icon) Dolly Parton. “Buffy” creator and writer Joss Whedon has no involvement in the reboot.

“Every pitch I heard was just like, ‘Let's just do “Buffy” again,'” Gellar told Elite Daily of why she finally decided to agree to a revival. “Why? But the passion that [Zhao] came to me with, what she wanted to do with the show and the character, and why ‘Buffy' is needed now — it was the first time where I thought, ‘OK, there's a reason.'” 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“Buffy the Vampire Slayer” aired on the WB for five seasons from 1997 to 2001 before moving to UPN for two more seasons. The series also landed spinoff “Angel” from 1999 to 2004.

Gellar said that the revival has been in the works for four years. “We won't do it unless it's 100 percent right and there's 100 percent a reason,” she added. “The whole point of an antihero is to be a hero for the people who don't fit in the box, the people who aren't like everybody else. That's who I want to tell stories for.”

And while not much else is known about the revival, Gellar confirmed that any loglines or casting rumors are false. “Those are all fake characters,” she said. “That thing that got released is all fake.”

Gellar teased during “The Drew Barrymore Show” in 2024 that she was inspired by other early 2000s revival series to revisit “Buffy.” “It's funny, I always used to say no, because it's in its bubble and it's so perfect,” she said. “But watching ‘Sex and the City' and seeing ‘Dexter,' and realizing there are ways to do it, definitely does get your mind thinking, ‘Well, maybe.' […] And it makes you realize that in this world, we need those heroes, I think, more so than ever.”

 










In the meantime before “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” 2.0, Zhao was directing “Hamnet” based on Maggie O'Farrell novel about William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes. Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley star.

“Sinners” director Ryan Coogler is currently at the top of Hollywood off the success of his IMAX-shot vampire epic, which has so far grossed more than $168 million worldwide.

But the “Creed” and “Black Panther” franchise filmmaker has said that his next project will indeed be returning to another piece of I.P., a long-rumored revival of “The X-Files,” the beloved Emmy-winning Fox series about FBI agents investigating the U.S. government's collaboration with extraterrestrials.

Gillian Anderson, who played FBI agent Dana Scully in the series that wrapped on Fox in 2002 but returned for two subsequent seasons in 2016 and 2018, has now revealed she's open to appearing in another version. Especially with Coogler — the “perfect person” to remake it, as she says — at the helm.

Anderson said during ITV1's “This Morning” in the below clip that she contacted “Sinners” filmmaker Coogler after it was rumored in 2023 he would be reviving the series. “I spoke to him, and what I said was, ‘If anyone were to do it, I think you are the perfect person and, best of luck, call me,'” Anderson said. “At some point, if the phone rings, and it's good, and it feels like the right time — perhaps.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






“The X-Files” first aired from 1993 to 2002 on Fox, with Anderson and David Duchovny as FBI special agents investigating paranormal cases that revealed a government collusion with extraterrestrials. The series spurred two films — “The X-Files” in 1998 and “I Want to Believe” in 2008 — in addition to its follow-up seasons.

“The X-Files” reboot as described by Coogler was first revealed by original series creator Chris Carter during the “On the Coast” podcast in 2023. “I just spoke to a young man, Ryan Coogler, who is going to remount ‘The X-Files' with a diverse cast,” Carter said at the time. “So he's got his work cut out for him, because we covered so much territory.”

After that announcement, Anderson deemed Coogler a “bit of a genius” during the “Today” show in 2024.

“It's so funny because for most of my life, since I have finished ‘The X-Files,' every interview I do, people have asked and the answer has always been, ‘Nope, not going to happen, not going to happen,'” Anderson said. “Now, Ryan Coogler, who is the director of ‘Black Panther' — brilliant, brilliant director — has approached Chris Carter to say that he wants to do a take on it, and I cannot think of a better way around for a reboot to happen.”

 










She added, “Whether I am involved in it is a whole other thing. I'm not saying no. I think he's really cool, and I think if he did it, it would probably be done incredibly well. And maybe I'll pop in for a little something something.”

Coogler later confirmed his involvement during the “Last Podcast on the Left” in 2025, saying that he will return to developing the series after “Sinners.”

“I've been excited about that for a long time, and I'm fired up to get back to it,” he said. “Some of those episodes, if we do our jobs right, will be really fucking scary. We're going to try to make something really great and really be something for the real ‘X Files' fans, and maybe find some new ones.”

Anderson has spoken out about her complicated feelings on returning to “The X-Files” before. In 2016, she made headlines when she revealed she demanded pay parity with her co-star Duchovny, whom she said was offered twice in pay what she was for her return to the 2016 series revival.

Eva Victor‘s feature directing debut “Sorry, Baby” — which the filmmaker also wrote and stars in — was the jewel of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. A24 bought the film before the festival's end, where this poignant and incisive look at an academic recovering from trauma won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award out of the U.S. Dramatic Competition. “Sorry, Baby” will hit U.S. theaters on June 27 from A24 after opening the Seattle International Film Festival for one last festival bow. The film will also close this year's Cannes Directors' Fortnight, the sidebar that regularly honors boundary-pushing filmmakers. Watch the trailer below.

A24's logline for “Sorry, Baby” is curiously mute on details — “Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on… for everyone around her, at least” — but IndieWire saw the film at Sundance and can confirm it takes a hard and unusual cinematic look at a woman reeling from a terrible encounter from her mentor. Victor, a comedian and social media star, makes a bold statement with her first film, both darkly funny and poignant. She co-stars alongside Naomi Ackie and Lucas Hedges as Agnes, who has stayed behind in the New England cottage town where she completed grad school, here still to try and make it as a writer. A fraught encounter with her thesis advisor (Louis Cancelmi) has left her scrambling for answers, as the movie charts her belated coming-of-age against the backdrop of one terrible event.

More from IndieWire's rave review: “Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on. Big, wonderful, funny, horrible, strange, sad, great life. How lucky we are that Victor is here to chronicle just that.”

Victor spoke to IndieWire at our Sundance Studio about how telling this very personal story became a kind of “therapy”: “It was definitely in a lot of ways an attempt to put myself through some sort of therapy, it's a story about healing, and in some meta ways, writing was an attempt at that, making it was an attempt at that. The film is about this serious thing in some ways but it's about the time afterwards and a friendship that gets you through that. A lot of the film is about trying to find joy, and that's what our characters are doing together in the film.”

“Sorry, Baby” finds uncomfortable humor in the darkest of times. Oscar winner Barry Jenkins produced the movie along with Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak. John Carroll Lynch co-stars as a stranger who helps Agnes out in the worst of times.

As Smerz, Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt are interested in the uncanny valleys and surreal messes of young adulthood, down to the Bama rush-meets-Blair Witch cover art of 2018's Have fun EP. Their forthcoming new record, Big city life, is a series of nights out on the town plumed in cigarette smoke, and “Feisty” might be the rowdiest of the bunch, like an episode of Girls (which turned 13 yesterday) in miniature. Time skips around when you're on the verge of blacking out, and Stoltenberg's droll narration glimpses the moments—checking your ass in the bathroom mirror, running into the guy you matched with on Tinder months ago, futilely petitioning the DJ to change the track—that disappear in a strobe flash. With chintzy string stabs and grime-caked live drums, she and Motzfeldt are on their ESG shit, and the only question worth taking seriously is Can you move to it? Like most parties, “Feisty” ends with a moment of introspection, maybe regret, but I'm partial to this earlier line: “Hey girl, I really wanna be your friend/Let us talk and dance until the end.” The end of the night? The end of time? Out on the floor, it hardly matters.

Bruce Springsteen has released the first song ever from his long-ago shelved soundtrack to Faithless, a film that was never made. Springsteen recorded much of the album in the months after his 2005 Devils & Dust tour concluded. It is one of seven albums to be unvaulted for his new collection Tracks II: The Lost Albums, out June 27. Listen to the title track of Faithless below.

“This was a really unusual collection of songs,” Springsteen said in press materials. “You could recognize details and maybe a character or two. But for the most part, I just wrote atmospheric music that I thought would fit.” Among the 11 tracks are four instrumentals, but Springsteen plays and sings solo for much of the record. Ron Aniello produced, and some touring E Street Band members—Soozie Tyrell, Lisa Lowell, Curtis King Jr., Michelle Moore and Ada Dyer—contribute alongside Patti Scialfa and Evan and Sam Springsteen.

Everything is content nowadays: crappy first dates, yapping with your friends, getting ready for work, getting ready for bed. Lucky for Jensen McRae, our output-obsessed digital ecosystem is one in which she thrives. She is not just a creator of incisive acoustic pop, but also a creator: Catch up with her on her podcast, or her Substack, or TikTok and “X,” where her occasional brushes with virality have bolstered her young music career.

The Los Angeles singer-songwriter has been compulsively tracking the minutiae of her life for much longer than she's been posting. An avid journaler, she harbors a personal archive going back nearly a decade. And even before that, she understood her role as a scrupulous observer, largely as a means of managing feelings of otherness that stemmed from growing up Black in predominantly white environments. “I started to develop this identity of being a narrator and a collector of details about my life, about other people's lives,” she told the New York Times recently. Put more bluntly on one song from her first album: “If I don't write about it, was it really worth it?”

McRae's sophomore album, I Don't Know How But They Found Me!, is a valiant bid to make heartbreak “worth it”: She forges her painstaking observations into armor and does battle with cruel exes and her own inner critic. Despite her Zillennial credentials and abundant digital savvy, McRae is engaged in a more timeless tradition—the breakup album—and taking notes from teachers like Taylor Swift and the firmament of sensitive, hyper-literate singer-songwriters that preceded her. Her first partnership with Brad Cook, producer du jour for writers of folky melodies and searching lyrics (Waxahatchee, Hurray for the Riff Raff), yields a tight, focused set of songs that bloom in the Pink Sugar air of Y2K soft-pop—but sometimes wilt from lyrical oversaturation.

Any appraisal of McRae's work inevitably involves Phoebe Bridgers, a comparison of McRae's own making. After her COVID-era tweet about a hypothetical Bridgers song blew up, McRae went ahead and wrote it herself; four years later, that track remains her second-most streamed on Spotify. The elder singer's influence extends to songs that don't explicitly mimic her, too. On I Don't Know How, it's in the frail opening bars and haunted, peripatetic imagery of “Savannah”; in the delicate blend of daydreams and nightmares on “Daffodils,” with its taut, wrenching encapsulation of cyclical abuse: “He cleaned my clock, he bought me daffodils.” The songs are simply arranged and sparsely populated; McRae is largely alone with her thoughts, or with men who are disappointing or something more sinister. Sometimes, as many do in the throes of heartbreak, she appeals to God.

Not everything is quite so grim. After “Daffodils” comes “Let Me Be Wrong,” a buoyant anthem for recovering Type As on which McRae captures the striver's greatest fear (“Somеthing twisted in my chest/Says I'm good but not the best”) and releases it to the wind (“When I was young, that knocked me out/But nothing really shakes me now”). Strummy and sunlit, it could sit comfortably between “Wide Open Spaces” and “Standing Still” on a road trip playlist—an example of the bright, nostalgic pop palette McRae deploys across the album to help counterbalance its weightier material.

It's impossible to get lost on I Don't Know How, because Jensen is always dropping a pin: She's speeding down Sunset Boulevard, on a flight to Georgia, in a bachelor pad in Shoreditch. Scene-setting is a core tenet of her craft, and a fitting technique for the story she's telling. First or foundational heartbreak presents a paradox: It happens to everyone, but when it happens to you, it feels uniquely agonizing. Seeding her narrative with specifics is how McRae lays claim to it—this is no generic heartbreak, it is hers. At the same time, she cheekily uses details to signpost something more universal. That the wayward subject of “I Can Change Him” wears cheap cologne and hand rolls his cigarettes is hardly a surprise, and when McRae mentions “navy bed sheets” on the excellent morning-after missive “Novelty,” we know exactly what kind of guy she's been spending the night with.

Such documentary instincts can make for dense lyrics. Yet the clarity and conviction with which Jensen sings draws your focus to every word. Her voice is expressive and pliable—soft and drifting one moment, grooved and throaty the next—and she seems to chew on each phrase that passes her lips, savoring it, making it sound irresistible. Only occasionally does she go overboard, as on “Tuesday,” a maudlin piano ballad where she invokes Judas and Brutus (a near-perfect rhyme, those bastards) to capture her own feelings of betrayal. Compared to the song's relatively muted arrangement, McRae's theatrical vocal performance here feels overwrought.

“Tuesday” drags down the back half's batting average. So does closer “Massachusetts,” a relationship retrospective that largely amounts to an inventory of McRae's ex's property—a novelty ashtray, his guitars, preferred beers, and video games. The song's glut of personally identifying details stemmed from a Swift-inspired songwriting exercise, she's said—but perhaps she overcommitted to the assignment. In theory, her approach gets at the random but indelible memories that stick around far longer than the people we share them with. And individual lyrics, like the line about co-opted turns of phrase (“I wonder if your tongue is turning over anything I used to say”), are strong. But the song's overall effect is of insularity, as if it was written for an audience of one—the only other person who could understand the deeper significance of the specifics.

As it turns out, “Massachusetts” wasn't supposed to be on the album at all. McRae recorded the song and reluctantly added it to the track list after an early draft made the rounds on TikTok and was boosted by Justin Bieber. Herein lies a pitfall of being a songwriter in the creator economy: The lines between organic sharing and market testing become blurred; consumer logic encroaches on creative intuition. The algorithm bites the hand that feeds it. Should Jensen ever post a snippet of a song about that twisted relationship—I'll be the first to reshare.

At the beginning of “The Times,” a smooth, diamond-in-the-back jam in the middle of his new album, (The) Forever Dream, Fly Anakin explodes into laughter. It seems to come out of nowhere, and leads Quelle Chris, who executive produced the record, into chuckling himself. There's something in the room between them—an unheard joke, an ineffable energy—that we aren't privy to. Suddenly, Mono En Stereo's Blaxploitation-esque beat is that much more enveloping; we're all in the Cadillac together, whipping through Anakin's Richmond or Quelle's Detroit, pungent smoke settling on the leather interior.

Snippets of laughter appear throughout (The) Forever Dream: Anakin chortles as his verse on “NOTTOOSHABBY” falls apart, the entire room erupts during a goofy freestyle session on “Dr. Phil (Skit),” and Lojii's verse on “CheckOnMe” features a sample of Jadakiss' iconic cackle. All these moments could've been edited out, but the decision to leave them in makes (The) Forever Dream that much more charming. These songs seem to form while we're listening, as though their creators have invited us to kick it in the studio, emptying cigars, passing bottles, and yes-anding each joke. It's the warmest, most welcoming record in Anakin's discography, a testament to his and Quelle's chemistry, and the joy they both feel when making music.

Though Quelle only produces a couple of tracks, he looms large over the record. He pops up in the margins of songs, appearing to kick a loose verse or provide an off-the-cuff hook. Quelle likes to constantly reinvent himself, reshaping his voice with each album to find new contours. Anakin, on the other hand, is a tireless technician, seeking out and expelling the impurities in his approach, honing each line until it lands like a drum roll. His records sound less like different versions of each other than increasingly refined versions of the same idea: an MC whose every song inches closer to a Platonic ideal.

Like a shoulder massage, Quelle's presence softens some of Anakin's rigidity and gently encourages him to take new risks. For over a decade, Anakin and his Mutant Academy comrades have been issuing stoned, soulful music that sits somewhere between the golden-era revivalism of early aughts Justus League and the dense trippiness of Backwoodz Studioz. The largely in-house production on Anakin's breakout album, 2022's Frank, introduced the Mutants' dreamy, loop-based psychedelia to a larger audience, alongside beats from progenitors like Madlib and Evidence. Here, Quelle brings in producers from his stable of collaborators, including Chris Keys, Child Actor, and August Fanon, all of whom specialize in the woozy, heavy-eyed vibe Anakin tends to gravitate toward. (The) Forever Dream doesn't stray too far from his usual palette, but it expands the scope, positioning Anakin as an auteur of mellifluous, multicolored rap music.

Anakin has always had a keen ear for melodic production, but this is perhaps his most tuneful batch of songs yet. The Alchemist's beat for “Corner Pocket” could be lifted from a Prefab Sprout song, its downward-spiraling chorused guitar line like a bar band too many drinks into its second set. Anakin's bouncy iambic flow creates a lovely contrast with Bbymutha's Gangsta Boo-like drawl, and when Quelle pops up with a chest-puffed, “Shouts out to me/I call the radio, send my shouts out to me,” Anakin's immediate “My man!” ad-lib feels effortless and intuitive. There's a comforting, familiar feeling throughout: The loungey chords that softly arpeggiate during opener “Good Clothes” build so patiently that you don't notice the drums as they flutter in and out, and the lilting vocal sample on “CheckOnMe” sounds like a folk song you've heard all your life but can't place. The only discordant moment comes from Quelle himself, whose production on “YOUGOTME!!” pits an out-of-tune piano line against a synth line full of accidentals, but even the clashing notes can't suppress the catchy melody.

In press materials, Anakin refers to (The) Forever Dream as “mindless music,” an exercise in seeing what happens naturally, with no conceptual framework. He lets himself experiment more, relaxing his typical metronomic precision and adopting a shaggier, more footloose demeanor. You can hear him tinkering: On “CheckOnMe,” he introduces a loping, slightly behind-the-beat flow, pushing it to its zombie-walk extreme one song later on “NOTTOOSHABBY.” The looser moments set him up to snap back into his diamond-cut technique, so “Lil One” or “YOUGOTME!!” land as big payoffs. Things occasionally get a little too mellow, like on “Lord Forgives, I Hold Grudges,” where Denmark Vessey and Pink Siifu's airy verses float around Anakin's more grounded stanzas. Still, when sharing the mic with big personalities like Quelle or Turich Benjy (who unspools a showstopping verse on “Say Thank You”), or navigating the album's driftiest beats, Anakin remains its unshakable center of gravity.

Though his profile has steadily increased over the past 11 years, Anakin has maintained some mystery. We know he loves weed, and we know who his heroes are, but we rarely glimpse his vulnerabilities and fears. He's a bit more candid than usual on this album, acknowledging the stresses of long-term relationships (“My shorty gimme lip, sometimes I give it back/Most times, I smoke it off,” he raps on “Lil One”) or his apprehensions about the music industry (“Told me I could be the biggest thing if I just make the list/But I don't see a future in this game playing politics,” he raps on “Forever Dream”), but it's through the sense of community he builds that we learn what he truly values. Anakin brings Richmond with him wherever he goes—Mutant Academy members Big Kahuna OG, Foisey, and Sycho Sid all make appearances on the album, and Richmond legends Nickelus F and $ilkmoney show up to kick verses and talk shit. The laughter peppered throughout comes from many different people, and it appears as if Anakin was never recording alone. The real forever dream is simple: Continue to make dope shit with your friends for as long as possible. That's the point of it all.

“I love the silliness and the joy that comes with the P-Funk universe,” multi-instrumentalist Emma-Jean Thackray recently told The Guardian. “It's not like free jazz; it's Black liberation music for the masses.” On her second full-length, Weirdo, Thackray's music—bouncy jazz-funk dusted with spiritual overtones and rubbed down by velveteen '70s soul—does for grief and loneliness what the Mothership did for Black identity. It uses humor and a shuffling beat to get at something deeply serious, to shape it, to say the unsayable. Its 20 tracks wiggle by in a constantly evolving groove that dares you to stay reverent; you might laugh out loud a few times. Though you will have ample opportunities to try, you will not have more fun empathizing with someone's suffering this year than you will listening to Weirdo.

Thackray initially intended for the follow-up to 2021's acclaimed Yellow to be a musical exploration of her neurodivergence—a risky proposition for even the most self-aware musician, although for Thackray, a record about her ADHD and autism could well play to her considerable strengths: She writes rhythms that ripple and eddy, and melodies that ping like super balls in a small room. Shortly after she began work, however, her longtime partner unexpectedly passed away, throwing her deep into grief. Weirdo became her way of pulling herself back out. She recorded the album alone in her South London flat, and, save for cameos from Reggie Watts and rapper Kassa Overall, she's responsible for every sound on the record: vocal harmonies that spread like a fan unfolding, exhaling Rhodes piano, programmed and live drums, flugelhorns, enough synthesizers to make 1974 Herbie Hancock jealous. Her name is listed 123 times in the album's credits.

Printing that surplus of Emma-Jean Thackrays in Weirdo's liner notes is meant to be a bit, as is the toaster perched on the edge of the tub on the album's cover. Both are funny, kind of—but, like the dark comedy of the album's lyrics, the cheekiness is a mask Thackray wants you to notice. “I don't wanna go on,” she sings in the opening moments of “What is the Point,” a brutal line whose brutality you nearly forget when the squishy synths and curving groove kick in; her vamp on the phrase “what is the point,” later in the song, is clever, but also tragic, but also vocally impressive, but also inspirational: Her runs are so remarkable, you can hear the music bringing her to a place her words can't.

Weirdo is full of moments like this, where thin layers of emotion stack into mille-feuilles Thackray invites you to pick through while you're dancing. Over the heavy funk of “Tofu,”, she sings for her supper through a bright melody, and when the bean curd fails to heal her wounds, she swerves that melody into a wordless la da da da da da da. Did you know dissociation can be funky? Lest you think she's ready to move on and return to the noble work of performing grief, she follows “Tofu” with “Fried Rice,” hoping maybe this time it'll work (it doesn't).

Thackray's talents as a singer and arranger are key to the album's success. Her voice is airy like crepe-paper streamers, with a bit of Georgia Anne Muldrow's pinch and some of Erykah Badu's snap. Like Badu, she lets her melodies take on the tone of conversation, setting “Stay” down in a moment of resignation; later in the same song, she flicks a Prince guitar solo across the beat. After starting with an Afrobeat stutter, “Save Me” melts into rich vintage soul, its bobbing hotel-lounge groove finally ending in a gospel rave-up. In “Let Me Sleep,” she pads McCoy Tyner chords with the kind of gently rattling beat that would ordinarily take a song over; here, she slips it behind the keys, making both instruments sound plaintive and exhausted. A little scrap of guitar wanders around the margins of the title track until it gains a bit of power and will from its solitude.

If you've never lost anyone, this arch approach might feel a little gross. In fact, Weirdo's artistic success depends on that; you're supposed to wonder why someone in so much pain is intent on throwing an incredible house-quaking party. Take a step back, though, and Weirdo becomes a very serious and genuinely moving portrayal of what mourning can do to you. After a while, the feeling is still there, and the expression of it is still legit, but you get tired of seeing it around; you have to start doing other things with it. As you go deeper into Weirdo, the album's opening track—a kooky vocal reading of its title, “There's Something Wrong With Your Mind,” that sounds a bit like Sun Ra Arkestra—feels less like a possible remnant of the neurodivergent album and more like the sound of Thackray's own exhaustion.

	In an episode of the new Netflix comedy The Four Seasons, Tina Fey's character, Kate, compares a situation to Zelig, an obscure Woody Allen film from 1983. Kate's husband Jack (Will Forte) sarcastically replies, “Oh, that's a really fresh reference!” 


The Four Seasons is perhaps an even less fresh reference. The story of three couples — Jack and Kate, Nick (Steve Carell) and Anne (Kerri Kenney-Silver), and Danny (Colman Domingo) and Claude (Marco Calvani) — who go on four memorable vacations together over the course of a year, it's a remake of a 1981 movie that was Alan Alda's film directorial debut. Alda's version was well-reviewed, and it grossed over $50 million (nearly $180 million in 2025 dollars), a testament to how beloved Alda was at the time as the leading man on the hit sitcom M*A*S*H. But it hasn't lingered in the collective memory the way some other films of its vintage have, in part because its target audience was moviegoers who were middle-aged, like its stars, back then. 

	











	It was also released at a time when there weren't constantly family-friendly movie options in theaters every weekends, so some parents who didn't want to hire a babysitter took their kids along to The Four Seasons. I saw it as a seven-year-old, but recall nothing other than the distinct feeling that it was a film in no way made for someone my age. Fey is a little older than me — she would have just turned 11 when it came out. And apparently either the film or her interactions with Alda when he guest-starred in several episodes of 30 Rock (playing Jack Donaghy's biological father) left enough of an impression that she, along with past and present collaborators Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, decided to adapt The Four Seasons for television. Hey, at least it's a relatively unusual deviation(*) from the kinds of things that usually get remade in the IP Is Everything era of TV!

(*) A few other Seventies and Eighties films for adults have gotten similar treatment in recent years, with Showtime at one point offering new versions of both American Gigolo and The Man Who Fell to Earth, both of which came and went without much notice.

	Since even the 1981 movie's most laudatory reviews suggested Alda had shot several episodes of television and strung them together, the switch in mediums is an easy fit. And the nature of the story lends itself to being told in this format, with two episodes apiece for each calendar season, and thus each trip the group takes together. 

	











	But despite the pedigree of that cast and of Fey, Fisher (who also created Never Have I Ever), and Wigfield (who created Great News and Peacock's Saved by the Bell legasequel) as writers, The Four Seasons never quite makes a convincing argument for why its story needed to be revisited today. There are some amusing moments, and a few genuinely poignant ones, but on the whole it feels thin — less a TV show than an excuse for a bunch of talented people, several of them old friends IRL, to hang out together in a variety of pretty locales. It's like a Grown-Ups film, but without the fart jokes. 


	Our story begins in spring, when the group traditionally assembles at Nick and Anne's beautiful lake house. The other duos have problems — Jack and Kate's marriage has become a bit too routine, while Claude feels Danny is being too cavalier about some age-appropriate health news — but the main source of tension comes from Nick's confession that he wants to divorce Anne. “We're like co-workers at a nuclear facility!” he says of how lifeless their marriage feels. “We sit in the same room all night monitoring different screens!” 


	After a cameo by Alda himself — by far the funniest and most touching part of the whole affair, with Alda proving he's still got it, even at 89 and dealing with Parkinson's — we shift to summer, where the other couples are struggling to get used to Nick's much younger new girlfriend Ginny (Erica Henningsen) while on vacation at a comically crunchy eco-friendly resort she picked out for them. Then there's an autumn parents' weekend trip to college to visit the daughters of Jack, Kate, Nick, and Anne, before the season concludes with parallel winter lodge stays for the now-splintered group(*).

(*) Given that most of these friendships go back decades, it's impressive that they've made it so long taking multiple trips together per year — as much for the logistics of it as for the fact that nobody got sick of each other until this point.  


	There are some solid bits of physical comedy here and there, particularly in the summer episodes, and dramatic moments land from time to time. There's also a late plot development that turns the show into a weirdly specific piece of typecasting for one of its actors. Mostly, though, Fey and company seem content to coast on vibes and the chemistry among the cast. The results are pleasant, but rarely more than that. Nick's daughter Lila (Julia Lester) accuses him of having a “pretty basic midlife crisis,” and the first half of that phrase applies to most of The Four Seasons. Everybody seemed to have a good time making it. Sometimes, that spirit becomes a bit infectious. But just as various characters keep questioning why the group chose to go on one trip or another, you will probably come to the end of the season wondering why this impressive group of people decided this was the project they wanted to join forces to remake.

	In January 2023, Tablo told Rolling Stone that “another Tablo x RM collab is in the pipeline.” Fans assumed that this collaboration between the Epik High frontman and the BTS leader would happen sooner rather than later. But two years after the rapper originally hinted about the upcoming song, the artists are ready to share their evocative single, “Stop the Rain,” which will be released at midnight Eastern time on Friday.


	“I've been holding onto this song for two years,” Tablo tells Rolling Stone in an exclusive Zoom interview from Seoul. “One of the reasons was because as I was listening to the song, I realized that both of us were talking about very personal things. It really felt like entries in a diary or some sort of confession. It only occurred to me then, which is crazy that we weren't really aware of where we were going with the song.”


	Toward the end of 2023, while Tablo was still pondering what to do with the song, RM, 30, enlisted in the South Korean military, which is mandatory for all able-bodied men.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Once he enlisted, there was no way for me to get in touch with him for a while,” Tablo, 44, continues. “I thought maybe this song should come out when he's around, or maybe not at all. There are many songs in my vault that I haven't released for the same reason. So I just held on to it.” He says that he spoke with RM “a few times” after the younger artist enlisted, but never brought up the subject of the song. “And then a few months ago, he hit me up and said, ‘Hyeong [a Korean term used by a younger man addressing his older brother or close male friend], where's the song we finished recording a while ago? Why don't you drop it?' I explained to him that I felt maybe his lyrics were very personal and I didn't know if he wanted it out. And he said, ‘What are you talking about? Drop it!'”


	Smiling, Tablo adds, “That's why I've been in a complete rush to get things together and finalize the mix. That's why this song is dropping now.”

	Tablo is intentionally releasing the song a month before RM is discharged from the military, sparing RM from having to answer questions about his lyrics, which are unflinching in their depiction of despair, and their shared feeling — at different times in their lives — that they might not live long enough to grow old. Over a languid beat, RM raps, “When I was a kid/I was convinced that I was destined for the 27 club/I'm 29 sinkin' in a bathtub.” 

	











	The 27 club refers to a collective of prominent musicians who coincidentally died at the age of 27, including Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones' Brian Jones, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and the K-pop star Jonghyun of Shinee.


	Having lived through TaJinYo — a yearslong smear campaign orchestrated by hundreds of thousands of anti-fans who hated him — Tablo didn't want RM to be targeted by spiteful people intent on sensationalizing his lyrics. The personal topics they address on “Stop the Rain” include mental and physical abuse, as well as suicidal ideation. The song is in English, except for one line in Korean near the end: “다시 덫 뒤에 덫,” which alludes to a cycle of feeling trapped.


	“If it was just my song with only me on it, I would have been OK with releasing this song right away,” Tablo says. “But with RM on it, it's a different story. I worried about how it could impact him. I didn't want him to be harmed in any way.”


	Tablo's less concerned with how listeners may react to his own lyrics, which reveal the abuse he says he lived through as a child: “Raised by shame/Raised by the rod/Bloody calves sacrificed in the name of God/They claimed it was love/Felt like heartbreak to me.”

	Before his family immigrated to Canada, Tablo went to school in South Korea during a time when teachers had impunity to smack their students. (Corporal punishment in schools wasn't banned until 2010.) “My sister was talking about this in front of my daughter, and Haru asked if I had been hit,” he recalls. “My sister said, ‘Oh, your dad got slapped all the time.' So we had this conversation, which was interesting, because this song kind of touches upon it. But I wasn't just hit by one person. I was hit by my dad. I was hit by my mom. I was hit by my brother. I was hit by my teachers. And when you came home and told your parents that your teacher beat you, you would get hit again for getting beat in school. I was like a ping-pong ball.”


	As a parent, Tablo says he has worked hard to break this cycle. Hitting a child isn't something he ever did. But he sometimes finds himself speaking to his daughter in a way that is reminiscent of “past generations flowing through me.”


	“I grew up in a certain way, and sometimes say the exact same things I hated [hearing when I was a child],” he says. “But my daughter is very open with me and tells me exactly what she feels” — which gives him the opportunity “to apologize and stop.”

	











	He says the core memories from his own childhood made it into “Stop the Rain,” with rain offering hope, renewal, and cleansing that can alleviate some of the despair.


	“Even as a child when people asked me what I liked the most, I would always say rainy days,” he says. “They would assume that it was about the rain. But it's not. Rain allows me to realize how lucky I am to have a roof over my head. How lucky I am to be able to be holding an umbrella with or for someone. It makes me hyper aware of how rare and amazing sunny days are, and to see a rainbow is just a bonus. I like writing about rain, not because it sounds moody and cool, but because for me it has always symbolized this duality.”


	So it's not surprising that rain is a recurring theme in Tablo's work with Epik High (“Rhapsody of Rain,” “Rain Song,” “Umbrella,” “Rain Again Tomorrow”). Or that he's drawn to RM's solo song “Forever Rain,” where the K-pop idol contemplates how a heavy rainfall offers him a bit of anonymity from peering eyes. 


	RM has often praised Tablo's artistry and spoken of how much Epik High has impacted his own growth as a musician. But Tablo is just as quick to stress the importance of RM and BTS, not only for the group's music, but for the way they've broken cultural and musical barriers. It's because of this mutual respect that their collaborations go beyond merely guesting on a track. Each is involved in writing what they will sing, and offering ideas on how to make the song stronger. This is how they worked on “All Day,” a cut from RM's 2022 solo album Indigo. And with “Stop the Rain,” Tablo agreed with RM's suggestion that the song would flow better in English, rather than Korean as originally planned.

	“The way he treated both these collabs made me feel kind of honored that he was putting so much effort into it,” Tablo says. “He cared enough to make it a great song. There was another bridge that made the song longer. He said, ‘What do you think about taking it out?' And until he said that, I was content with how it was. But he was right. An example that I wanted to tell you about is that there's a line in the song that at first was something like, ‘I can never stop the rain.' And then RM said, ‘I think we should change that line. What do you think about, ‘I'm tryna stop the rain.' And I was like, ‘Yo, that's way better!'”


	He adds: “I thought about how when I was younger working with other artists on their songs, if I didn't think something was really the best choice, I would just let it fly and remain quiet. I thought that was what you're supposed to do. But in retrospect, maybe I should've said something, too, and given them the opportunity to rethink an idea. That's a true collaboration. I will always be grateful to RM for caring enough to go out on a limb like he always does.”

	Dear Mr. President, we say no to your power grab, and this week people are taking to the streets to protest it. Rallies, marches, town halls, and other direct actions have been increasing over the past month, and today more than a thousand protest events will take place across all 50 states. While organizers tell us the primary focus of Thursday's May Day demonstrations is rallying against the “billionaire takeover” of the federal government, grassroots opposition is on the rise as Americans feel the ramifications of your policies.


	We the people say no to executive overreach and your flagrant amassing of authority by purging thousands of civil servants so you can fill them with zero-sum loyalists or eliminate their positions entirely under the guise of efficiency. We say no to intimidation, to stonewalling court orders, and to flouting the rule of law itself when it's not to your liking. Most fundamental of all, we say no evading checks and balances, the very foundation of how our government has operated since the Constitution you swore to uphold was first ratified. That's not governance, it's not making anything great, and we the people say hell no.

	











	We must be active, smart, and resilient in how we fight back and put a stop to these abuses. That means seeing the big picture and where we're all headed if we do not resist and speak out. We must also provide a positive vision. We're saying no to many things the Trump administration is doing, but we are also saying yes to making life in the nation actually great.

	We know well that times are hard for a huge number of Americans and that many of us feel disempowered: financially, culturally, geographically, you name it. We know, Mr. President, that you tapped into those feelings during the election — after all, who among us doesn't want their government to be more efficient, who doesn't want to feel safe? — and we know that you're a consummate salesman who convinced 77 million people that your leadership was the country's best choice even after you finished your last term as a serial-lying, insurrection-raising, Muslim-banning, family-separating, bankruptcy-filing, hush-money-paying, business-record-falsifying, classified-document-stealing, liable for sexually abusing, abortion-ban-producing, twice-impeached, election-subverting felon. That's impressive.

	So too, Mr. President, is your flood-the-zone strategy, a blitz of executive orders, announcements, and a daily assault on rights and governance meant to stun and immobilize those of us who oppose your agenda — a strategy we recognize as a page from the classic autocratic playbook that it is. Putting aside the recurrent onslaught and day-to-day chaos of the administration, the massive amount of money allowed in our politics, and even the horribly bungled implementation of so many of your policy rollouts — firing, rehiring, and keeping government workers in limbo; explosive tariff mania that's jacking up prices, started a global trade war, and is sending the stock market zigzagging downward — let's step back and name some of the things we oppose about the first 100 days of your second term.


	We say no to defying the judiciary by selectively disregarding due process as enshrined in the Constitution, arguing that presidents have absolute powers over the executive branch that the judiciary cannot usurp, filing motions to disqualify judges, and calling for the impeachment of those ruling against your administration, all while disregarding court orders that conflict with your agenda.


	We say no to chainsawing the federal workforce and dismantling large parts of the government via a so-called Department of Government Efficiency, no to your gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development and Department of Education, and no to the massive layoffs and reckless firings of essential workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Health and Human Services Department, the IRS, FEMA, AmeriCorps, and the Social Security Administration. 


	We say no to your shameful efforts to erase transgender identity, so often by hiding behind the fig leaf of religious freedom. We are all your administration's constituents, Mr. President, and ostracizing any of us is an attack against all of us. From blocking new passports for trans and nonbinary Americans to trying to ban transgender people from serving in the military and from your housing trans women in male prisons to erasing trans history and public health data from government websites, we say no. 


	We say no to withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the landmark global initiative to address the climate crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions signed by every nation on Earth except Yemen, Libya, and Iran. We say no to your doubling down on fossil fuels, to rolling back fuel economy standards, and to ending requirements that big polluters disclose how much carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases they emit. We do not approve of your canceling $20 billion in climate grants, ending climate standards on household appliances, and moving to repeal dozens of the nation's most significant environmental regulations. 

	











	We also say no, Mr. President, to effectively switching sides on the war in Ukraine, blaming Ukraine for starting the war, being deferential to Vladimir Putin, and allowing members of the Cabinet to spout the Russian government's talking points. We say no to walking away from our allies and fostering an adversarial relationship with the European Union. We say no to pledging to retake the Panama Canal, no to insisting that the U.S. will acquire Greenland (which we imagine will go about as well as your endless 2016 promises that Mexico would build and pay for a wall along the southern border), and no to saying that Canada should become part of the U.S. We say no to renaming the Gulf of Mexico and proposing that the U.S. take over Gaza, displacing the entire Palestinian population of the devastated enclave and turning it into “the Riviera of the Middle East.”


	I'll say this for you, Mr. President. When you hate something, you really hate it. While nobody is advocating to keep violent criminal migrants in the country, many of us draw a distinction between civil removal proceedings and criminal prosecutions, and we say no to your firing immigration judges when there's a backlog of cases. But what's really galling is the cruelty, lawlessness, and overreach of your crackdown. 


	We say no to deporting anyone without due process. We say no to illegally deporting people from the United States to El Salvador (255 and counting). And we say no to your deporting anyone because of an administrative error, especially to a foreign prison notorious for its inhumane conditions, and then refusing to bring him back even when a court orders you to do so. We say no to your deporting two-, four-, and seven-year old citizens, no to your saying undocumented immigrants shouldn't get trials, and no to insisting that your administration should be able to deport unauthorized immigrants without appearing before a judge. 


	We also say no to terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government, to blaming DEI for the deadly midair collision over the Potomac in January, and to withholding federal funding from states and districts with diversity programs in their public schools orders that are designed to ensure equal opportunity for all — and we say yes to equal access to jobs, housing, health care, and education for everybody.


	When it comes to our nation's health, we say no to withdrawing from the World Health Organization (again), no to gutting the National Institutes of Health to the tune of 1,300 fired workers, no to terminating employees and active research grants at the National Science Foundation, as well as your canceling $2 billion in federal research grants that include clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and cancer. These are the things that affect our lives and loved ones. So we are going to keep saying no to extensive staff reductions that include scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Environmental Protection Agency, and no to the Department of Health and Human Services abruptly discontinuing $11.4 billion in state grants used to track infectious diseases and to support mental health services, addiction treatment, and other urgent health issues.

	











	As for institutions, we say no to your freezing, reducing, and eliminating billions of dollars in funding to an ever-widening group of universities in federal grants and contracts because you don't like their politics. Fighting the insidiousness of antisemitism and all other forms of hate is momentous, necessary, and to be applauded, Mr. President. But bullying exceptional schools with lists of demands based on your ideology is unacceptable. We say no to detaining international students, no to sending permanent legal residents to ICE detention centers, no to entering student housing, and no to plainclothes officers physically restraining students before showing their badges, all of which have happened during your campus crackdowns. Beyond universities, we say no to your vengeful targeting of political opponents and threatening perceived enemies including law firms, news organizations, television networks, former officials, and cultural institutions like the Kennedy Center.

Kamala Harris criticized Donald Trump in a speech in San Francisco last night, noting that his administration has perpetuated a “wholesale abandonment” of America's highest ideals. 


	Speaking at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, Harris took aim at the president's agenda. During the 15-minute speech, Harris reflected on the fear and anxiety being caused by Trump's tactics and praised those who have been standing up against them. 


	“They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,” she said. “But what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious. The courage of Americans who are banding together against the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.”


	Harris called Trump's tariffs “reckless” and said they hurt workers and families, as well as American businesses. She added that these tariffs “as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.”

	During the speech, Harris noted that the Republicans aren't just creating “absolute chaos.” Instead, she said the administration is following a calculated plan. 


	“What we are in fact witnessing is a high-velocity event,” she said. “Where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making. An agenda to slash public education. An agenda to shrink government and then privatize its services. All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. By the way, an agenda that is not lowering costs. Not making life more affordable. And not what they promised.”


	She continued, “It's an agenda, a narrow, self-serving vision of America where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power, and leave everyone else to fend for themselves. All while abandoning allies and retreating from the world.”


	Harris added that we are currently experiencing is “exactly what they envisioned for America.” She said there is a risk of a constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to stand up to the president.

	“That is a crisis that will eventually impact everyone,” she said. “Because it would mean that the rules that protect our fundamental rights and freedoms, that ensure each of us has a say in how our government works, will no longer matter.”

	











	The former vice president warned that if that does happen “the one check, the one balance, the one power that must not fail is the voice of the people.”

	Elsewhere during her speech, Harris praised Democrats who have been “speaking with moral clarity” about Trump's action. She called out Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Bernie Sanders, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by name, thanking them for their efforts. 


	Harris has kept a low profile since losing the presidential election to Trump last year. Last night's speech represented her longest remarks since she left office in January. It has been speculated that Harris could run for office again, including for governor of California, however she did not address her future during the speech. She closed the evening by acknowledging, “Things are probably going to get worse before they get better. But we are ready for it.”

P
iper Rockelle's pug, Frank, scuttles around the room as she sits cross-legged on her bed in a pink hoodie and pajama pants patterned with teddy bears, the shades drawn against the waning California sunlight. Her long brown hair falls over her shoulders and she clicks her French-tipped nails together as she talks. She looks like any other teenager in suburban Los Angeles, even though she has 15.4 million followers on TikTok, 12.1 million subscribers on YouTube, and 6.3 million followers on Instagram. Hugely famous since before she hit double digits, Rockelle became the face of child internet stardom, and then, almost as quickly, the unwilling poster child for its dangers. “People don't want to work with me,” says Rockelle, sitting in the bedroom of the modern farmhouse she shares with her mother, Tiffany Smith, and Smith's boyfriend, Hunter Hill. “People want nothing to do with me.” 


	The 17-year-old content creator has been putting off having this conversation, but she's known for a while it was probably coming — ever since Netflix announced Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing. The three-part series tells the story of Rockelle and the Squad, a group of child influencers who got together in 2017, reaching the heights of viral fame. But after a few years, the kids slowly started to break out of the group. In 2022, 11 former members filed a lawsuit against Smith, the de facto head of the Squad; Hill, who often filmed and edited the videos; and Piper Rockelle Inc., alleging “emotional, verbal, physical, and at times, sexual abuse.” The plaintiffs also claimed they weren't sufficiently compensated by Smith, and that Smith and Hill used “dirty tactics” (including embedding videos of minors into porn sites) to sabotage the YouTube channels of Squad members after they left. They sought $22 million in damages. The defendants roundly denied the claims. 

	











	When the lawsuit was settled in 2024 for a reported $1.85 million, Rockelle says she thought God was answering her prayers. Finally, after two years of lawyers, it was over — but of course, it wasn't. When the documentary came out on April 9, it shot to the top of the Netflix charts, bringing in millions of viewers and reigniting a conversation about the ethical considerations of child influencers. It criticized the way Smith ran the house and acted around the children, and questioned Rockelle's post-Squad content, which many have called overly sexualized. Though Rockelle and Smith loom large in the series, neither of them agreed to be interviewed for it, and they say they didn't consent to their likenesses and images being used. (A source familiar with production says all footage used in the documentary was appropriately licensed or permissible through fair-use guidelines.) Instead, the former Squad members and their mothers were interviewed, telling viewers about their harrowing experiences with child-influencer stardom — laying much of the blame on Smith, while saying that they saw Rockelle as a victim, and only want the best for her in the future.

	The plight of the child star is not new — in the 1930s, there was Shirley Temple; in the 1990s, there was Macaulay Culkin — but the internet has supercharged the experience of childhood fame. Unlike their predecessors, child influencers are not famous for playing a role; they're famous for being themselves. Because of the endless churn of content creation that life as an influencer requires, fans have near-constant access to their favorite child influencers. The boundaries between work and life are blurred; a child influencer's work is their life, and their home, oftentimes, is their set. They're also much less legally protected than child actors — in the Wild West of the influencer industry, there are few legal protections for the kids at the center of the content, leaving advocates worried about the financial, ethical, and privacy implications. As their platform grows larger, the fame of the child influencer becomes a family affair, with parents managing their careers — or, as detractors accuse, exploiting their kids — because in this multibillion-dollar industry, there are fortunes to be made on the backs of children.

	To hear Rockelle tell it, the most distressing part of her career was not her days in the Squad as a famous kid influencer, but the onslaught of hate she and her mother have received in the wake of the lawsuit and the docuseries. There are the mean comments, the anonymous calls to Child Protective Services, the death threats. The offers for collaborations largely dried up; YouTube demonetized her channel. These kids — now teenagers — were Rockelle's friends, and despite their tearful, on-camera pleas for her safety, she says she hasn't heard from them, and she doesn't believe their motives are altruistic in the slightest. “I'm safe,” she says. “I don't need to be helped. They want publicity. They want sympathy. It's my turn now.”


	ASIDE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA posts winking at the documentary's existence, Rockelle hasn't addressed it publicly; that's why I've been invited to her house, which is behind a gate in an otherwise unassuming Southern California neighborhood. Smith, the boogeyman of the docuseries, opens the door with a PR representative. She shakes my hand and thanks me for coming, offering me water or a probiotic soda. Outside the front door is a Rockelle-branded vending machine next to a chair and table with a jigsaw puzzle spread over it. Smith takes a seat there and tells me I can go upstairs. Hill comes down as I go up. Before I can knock on her bedroom door, Rockelle opens it. 

	











	On YouTube, the Squad became known for challenges (“Last to Leave the Trampoline Wins $10,000,” viewed more than 4.7 million times), pranks (“RANDOMLY CRYING THROUGHOUT THE DAY PRANK!!,” viewed more than 3.1 million times), and sometimes, blending challenges and pranks into one (“Who Can MAKE the MOST MONEY in 24 Hours Challenge **KISSING BOOTH PRANK,*” viewed 11 million times). 


	How these videos came together, as well as the moments that didn't make it to YouTube, has become the crux of the allegations. Rockelle, Smith, and Hill stand together on one side. On the other, it seems, is everyone else. According to the ex-Squad members featured in the series, they were scripted into intimate interactions with one another, like the times they were instructed to kiss or talk about their crushes, which left them feeling uncomfortable. They also say they were put into situations that made them feel unsafe; there's footage in the documentary of one prank where a Squad member is arrested by actors playing police officers, and kids are seen sobbing before the prank is revealed. Yet Rockelle maintains all the videos were scripted ahead of time. “We knew who was going to win a challenge. We knew who was going to prank the person,” she says, before adding, “And I'm not trying to discredit any of the victims, but we all knew how to cry on command.”


	The docuseries also alleges that Rockelle and Smith took advantage of the other Squad members, having them appear for free in her videos, making money off their likenesses without appropriate compensation. But Rockelle, the center around which the group revolved, claims it was the moms of her fellow Squad members who were using her. “I was in everyone's videos because all the moms would constantly be like, ‘I want Piper in my kids' video,'” Rockelle says. When the Squad would go out to dinner, Rockelle remembers the moms urging their kids to sit next to her. “It was a competition like, ‘Who's going to be Piper's best friend? Who's going to be Piper's boyfriend?' It made this stigma in my brain that everybody that's ever nice to me is just trying to get close to me to have me be in their videos.” 


	Some of the claims have to do with how Smith marketed Rockelle when she was still a preteen. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs alleged that Smith had sent “several of Piper's soiled training bras and panties to an unknown individual.” Rockelle is adamant that never happened — that it was, instead, related to an arrangement she had with a popular app that sells secondhand clothes. “I had a Poshmark that I was selling my old clothes on because I had a brand deal,” she says. “I never sold any of my underwear.” 

	











	The most serious of the allegations in the lawsuit and docuseries, however, have to do with Smith, who former Squad members accused of acting sexually inappropriate. That included the allegation that Smith would assume the alter ego of Lenny, a cat they'd had who died, and tell the kids things like, “I'm going to touch you in your sleep,” or ask whether they'd ever had sex before. A male Squad member claimed that she asked about the size of his penis, and if his testicles had “dropped” yet. Two members said that she would enter their rooms while they slept. Then there was the time she kissed Squad member Reagan Beast, then just 17, directly on the lips on a livestream, which is shown in the series.  


	While Smith declined an interview with Rolling Stone, she did reply to detailed questions in writing. “There's never been any kind of abuse. No physical abuse, no sexual abuse. No verbal abuse. Nothing,” she wrote. In Smith's telling, some of the claims in the lawsuit — like the allegation that she would say sexually explicit things to the kids — are “terrible exaggerations.” There was a Lenny voice, Smith says, but it was done in jest with the other parents, and it was alongside other voices the moms would do with one another. “It was just silly, stupid humor, but totally G-rated in front of the kids,” Smith says. And that weird kiss with Beast? She insists it was “a bad joke” and “the most overblown kiss in history.” 


	Smith also addressed the claims that she sabotaged ex-Squad members' YouTube channels. “The truth is that the other kids did way better on social media when Piper was a part of their videos. But if they left, or stopped making videos with Piper, their numbers dropped because Piper was no longer carrying them, and they were no longer making content that worked. It wasn't engaging,” she wrote. “That may be sad for those moms and kids to admit, but it wasn't bots or dirty tricks. Piper has always been the star. And not because of bots.” These days, Smith says, she's not very involved in Piper's content creation. Smith suggested her daughter distance herself from her infamous mother to save her own reputation, but Rockelle wouldn't do it. “She's had so much taken away from her already,” Smith wrote. “Piper is the real victim in this whole thing.” In response to a request for comment, ex-Squad member Claire Smith, who is Smith's niece, said, “Piper is a victim — of her own mother. Sharing our story was about protecting other kids from suffering the same kind of harm we did.”

	











	ROCKELLE HASN'T WATCHED the Netflix documentary, but says she can't escape it, especially on her TikTok For You Page. Sometimes, she says, she scrolls away; other times she watches. She knows the crux of the allegations made in the documentary. “They're not making it up, but they're extending the truth,” she says. “I was there. I witnessed every day.” It's not that everything was perfect, Rockelle says, but she doesn't believe it was as bad as the documentary presents, either. “I think that they believe what they are saying, but I was there and I saw everything.” 


	When the trailer dropped in March, Rockelle didn't cope well, and things got worse after it was released. “I just completely fell apart,” she says, her voice cracking. “I did not think I was going to get through it.” She started having “awful thoughts”; she kept them to herself instead of telling her mom because she felt Smith was already going through enough. Rockelle worried about her mother being taken away by police; she feared what would happen if someone recognized Smith in public. “That's something I have to worry about is people coming and trying to take away my mother because they always envied my mom and I's relationship,” Rockelle says. “My father was never in my life, so it's always just been her.” As a daughter raised by a single mother, Rockelle is especially protective of Smith, who she says has been slandered by the claims against her. 


	The insistence from the former Squad members that they took part in the documentary for a positive reason — to save her from the clutches of her mother — doesn't fly for Rockelle. “You know where I live. Come get me if you want to save me,” she says. “If you want to ‘save Piper,' stop talking please. Because by hurting my mother, you're hurting a part of me.” In an interview for Teen Vogue, Rockelle's ex-best friend Sophie Fergi told me she wants Rockelle to know “it's not her fault and she needs to get away.” At the mention of these comments, Rockelle says simply, “She knows I don't need to be saved. The reason why people keep talking about you sometimes is because when they start talking about themselves, nobody listens.”


	The version of her childhood and adolescence Rockelle is laying out is at near complete odds with the one portrayed in Bad Influence, but she's disinclined to speak of the specifics, at least while she's still underage. Of the allegations her former friends have made against her mother, she says, “They're stretching the truth. I was there every day.” She declines to talk about Smith using the Lenny persona to say inappropriate things to her friends: “I can get into that in the future,” she says. Does she think her mother ever said sexually suggestive comments to the other kids? “I don't really think I should answer that yet,” Rockelle says firmly, without elaborating. “I think I should wait until I'm old enough to speak about it.” 

	











	ROCKELLE IS LOOKING FORWARD to her 18th birthday, which is just a few months away. Maybe then, she thinks, people will take her more seriously. “They won't think that I'm just a puppet. And once I'm 18, people won't go and hurt my mom necessarily. If they want to sue me, they'll sue me, not my company or whatever.” Having been a viral social media star since she was nine, establishing herself as a young adult has been a challenge for Rockelle, who has been criticized for the way she presents herself these days on social media. “People definitely have not let me grow up. But I guess what I have to say is, if you're looking at it in a sexual way, why are you looking at it in a sexual way?” she asks.


	In addition to maintaining a presence on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, Rockelle posts on BrandArmy, a subscriber-based platform similar to OnlyFans. Though BrandArmy doesn't allow nudity, some of the looks featured there are not exactly safe for work. Rockelle's bio on the site reads, “I'm so excited to share more of me with you.” There are three subscription tiers, including one for $100 a month, which allows users to “request custom looks.” 


	“[Being on BrandArmy is] one of my favorite things to do and I apologize if people don't agree with it,” she says. “It's the same photos I post on Instagram, and I just get paid for it a little bit.” But does she worry about who her subscribers may be? “I mean, I don't worry about it because you're well aware of what happens on the internet. So I just let it be. There's a lot of good people out there. There's probably a lot of bad people out there, but you can't control who follows you and who doesn't. Because if they're supporting you, then let them support you.” But Rockelle has seemed to lean into this image, visiting BopHouse — a Miami content house made up of prominent OnlyFans creators — at the invitation of house co-founder Sophie Rain just weeks before the documentary dropped. “Why would I not take that opportunity, just because she does something that she's of age doing, and I won't be part of? I had the best time of my life,” she says. “I just did TikToks with them. It was great.”


	Rockelle spends her days making content and taking care of her many animals. (She declines to say how many cats she has, but when I walk into the house, I see multiple cages placed next to each other.) She's not the most social person, she says, and she doesn't have many friends. The closest relationship she has is with her mother. “She somehow always has a way of making me feel better and making me feel like everything's going to be OK,” she says. She recently started dating content creator Capri Jones, which, she explains, actually started out as a “social media relationship. It was for business. We were just working.” The teenagers arranged to meet in person and film content together — a collaboration of sorts, not unlike the Squad; during the filming of that content, they realized they actually liked each other. But while she now calls him her boyfriend, business isn't far from her mind. “We're so smart and we think about everything,” she says. “We can go so many ways with this relationship. On social media and in real life.” 

	











	She loves animals and cooking and tanning, and posting content that she knows will make people mad. “Like rage bait,” she says. “I love doing stuff that people are going to be like, ‘Oh, my God. Why did you do that? You're so annoying.'” For April Fool's Day, she and Jones posted that Rockelle had cheated, and the two had broken up. Rockelle lost 100,000 TikTok followers, but to her, the attention was worth it. “You have to think about social media,” she says. “It's a job. You have to take risks. And that was a risk that I was willing to take … to popularize our Twitch.” She shrugs. “It did really, really well for both of us.”

	As the afternoon stretches into early evening, Rockelle grabs her phone from where it's charging on a bedside table. She scrolls through her camera roll until she gets to a video of hundreds of fans clamoring for her from a few days before, when she was visiting Six Flags. “Look at all these [people],” she says. “We had to leave.” The footage from the video looks wildly overwhelming, but as Rockelle watches it, she smiles. “I love getting recognized,” she says. “Being known is one of my favorite things ever.”


	None of this — the Netflix exposé painting her childhood as hellish and her adolescence as haunted by the specter of a controlling, manipulative mother; the rabid backlash to it and endless coverage of it — is pushing Rockelle off social media. Online, she posts her usual content, smirking into the camera despite the hundreds of comments on each post referencing the documentary. “I can't make it look like it's affecting me,” she says. “I won't. Social media is about entertaining people, and I want to entertain them and make them happy.” One day, Rockelle hopes, the allegations against her mother will only be a footnote in her long, illustrious career. “I've gotten this far,” she says with a flick of her hair. “I'll be fine. I'm getting the hard stuff out of the way. By the time I'm 30, I'll be zen. I'll be good.”

Ever since it came into the public eye in 1989, Area 51 has been a source of conspiracy, with many questioning its purpose and whether the US government is hiding something from the public behind its heavily guarded barbed wire fence. The site's existence was officially acknowledged by the CIA only in 2013.

Now, the 400-page report by the CIA has resurfaced and is catching the attention of many for the first time as it's being shared on the popular social media site X. The report highlights many of the base's activities pre-1974, outlining how secret U-2 spy plane testing was the explanation for many potential UFO sightings. The report stated: ""High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect - a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).



  Don't miss...    Mystery as unidentified flying object lights up sky over Kyiv  

""Once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports.

""At times, when a U-2 pilot made a turn, the sunlight reflecting off the U-2's silver wings would cause a series of glints or flashes. This caused airliner pilots to report seeing a bright object high above them.""

The base was constructed in July 1955, and contained just a runway, housing, water wells and a small amount of hangar and shop space.

The following month, the CIA began there project AQUATONE, a programme to develop the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft.

The aircraft was designed to survey the Soviet Union from a great distance, and to aid in building intelligence during the Cold War.

Following these test flights, the base began the OXCART programme in 1960, which developed the A-12 reconnaissance plane.

This new aircraft was able to undertake missions where speed and stealth were pivotal, with it being used for five years to fly over areas deemed politically sensitive.

""In early 1962, CIA officials became concerned about the possibility that the Soviet Union might learn about the OXCART program through overhead reconnaissance,"" the document went on to say.

To test this, they had Area 51 itself ""photographed by a U-2 and later by a CORONA reconnaissance satellite"".

However, astronauts on America's first space station also photographed the site.

The Skylab astronauts inadvertently photographed the Groom Lake test site despite specific instructions not to do so.

The report itself was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request made in 2005, yet many have been critical of it.

""The notion that the U-2 explains most sightings at that time is utter rot and baloney,"" self-proclaimed Ufologist Stanton Friedman said in 2013.

""Can the U-2 sit still in the sky? Make right-angle turns in the middle of the sky? Take off from nothing?""

   11:54 EDT 01 May 2025, updated  13:21 EDT 01 May 2025    By CHRIS MELORE, ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM and ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

A bipartisan congressional briefing is underway, hearing from scientists who say they need a larger role in the investigation into UFOs and other strange phenomena the government has been keeping secret.

The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, with help from the UAP Disclosure Fund, is holding a briefing Thursday called 'Understanding UAP: Science, National Security & Innovation.'

It's focused on UFOs (or UAPs, as they're now called) and what the government knows about these unusual sightings.

Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official who investigated UAPs before becoming a UFO whistleblower, and Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, are the main speakers.

They're pushing for the government to release more UAP data and for the development of better ways of detecting these unidentified objects.

The hearing is being led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, the Republican congresswoman from Florida charged by President Trump with overseeing the disclosure of several classified events, including UFO sightings.

Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral at Thursday's UFO hearing, says a secret military document was removed from his computer without his permission.

Admiral Gallaudet said the classifed memo described the urgent need to address near-misses Navy pilots were having with UFOs.

Gallaudet, who was in charge of safety and flight while serving as the chief meteorologist in the Navy, said the email had an infamous UFO video attached to it.

The email, which sought urgent information about the origin of the UFO threatening Navy planes, was mysteriously wiped from his computer a day after the admiral received it.

'It didn't sit well with me,' Gallaudet said. 

He added that it's the reason he's gone public with what he knows and why he's calling on the White House to disclose what the government knows about UFOs.

Research physicist Dr Eric Davis said during Thursday's hearing that the US government has been operating a secret program that recovers crashed UFOs since the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s.

Dr Davis worked as a subcontractor and then a consultant for the Pentagon UFO program since 2007. 

According to him, the secret program originated after the discovery of a crashed UFO in 1944.

Since then, Davis claimed much of the technology recovered from these wrecks over the years has been secretly moved to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

All of this activity, Davis said, was being done without congressional oversight or approval, with project code names regularly changing every few years to cover up the Defense Department's actions.

He previously said that examination of some materials recovered by the program failed to determine their source and led him to conclude, 'we couldn't make it ourselves.' 



A retired US Navy admiral slammed an alleged 'disinformation' campaign by the US intelligence community which he claimed was covering up military sightings of UFOs.

Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral, spoke at Thursday's hearing, claiming that the Navy 'has a trove' of data on UFO sightings from pilots and other personnel who have spotted UAPs while on duty - much of which has not been officially released.

Admiral Gallaudet publicly called on the White House to reveal this information and noted that he had just received reports from members of the Navy who had been involved in recent UFO sightings.

He also compared the urgency needed on this topic to the current climate change emergency researchers are well funded to study in depth.





During the hearing, Loeb referenced fragments of metal that he and his colleagues recovered from the Pacific Ocean in 2023.

The remnants came from a meteor-like object that originated from 'interstellar space' and crashed off the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2014. Loeb has not ruled out the possibility that this object could have been an alien craft, or part of one.

'This is a historic discovery because it represents the first time that humans put their hand on materials from a large object that arrived to Earth from outside the solar system, he said at the time. 

Loeb is working to raise funds for another expedition to the location where these fragments were recovered to look for more physical evidence of alien technology.



Avi Loeb told Thursday's congressional hearing that 'there are objects in the sky that we don't understand' while explaining the need for increased funding for UFO detection.

Loeb said that at least one billion dollars needs to be committed to improving America's efforts to track and monitor the movements of UFOs and UAPs.

The Harvard astrophysicist added that he was upset with the lack of data available currently in terms of tracking objects flying over our skies.

Loeb went to discuss the possibility of alien civilizations that could have developed long before humans developed into a modern society.





Days before Thursday' hearing, the whistleblower behind a stunning report submitted to Congress - exposing what he claims is a secret Pentagon program tracking unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) - revealed his identity and says he fears for his future after speaking out.

Matthew Brown, a former US national security official, publicly identified himself as the whistleblower on an episode of WEAPONIZED - a podcast released Tuesday that is hosted by investigative journalists and UFO experts Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp.

Brown is the author of the Immaculate Constellation Field Report, a document entered into the Congressional Record earlier this year that alleges the Executive Branch has been secretly managing UAP programs for decades - without congressional oversight.

One of today's main speakers is Avi Loeb, an Israeli-American astrophysicist at Harvard University.

For years, Loeb has been a prominent advocate for more scientific investigation UAP sightings, hypothesizing that extraterrestrials have already visited Earth, and that we may have recovered physical evidence of their technologies.

During the hearing, he plans to give a presentation advocating for more funding for UAP research and urging the US government to share 'any data or materials concerning what lies outside the solar system.' 



Months before Thursday's briefing, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official turned UFO whistleblower told Congress that there was proof of alien life being kept from the public.

During his testimony back on November 14, 2024, he blasted the US intelligence community for 'excessive secrecy' of UAP reports that had lasted decades, adding that it was 'all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.'

Elizondo resigned from his position, running the Pentagon's program to investigate UFO sightings to 10 years, and went public with what he knew in October 2017.

By Janay Boyd | Reporter

Even though spring is in full swing, spooky things still linger in the air. Every Saturday, the Dr Pepper Museum hosts its weekly Paranormal Experience — a two-hour tour that reveals a side of the museum far beyond just the drink.

On the tour, museum staff will guide groups of up to 16 people through the historic building, including the usually off-limits basement. Visitors will hear about the museum's history and explore its paranormal side using investigative tools like EMF detectors, dowsing rods and, occasionally, shadow or spirit boxes.

According to the Dr Pepper Museum, paranormal investigators and staff have experienced everything from shadow figures to disembodied voices and full apparitions.

“We've had a lot of history, specifically with the museum, but there have been stories that have been passed down from family members who used to have individuals that worked here,” said Kayla Tatum, the museum's experience manager. “There were stories passed down from staff who have also had certain experiences themselves here at the museum.”

According to Tatum, the museum is now certified as a haunted location. They had a paranormal investigator visit to uncover the history of who occupied the building during different eras and to gather more personal stories, she said. 

Now, the Paranormal Experience tours have been running for over two years.

“It's more so getting to know the museum's history, but also going a little bit into that investigation of what are some of the paranormal things that have happened over the years,” Tatum said. “So you get a little bit of both, but I certainly like to highlight for people that the intent behind it is not to go hunt ghosts, but there is that paranormal aspect that can come about from the tours.”

Abilene resident Drake Warner, who attended a nighttime ghost tour, said most tours tend to blend historical storytelling with reports of unusual activity.

“Most tours, I feel, lean heavily on the history of the location along with tidbits of experiences in certain places or rooms,” Warner said. “I figure those parts of the location are the most visited to try and have a paranormal experience.”

Authenticity often depends on the atmosphere and the history tied to the location, Warner said.

“Ghost tours are always going to be a hit or miss thing since it's never a guarantee, and there's always a lot of skepticism involved with ghosts in general,” Warner said.

Even so, the museum reserves its main Paranormal Experience for adults 18 and older, with a junior paranormal event offered in the fall for younger visitors.

“We get a hodgepodge, from those that have visited the museum and are just wanting to look at that experience under a lens at night, to those that are truly looking for the paranormal experience and wanting to figure out what the stories are behind what people have seen,” Tatum said.

During one of Tatum's own experiences, a spirit box was activated, and when a call went out to a spirit, the group's EMF readers all lit up in a row, as if something had passed through.

“It's definitely interesting,” Tatum said. “Even if you don't necessarily fully believe or if you're kind of half-and-half or full on, I still think that you can get something from the experience.”

The tours start at 8:00 p.m. and end at 10:00 p.m. Tickets are $35 per person and can be purchased here.

But a microbial source of the signal from planet K2-18b would have interesting implications for evolution



Source: © NASA/ESA/Hubble, M. Kornmesser/STScI/Science Photo Library

Recent reports claim that dimethyl sulfide detected on planet K2-18b indicates the presence of alilen life  

Belief in alien life, having been forever devoid of any empirical basis pro or con, has been free to enjoy cycles of fashion. When both traditional astronomy and Christian theology placed the Earth at the centre of the cosmos, few imagined the stars and planets as anything other than the unchanging celestial backdrop to life in this vale of tears. But ‘A Man that is of Copernicus's Opinion', in the evaluation of Christiaan Huygens in the late 17th century, ‘cannot but sometimes have a fancy that it's not improbable that the rest of the Planets have… their Inhabitants too'. 

Huygens' casual acceptance of extraterrestrial life remained the norm at least until HG Wells warned of its hazards, and even in 1952 the Astronomer Royal Harold Spencer Jones was happy to tell us that ‘it is almost certain that there is some form of vegetation on Mars.'

When the Viking lander missions of the 1970s revealed a sterile Martian landscape, scientific opinion reverted to the notion that we are a lone oasis of life in the solar system and possibly in the wider cosmos. Some still consider the origin of life on Earth to have been an extremely rare and improbable event on potentially habitable worlds. But probably a more common view, now that we know how abundant extrasolar and even somewhat Earthlike planets are, is that life of some kind might be fairly widespread in the universe, but that intelligent life – the sort that we purport to be – could be very rare. 

One argument for that view came from cosmologist Brandon Carter, who in 1983 pointed out a peculiar coincidence whereby the timescale for humans to evolve – around 4.6 billion years – is of the same order of magnitude as the span over which our planet will be habitable at all: in around 5 billion years' time the Earth will be fried by the ageing, swollen Sun before it wanes into a white dwarf.1 Carter inferred that it would normally take much longer for intelligent life to appear on a planet like ours, and that we are the result of one or two rare and improbable events required for such evolution: ‘hard steps' that usually preclude advanced, intelligent life but which will happen here and there throughout the cosmos. In this view, we're either alone or nearly so. 

Carter's hard-steps model has recently been challenged by a team who argue that the late arrival of humans need not imply our improbability, but might rather reflect the fact that the environmental conditions needed for big, complex life forms like us – not least, an oxygen-rich atmosphere to support our energy-hungry cells – can't evolve quickly from the inhospitable setting of the Hadean (Earth's oldest geologic eon).2 

All this context adds intrigue to the recent claim by a team of astronomers at the University of Cambridge, UK, to have detected a potential ‘biosignature' – a compound that, on Earth, has only a biogenic natural source – on an extrasolar planet called K2-18b, 2.6 times the diameter of Earth and orbiting a red-dwarf star 124 light years away.3 They report the spectral signature of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in K2-18b's atmosphere, based on measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The team made the same claim more tentatively two years ago from data collected by a different JWST instrument.4 

The most credulous (or most sensationalist) media sources reported this claim as a likely (‘99.7% certainty') detection of alien life. Many experts were more sceptical. For one thing, the DMS detection itself may not be as convincing as the authors claim. They said there is only a 0.3% chance of the signal being mere noise, but others have questioned that number. 

On Earth, DMS in the atmosphere is produced by marine plankton, and the Cambridge team says the compound has been considered a ‘robust biosignature' for planets like K2-18b, which is thought to have an ocean beneath an atmosphere rich in hydrogen. But an abiotic source of DMS has been reported from photochemical reactions involving hydrogen sulfide and methane.5 Some planetary scientists argue that it seems unlikely any putative biosignature gas in a planetary atmosphere can be considered compelling evidence for life, given how little we know about the geological conditions of any extrasolar planet. 

All the same, it's interesting to contemplate what a world with DMS-generating microbes might imply. On Earth, these are relatively recent: the metabolic pathway leading to DMS is thought to have appeared only around 250 million years ago.6 So it's a fairly sophisticated bit of biochemistry. Such life might then be supposed already to have completed some of Carter's hard steps – in which case they wouldn't look so hard after all.

Introducing the all-new Astronomy.com Forum! Become a part of our Community!  >> Visit Now

There are tens of billions of Sun-like stars in the Milky Way, an immense tally that encourages the possibility that extraterrestrial life peppers the universe. Finding evidence for aliens — even microscopic ones — would confirm the widespread belief that life is not an unlikely event, constrained to a small number of planets and moons. It could be commonplace, a ubiquitous cosmic infection.

This idea is not new. Since the time of the classical Greeks, many scholars have assumed that life was everywhere, even though they lacked the technical means to find it. By the 19th century, European novelists were writing stories about sophisticated inhabitants of our Moon, and a century later both scientists and the public were convinced that Mars was teeming with clever beings who had built massive irrigation structures visible from earthly telescopes.

Even though the idea of lunar life is now considered foolish and the belief in canals on Mars has evaporated, the hope for discovering life beyond Earth has intensified. Much of this contemporary interest is powered by our successful discovery of more than nearly 6,000 planets around other stars, and that is surely just a small sample of what's out there. With all that opportunity for life, the idea of hunting for aliens by looking for their infrastructure — artifacts, in SETI parlance — whether irrigation or power systems, surely deserves another look.

Exoplanets, it turns out, are as common as garden ants. However, it might not be necessary to search even that far afield to find some cosmic company. In our solar system, astronomers recognize at least seven worlds that could have reservoirs of liquid water — places where alien microbes could exist. And in a shift of thinking that would have surprised those Victorian-era scientists so focused on arid Mars, we now consider some of the moons of the outer solar system to be our best bets for finding life within rocket range. To 19th-century astronomers, these moons appeared only as luminous dots. But we now know these modest points of light are swathed in water and ice, and may be where we'll first find life beyond our own planet.

Our searches also are less direct now than they were when the Victorians turned their telescopes on the Red Planet. Instead, we try to find secondary clues to the presence of biology, such as using spectroscopy to search for atmospheric gases that are the byproduct of metabolism. This approach can work for moons and planets both near and far, for teeming ecosystems or scant microbiology.

There's little doubt that finding any extraterrestrial life would be a stunning achievement. But the most interesting discovery would be to find intelligent life, which is to say organisms that can rival humans in their cognitive abilities, beings that are like the aliens in our movies and TV shows. Detecting thinking organisms would surely be one of the biggest news stories of all time, if not the biggest.how's it going?

In the absence of direct contact, of course, we are limited to looking for other clues. By the time of World War II, most scientists had discounted the century-long claims of engineering projects — specifically, canals — built by thinking beings on Mars, ascribing them to optical illusions. As the Space Age got underway, flybys of the Red Planet not only failed to find such features, but revealed a desolate and seemingly sterile world.Astronomers, undaunted, swung their instruments to more distant targets. In 1960, Frank Drake made the first modern attempt to pick up deliberate radio signals from extrasolar societies. He sequentially pointed an 85-foot-diameter (26 meters) radio telescope in West Virginia toward two nearby star systems in an endeavor known as SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. He whimsically dubbed his two-week effort Project Ozma in a nod to Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz book series.

Drake didn't detect any extraterrestrial transmissions. Nonetheless, more than six decades later, radio searches remain the go-to method for trying to prove that someone is out there. Contemporary experiments are similar to Drake's and continue to use the highly sensitive equipment of radio astronomy to search for the kind of narrowband signal that only an artificial transmitter could make.

We've still not found aliens, even though a majority of the scientific community, as well as the general public, believe they exist. Mind you, radio waves from the cosmos are commonplace, sustaining a substantial cohort of radio astronomers who study these emissions to learn about the universe. But while we've cataloged several thousand pulsars (spinning neutron stars) and more than a million quasars (feeding supermassive black holes), no signal picked up by our radio telescopes has yet had the characteristics of a deliberate broadcast.

Radio is only one technology communicating aliens might use, however. There are others: for example, flashing signals into space with lasers. Lasers can send many more bits of information per second than a radio transmitter, and consequently some advanced aliens might be using them for interstellar communication. To that end, the LaserSETI network, currently operated from roughly a dozen observatories worldwide, is designed to continually search the entire night sky for flashes of optical laser light originating beyond our solar system.

Signals are not the only kind of evidence for aliens we might find. In particular, we could look for massive artifacts, constructions large enough — or bright enough — to be detectable by our telescopes.

This is hardly a new idea; it goes back at least a half-millennium, when polymath and bishop Nicholas of Cusa suggested that all heavenly bodies were populated by plants and animals. During the Victorian era, several reputable astronomers claimed to have seen signs of intelligent beings in our own solar system. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli and American astronomer Percival Lowell both claimed to espy straight-line markings on Mars. Lowell explained these as irrigation ditches constructed to support martian agriculture. The astronomers weren't seeing the martians themselves, of course — just their civil engineering efforts. The so-called martian canals eventually became a trope, if not a fact.

In 1960, physicist Freeman Dyson suggested another approach. He noted that technically sophisticated aliens might surround their home stars with a constellation of satellites outfitted with solar panels. This phalanx of orbiting light collectors, now termed a Dyson sphere, could capture a large fraction of the star's radiative output. This energy would then be beamed back to the aliens' home planet, powering their high-tech lifestyles with a scheme that offered an endless supply of energy and had no environmental impact. Crucially, scientists understand that these satellites would inevitably become warm, and consequently radiate a weak infrared glow that would make them visible to our telescopes.

The idea of Dyson spheres marking the location of sophisticated societies was not only ingenious, but also made a prediction that could be experimentally verified. The prediction in this case was that the satellites would produce infrared radiation. This meant that astronomers could find a Dyson sphere by noting any unexpected infrared emission from a star system.

For several decades, researchers have tried to do exactly that. Most recently, astronomers at Sweden's Uppsala Observatory surveyed 5 million stars, looking for the telltale glow of a Dyson sphere. They report finding 60 candidates that have more-than-expected infrared radiation, and are following up with additional observations.

Searching for artifacts offers a straightforward advantage over the way SETI has historically been pursued. The traditional approach pioneered by Drake assumes that our telescopes are pointed in the aliens' direction at the same time their signal arrives at Earth.

This synchronicity requirement clearly reduces the chances of successfully eavesdropping on ET. By how much? Alas, we can't say without knowing how many societies are out there. We also need to have an idea of their typical lifetimes — how long do they signal for before they either die or are snuffed out? We don't know either of these things.

But if we hunt for artifacts instead of signals, we can largely avoid such uncertainties. Artifacts can be found at any time subsequent to their construction. The Egyptian pyramids and the American interstate highway system are testaments to human existence that could plausibly outlive humans themselves. Even after we are long gone, these engineering projects will tell anyone who finds them that we were once here. And, as a further advantage, a hunt for artifacts doesn't depend on guessing the aliens' choice of frequency or transmitter power.

What sort of artifacts might we expect? While Dyson spheres are certainly one possibility, we can't confidently describe how an alien construction would appear any more than the first humans could accurately anticipate the appearance of a 21st-century cityscape. A fundamental challenge to any artifact hunt is that we can't be sure what we're looking for.

But it's not necessarily an insurmountable problem. We might still find these artifacts simply because they would be novel, and not already members of the known cosmic bestiary. For example, consider the aforementioned quasars. No one predicted the existence of these objects, let alone what they would look like. Indeed, both quasars and pulsars were initially suspected of being alien handiwork. We now have natural explanations for both, but they were discovered because they were different from other objects we knew about at the time.

Despite the fact that we can't say much about the appearance of alien artifacts, there's little doubt that any we find will be subject to selection effects. The easily detectable ones will surely be the biggest and brightest. This is akin to searching for dogs by listening for barks. You won't find all the dogs, and not necessarily the most interesting ones. Just the ones that make a lot of noise.

Similarly, the hunt for alien engineering efforts — if it turns up anything — will only show us the societies that build things easily visible from light-years away. Such constructions may not be typical, nor even of recent vintage. But no matter how singular such artifacts might be, their discovery would answer a long-standing question: Is anyone out there?

For nearly two centuries, we've searched for clever company in our cosmic neighborhood. Once, that search meant examining our solar system for artifacts, until we later switched strategies, hoping to pick up radio signals or other transmissions as the indication of another technological civilization. The latter is an approach that we've followed for a long time now.

Maybe we should revive the strategy of looking for artifacts. Space is vast, and it's conceivable that we'll never meet the aliens themselves. But we might uncover some of their public works.

Elway Explore the Psychic Toll of Warfare in Video for New Single “Laugh Track”

The Fort Collins punks share the first track from their seventh album Nobody's Going to Heaven just in time for May Day.

With 232 pages and an expanded 12″ by 12″ format, our biggest print issue yet celebrates the people, places, music, and art of our hometown, including cover features on David Lynch, Nipsey Hussle, Syd, and Phoebe Bridgers' Saddest Factory Records, plus Brian Wilson, Cuco, Ty Segall, Lord Huron, Remi Wolf, The Doors, the art of RISK, Taz, Estevan Oriol, Kii Arens, and Edward Colver, and so much more. 

Channeling Ziggy Stardust's glam transcendence, Will Toledo resurrects the album as a grandiose narrative vehicle while marking his valiant stride into the rock canon. 

The Erasure frontman works out something open and anthemic on his latest solo album, with producer Dave Audé adding subtler shades to his post-house pop mix.

The Swedish post-punks' fourth album combines half-assed humor with half-assed performances, filling in the void left by guitar-centric punk with demented synth tinkering.

On March 19, 2003, the USA—with the UK very much in tow—invaded Iraq. It's that day and singular event which is the setting of this new song by Elway. Over the course of just over three minutes, the Fort Collins, Colorado punks combine the very personal with the very political, navigating the memory of that day and declaration with the knowledge of what's followed in the 20-plus years since. Set to a video montage of presidents and political figures both pre- and post-Bush, both Democrat and Republican, as well as news footage of significant worldwide events, “Laugh Track”—the first single to be taken from Elway's forthcoming seventh album—explores the long-lasting ramifications of that day's events, as well as American imperialism in general. 

As political as it is, it's also a beautiful song—melodic, sincere, and poignant in equal measure—that finds itself at odds with the world in which it exists. Of course, as the song and its video both highlight, that world is the natural consequence and legacy of a country that's been engaged in war for 231 of its 248 years of existence. “The psychic toll of war is congenital,” explains frontman Tim Browne. “It is passed like a mutation through the generations in America. This song is about how I came to learn how endemic war is in our culture and it proposes, if not insists, for this utter madness to end with us.”

It's no coincidence that this digitally released single—backed with an acoustic version of fan favorite “Better Whenever,” because Red Scare label owner Tobias Jeg doesn't like the idea of releasing lone tracks—is premiering here on May Day, given the label's (tongue-in-cheek) name and political leanings. “‘Laugh Track' is the first single from Elway's upcoming Nobody's Going to Heaven LP,” says Jeg, “and even though these soy boys are really frustrated with the current timeline, the new songs are secretly triumphant and affirmative.” 

A perfect reminder of that most important and (sadly still relevant) political adage: No war but class war. Happy May Day! Watch the video exclusively below before the song is officially released on May 2 (pre-save here). The band will also be on tour later this month and will also be performing at this year's The Fest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","New Oklahoma curriculum includes pro-Trump conspiracy theories","https://popular.info/p/new-oklahoma-curriculum-includes","Thu, 01 May 2025 10:02:44 GMT","

Beginning in the 2025-26 school year, thousands of high school students in Oklahoma will be required to learn about President Trump's debunked claims that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. The lesson will not be part of a course on conspiracy theories, but an official component of the new social studies curriculum created by Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters (R).

The new curriculum includes a section that requires students to ""analyze contemporary turning points of 21st-century American society."" That requirement includes the following:

Identify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of “bellwether county” trends.

In March, Walters said the purpose of this section was to teach ""students to think for themselves"" and ""not be spoon-fed left-wing propaganda."" According to Walters, there are ""legitimate concerns"" about the integrity of the 2020 election that were ""raised by millions of Americans in 2020.""

Walters is wrong. There are no ""discrepancies"" in the 2020 election results that validate the claims of Trump and his allies that the results were fraudulent. The new curriculum is simply an amalgamation of unsupported claims.

There was no ""sudden halting"" of ballot counting in key states. The counting took an extended period in some states because election officials were legally prohibited from counting early ballots in advance. Mail-in balloting is safe and secure. Large increases in vote totals (""batch dumps"") happen in every election, impact both parties, and are not a sign of fraud. Record turnout in 2020 was not ""unforeseen"" — it was due to increased engagement related to the pandemic and other factors. And traditional ""bellwether"" counties are now more conservative than the nation as a whole.

The new curriculum will cost Oklahoma taxpayers at least $33 million.

Oklahoma's legislature had an opportunity to block the new curriculum. The chairman of the Oklahoma Senate Education Committee, Adam Pugh (R), filed a resolution that would have sent the curriculum back to the Oklahoma State Board of Education for further review. But ultimately, the resolution did not receive a vote.

Moms for Liberty, a far-right activist organization, sent a letter to Republican members of the legislature, praising the new curriculum as ""truth-filled, anti-woke, and unapologetically conservative."" They also delivered a warning: ""In the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable. If you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.""

Walters' new social studies standards were approved by the Oklahoma State Board of Education in February. But many members have since said that Walters used deceptive tactics in order to pass new last-minute changes.

Walters did not send the new standards with his additions to the members of the board until 4 p.m. the day before the board's 9:30 a.m. meeting. This did not give members enough time to read the new standards, which are around 400 pages long. Some of the members said later that they did not even realize that the new standards were different from the earlier version that they had previously reviewed.

The email sent the day before the meeting “subtly indicate[d]” that updates had been made, but did “not provide any specifics,” 2 News Oklahoma reported. In the meeting, Walters did not mention the specific changes. In an April 24 meeting, one of the board members, Chris VanDenhende, asked Walters to provide documents that noted the changes made, but Walters called the request “irrelevant.”

At the February meeting, Ryan Deatherage, a board member, asked to delay the vote so they had time to read the full standards, but Walters “pressure[d] the board to vote that day, indicating a legislative time crunch,” according to 2 News, which attended the meeting. In reality, they had until April to approve the standards. After the February meeting, multiple members of the board stated that they wanted another chance to review the standards, calling Walters' tactics a “breach of trust,” the Oklahoman reported.

Walters claimed that the last-minute additions to the standards were based on public input. But there is no evidence of this. During a press conference, “a reporter who reviewed an open records request said there were no public comments that suggested adding a standard about election discrepancies,” KGOU reported. Walters responded by arguing that there were “focus groups” and “a lot of discussions that were going on.” But Walters also acknowledged that he was the one who decided to change the content. “Ultimately, it was up to me to make the final decisions of what are we going to put in,” he stated.

Walters also included right-wing activists on the committee that reviewed the social studies standards. The committee would normally involve educators and other experts, but Walters' committee included Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation; Dennis Prager, the co-founder of PragerU; and right-wing media personalities Steve Deace and David Barton. Only three out of the 10 people on the committee have lived in Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma Voice.

The Oklahoma Council for Social Studies (OCSS) opposes Walters' new standards: “OCSS cannot fully support the standards in their current form. Many of the late additions include historically inaccurate content and do not align with the inclusive, evidence-based approach that is essential to high-quality social studies instruction.” The statement also argued that “the manner in which these changes were introduced raises serious concerns, casting doubt on the transparency and integrity of the standards development process.”

Among the curriculum changes that will soon go into effect is the removal of part of a unit in which students will learn about former President Joe Biden's administration. The original lesson plan taught students about the “challenges and accomplishments” of Biden's term, but the new version focuses on challenges and leaves out accomplishments.

The original version said that students should be able to describe economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic and bipartisan infrastructure legislation. The new version only asks students to describe “the United States-Mexico border crisis” and “America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, responses to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Gaza-Israel conflict.”

While Biden's accomplishments are de-emphasized in the new curriculum, the amount of time Oklahoma students spend learning about Christianity and the Bible will be increased. In December, Walters proudly announced that his new curriculum will increase the number of mentions of the Bible from two to nearly 50 for students starting in first grade. The Bible lessons primarily focus on the influence of Christian values on the Constitution and the Founding Fathers.

Students as young as six years old will learn the stories of the Ten Commandments and David and Goliath. By the end of middle school, students will have gone through several lessons on how the Bible's principles served as inspiration for the American independence movement. In high school, they will be able to take an entire course about early Christians and the history of Christianity.

Despite the new emphasis on the relationship between the Bible and America's founding, the curriculum does not reference the separation of church and state. Walters and many of the Christian nationalist figures who helped him craft the curriculum have said that the separation of church and state is unconstitutional or a myth.

Walters: ""We want students to think for themselves and not be spoon-fed left-wing propaganda. Which is why I'm personally hijacking the curriculum and spoon-feeding them right-wing propaganda.""

Does anyone wonder why Oklahoma is one of the least educated states?  Just could be because of inbred mouth breathers like this guy. Just maybe.

QAnon is one of those conspiracies. Here's the short version: A cabal of liberal elites and movie stars is trafficking children, and Donald Trump is fighting to save them. In a new book, the journalist Jesselyn Cook tells the stories of five American families caught in the QAnon web. There's a QAnon-obsessed mother who disowns her once beloved son; a couple whose decades-long relationship is sorely tested; sisters, one of whom becomes an activist, the other a conspiracy theorist; and more. And this goes beyond QAnon; what Cook cares about is why people believe the unbelievable and the way conspiracy theories assault the nation on a most personal of levels — the family.

            Health officials in India are investigating reports that hundreds of children were served food that had contained a dead snake at a school last week.
    


            More 100 children who consumed the contaminated lunch meals fell ill in the town of Mokama, CNN affiliate CNN News 18 reported. At least two dozen students were hospitalized on April 24.
    


            A school cook dished out the meals after they had removed the snake remains, according to the country's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), citing local media.
    


            “Reportedly, the cook served the food to the children after removing a dead snake from it,” the commission said in a statement.
    


            Some of the children showed symptoms of dizziness and vomiting, the commission said. The health scare sparked furor among villagers, who blocked a local highway in protest.
    


            The NHRC issued a two-week deadline to police in Bihar for a report on the incident, calling for an urgent update on the health status of the children.
    


            The reports “if true, raise a serious issue of violation of the human rights of the students,” the commission added.
    


            India runs the world's largest free school meal scheme, as a way of providing better nutrition and keeping children in education.
    


            In 2013, pesticides in such meals killed at least 23 students, prompting the government to improve safety standards.

Experts are alarmed as department says it will alter vaccine testing methods and build new ‘surveillance systems'

Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and his department have made a series of misleading statements that alarmed vaccine experts and advocates in recent days – including that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”.

Health department officials released statements saying they could alter vaccine testing and build new “surveillance systems” on Wednesday, both of which have unnerved experts who view new placebo testing as potentially unethical.

“It's his goal to even further lessen trust in vaccines and make it onerous enough for manufacturers that they will abandon it,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, about the statements and Kennedy. “It's a fragile market.”

In this same week, Kennedy exhorted parents to “do their own research” in a talkshow interview – the phrase has become pop culture shorthand for a shallow internet search that casts people into the arms of the disinformation ecosystem.

“All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”.

The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems.

Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation's most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for prolific misinformation. He also earned money by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers.

Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post.

Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.

Vaccines against new pathogens, such as Covid-19, are placebo tested. However, experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines, for instance measles, to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.

“No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he's asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit.

Although Kennedy has made false and misleading statements about vaccines generally, the Covid-19 vaccine appears to be especially in the administration's crosshairs.

In response to recent questions about Covid-19 strategy from the Guardian, the administration responded: “The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”

Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be flagged to Kennedy's office. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an $11bn clawback in grants from states.

Most controversially, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed expected approval of a new Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, reportedly on the review of a political appointee known to be skeptical of vaccines.

Over the weekend, FDA commissioner Marty Makary addressed the delay by describing annual updates to the vaccine's strains as a “new” product, creating confusion about whether vaccine makers have to conduct new safety and efficacy trials. Such trials would not be a normal part of routine updates.

On Monday, the company released a statement that said in part the FDA had demanded a clinical trial as part of post-approval surveillance, and that it would continue to work with the FDA.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has announced sanctions against his former top adviser. Alexey Arestovich has frequently criticized both Ukraine's leadership and its military strategy in its conflict with Russia.

Arestovich was among several Ukrainians mentioned in a decree released by Zelensky's office on Thursday. Penalties imposed include asset freezes, restricted trade and financial transactions, travel, and the revocation of state awards.

Arestovich served as an adviser to the Office of the President of Ukraine between 2020 and January 2023. He resigned in controversy after claiming that a Russian missile hit a residential building in the city of Dnepr only because it had been downed by Ukrainian air defenses. Following public outrage and accusations that he had discredited the Ukrainian army, Arestovich backtracked, apologized, and submitted his resignation.

He has since become a prominent commentator on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, often presenting views that diverge from the official Ukrainian narrative. Last month, he suggested that Kiev should agree to cede land to Russia as part of a potential US-brokered peace deal, warning that any attempts to reclaim lost territories would only backfire.

“Why should we give up four regions? So that in six months or a year we don't lose another six or eight,” he said, referring to four former Ukrainian territories that in 2022 voted in public referendums to join Russia.

Kiev has consistently refused to acknowledge any territorial losses, however..

Arestovich has also accused the Ukrainian leadership of corruption. He has claimed that Zelensky is personally involved in numerous graft schemes and that Kiev's Western backers are well aware of his activities.

He has also signaled that he wants to run for president of Ukraine. Zelensky, whose term expired last year, has refused to call new elections, citing martial law, which has been extended more than a dozen times.

Addressing the sanctions, the ex-adviser predicted that the Ukrainian authorities would now try to limit his media reach by cutting off access to his YouTube channel from the country's territory.

Fast-food company reports 3.6% fall in sales and carmaker says tariffs could cost it as much as $5bn in 2025

McDonald's and General Motors have warned that uncertainty around Donald Trump's tariff policy is hurting business, hitting sales and knocking profits.

The fast-food chain reported a 3.6% fall in sales in its US home market during the first quarter, driven mainly by lower customer numbers as consumers reined in their spending in the face of an unpredictable economic outlook.

It was the largest quarterly fall in sales since the Covid lockdowns of 2020, and comes as US measures of consumer confidence plummeted in March and April.

McDonald's chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said the company was navigating the “toughest of market conditions” as it also reported a surprise 1% fall in global sales in the first three months of the year.

“Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” Kempczinski added.

The company, headquartered in Chicago, has been trying to boost consumer spending on its Big Macs and chicken McNuggets through the launch of a new “value” menu.

Also on Thursday, GM, one of the “big three” Detroit carmakers, cut its profit guidance for the coming year, and cautioned that Trump's tariffs could cost it as much as $5bn (£3.8bn) in 2025.

The carmaker said it was exposed to the costs even after Trump's announcement that he would scale back some of the duties on foreign cars and parts. The move was designed to give a reprieve to US carmakers, after the domestic industry warned his strategy would increase costs for American manufacturers by tens of billions of dollars.

Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will now not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, such as those on steel and aluminium. US carmakers will also be allowed to apply for temporary tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although the relief will be phased out over the next two years.

Mary Barra, GM's chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders that the company now expected to make a pre-tax profit of between $10bn and $12bn this year, including a tariff exposure of between $4bn and $5bn. This compares with previous profit guidance of $13.7bn to $15.7bn.

Despite the significant hit to profitability from tariffs, Barra's letter stated the company was “grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry”.

“We look forward to maintaining our strong dialogue with the administration on trade and other policies as they continue to evolve,” Barra wrote.

Carmakers have been struggling to keep up with Trump's frequent changes to his plans for sweeping levies, which have also forced Stellantis – the owner of brands including Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat – and German manufacturer Mercedes to withdraw their financial guidance for the year as a result of the uncertainty around tariff policy.

GM and the other two big Detroit carmakers, Stellantis and Ford, have significant manufacturing facilities in Mexico or Canada which serve the US market, prompting analysts to caution that the trio could be most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs. Under free trade agreements, which have been in place for decades, parts and cars can crisscross that border many times.

Companies across a range of sectors have been struggling to keep up with changes to tariff policy announced by the Trump White House, which threaten to upend global supply chains and disrupt markets.

Uncertainty and abrupt policy U-turns also appear to be weighing on US consumers, while other hospitality businesses including Starbucks, Domino's Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill have warned that Americans are cutting back on dining out.

It came as official figures showed that the US economy shrank by 0.3% between January and March, down from growth of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024 and the first contraction since the start of 2022.

US consumer sentiment plunged by 32% to its lowest level since the 1990 recession between January and April, after the announcement of Trump's tariffs sparked fears of a global trade war. The index of consumer sentiment score is based on a monthly survey asking Americans about their financial outlook.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a long-anticipated mineral resources deal that could help Kyiv secure future military assistance, despite an apparent last-minute disagreement about its terms.

The U.S. Treasury Department said late Wednesday afternoon that the two sides had agreed to establish a United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that would “accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery” from Russia's invasion while also recognizing “the significant financial and material support” that Washington has provided.

The announcement contained few details about the fund, which will be run by Treasury and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.

The U.S. and Ukraine have announced an economic deal after a weekslong press by President Donald Trump on Ukraine compensate Washington for more billions in military and economic assistance to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion.

The Associated Press

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.” He warned that anyone who “financed or supplied the Russian war machine” will be barred from profiting from Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Washington Post, which said it had obtained a copy of the deal, said the agreement covered minerals, oil, gas and other natural resources, but not the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant currently under Russian control. It said the deal also did not provide security guarantees to Ukraine but contained language about long-term U.S. support for Kyiv.

The Kyiv Independent reported before the signing that the U.S. would take a 50-50 share in profits from Ukraine's future production of rare earths minerals. The news organization's sources said the profits would pay for future U.S. military aid to Kyiv rather than compensate Washington for past aid, as President Donald Trump had previously demanded.

Treasury did not respond to requests to confirm the exact terms of the agreement. 

Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump's policy chief, said Thursday that “repayment to the United States” was still the objective of the deal. “It's meant to pay back the United States, is the key point, for the hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers have spent subsidizing the war in Ukraine,” he told reporters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the fund will receive half of royalties, licence fees and other payments related to natural resource projects in Ukraine. She framed it as tying the U.S. to Ukraine's future economic success.

“This partnership represents the United States taking an economic stake in securing a free, peaceful and sovereign future for Ukraine,” she said.

Separately on Wednesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A summary of the call released by Mr. Carney's office said the pair “agreed that a durable peace can only by achieved with Ukraine at the table,” seemingly a reference to previous American efforts to negotiate with Russia in Ukraine's absence.

The Prime Minister's Office said Mr. Carney and Mr. Zelensky will meet in June at the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alta., and that Mr. Carney committed to backing “lasting peace and security” for Ukraine.

Before the deal closed on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent signalled that there had been some late disagreements over its details, even as Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was in Washington to finalize the accord.

“The Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes. We're sure that they will reconsider that, and we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are,” he said at a televised White House cabinet meeting a few hours before closing the deal.

Mr. Bessent did not specify what the sticking points were. He said the two sides had reached an agreement over the weekend that the U.S. was ready to sign.

The down-to-the-wire wrangling was consistent with the fraught history of the negotiations.

Mr. Trump originally proposed a deal that would have given the U.S. access to US$500-billion worth of rare earths minerals as a way of paying for the military assistance that Washington has provided Kyiv since the start of the war. (Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. had given aid worth US$350-billion to Ukraine. The real figure, according to the U.S. government‘s own Ukraine Oversight webpage, is US$183-billion.)

That deal fell apart after a Feb. 28 clash in the Oval Office between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump also blamed Mr. Zelensky for the fact that Russia had invaded his country.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky held a much calmer meeting last weekend on the sidelines of the Rome funeral for Pope Francis. Since then, Mr. Trump has softened his rhetoric toward Ukraine, and expressed stronger criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has rebuffed Mr. Trump‘s efforts to push the two sides toward a ceasefire. Mr. Trump has mused that Mr. Putin may be “tapping me along” and holding up a peace deal.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump explained his rationale for the deal: He felt that the U.S. should be getting something in return for helping Ukraine defend itself.

The President said at the cabinet meeting that the U.S. had previously given money to Ukraine “like it‘s throwing it out the window” and he “felt very foolish.” The deal, he said, would ensure the U.S. received rare earth minerals for its military support.

“We had no security, we had no nothing – we were just pouring money there, unsecured money, putting it in banks and anybody could have taken it out. Anybody over there. It was their decision,” he said.

“So I said, ‘well, we want something for our efforts beyond what you would think to be acceptable.'”

Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the foreign affairs committee in Ukraine's parliament, said that the agreement was at least a good sign that Mr. Trump may be willing to keep backing Kyiv.

“I think it‘s a sign of the increasing trust between both presidents,” Mr. Merezhko said.

Mr. Trump has not authorized the delivery of any weapons or ammunition to Ukraine since taking office, leading to rising alarm in the Ukrainian military, which has relied on U.S. military support to hold back the Russian troops that currently control about 20 per cent of Ukraine. 

Mr. Trump once said he could deliver a ceasefire within 100 days of taking office – a milestone that passed on Tuesday with the war still raging.

“Trump needs to show a victory for his 100 days in office. And it‘s a sort of such a win for him,” Mr. Merezhko said. “He didn't deliver on his promise to finish the war and yet he has signed a deal with Ukraine. Now he can say: look, unlike Biden, I have managed to salvage the aid given to Ukraine.”

US growth has dipped by an unforeseen 0.3% in the first three months of Donald Trump's presidency, according to initial data. Stocks fell in reaction to the news. 

The US Commerce Department on Wednesday said the world's largest economy declined by 0.3% in the first quarter, according to preliminary data.

The first gross domestic product (GDP) figures for US President Donald Trump's second term had been highly anticipated, especially after the sweeping tariffs he has implemented since taking office.

US stock index futures dropped after the GDP reading raised worries of a US slowdown amid a global trade war.

GDP decreased at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, having grown by 2.4% in the final months of 2024. 

The data was far below a market consensus estimate of 0.4% growth.

""The downturn in real GDP in the first quarter reflected an upturn in imports, a deceleration in consumer spending, and a downturn in government spending,"" the Commerce Department said. 

The reading was published on the 101st day since Trump's return to the Oval Office on January 20. 

Since then, the US president has announced several rounds of import levies, laying out plans in March to impose tariffs on top trading partners from early April that were later put on ice. 

The downturn was largely attributed to a surge in imports as businesses and consumers stockpiled in anticipation of future Trump tariffs.

Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for the bad economic news in a post on post on his Truth Social platform.

""This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,"" the US president wrote. ""Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.'""

The UN secretary-general's warning comes as worries of spiraling conflict grow over a deadly attack in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Islamabad claims 'credible intelligence' Delhi is planning an imminent military strike.

These live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading.

Below, you can read a roundup of developments from Wednesday, April 30, on tensions between India and Pakistan following the Kashmir attack.

Indiahas closed its airspace to Pakistaniairlines, according to local media.

All aircraft registered in Pakistan, including military flights, are affected, with the ban remaining in place until May 23, the authorities said, according to Indian broadcaster NDTV.

This comes as tensions between the countries continue to grow after the deadly attack in the disputed Kashmirregion that resulted in 26 people being killed.

Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian aircraft as part of the diplomatic downturn since the attack on April 22.

Sumatra Bose, a political scientist and a professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), told DW that India's attack on Pakistanis imminent.

""I think it's a matter of days rather than weeks,"" Bose said, adding that the main question would be the form of India's military action.

The reasons for the Indian government's lack of choices, Bose said, stems from its very own hardline rhetoric, as well as from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's no-nonsense leader image being at risk.

Speaking about the potential of another country mediating between India and Pakistan, the LSE professor says the two countries are pretty much on their own.

The United Nations ""became irrelevant"" on Kashmirdecades ago, while the US and China are hardly likely to become active, also due to Beijing's close relations with Pakistan, she added.

""China is very likely to extend, at the very least, moral and diplomatic support to its longstanding ally,"" Bose said.

Viral posts on social media have claimed India triggered a flood in Pakistan by withholding, then releasing, large amounts of water from a dam, causing flooding.

New Delhi suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty with Islamabad after last week's deadly attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan's national carrier has canceled all flights to Gilgit and Skardu, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir due to security concerns.

News site Geo News reported that Pakistan International Airlines canceled multiple flights from Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

Meanwhile, Express News reported that Pakistan issued new directives to air traffic controllers to ramp up monitoring of Pakistani airspace.

More Pakistani nationals living in India headed to the mainland crossing between the two countries on Wednesday, well after the deadline for them to leave by Sunday had passed.

India has ordered almost all Pakistani citizens to leave the country as part of Delhi's response to the attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which it has linked to Pakistan.

Sara Khan, who was ordered back to Pakistan without her husband, Aurangzeb Khan, who holds an Indian passport, told the Associated Press news agency, ""they told me you are illegal and you should go.""

""We have settled our families here. We request the government not to uproot our families,"" said Khan, who had a long-term visa that was valid until July 2026.

The Pakistani government, which denies any involvement in last week's attack, has retaliated with its own measures, including the cancellation of most visas for Indian citizens.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, the Kremlin announced.

The May 9 event marks the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Modi was invited to attend alongside other international leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not provide a reason for Modi's absence. According to the Russian state news agency TASS, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh may represent India instead.

India's government said Wednesday that Russia had been informed that India would be represented by Singh.

Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region following last week's deadly attack.

Militants killed 26 people, mostly tourists on Tuesday, April 22. India has blamed the attack on Pakistan, which has repeatedly denied the allegation. Kashmir is a disputed territory administered by India, Pakistan and China.

DW's New Delhi bureau chief Sandra Petersmann suggested that India's recent history indicates a possibility of military action following the Kashmir attack.

She cited Delhi's limited military responses to attacks on Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016 and 2019.

""In 2019, the Indian Air Force struck an alleged military training camp for terrorist in Abbottabad in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which is close to the Afghan border but lost a jet in the process,"" she said. 

""So all of this is clearly indicating that a potential military reaction from India after this attack on civilians is very much on the table,"" Petersmann added.

India was also trying to diplomatically isolate Pakistan, adding pressure on Islamabad.

Conflict in Kashmir ""goes much beyond the region,"" Petersmann said, noting that China's territorial claims could mean the involvement of three nuclear powers, not just two. 

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Tuesday.

""The secretary-general also expressed his deep concern at rising tensions between India and Pakistan and underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences,"" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

A confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors ""would be catastrophic for those two countries and for the world as a whole,"" the statement added.

Sharif's office said he had asked Guterres to ""counsel India to exercise restraint.""

""Pakistan remains committed to peace, but will defend its sovereignty with full force if challenged,"" he wrote on X. 

Jaishankar appreciated the call from Guterres and said, ""India is resolved that the perpetrators, planners, and backers of this attack are brought to justice."" 

Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that New Delhi intended to use last week's militant attack on civilians as a ""pretext"" for further military action.

""Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident,"" Attaullah Tarar wrote on the social media platform X. 

The statement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly authorized his country's armed forces on Tuesday to respond to the Kashmir attack in whatever way they see fit.

Welcome to DW's coverage of events in Kashmir and the wider region on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

On April 22, gunmen killed 26 people, most of whom were tourists, near a resort close to the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The attack prompted New Delhi and Islamabad to downgrade diplomatic ties, and India suspended a key water-sharing treaty with Pakistan.

The following days have seen cross-border firing from both sides, with no reported casualties.

On Tuesday, Pakistan accused India of planning a military strike within the next 24-36 hours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Trump: I've removed Mike Waltz as national security chief","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/05/01/mike-waltz-quit-latest-donald-trump/","Thu, 01 May 2025 20:06:57 GMT","

Donald Trump has announced he is removing his national security adviser, Mike Waltz and nominating him instead to the role of UN ambassador.

The announcement followed hours of breathless speculation that Mr Waltz was being ousted entirely by the Trump administration.

The reshuffle will be viewed by many as a demotion for Mr Waltz, with Mr Trump having very little interest in the affairs of the UN.

Mr Waltz said in a brief statement on social media he was “deeply honoured to continue my service to president Trump and our great nation”.

The move is viewed partly as a response to the Signal-gate fiasco, in which Mr Waltz accidentally leaked military plans to a journalist.

Mr Trump said Mr Waltz had “worked hard to put our nation's interests first” in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, will take on his role temporarily while remaining in his post as the nation's top diplomat.

“From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my national security adviser, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our nation's interests first,” Mr Trump said.

“I know he will do the same in his new role.

“In the interim, secretary of state Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.”

Thanks for following the updates here. This live blog is now closed.

Mike Waltz faces “brutal” confirmation hearings to become the US ambassador to the UN, Democrats have said.

Mr Waltz will need to be confirmed to the position by a Senate vote, and will almost inevitably be grilled over his role in the Signal-gate disaster, where he accidentally leaked military plans to Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

“I think it would be pretty brutal,” Mark Warner, a Democrat senator, told NBC.

John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, told the BBC: “Signal-gate will now be a major part of Mike Waltz's confirmation process.”

John Bolton, Donald Trump's third national security adviser in his third term, has said Mike Waltz's ousting is a sign of the US president's “chaotic” administration.

He wrote in The Wall Street Journal:

Donald Trump's chaotic national-security governance is in full flood.

Whether it's risking American military operations, making volatile, highly dubious tariff decisions, hiring uninformed senior advisers, or seeing senior government officials dissenting from presidential decisions, the disarray is palpable and likely to spread.

It did Thursday, with the ouster of national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Mike Waltz has issued a brief statement after being ousted as US national security adviser:

I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation. pic.twitter.com/FFTPjnIYkI

And there we have it. After staying silent on the issue so far, Mr Trump has now announced that Mike Waltz will go to New York to be his permanent representative to the UN, while Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, will wear two hats and act temporarily as national security adviser.

Mr Trump is desperate for this administration not to go the same way as his chaotic first. He managed to wait 101 days before making a major change to his top team. 

And rather than dumping Mr Waltz entirely he has found a face-saving post elsewhere (albeit a demotion). That is a reflection of how tight this team is and is something of a reward for a figure who has remained totally loyal up to this point.

At the same time, Mr Rubio, who as a more traditional conservative hawk may have wondered if he too were on thin ice, takes on more responsibility. That will reassure European allies that Mr Trump has grown-ups in key places and shows that Mr Rubio is safe in his role.

Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, was “barely” on speaking terms with Mike Waltz, Politico reports.

Officials are said to have been alarmed at how his authority drained away following the Signal-gate fiasco as Laura Loomer, the Right-wing activist, convinced Donald Trump to sack key members of his national security team.

Approached by the news outlet amid reports of Mr Waltz's ousting, Ms Loomer replied: “Loomered.”

Mike Waltz deserved to lose his job, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has said, adding that Pete Hegseth should be fired too.

“Look, they should fire him, but they're firing the wrong guy. They should be firing Hegseth,” Mr Schumer told reporters.

Arizona senator Mark Kelly also called for Mr Hegseth's dismissal.

“I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” he said, adding that he thought Mr Waltz accidentally including a journalist on Signal was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Mr Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk”.

Following the Signal-gate leak, Maga faithful lined up to back Mr Hegseth, leaving Mr Waltz to take the fall.

Mike Waltz quit as national security adviser after his relationship soured with Donald Trump's chief of staff.

Relations between Susie Wiles, nicknamed the president's “Ice Maiden”, and Mr Waltz reportedly became strained, even before the Signal-gate Fiasco.

Mr Trump had considered firing his national security adviser after Mr Waltz leaked military plans to a journalist, but he refrained to avoid providing fodder to his opponents, according to CNN.

Yet Mr Waltz remained on shaky ground, losing much of his influence in the West Wing, and his standing never really recovered, four sources told the outlet.

Central to his reduction in stature was Ms Wiles, who was allegedly one of the officials most unimpressed with Mr Waltz.

Speaking in the Rose Garden at an event to mark the National Day of Prayer, Donald Trump made a point to say that Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, was doing a “great job”.

The president reeled off members of his cabinet and congratulated them for their good work, missing out Mike Waltz. However, he was quick to mention Mr Hegseth, who is also vulnerable.

The defence secretary was part of the Signal group chat into which Mr Waltz mistakenly added a journalist.

Mr Hegseth discussed sensitive information including times and locations of Houthi strikes.

In recent weeks, the Pentagon boss has been the subject of a myriad of negative headlines claiming he is disorganised and unprofessional.

The Trump administration and the president himself have repeatedly reassured Mr Hegseth's job is safe.

Robert De Niro has thrown his support behind his transgender daughter saying: “I love all my children”.

Airyn De Niro, 29, who was born Aaron, spoke out about undergoing hormone therapy and “stepping into this new identity” in a recent interview with Them, the LGBTQ magazine.

De Niro, 81, responded to Airyn's decision to transition by issuing a message of support.

“I loved and supported Aaron as my son, and now I love and support Airyn as my daughter,” he told Variety magazine.

“I don't know what the big deal is,” he added. “I love all my children.”

Airyn said the transition was inspired by watching the 2023 re-make of The Little Mermaid.

“There's a difference between being visible and being seen,” Airyn said. “I've been visible. I don't think I've been seen yet.”

Laverne Cox, the transgender actress, was also an inspiration. “Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success… I'm like, you know what? Maybe it's not too late for me,” Airyn said.

“I'd want to hopefully be an inspiration for at least one other person like me who is black, who is queer, who's not a size extra small.”

Airyn, whose mother is actress Toukie Smith, said they were a “late bloomer” who had never fit in with those around.

“I was always told I was too much of something or not enough of something growing up: too big, not skinny enough,” Airyn said. “Not black enough, not white enough. Too feminine, not masculine enough. It was never just, ‘You're just right, just the way you are.'”

Despite an affluent upbringing, Airyn has dismissed “Nepo baby” headlines and credited De Niro and Smith for doing their best to shield their children from the public eye.

“No parent is perfect, but I am grateful that both my parents agreed to keep me out of the limelight,” Airyn said. “They have told me they wanted me to have as much of a normal childhood as possible.”

De Niro, a two-time academy award-winner, has fathered seven children, including Ms De Niro and her brother, Julian.

In 2023, he welcomed his most recent daughter, Gia, at the age of 79.

A union exists whenever a group of people work together to solve a problem they couldn't alone, says Shane Burley.

“We need to think deeply about cultivating that mindset of collective survival, of needing to understand each other and work together, even if we don't like each other, and would never actually choose each other, because this is the ‘us' we've got in an us versus them situation,” says Kelly Hayes. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Hayes and guest Shane Burley discuss the realities of organizing under a federal government that's been captured by the far right.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we are talking about fascism, including techno-fascism, mutual aid, and the kind of organizing and solidarity we need to survive these times. We'll be hearing from my friend Shane Burley, who is the author of Fascism Today: What It Is and How to End It, Why We Fight: Essays on Fascism, Resistance, and Surviving the Apocalypse, and the co-author of Safety Through Solidarity: A Radical Guide to Fighting Antisemitism. Shane has helped me think through a lot of crises over the years, and I think his insights on this moment are downright essential.

[musical interlude]

KH: Shane Burley, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Shane Burley: Thanks for having me back again.

KH: How are you doing, friend?

SB: I'm doing okay. It's been a rough few weeks. It's been a rough few weeks for everyone, so at least we're all doing it together.

KH: Absolutely. So it's been a while, but you've been on the show, I think probably more than any other guest, but for listeners who may not have heard from you before, can you say a bit about your work and what you do?

SB: Sure, yeah. I'm out here in Portland, Oregon. I have written for a long time about fascism, far right and anti-fascist organizing and about social movements in general, mutual aid. And I've worked in organizing and housing and labor, mutual aid organizing, ecological defense and other things over the years. And we've gotten together to talk about the state of the world and fighting back many, many, many times over, I don't know how many years at this point. 

KH: Well, really glad to have you back. I Really value your insights and your analysis, and I think I think the two of us make a good team.

So to open up this conversation, I just want to ask, as someone who has studied fascism, fascist movements, and anti-fascist organizing for many years, how do you view the present moment? What are you noticing? And what do you think needs to be named?

SB: I think this is a totally unwritten, unpredicted situation where the rules are entirely different and we should treat them as entirely differently. Right now, if you think about what we call anti-fascism, what people kind of have the image of, it's mainly post-war anti-fascism, so after World War II. So what that generally means is that those movements aren't fighting fascist governments, so that's just typically not what's happening in most of that, what we kind of envision as typical anti-fascist organizing. Maybe they're fighting neo-Nazis, maybe they're even fighting really, really large movements, but not necessarily in the state.

But the question is what does it look like when there's state capture? And then what does it look like when there's state capture by the far right in a very advanced post-industrial government? If you think about Germany or Italy or Spain or even later sort of government entities where a fascist or far right party takes power, those are somewhat primitive states in comparison to the massive sort of overarching American government, which is a totally different beast, which controls global economies, which has huge hands on workers' lives, on people's civil rights, health care access, all kinds of stuff, and is very technologically sophisticated and kind of coordinated.

So we are in a situation now where essentially the far right has taken over basically every element of the federal government, which is enacting policies that attack the left very specifically and are doing mass deportations, attacking trans health care. They're staging a coup on people's lives. It's like dropping an atom bomb on the daily lives of human beings, at a scale that has never happened before. We should say that again. It's never happened before, not like this. There's real precedent for it.

So because of that, it doesn't mean we don't have many, many, many examples from history from which to learn, but we do need to kind of weave those together differently than we have in the past and certainly different than we did in 2017 when preparing for Trump's first term or in the interim. So we should be thinking about this as how do we deal with this differently, when there is such a perfect alignment on the one hand of the world's richest person and the scion of the far right who's now the president, and a dramatic rightward shift of the entire GOP to aligning with politics that used to be found in the fringes of fascist message boards? What do we do in that situation?

KH: When you say this hasn't happened before, you mean here in the United States?

SB: Right, yeah. No, to be real specific, I mean here. There's not a precedent in the United States for this. There is precedent globally, which is why our sort of need to press internationally and to have those international relationships and that two-way sort of learning, that's really important.

But here, specifically in the U.S., it hasn't happened. And that's why I think people were so unprepared for just the scale of these executive orders and the attacks that happened because there was a sort of underlying belief, particularly amongst kind of affluent liberal communities that are often in urban areas, that simply this scale of attack just wouldn't take place. That it'd be much more muted or specific or it would slot itself into the sort of struggles that you normally have, that you'd be able to stop it in the courts or there would be protests that would get people to back down, that kind of thing.

But that's not taking place now. Something different is happening, something that looks a lot more like political coups that have happened in other countries over the last 20 years, but not like the right-wing history of American government.

KH: So how does what we are experiencing in the U.S. relate to what's happening with fascism globally right now and to some of those more recent histories you were just referring to?

SB: Well, there's been a shift in electoral politics all across the world, but most specifically you can see it across Europe, in Russia, India, Israel, where a lot of mainstream parties either have taken on the character that you'd normally see in a far right national populist, white nationalist party.

So an example is Israel, the Likud party, which is often thought of as, I don't know, sort of like the Republican Party, except their politics are much more in line with what you'd find in a far right nationalist party, National Front or something like that. In Europe, those have taken on that character and at the same time, coalition governments are now bringing in far right parties, so they're actually working in collaboration in these places, which moves the entire apparatus very, very far to the right. So what you're seeing now is not just an insurrectionary fascist movement, not like people in the streets, those exist too, but it's a little bit different, but they're actually in there making public policy. And the left hasn't obviously had that same kind of success. The DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] hasn't taken over huge parts of the Democratic Party or something like that.

So what you're seeing is that they're mobilizing and they're using either, on the one hand, real financial instability or the trenchant threat of financial instability or the loss of status in a lot of largely white middle income communities, to then push these far right politics, specifically to demonize immigrants. In Europe, this is really, really built around the Islamophobic core of the far right. And here it's, to a degree, of the same, but it's also built around attacking immigrants south of the border and specifically in demonizing trans folks.

All of that has allowed them to take this long game of taking over state power, whether it's in courts or in just normal electoral positions, and moving things really far to the right. And now what they've done, particularly in the U.S., that follows suit of what's happened particularly in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, which is to basically set up a situation that breaks down the safeguards, breaks down the balance of power so that when someone gets in there with enough force, they're able to start just kind of knocking out various changes.

And that's [what] Trump [is] doing today. The closest allegory is probably Viktor Orbán in Hungary and how there was a right-wing shift that allowed him to basically just start making really, really serious changes to fundamental core institutions. And there was not much, at least in terms of structures of government, that could stop that.

KH: Yeah, I think the Orbán comparison is really important, because there are a lot of parallels there. I also think it's worth noting that Netanyahu, who can't safely travel to many countries without worrying about his ICC [International Criminal Court] arrest warrant, was recently welcomed by Orbán in Hungary. And while Netanyahu was visiting, Orbán announced that Hungary was actually withdrawing from the International Criminal Court. Netanyahu and Orbán have long taken the position that western liberalism and multiculturalism are done, and that nationalist politics are going to define the future. With the second election of Donald Trump, which has led to the destabilization of long-held alliances and international norms, I think they see an opening for the normalization and proliferation of their agendas.

From Orbán's capture of Hungarian media, to the control he's exerted over the Hungarian judicial system — which is something Netanyahu has also aspired to — we can see, in Hungary, what it looks like when some Trump's aspirations are brought to fruition. What should those of us who want to resist Trump take away from Orbán's ascent in Hungary?

SB: Well, I think there's a good comparison right now to the way that Orbán went after universities, public universities, not even just public universities, but universities in general as a sort of way of dispatching two things. One was to dispatch the actual political organs of the left, given the role that universities and colleges often play in grassroots politics. And then also to stage sort of like a cultural war intervention. We're not going to reproduce the ideas that build the left. We are going to attack, I don't know, gender studies or other sorts of ideas that run counter to the Hungarian national narrative. So that's a way of intervening and changing things generationally. We haven't even seen the long-term effects of what that looks like.

And then centralizing power, centralizing core powers. A similar way actually might be to what happened in Israel prior to October 7th with the attack on the judiciary, trying to make it… Sort of to undo the checks and balances that would've been used to pull back the more extreme policies that the right-wing coalition government was going to push through. These are just very smart ways of dismantling resistance, at least the kind of resistance that's sort of legible through the state electoral system. And that's exactly the things that are happening right now.

So you see these executive orders that go after those sort of what sometimes almost seem mundane elements. So for example, attacking collective bargaining rights for federal employees. This is attacking an institution that often challenges capital — labor unions — and going after that. Similarly, going after campus activists, making it too volatile for them to exist, going after universities and pulling their funding if they don't do something about these collegiate activist organizations. Saying, “Okay, your university will no longer get medical research funding if you allow people to wear keffiyehs as masks,” things like that. What this does is it dismantles, one at a time, these elements of resistance. So that's exactly what the Trump model would be.

I was with Dan Berger, well-known good buddy, organizer, scholar who was saying that one of the mistakes that Trump made in the first term was just simply entering in with racist rhetoric first. And that what he'll likely do this time, and that has proven true, is to attack the elements of defense and resistance first. And then as that's happening, to start ramping up racist policies and transphobic policies. Because what happened before was people had their defenses right away and people were able, there was mass flooding in the streets and you saw really big actions and the growth of organizing, but what they would try and do instead is attack that resistance right from the get-go, right? Have a real panic about it. Give a sort of moral panic about what the left was capable of and what the left had been doing. And therefore, they could dismantle any kind of resistance right away and then the policies would come in with less pushback, at least that's what his hope would be.

KH: On that subject, I want to talk for a moment about the capitulation that we're seeing from some institutions. I'm thinking about Columbia University and how some people seem to think they can cooperate their way out of this mess. If anything, I think submission actually excites the fascist ego, and will probably lead Trump to inflict more pain, and create a spectacle in doing so.

SB: Absolutely. Liberal politics is based on the idea that moderation and internal collaboration, by which they mean capitulation to their opponents is how you get to a sort of reasonable balance of society. And there was, there emerged a sort of class of liberals, over the last like 10 years or so, that really, whose goal is there to punch to the left, to sort of undermine the leftward shift that had happened in politics around Trump to say, “Actually, we're trying to return ourselves to this sort of balancing act of American Democratic politics.”

The problem is that the right has no interest in that capitulation, right? They are a radical force, now they're not a negotiating sort of center-right politic. That doesn't exist in the Republican Party anymore, but is still the center of the Democratic Party and this whole apparatus that surrounds it. And to be on the radical left, which is the alternative to that, is to not have the same financial backing, which is to have no connections to corporate America, is to have all those things that make something larger and more vocal and to dominate the conversation more.

So what you're seeing is a sort of class of affluent liberals basically just sort of bending to Trump's demands. That's exactly what's happening in Columbia, right? You have essentially liberal-leaning academics of a techno-managerial class who are sort of giving in because they need money, they want to keep their university functioning. Except what's happening when they do that? Trump's not backing down. So they're giving in all these things but they're not getting anything in return.

And that is exactly the exchange that's happening all across the country, as sort of center-left but liberal politicians sort of make these concessions, whether it's on the budget or on other things, under the idea that hey, we need bipartisanship. That's smart governance. But the reality is that they are at war with the rest of the people. So if you're not coming in with that same sort of war mindset, you're not actually going to be fighting back to get anything. When you actually get concessions, if concessions is what you want, is by actually fighting and having a real sense of position and a really sense of what you want to win. And that's just simply not what's happening.

And again, it's not necessarily in those people's interests to fight. For so long, our image of liberal Democratic politics has been governed by very, very affluent people in corporate or nonprofit or academic sectors. Those people are not the ones that are primarily harmed by these changes. It's working-class people, it's marginalized people. So again, when you're going to leave it up to them to be the ones that are sort of the vocal, I don't know, voice of the resistance, what you're going to get is capitulation every time.

KH: So you're saying appeasement doesn't work.

[Laughter]

SB: Never has and never fucking will. There's no situation in which that has ever worked. It can work in ensuring that you have a good donor base for your reelection, but it's not going to work to actually fight back against these really serious attacks.

When Trump is attacking, for example, the labor movement and trying to erode the base of the entire worker's struggle, there's no negotiation that's going to help you to maintain the standards of living for the people those unions negotiate for. That's simply not how it works. You're going to have to fight and dismantle those attacks. But if you're not prepared to fight, then there's really nothing that you can expect to receive on the other end of it other than to maybe slow the process of destruction.

KH: So what kind of posture do you think makes sense right now for people whose communities and organizations are under attack?

SB: I think the first thing is they have to know that they're in a war. I think people need to know that they are under assault right now. There has been, again, the same kind of liberal apparatus that has focused for so long and making sure that people don't feel like that Trump is apocalyptic and kind of making people feel sort of silly or vulnerable for having those kinds of reactions. But the reality is that if you are a union worker, if you are a federal worker, if you are a trans person or trying to get health care, if you're a person of any level of immigration at this point, whether it's a green card holder or someone on a more temporary basis, you are under attack, right? They are really literally rounding people up on camera and doing these sorts of things.

So we need to acknowledge what the threat actually is and then also acknowledge that all these sort of, quote-unquote, legally protected safeguards, whether it's nonprofit status or these allegedly court-defended rights are vulnerable. Instead, we need to think what are the actual tools we have? And that is each other, it's organizing together collectively to take action. The legal structures, while they can be helpful sometimes, are not what the actual core of it is. We cannot depend on those things.

We cannot depend on, for example, courts to maintain what we think is the true incarnation of our civil rights. The only thing that defends those is us defending them. So instead, looking at what resources we have within, the primary resource being people, other human beings that we have real personal relationships with and building strategies to take action in that way, that needs to be the big shift. If there is a positive shift that could happen right now, it's shifting away from the idea that, for example, the nonprofit-industrial complex is the place in which change happens, and instead bringing it back to the personal level.

And that doesn't mean that… People could still be involved in nonprofit organization stuff they want, but that's understanding that that status, those protections, those legal sort of structures are not going to be the foundation of any successful social movement or defensive effort. Since people know that, acknowledging that, I think that pivoting to saying, “Okay, where's our actual power coming from?” That's where the basis of this is going to be.

KH: So, what does that kind of organizing look like?

SB: Well, I think it requires looking at each particular sort of node of a social movement as being distinct but collaborative. So we're seeing an attack, for example, on housing access. This didn't start with Trump, this is not a uniquely Trump issue. But it is, when we're looking at the absolute dire sort of consequences of the economic collapse that we're going through right now, housing's going to be a really big piece of that. So we need housing organizations, independent from the state, not just lobbying for rent control or something, but independent tenant organizations or low-income homeowner groups, people to defend housing access and to expand that access. Those things have to work together with labor unions that defend people's rights in the workplace, that are unionizing new places, that are basically organizing workers of different stripes to basically raise their wages and take action, defend themselves in the workplace. And those folks have to work really, really directly with people who are defending health care access more broadly and specifically, as the frontline, trans health care access.

These things have an entire sort of universe of strategies and tactics and relationships together individually. But when we come together and figure out how those are going to work together, that's how you really build this web of solidarity and mutual aid. So that is more than anything what we need now, and that doesn't mean actually inventing anything new. We actually know how to do those things, we've been doing them for years. But there's ways of pivoting. You pivot into the tactics that you know are going to work now. You pivot away from relying, for example, on simply filing lawsuits for a court that might be unfriendly or trying to pass legislation that may not have an effect on it. And instead focusing on what is going to build us the long-term independent strength? Whether or not that's building up the tenant union or building up the labor union and having some way of collaborating.

And then also know how those organizations can work together. How can a labor union help fight for health care access? Well, they do it for their members all the time in getting health care in union contracts and things. But maybe they can go a step further and maybe they can focus on trans members and trans community members. Maybe it's health care workers that can speak out from those labor unions for health care recipients.

There's all these ways in which you kind of do that, understanding that one issue is directly connected to the other. This is really easy when we're talking about economic stuff, right? Housing and worker justice are really built together, but it's all of these pieces that sort of make up a person's social life. So having those networks together, building them and having those relationships, that's what's important.

And in a lot of ways that's how you scale up anti-fascism. Like we've had anti-fascism as a defensive movement against attacks from neo-Nazis, but what happens when that far right is now attacking Medicaid? Is literally attacking the legal status of unions or people's immigration status, you're going to need something bigger than that. You can't just have the black bloc blocking them. That's not where it's happening, that's not what the site of struggle is anymore.

So instead, it's expanding that out and making sure that you have these coalitions with these different pieces, those pieces meaning authentic to themselves, maintaining the strategy and their sense of themselves, but working together and figuring that out. And there are examples of this, right? Spokes councils exist for a reason, coalitions, long-term coalitions exist for a reason. They have done these things before. But with the level of threat we're having now, it's time for all those to have the most permanent relationships they can build.

KH: I feel like what you're saying really connects with what Ejeris Dixon was saying on the show recently about how we're safer when we're bigger. This is really a time to build coalitions, deepen relationships, grow our organizations, and really break through some of the isolation that might be holding us back. 

I am also thinking about what you said about how a lot of our infrastructure is incredibly vulnerable right now. Non-profits can be stripped of their status, and we know that's part of the right's vision for this administration, to really gut the infrastructure of progressive organizing. The National Labor Relations Board can be destroyed, or simply made defunct or irrelevant. We are going to have to be nimble, in terms of how we structure what we're doing, and we have to accept that some work is going to happen differently over time. We are going to have to adapt to a changing terrain.

One example of this that I'm already seeing is this sort of common wisdom around protests — a lot of people won't attend a protest unless it's organized by a group they know and trust. Now, that's really reasonable. It's a sensible standard. But on a changing terrain, things aren't always going to work that way. I've seen some people, in recent weeks, discouraging people from going to protests because some events and calls to action have not been organized by familiar groups or formations. But the reality is that this is a very daunting time for protest organizers, and there could be any number of reasons that the organizations people are used to showing up for aren't going to issue the call or host the event.

For one thing, there was a Supreme Court decision last year that stated that organizers can be held liable for violence and property destruction, even if they had nothing to do with instigating those actions. I'm sure some people are thinking about how that might be weaponized, in the current climate. Some organizations are undoubtedly worried about losing their non-profit status. Some are probably worried about getting hit with a multi-million dollar judgment. In a recent lawsuit, Energy Transfer basically pegged the entire Standing Rock movement on Greenpeace, and won a judgment for $660 million — which is preposterous, but it happened. And that case has chilling implications, not only for protest organizers, but for groups doing support work or direct workshops.The threats people are grappling with are intense, and the stakes are only going to get higher, so we have to accept that protests are probably going to emerge and happen differently in these times. I personally believe that protest is going to become riskier in general. It was already more dangerous for some people than others, but it's going to get riskier for everyone. And we know that when things get worse for anyone, they get much worse for the marginalized. Some people may not protest under these conditions, while others will. Some people might take a really conditional approach, like only protesting if they have a really thorough safety plan, or an awareness that there are people in the streets who have their backs. Absent those things, they may opt out. Everyone has to do their own risk assessment and sort out what makes sense for them. 

We need to think really expansively about the fact that things are changing rapidly. We need to be adaptable and we have to be willing to innovate and engage differently amid changing conditions, whatever that means for us. 

SB: I think one dynamic of this reality, and like you're saying, that the sort of schematic of who is vulnerable is growing really dramatically, is it does remind people, particularly people who consider themselves organizers or radicals or political in some way, is that you're not actually helping those people over there. It's actually you, right? You are there living this life under threat, being terrified, who could have things stripped from them. And I think having that reminder is actually what solidarity is built on. And I think when you have a common, shared experience, a negative experience, it does actually push you into that mindset. And I think a lot of people are thinking, “Okay, how do we do this all together? Because I personally need this.”

But what we need to think about too is then what is the actual core of that mutual aid solidarity relationship? When I did Fight for $15 organizing — this was many years ago, at least 10 years ago now, maybe longer than that — there was a training I went to and they always said, “You can say, when you're having a conversation with a worker, talk to them, listen to them, do what you do in a conversation, but one thing everyone needs to say, that everyone needs to say one thing that's common. And it's a union exists whenever two people or a group of people work together to solve a problem they couldn't alone.” And the point was/is to maintain this idea that a union isn't a thing that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board approves, right? It's not something that has a legal sanction. A union exists when people come together to act collectively. That is what a union is.

And I think that's what we need to start thinking about. Legal structures are super helpful. I think that they can be helpful when they work. But that is not what the actual core of the organizing is. The organizing is the relationships we build and our ability to take collective action. So we need to think about what does it look like if all of those legal protections were stripped? At that point, it's just people coming together to solve a problem they couldn't solve alone. So we should really use this as an opportunity to rethink those sorts of things.

And at the same time, as you're watching the erosion not just of legal protections but of social safety net, of real stable access to almost any resource, what does it look like to share resources? Because that has a whole number of implications when you do that. When you create a mutual aid network, whether it's sharing anything from food to medication to access to health care, whatever it ends up being, that is sort of a snapshot moment of a different kind of society. And if we're talking about struggle as being a stepping stone to radical change, that actually happens when you actually build up those pieces of that different kind of world, not just as a sort of reminder of what could be, but something that exists right now. This is actually a piece of that other world. We can grow it, we can expand it, but it's existing right in the here and now.

So both of those pieces, I think are at the core of what happens when the legal structure that's supposed to validate forms of resistance like civil rights and nonprofit status, union status, things like that, when that evaporates, all you have at that point is solidarity and mutual aid. And that was what it always was to begin with.

KH: I feel like the work of collective survival also has the potential to help us get past some of the differences that keep us fractured and divided, and that make us less effective. I always think about my dad in AA, and how his politics evolved because he was committed to this project of collective survival, where his sobriety was bound up in this collective project of not drinking. Taking that seriously, and helping other people do what they needed to do to stay sober meant understanding people in ways he hadn't before, and taking seriously what they were up against. Through that process, his politics evolved in ways I couldn't have predicted and that I couldn't have inspired, just by telling him that he should look at something differently. I've also seen a lot of things that seemed important to people melt away when a community is under immediate threat and the waters are rising or people are being taken by the state. And I want us to think deeply about cultivating that mindset of collective survival, of needing to understand each other and work together, even if we don't like each other, and would never actually choose each other, because this is the “us” we've got in an us versus them situation. We need each other, plain and simple.

And I think getting people into motion is crucial, because we are not going to find the kind of understanding, connection and solidarity we need by venting on social media. We're not going to bring anything worthwhile into being by standing in perpetual judgment of other people's efforts because they aren't doing what we would do. We are going to grow what needs to be grown by doing what we think people should do, and doing it in concert with other people.

SB: Yeah, the stress of reality also inspires the doing. You have no choice. We are actually doing the work of survival right now because we have no choice. We're under assault. Then what we're doing to basically maintain ourselves through that is what that work actually is. And the question is how is that work going to build into a different kind of future? Can it?

So by making choices of solidarity, basically I'm seeing these problems come and I'm going to make choices to build community and to work collectively as an answer to that, those are the kind of answers I would like to make. That is, in a lot of ways, how you build it up. And those things can actually grow really dramatically. I'm not the only person to be disappointed by the last few months of organized resistance to the second coming of Trump. It hasn't been at the scale that we thought it was, it wasn't the scale that it was in 2016, 2017 or in 2020. But that can change very, very rapidly as people sort of not just have to respond to these threats but have to survive them, because actually engaging in resistance is that form of survival.

KH: You said you've had some disappointment. Are there efforts or projects that you find particularly encouraging right now?

SB: I think we're recording this just after a really big national mass action that involves some more moderate voices and things like that too. But the point was that it did get tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people out into the streets. This is a good thing. There's been targeting of Tesla dealerships for protests, things like that. Those are positive. I think that interestingly, seeing federal worker unions really come out in force and they're not known to be the most militant unions in the labor movement, I actually think that's a really big positive. I think there's been a number of high points in that way.

I think people are also scrambling to figure out what the next move is, and that's okay. Scrambling is what we do. People should have empathy for the fact that it's not always obvious what the right choice is.

I also think that coming out of the sort of solidarity movement for Palestinian liberation, that has been a huge high point and seeing certain coalitions continue that work. There's Jewish coalitions, places like New York that sort of cemented up a lot of relationships in doing that work after October 7th that are then formalizing them now, so they're able to respond very quickly. So we had these big 1,000-person rallies come out with very short notice, for example, in solidarity with Mahmoud Khalil after the initial arrest and then the attacks on Columbia University. Those things happened really fast because the relationships existed and they were able to respond and they're growing now.

So those high points are there, and I think they're most successful when they sort of build out relationships and strategies that existed prior, right? They're not just reinventing the wheel, but they're trying to figure out how to apply those lessons learned and those relationships built to the new conditions.

KH: I think some of the conditions I mentioned before are also generating a certain amount of hesitancy. I think there are a lot of factors. I know I was at a protest recently where a man who was holding a todler was being menaced by the police, because he was sort of standing in the path of the doorway of a building. The police were threatening to arrest this man, and telling him to hand off the baby, and rather than trying to deescalate the police, a couple of protesters were talking to the man the police were threatening in ways that were really unhelpful. One man said, “The police are our friends here,” and the man who's being pushed while holding a baby says, “they are nobody's friends,” really emphatically. I turned my attention to the cops and was like, “Hey, you've pushed him enough that he's not really blocking the door anymore, so this really seems like it's been handled,” and the cop settled for that, and sort of took the win and backed off. But I could see that man's anger, that rather than being on his side, some of the protesters were sort of advocating for the position of the police, and I understood that hurt. And this was a white man with a baby. There are people who have much more intense vulnerabilities, some of whom have trauma around being brutalized, or around seeing their Black or Indigenous kin brutalized by police. I think we are living in a politically fractured environment right now, and that there isn't a lot of trust. People are afraid that if they show up for a cause, they could be harmed and undefended, so I want to name those concerns and that they don't come from nothing. The solution can't just be that people need to get over those fears.

But I also want to say that I have been excited about some of the less public work that's going on, and some of the work that's not playing out in the streets, but that definitely has a major impact on our communities and our movements. Interrupting Criminalization's Beyond Do No Harm Network is a great example of folks cultivating resistance in essential, practical ways. The Chicago Teachers Union has done amazing work around creating a template for what defending our schools against ICE raids can look like, in addition to Bargaining for the Common Good. So, when we're thinking about the ways people are in motion, in spite of the fractures and schisms that are holding us back, I hope folks will keep that work in mind as well.

SB: Yeah, I think we're going through a process by which there's also a separation of the left from a lot of nonprofits that weren't… Maybe not the core, these are not core radical nonprofits, they're not core labor unions or anything like that, around issues about the ceasefire, around Israel-Palestine, which was a big breaking point with the DNC's inability to carry through really any of the demands of the actual left. So people are finding their way a little bit separate from some of what people outside of the core active spaces would've recognized as leaders in these spaces. So we should expect that things are going to be different, but that doesn't mean that they can't have the same sort of mass constituencies they've had before.

[musical interlude] 

KH: This regime is powered by multiple competing but cooperative forces, and one of those forces is techno-fascism. The old school Republican Party has really yielded itself to the MAGA movement, and the leader of the MAGA movement, Donald Trump, has handed off a whole lot of power to Elon Musk and DOGE.

In Elon Musk, we have this billionaire, the richest man in the world, who has referred to federal workers as “the parasite class.” We have DOGE gutting government agencies, and burrowing its way into the Social Security system, DHS, and pushing to centralize government data in ways that could create a kind of panopticon for people in the U.S., surveillance-wise. As someone who has been paying attention to the cults of Silicon Valley for quite a while now, I'm not exactly shocked by these developments, because their rate of economic and institutional capture has been incredible. But the severity of the situation is rather stunning. Do you have any thoughts on the role these techno-fascists are playing in the current moment and how they ought to be fought?

SB: Yeah, this is the tail end of a long far right social movement that really settled into Silicon Valley really starting in the '90s, but closer to the larger financial collapse. We've started to sort of see what we think would be fairly called a big grand realignment of tech leaders who had been, to a large degree, sort of like neoliberal supporters of the Democratic Party, particularly as the Democratic Party facilitated wealth transfer to tech companies through public-private partnerships or subsidies, things like that. They had played for a long time thinking that, for example, these socially liberal policies, as long as they supported money coming in in relationship to venture capital or into things like Tesla, that that was in their favor.

And they really started to shift that when they started to see political issues around particularly identity-based struggles as being sort of something that could erode their power sector or was maybe connected to labor unions in some way. But basically, they started to see that as a form of resistance to their power and began to shift to Trump.

And one of the realities about Trumpism and his economic protectionism is that they largely believe that there'll be carve-outs for particular tech leaders, and there probably will be. And having a protected economy with carve-outs is much more sort of safe as a channel of wealth than just having kind of an anarchic system of free markets, which can accumulate wealth, but also has competition. So what you're seeing now is this tariff system which has just basically dropped an atom bomb on the economy, likely under the belief that there will be some ways of tech… Some fashion in which these tech leaders will continue to receive their wealth transfer from the working class up to their bank accounts.

But we've seen this coming from Silicon Valley from a very particular ideological legacy. So a person that's been brought up a lot recently is Curtis Yarvin, who is a blogger and a tech developer who had helped build what's called the neo-reactionary movement, sometimes called Dark Enlightenment. Well, it's the idea that democracy is a failure, human beings are not equal, whether individually or racially or nationally or by gender, and that we need a strong monarchical leader in the form of a CEO to basically take control of society and run it like a business.

And this is a lot of the sort of internal mythology that runs venture capital in Silicon Valley. And it became more and more increasingly popular, particularly around people like Peter Thiel as he got really involved in funding the Trump campaign, other kind of right wing campaigns. And this has been really important, for example, Vice President [JD] Vance has been influenced by this. It used to be sort of an embarrassment to be associated with Yarvin because he comes in with incredibly racist ideas, these are open fascist movements. Except now he's being interviewed in The New York Times because political leaders and major tech funders of campaigns are citing him openly, right?

This anti-democratic trend that's often associated sometimes with what's called post-capitalism, but a kind of new vibrant libertarianism or free-marketism mixed with authoritarian politics at home, this has become a kind of publicly stated part of the tech identity now, so we've had this really big shift over. So now what you have is the world's richest man essentially entering into the American government and just laying off millions of workers in the same way that he would move fast and break things in a company of his own like he did in Twitter, now X.

So this is sort of the logic of the Silicon Valley far right, which had its own kind of internal culture and politics and lingo, now heading not just into the government, into all areas of politics and social life and now our discourse. And this is not new. It made me, when watching Elon Musk talk about the parasite class, for example, it reminded me of Sam Francis, who was a very important kind of white nationalist figure, before that he had been at the GOP amongst what were called paleoconservatives, so a kind of far right-wing element in the Republican Party, that had this belief that technocrats had taken over different parts of the government and the economy and that they were a class of their own. And we had to strip those out and give control back to what he called Middle American Radicals.

This is not altogether different than the way the MAGA movement talks about the deep state, right? Taking power away from the peoples. And I think at one point the idea that there was professional people in the government, Musk said that that means that we're not in a democracy, we're in a bureaucracy. This is the kind of logic you've heard on the far right for decades and decades and decades.

So all of this is about restating these far right politics and now putting them in positions of power. So if we talk about the idea of state capture, we're not just talking about the fact that the Republican Party moved further to the right and now they have all sort of wings of federal government, and therefore they're able to push through legislation. We're talking about, on some cases, explicitly white nationalists or fascist politics have become the motivating ideology of major transitions in government and the government status quo.

So for example, they're attacking this entire sector in the same way that paleoconservatives and others had been talking about for decades, and which were considered really fringe ideas. These were really out there ideas. You would find them often in white nationalist publications, but they are now public policy. You have to really ask yourself, what is the government today, if not a fully captured institution by the far right?

KH: Absolutely, and I think it's really important to acknowledge the extent of that capture, because I don't think words like “constitutional crisis” really do the situation justice. 

And in acknowledging the reality of what the far right has accomplished here, I also want to take a moment to examine some of the myths and conspiracy theories that prop up their politics. You touch on some of this in your latest book, Safety Through Solidarity: A Radical Guide to Fighting Antisemitism, which you co-authored with Ben Lorber. Can you talk about the role antisemitism plays in white supremacist cultures, conspiracies and myth-making, and why it's important to understand those dynamics right now?

SB: Yeah. So antisemitism remains the functional ideological core of white nationalism. It's sort of the linchpin that pulls it all together. That's what Talia Lavin, the term that she would use. What this means is that as white nationalists tell a story about white people, about race, about governments, about human history, they need a sort of conspiratorial element to piece it all together. It should go as without saying that the white nationalist understanding of race is factually incorrect, right? It's not actually based in scientific reality.

Their narrative, for example, about Black people is that they're incapable, they have low IQs. But then they can't explain why there has been Black uplift or Black social movements or Black development over the years. Well, they need an answer to that question. And the answer is, Jews, right? That Black people are being controlled by Ashkenazi Jews, that Jews control the government, they control finance. They're the ones who invented both capitalism and communism. Basically, Jews are sort of the cornerstone of the modern world that makes white non-Jews so unfree, right? That attacks our sense of self, that distorts gender roles, that distorts natural hierarchies.

So it has continued to be, over the decades and the centuries, the real cornerstone ideological construct that white nationalist depends on. And this is not just in amongst sort of neo-Nazi fringe, antisemitic conspiracy theories have been, in a lot of ways, coded and secularized in ways that have made them really, really frequently popular just amongst the mainstream right and particularly a right that tries to explain economic disenfranchisement and to develop a populist politics.

So if you're talking about a white working class that's had falling real wages for decades, that has been disconnected from the community, that doesn't have strong relationships anymore, but you don't actually want to offer them economic uplift, you're not going to support unions, you're not going to support social programs, well, you have to give them a story that acknowledges their suffering, but channels them away from actual solutions and into reifying the same right-wing vision you're offering. And the way you do that is with a conspiracy theory, right?

It's not capitalism itself, it's those capitalists, with names like Rothschild or Soros. That's a way of basically sort of making it a more specific image of an enemy without looking at any of the structural factors involved. So as received, particularly in the modern right, conspiracy theories are the way that they channel and then neutralize the class anger of the dominant audiences they're looking for, usually white men or male-bodied people in the U.S.

So the question ends up being too, how do we talk about this antisemitic reality? The reality that the right is sort of, in a lot of ways, foundationally built on these antisemitic conspiracy theories at a time when the right is constantly talking about antisemitism? Antisemitism has, for them, been one of the primary rallying cries they use to attack the left, particularly the Palestine solidarity movement, right? Claims of antisemitism are really a big part of how they've created this reactionary fervor in their movement. And it's allegedly in defense of Jews who are being victimized by this antisemitism, that they're attacking immigrant groups, the way they're attacking social movements, attacking nonprofits, things like that. That's all allegedly to defend Jews against antisemitism.

So we're in a real serious bind at the moment where antisemitism, actual rates of antisemitic attacks are peaking at levels we haven't seen in a long time. Actual white nationalism has grown severely. Antisemitic conspiracy theories are incredibly common across the GOP, whether it's through the great replacement theory, the idea that Jews or a, quote-unquote, elite class are trying to bring in non-white immigrants to replace native-born whites. All of these things are really, really frequent on the one hand. And at the other time, the right never stops talking about antisemitism, except it's pointing directly at the left every single time and using really spurious and weaponized claims to do so.

So one of the things that we talk about in the book is it's important for us to really understand how this stuff works. One is to fight antisemitism, defend Jews from attacks, all those things are important. But two, to also see how antisemitism is used to split the working class, to give them false promises about how to solve their problems, and how these things are all related. And one thing that's really important to understand is that when white nationalists create this story about Black communities, it dovetails with antisemitism in almost every conversation.

If we look at the attack on trans health care, if you look at the language people are using, they often have a pretty clear idea of who is, for example, attacking the community with youth gender medicine or something, right? They blame Rothschilds, they blame globalists or elite classes. They essentially use antisemitic conspiracy theories to explain why they think trans health care development is happening.

So these things end up being related. So one of the things we tried to pull out in the book is how can we look at different forms of oppression, both structural and interpersonal, and combine them together and say, “Look, these things are related and we have to struggle with them in a similar way.” And that's how we think of antisemitism. Antisemitism is not disconnected from any other form of struggle. And that is exactly how the right would want it to be understood. They would want it to be understood as a zero-sum game. Defending Jews means undermining the rights of other people and we have a counter narrative to that.

And it's not new. This is something that has come from anti-fascists and from the Jewish left for years, and I think it's going to be much, much… It's becoming even more important as the rhetoric about antisemitism as a sort of vector of attack on the left is increasing so severely, and we are needing to find our footing as fascist movements change and develop and grow.

KH: I think this nuanced analysis is so important right now. I also think people should understand that the right's investment in Israel is not an investment in Jewish people or Jewish identity, and that when they talk about antisemitism, it's generally about condemning any criticism or rejection of Israel's violence. Trump's administration is bound to Netanyahu's in some really important ways. These are both fascistic leaders, and the structural supremacy of Jewish Israelis, the apartheid policies, the disregard for international law, the genocidal violence, the attempts to suppress the judiciary — this is all aspirational for Donald Trump. So, it's important for us to keep that international view of who is part of Trump's network of oligarchs, who he wants to be like — like who are his role models and how is he emulating them — and how false allegations of antisemitism serve his relationship with Netanyahu.

And while we're on the subject of false allegations of antisemitism, I want to mention that the conflation of antisemitism with any advocacy for Palestinian life and liberation has led some leftists to be dismissive of antisemitism as a real world concern. So, I want to emphasize, when you refer to rising rates of antisemitic violence and attacks, you're not just referring to statistics offered by the ADL, which I think many of us know is not a reliable or trustworthy organization. You've actually been involved in doing some research and fact-checking the ADL's statistics, and evaluating what remains when you strip away things like Palestine solidarity protests, that have been wrongly characterized as instances of antisemitism. And on the basis of this sort of fact-checked research, you have found that, yes, this kind of violence is increasing?

SB: Absolutely. Yeah, it's actually incredibly black and white. I think when we talk about antisemitism increasing, and when we look at the ADL research, they focus very, very, very heavily on campuses and on stuff related to anti-Zionism. And they'll use really common anti-Zionist phrases or protest tactics and suggest those are antisemitism. Then people assume that that's what they mean by the core of the increasing.

But actually, if you strip that stuff away, and we did this with last year's ADL data, I've looked at it piece by piece, what you're actually seeing is huge numbers of attacks on synagogues, attacks on visibly Jewish people, particularly Orthodox Jews. And that happens at a rate that just far exceeds what people understand. It's actually happening really, really severely, street attacks against Orthodox people, that's people who are visibly Jewish, and particularly in places like the South or in New York. All of that's increasing really severely.

White nationalist gatherings that are specifically about Jews, whether they're flyering about Jews or they're creating programs or protest action that are meant to specifically target Jews, have increased really steeply as well. And actually, when you look at the actual incidents themselves, even when they mention Israel-Palestine, they're not coming from left-wing anti-Zionist social movements. They're oftentimes coming from the far right who also talk about Zionism for a whole different reason. They mean something very different. Or they're coming from sort of impromptu street confrontations with people who are engaging in antisemitism. They may say something like Palestine, they may say that they're supporting Palestine, but they're not actually engaged in any kind of actual political work or thoughtful process. Instead, they're just engaging in antisemitism and painting Palestine rhetoric on top of it.

So if we look at that, I think that's really important to note that those numbers have increased very severely. There is no sort of testing metric that we've found that doesn't show a dramatic increase. And at the same time, we're also seeing that one of the largest increases in really open neo-Nazi style, it's kind of very severe white nationalist organizing, that has also dramatically increased in the last two or three years. Basically, since October 7th, it has sort of skyrocketed, but it was already trending up in that way.

The other thing I think it would be worthwhile to people to understand about this is that there is a structural element to this. There's something built into the common kind of Western understanding of politics that constantly reproduces these conspiracy theories and leans people back to these sort of antisemitic ideas. So they reproduce over years, and that's really built into a lot of the ways that we misunderstand inequalities and the way that alienation is built in the economy.

And also, keep in mind there are places like, for example, prisons where antisemitism looks like it did 100 years ago, where interpersonal attacks are very, very severe. There's places like the Bible Belt in the South where Jews have trouble finding houses sometimes or have trouble adopting or have trouble taking their kids to school. 

So when I think people are able to dismiss some antisemitism or say, “Hey, it's not that severe,” they're not thinking about when I have been confronted by a Proud Boy with a gun who calls me a Jew? That's not the image of the antisemitism that they're thinking of. They're thinking of an off-color phrase at a protest. So I think it's important to pull that back and say, “No, let's actually look at what's happening, what kind of street attacks are happening. How does this actually play out in people's lives? And what is possible in terms of antisemitism, like what kind of violence is possible there?” 

KH: I really appreciate that clarity. 

I want to circle back to something you said earlier about us not seeing the kind of mass participation in protest we saw in 2020. I think another difference between 2025 and 2020 is that, in the early pandemic, a lot more people were determined to figure out how they could help. There was an explosion of mutual aid. Everyone I talked to wanted to contribute to a cause, in whatever way they could. I am seeing less of that energy from people right now. There's a lot of anger, a lot of bitterness, a lot of isolation. A lot of people are in motion, and scrambling to figure out how they can help each other and what they can do, but I don't think nearly enough of us are in that mode. Instead, a lot of people are posting through it, or just keeping their heads down, hoping that they, personally, can avoid the worst outcomes.

So, in this environment, how do we cultivate the solidarity we are going to need to get through this?

SB: Yeah, I think that there has been some social movements that were easier to bridge difference in, and COVID mutual aid was one of those. I think anti-fascism has been one of those where lots of people felt, had just those kind of crossover feelings. So though they might have some political differences, they were able to meet on this sort of reality. People were able to sort of meet on the fact that what happened in Charlottesville was bad, that the people needed help during COVID. That was a low bar for a lot of people.

But other social movements have shown that there actually is a big reactionary core that wasn't willing to move on certain things. Palestine was one of those. I think that there's also a sort of liberal unwillingness to sort of stand up on trans issues in the way that we need folks to. And I think it's about how are we able to build with the communities we have and then start to reach up beyond that?

And I think that the situation is actually shifting to a more dire one that will make that common cause more obvious to people. And I think at that point, we'll see how resistance people are with some of these entrenched bad political ideas that we've seen split those coalitions before. I was really shocked to see how many of those coalitions broke down when Palestine became the issue. Maybe I shouldn't have been, maybe that's naive. But conditions, the reality of shared conditions and the need for each other, that oftentimes is what will bridge that gap and give people the moment in which they can actually move on those bigger issues, when they're actually able to engage in shared organizing and relationship. Then they can start to be confronted on issues like Palestine, that they might have had decades of conditioning, to have a different sort of understanding of.

So I think the problem is I don't like that it's collapsed when those relationships get formed. And then also can make it that if that collapse is sort of mitigated, then those relationships could break down. But I do think what we're going through right now, economically and socially, is not altogether different than what happened in 2020. I think that we're in a bad spot and I think people are going to need each other, and so we're going to have to bridge that as much as possible.

And I think people are, I think we're actually seeing the early return of a sort of mass mutual aid politic. And I think part of it is that it's unclear where those resources, other than supporting obviously trans communities and immigrant folks, where some of the new pain is going to be hit right away. So people should start working on the infrastructure and stuff now.

And the other thing to keep in mind is that whether people know it or not, there is a mutual aid group in their area that does exist already. You could be a part of it. Or you could federate, for example, you could take some of their ideas and build something in your neighborhood or regionally and then connect with them and work together. There are things, you are not starting from zero, and you can do that at basically any point.

I think so often for folks who have not been involved in organizing, maybe even folks who have been involved in organizing, getting involved on some really kind of critical point feels daunting. But knowing that there are people actually doing this already and that can stepping-stone your way into understanding how it works, that's a useful way of approaching it. So just seeing what's there first I think is always the kind of step number one.

KH: You've mentioned trans issues, immigration, and Palestine — areas where the Democrats are not just falling short, but failing miserably. Rather than addressing their own failures, the Democratic Party is taking the position that they just haven't thrown enough people under the bus, and that they need to completely abandon trans folks and get even tougher on immigration. Unfortunately, we are seeing some resistance-coded liberals repeating those ideas — that to overtake Trump, the Dems are just going to have to abandon trans folks.This fundamental misunderstanding about what it takes to defeat a fascist enemy is not only dangerous to trans people, and to everyone's bodily autonomy, but it really has the potential to sink us. Because this is actually how fascists win, when targeted groups are sacrificed, one at a time, and their violence is normalized, while so-called good people do nothing. And on some level, I know people know this, but when it's happening directly in front of their faces, some people apparently can't see it. So, I am wondering if you can talk about the need to push back against these politics of sacrifice.

SB: Yeah, that's exactly what it is. It's a politics of sacrifice. This is even the rhetoric that's being used. You can see in a lot of these debate shows and public platforms of being like, “Well, trans athletes and youth gender medicine, those are losing issues. We need to drop them if we're going to rebuild this progressive coalition,” or something like that. First off, there is no, quote-unquote, progressive coalition that leaves folks behind. That just doesn't exist.

But the reality is that is not what breaks up those coalitions. What breaks up those coalitions is when you have a sort of affluent class speaking about issues that don't matter to most people. The reality is that the issues of trans health care… they affect actually every single person because they are also the issues of everybody's health care. They're the issues of maybe your family, friends, and kids even, right? These are actually issues that affect people in material ways, and we need to bring that back to people's reality.

These issues of attacking immigrant communities, that is a labor issue, that's a health care issue, that is a communal safety issue, that's a police justice issue. All of those things actually affect people in really material ways, but that is not the way that the Democratic Party talks about them or the way affluent progressives talk about them. They talk about them in a very sort of… They kind of present it almost in moralistic terms, not material terms. What's happened is for years now, these issues have been talked in a way that only appeals to small segments of the community and not actually showing the stake to people about what's going on.

So the change that we have to make is to actually be like, “Why do these issues matter? Let's talk about them. Let's show you really materially what's going on here,” and get buy-in from folks. Because what's often being understood here is that, and this is again where Democrats and centrist liberals sort of capitulate to far right wing sort of framings, is that we're not talking about bread and butter issues because we're talking about pronouns or something like that, as if pronouns are what's not giving you the raise at work or is making your mortgage unaffordable or making college unaffordable. Instead of saying, “Actually these issues are interrelated. How do we combine those struggles? How do we have that shared reality?” Because these are all working-class issues when it comes down to it. These are all about having access to the things we need to be happy, to be safe, to have healthy lives that move forward.

So I think part of the problem here is that the wrong people have spoken about these issues for a very long time because they're the ones who have access to speech modules. They're the ones who get invited on the TV shows, they're the ones that can pay for political ads, things like that. Instead, this needs to be actual working people talking about the issues that matter and why they should matter to everyone. That's how you build solidarity.

When someone sees these issues of trans health care and says, “Actually, that matters to me. That impacts lives, that's actually connected to the things I'm doing in my life, the things that affect me in my life,” that's when you win. That's when you actually build a revolutionary movement. And that is just not the way those issues have been talked about because it is not us talking about them. So I think we need to bring it back to the actual communities that are most affected and the folks that are trying to build bonds to have militant resistance because that is where the struggle is happening.

So for too long, we are sort of having, even on the radical left, we're having to deal with the mistakes that liberal politicians, the liberal political class have made. And I think part of what's happening over the last year, and partially this is because of the splits around Israel-Palestine and the failure of the Democratic Party to do anything to stop a genocide, I think is that we're actually breaking away from them. And that gives us the opportunity to speak for ourselves and to actually talk about the issues that matter and to talk to communities about why these issues matter. That's what's going to be really important.

Because like you said, this idea of disposability, there is no political victory on any issue that's possible if you dispose of people most affected by those issues. They're just simply not possible. So the idea that that's how you build a political coalition is, right at its foundation, one that's not coming from our vision of solidarity. So we need to reify what does it mean to build solidarity with other people? It means to share those struggles because they are already shared whether we acknowledge them or not.

KH: Thank you for that. Is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience right now?

SB: I think people are really tired and working really hard. And I feel like people, it needs to be acknowledged, the way that there's a certain sort of discourse that there's laziness or apathy taking place that I don't think is actually true. I think people are really struggling just to get through day by day. So I want people to engage in organizing as a way of knowing themselves and their community in ways that feel healing and generative.

So my only suggestion is to find ways that do feel sort of empowering and that give you energy and that don't overtax it, and that makes making small commitments to organizing projects or community projects that you feel like you have the capacity to do and not overdoing it. That is, I think the biggest mistake people make is that they're already tapped on energy and then they sort of collapse themselves into something that's unsustainable. But instead, finding something small, starting there, figuring out what you feel like you have capacity for and what feels sort of energizing to you, that's going to be the most important thing because that's how you get longevity.

KH: Well, thank you so much for that, and thank you so much for joining me, Shane. It's always so great to talk with you.

SB: Thanks for having me back, I love coming on.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

Show Notes

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Live Updates


• New role for Waltz: President Donald Trump announced today that he's nominating Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser. Marco Rubio will now serve as secretary of state and interim national security adviser. Waltz had been on shaky ground since he added a journalist to a group chat on military strikes.
    


• Immigration ruling: A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas ruled that the president unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and blocked the administration from quickly deporting some alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.
    


• Tariff turmoil: Trump acknowledged his tariffs could impact US consumers — but downplayed the economy shrinking in the first quarter. Behind the scenes, White House officials describe intense pressure to produce trade deals as economic anxiety builds, sources tell CNN.
    


            Outgoing national security adviser Mike Waltz said he's “deeply honored” to continue serving President Donald Trump after the president announced today that he'd be nominating Waltz to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations.
    


            “I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” Waltz wrote on X.
    


Remember: Waltz had lost most of his influence in the West Wing in the wake of a scandal stemming from him inadvertently adding a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes.
    


            Crowds of protesters marched through downtown Los Angeles today, with several carrying signs urging the government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the US.
    


            Organizers from the '50501' movement, short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement – in response to the Trump administration's flurry of moves over its first 100 days, announced protests across the country, CNN previously reported.



            May 1 marks May Day, which shares a date with International Workers' Day and is often a day for protests and civil action for labor rights.
    


            In New York City, the first May Day protest of the day was a mix of several different causes, with chants of “Free Palestine,” signs calling for the freedom of Mahmoud Khalil, and more typical worker rights signs like, “Trump: Hands Off Our Unions.”
    


            Many signs also called for ICE to get “out of our communities,” and to stop the Trump administration's emphasis on deportations.
    


            The group of roughly 150 or so marched a little over 20 blocks from their starting point in Union Square to the New York Public Library, where the rally concluded near the iconic lions on its front entrance steps.
    


            President Donald Trump informed his outgoing national security adviser Michael Waltz that he was removing him from his role and nominating him as the US ambassador to the United Nations this morning, a White House official tells CNN.
    


            Hours later, Trump announced the move on Truth Social, as well as that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve in the national security adviser role on an interim basis.
    


            State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce expressed confidence that Secretary of State Marco Rubio can handle his roles of both top US diplomat and interim national security adviser.
    


            “He would not have accepted an assignment if he didn't think he could do it,” she said when asked if Deputy Secretary Christopher Landau would take on some of Rubio's portfolio.
    


            Still, Bruce noted that there is always a team involved in government, calling the other State Department leadership “remarkable.”
    


            “It's about managing people. It's about assigning people to the right roles, as the president has just done. If anybody can do this, certainly the secretary, as I've gotten to know him, it would be Marco Rubio,” Bruce said.
    


            The spokesperson said Rubio is a “very involved, energetic man” with close ties with the president.
    


                    “We've seen him be at the White House several times a week. His close working relationship day to day with the president happens for a reason because they work well together. They've clearly been in an environment where they've gotten to know each other very well,” she said at a press briefing.
                





            State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce appeared caught off guard by the news of the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim national security adviser, before calling it “an exciting moment.”
    


            Reacting to CNN informing her of the news, Bruce noted that Rubio is a “man who, I think you all know, has worn several hats from day one” and “is someone who is well known by the president.”
    


            “The president makes perfect assessments about who would implement his agenda,” she said at a press briefing, noting she wasn't entirely surprised.
    


            “That is the miracle of modern technology and social media,” she said of Trump's Truth Social post.



            President Donald Trump announced today that he's nominating Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser.
    


            Marco Rubio will now serve as both secretary of State and interim national security adviser, Trump said.
    


                    “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.”
                





            Earlier today, CNN reported that Waltz was expected to depart from his post as national security adviser in the coming days, according to sources, the first major staff shakeup since the president took office in January. Waltz's job had been in limbo after it was made clear to him earlier this week that his time leading the NSC had come to an end, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Waltz had been on shaky ground – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes.
    


            Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are also expected to depart, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear.
    


            It's not the first time Rubio has been suddenly asked to fill a vacancy in Trump's administration. In February, Trump dismissed National Archivist Colleen Shogan, later naming Rubio to fill the role.
    


            That same month, Trump named Rubio as acting administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) — an agency he's moving to shutter as part of the administration's efforts to cut down on spending.
    


            Henry Kissinger previously served as both secretary of State and national security adviser simultaneously under then-President Richard Nixon.
    


            The expected departure of national security adviser Mike Waltz from the Trump administration in the coming days, according to sources, would make his tenure the second shortest of anyone who has served under President Donald Trump in the position, including during his first term.
    


            Trump cycled through three national security advisers during his first administration.
    


            Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn was on the job for just 25 days. He was forced to resign less than a month after Trump's 2017 inauguration amid claims he misled the administration over his communications with Russia during the transition. In early December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump pardoned Flynn in 2020.
    


            Flynn's replacement H.R. McMaster was able to last longer in the role (over 13 months.) But after months of personal tension between him and Trump, the president announced McMaster's departure in a post on X in April of 2018. Trump had privately expressed irritation with McMaster stemming from differences in “personality and style,” a senior Republican source told CNN at the time.
    


            In the same tweet Trump made McMaster's ouster public, he announced who the next NSA would be: John Bolton, a then-Fox News analyst who had served as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush. A senior administration source at the time told CNN the president had grown frustrated with Bolton taking different positions on issues. The source said Trump no longer believed Bolton could advocate for his agenda.
    


            Bolton was out in April 2019, with him and Trump offering different views on whether he left voluntarily or was asked to resign.
    


            Trump replaced Bolton with Robert O'Brien, who served from 2019 until Trump left office in 2021.
    


            Senate Democrats announced today they are planning to force a vote on a resolution that would require the Trump administration to release a report detailing its efforts to comply with court orders on wrongful deportations to El Salvador, including a human rights report on the Central American country.
    


            It comes amid the case of Kilmar Abrego García, the Maryland man who the administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to the country.
    


            Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat who met with Abrego García in El Salvador over the April congressional recess, told reporters: “The right to due process is a bedrock American principle, and in his first 100 days, Donald Trump is shredding the Constitution of the United States.”
    


            The legislation is privileged, meaning Democrats can force a vote on it despite being in the minority. Van Hollen said, if passed, the resolution won't need to go to the House.
    


                    “If it passes in the Senate, there is a requirement for the State Department to produce the Human Rights Report. The text of the bill poses a number of questions that the report must answer. If no report is produced within 30 days, the law specifies that all security assistance to El Salvador will be cut off,” Van Hollen said.
                





            Earlier today, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer dodged when asked if he would support other Senate Democrats going to El Salvador, though he said that he “respected” Van Hollen's actions and is co-sponsoring the resolution.
    


            Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Democrats want to use this vote to “send a message” to the administration, as well as to the government of El Salvador. ‘If you think you can take steps like this without Congress challenging your executive overreach, you're wrong,” he said.
    


            Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, told CNN she tried to raise concerns about national security adviser Mike Waltz directly with President Donald Trump during their April meeting in the Oval Office, which had already resulted in the dismissal of several other National Security Council members.
    


            Loomer was urging the removal of national security officials she viewed as insufficiently loyal, and said she planned to show Trump a 2016 campaign ad in which Waltz criticized him. But before she could play the clip on her phone, Waltz entered the room.
    


            Her intention was to demonstrate what she viewed as Waltz's blind spot in identifying unfaithful actors, given his own early opposition to Trump before becoming a supporter. She said she believes Trump has since seen the video, though she could not confirm it.
    


                    “All of this boils down to a vetting crisis. Michael Waltz is the one that looked the president in the eye and said he vetted all of these people who there are a lot of problems with,” she said.
                





            Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to national security adviser Mike Waltz's expected ouster by saying President Donald Trump was firing the wrong national security official. They believed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserved the boot more after he discussed bomb targets in Yemen in the Signal chat.
    


            But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was never able to move beyond the question of how Waltz invited Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic into the group chat in the first place, people familiar with the matter say.
    


            While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him.
    


            Hegseth also has more far support outside the administration through the Trump-inspired MAGA movement than Waltz, who was viewed with deep suspicion among the base. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz would not involve a Senate confirmation fight.
    


            White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.”
    


            Most Americans are not too keen on the idea of Congress making major cuts to federal funding for Medicaid, according to a KFF poll released Thursday. Even a majority of Republicans feel that way, the poll found.
    


            The findings come as House Republicans are looking to slash hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending over the next decade as part of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package. The House committee that oversees Medicaid is expected to release more details next week.
    


            Here's more on the poll's findings:
    


• Just over three-quarters of the public oppose major Medicaid cuts, including 95% of Democrats, 79% of independents and 55% of Republicans.
    


• Similarly, a majority of all three groups oppose federal funding reductions for Medicare, Social Security and to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, but fewer than half of Republicans oppose the reduction of federal funding for HIV prevention programs, premium subsidies for people buying Obamacare plans and research at universities and medical centers.
    


• Those who identify as Make America Great Again supporters are split on Medicaid cuts, with 49% opposing a reduction. But a majority of this group opposes reductions for Medicare, Social Security and mental health and addiction prevention services. Like Republicans overall, fewer than half support federal funding for HIV prevention, Obamacare premium subsidies and research.
    


            The survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, is based on a nationally representative sample of 1,380 adults in the US who were surveyed during the 2nd full week in April.
    


            President Donald Trump told a group attending a National Day of Prayer event at the White House that he'd just left “a really great meeting” where he was updated on his sweeping bill on taxes.
    


            The president said House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise were among those who attended the meeting.
    


                    Trump said he was being updated on “the progress of the one big, beautiful bill,” adding, “We love that bill. I won't like it if it doesn't pass, neither will you.”
                





            Johnson called the meeting “very productive and engaging” in a statement today. While he did not say if the group made any final decisions on policy, he said they are waiting official details on the legislative effects of those policies.
    


            Yesterday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he plans to turn his attention on mustering congressional support for his party's tax bill.
    


            “And I just wanted to say the final details are coming together, and they're coming together rapidly, and I think we're right on schedule,” he said.
    


Sticking points: House Republicans are struggling to agree on key issues like Medicaid and raising the state and local tax deduction after a week of intense meetings and negotiations between swing district Republicans, key chairmen and leadership.
    


            The uncertainty about the path forward comes as hardliners remain dug in on wanting at least $1.5 trillion in cuts and as swing district Republicans are beginning to acknowledge that goal may not be achievable if they want to protect coverage for Medicaid recipients in their state.
    


CNN's Lauren Fox and Haley Talbot contributed to this reporting, which has been updated with comments from Johnson's office. 



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau have been floated to replace national security adviser Mike Waltz on a temporary basis while the president weighs a more permanent pick, according to a source familiar with the talks.
    


            Special envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of President Donald Trump, is also under consideration to replace Waltz as national security adviser, one person said, though no decision has been made.
    


            But Witkoff has told people close to him he does not want the job, two sources close to Witkoff told CNN, and they do not anticipate he'll ultimately be selected as Waltz's replacement. Though, they cautioned, he could still take the position if Trump asked him directly.
    


            Witkoff has led discussions with Russia and Iran as Trump looks for international deals.
    


            “Why would he do that? Be saddled with managing the interagency instead of doing what he is doing now?” said a person familiar with Witkoff's thinking.
    

National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to depart from the administration in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN's Kaitlan Collins reports.


This post has been updated with more reporting on Waltz's possible replacements. 



            The signing of a minerals deal between Ukraine and the United States is the “first result” of a meeting the countries' leaders had at the Vatican last weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today.
    


            The pair held a brief meeting before the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. Pictures released of the talk showed the leaders huddled in close discussion in an empty area of St. Peter's Basilica. Zelensky said he told Trump “about our readiness to conclude a deal” during the Vatican meeting.
    


            The Ukrainian leader called the minerals deal a “truly equal agreement” that “creates an opportunity for investment,” praising the Ukrainian delegation who worked on negotiations.
    


            “Our representatives worked very well. The agreement has changed significantly in the process of preparation,” he said. Zelensky said the deal is “debt-free” and will allow both the US and Ukraine to make money together.
    


            The Ukrainian leader called the Vatican meeting “meaningful” and said his country is “looking forward to the other results of our conversation,” without giving any more detail.
    


Remember: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and arranges for a joint investment fund that will pour money into Ukraine's natural resources.
    


            The pact features strong language on the war with Russia and is viewed as a way to further intertwine US economic interests with Ukraine's security needs, though it stops short of providing concrete security guarantees.
    


            A Donald Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has ruled that the president unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and is blocking the administration from quickly deporting some alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.
    


            US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas said Trump had unlawfully invoked the sweeping 18th century wartime authority to speed up some deportations. His decision means Trump cannot rely on the law to detain or deport any alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua within his district.
    


            The ruling is a significant blow to Trump's decision in March to invoke the act — a move that has faced numerous legal challenges and has been halted by several courts. But Rodriguez's ruling is the first to conclude that the president exceeded his authority by relying on a law that was intended to be used during times when the US is at war.
    


                    “Allowing the President to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope,” the judge wrote. “The law does not support such a position.”
                





            Although Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act has been litigated in multiple courts nationwide, including the Supreme Court, Rodriguez is the first judge to have reached a final decision on the merits.
    


            Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said he was not given a heads up that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be leaving the Trump administration. Waltz is expected to depart in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            “I had not heard about it until the middle of the hearing and so I really don't have anything to add at this point,” he told CNN after leaving a hearing for the panel.
    


            He would not answer when asked if he agrees with Democrats that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should also be held accountable and ousted over his involvement in the Signal chat scandal.
    


            Democratic Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Waltz's imminent departure from the administration “long overdue.” She said, “He's the guy who started the unclassified text chain when they were classified channels available. It's his responsibility, but I also think Pete Hegseth needs to be fired as well.”
    


            Duckworth said she thinks Trump is forcing out Waltz to protect Hegseth and that upheavals in the administration will continue because “people are scared to do their jobs.”
    


                    “People are concerned to share classified information. They don't trust that the secretary of defense knows how to manage classified information, and I think they're trying to get rid of this issue, but it is one of national security importance,” she said. 
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he also wasn't aware of Waltz's reported departure, and he wouldn't weigh in on Hegseth when asked if the defense secretary should also be held accountable for the now-infamous Signal chat.
    


This post has been updated with more reactions from lawmakers. 



            President Donald Trump praised members of his Cabinet by name at the top of a speech in the Rose Garden today, starting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who he said was doing “a fantastic job.”
    


            He did not mention national security adviser Mike Waltz, whom CNN reported is expected to depart the administration.
    


            Waltz and Hegseth were both involved in the Signal chat scandal involving the editor in chief of The Atlantic, with Hegseth also having shared detailed plans about a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen on a second Signal chat including family members.
    


            Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and others at the National Day of Prayer event.
    


            “Marco, when I have a problem, I call up Marco. He gets it solved,” Trump said of Rubio.
    


            Democratic senators said today that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should be ousted from the Trump administration, responding to reporting that national security adviser Mike Waltz will leave his position in the coming days.
    


            “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly told CNN, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist in a group chat discussing strike plans was an “unfortunate mistake,” but the “most troubling” part of the incident was Hegseth “sharing incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.”
    


            “That's where the accountability should be, not with the national security adviser. That's my view,” he added.
    


                    “I was surprised to see this. I think they fired the wrong guy,” he said.
                





            Asked if he's satisfied that someone is being held accountable for the group chat disclosing detailed military plans, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal answered, “The question is whether the right person's being held accountable.”
    


                    “There has to be accountability for the mistakes and the errors that have been made, but I think the secretary of defense ought to bear that responsibility. He should be fired,” he said, arguing Hegseth is responsible. 
                





            Meanwhile, Montana Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy said: “If Mike's leaving, that's the president's decision, and we support that.”
    


            “I'm frankly tired of hearing about Signal,” he said, praising the Trump administration for sending troops to the southern border and “putting terrorists back on their heels.”
    


            National security adviser Mike Waltz is expected to leave the Trump administration in the coming days, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            It would mark the first major departure from the administration during President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            His job has been in limbo since it was made clear to Waltz earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with what happened. Waltz had been attempting to stay on and attended yesterday's Cabinet meeting, appeared on Fox News and showed up to the West Wing today.
    


            But Waltz has been on shaky ground and lost most of his influence in the West Wing after he inadvertently added the editor in chief of The Atlantic to a group chat about military strikes in March.
    


            Trump stood by his national security adviser at the time, but Waltz's standing never really recovered, according to four sources. He had also lost his standing with top aides inside the West Wing.
    


            Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he remained behind at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with Trump to a Michigan rally, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration.
    


            Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, says he's “sure there'll be news by the end of the day” regarding a trade deal.
    


            Hassett, who made the comment in a CNBC interview today, declined to share which country the deal would be with. A likely candidate, however, is India.
    


On China: “We're pleased to see that last week China pulled back a bunch of tariffs on US products, perhaps in a show of good faith,” Hassett said during the same interview.
    


            China's pullback came after the US exempted certain electronics coming from China from 125% tariffs.
    


            China's response, Hassett said, “shows we're very close to making the kind of progress we need to move the ball forward.”
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading negotiations with China, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is leading negotiations with other countries.
    


            Hassett said he's confident Bessent will help get the deal done, saying his work on the Ukraine minerals deal was another sign of his leadership.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that lower Treasury yields and slower inflation suggest the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates.
    


            “We are seeing that two-year rates are now below Fed funds rates, so that's a market signal that they think the Fed should be cutting,” Bessent told Fox Business. “We've had some great inflation numbers. We had the biggest decrease in energy prices for a single month in years.”
    


By the numbers: The yield on the 2-year US Treasury note was 3.56% as of market open today compared to the Fed's benchmark lending rate at around 4.33%. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed's favored inflation gauge — registered a 2.3% annual rate in March, down from February's 2.7%.
    


Echoing Trump: Bessent's remarks come as President Donald Trump has recently publicly attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, only softening his stance after advisers warned Trump that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


Unlikely to change: Fed officials, however, haven't signaled they're ready to resume lowering borrowing costs just yet. The central bank is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting next week, according to futures, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Last year, the Fed lowered its key interest rate by a full percentage point.
    


            Uncertainty over President Donald Trump's sweeping economic agenda and inflation's descent stalling out around the turn of the year have kept the Fed on hold. For the Fed to begin cutting again, central bankers will have to either see inflation continue to slow or the unemployment climb more than expected.
    


            The US Chamber of Commerce is asking the Trump administration to provide American businesses with sweeping relief from sky-high tariffs to avoid causing an economic downturn and wiping out countless small businesses.
    


            In a letter to Trump officials, US Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark warned that ending US tariffs imposed this year “is critical given the negative impact recent tariffs are having on the US economy, employers and American families.”
    


                    “We are deeply concerned that even if it only takes weeks or months to reach agreements, many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm,” Clark said in the Wednesday letter. “The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increase in tariff rates.”
                





            In order to “save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,” the chamber is requesting the administration immediately launch a tariff exclusion process.
    


            The business group argued the exclusion process should automatically exclude “any” small business importer from the new tariffs because smaller firms don't have the profit margins and financial resources to sustain higher tariffs.
    


            Additionally, the chamber wants the administration to provide “automatic” tariff exclusions for all products that can't be made in America or are not readily available from domestic sources such as on coffee, bananas, cocoa and certain minerals. The chamber is also asking for a process that would let businesses quickly get exclusions when they can demonstrate tariffs will kill jobs.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.
    


            Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said he expects that next week, “cargo coming into Los Angeles will be down 35% compared for a year ago” in response to tariffs.
    


                    “Many major retailers have told us they have about a six- to eight-week supply of inventory in their systems now,” Seroka said. “United States manufacturers and consumers alike will find difficult decisions in the weeks and months to come if policies don't change.”
                





            His comments come as some of the last cargo ships carrying Chinese goods without crippling tariffs are currently heading into US ports.
    


            Cargo on ships from China loaded after April 9 will carry with them the 145% tariff President Donald Trump slapped on goods from that nation last month. Next week, those goods will arrive, but there will be fewer ships at sea and they will be carrying less cargo. For many importers, it is too expensive to do business with China.
    


            Businesses are making a difficult choice: Continue selling products from China at more than double their previous prices or stop selling those products altogether. For consumers, that means some products will be hard to find or may be too expensive to buy.

            House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie will head to the White House this morning to meet with President Donald Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            The meeting comes at a key time when congressional Republicans are working to cut a deal on Trump's first big legislative package.
    


            Johnson was already expected at the White House to attend the morning prayer breakfast.
    


            The Trump administration's tariffs on imported cars and auto parts will cost General Motors between $4 billion and $5 billion this year. But in an interview on CNN, CEO Mary Barra said the company doesn't necessarily expect to pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of elevated prices.
    


            “We believe … pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” she told CNN's Erin Burnett today, although she added, “Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. We're going to respond to the market.”
    


            The company does expect the higher tariff costs to eat into its earnings as it slashed its profit guidance for the year, as revealed in a letter to shareholders from Barra released early this morning. The letter and guidance were delayed from their planned release on Tuesday, when the company reported lower first-quarter earnings and awaited tariff changes from the Trump administration.
    


            GM is the first major company to estimate, in dollars, how much President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs will cost it. Many others have walked back earnings forecasts because of the ensuing economic uncertainty.
    


            While GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest American automaker, with US sales of 2.7 million cars and trucks last year.

            President Donald Trump's family company has made two real estate announcements in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar just weeks ahead of the president's trip to the region.
    


            The announcements, which involve regional developers, come before Trump's first presidential trip of his second term to the wealthy Arab nations, which have pledged to invest trillions of dollars into the United States.
    


            The Trump Organization on Tuesday introduced the 80-floor Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, a $1 billion development where penthouses are going for $20 million.
    


            And yesterday, Qatari Diar, a real estate company owned by the natural gas-rich nation's sovereign wealth fund, signed an agreement with Dar Global to develop Trump International Golf Club, according to state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA). The 18-hole golf course will also include Trump-branded luxury villas. It is estimated the project will bring $2 billion in foreign investment into Qatar, QNA said.
    


            Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE from May 13 to May 16. The president fostered close ties with Gulf Arab states during his first term, choosing Saudi Arabia for his first presidential visit in 2017.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order establishing a religious liberty commission this morning, a White House official confirmed, during a National Day of Prayer event in the Rose Garden that is scheduled at 11 a.m. ET.
    


            Trump forecasted the action at the National Prayer Breakfast on Capitol Hill in February.
    


                    “I will be creating a brand-new presidential commission on religious liberty. It's going to be a very big deal, which will work tirelessly to uphold this most fundamental right,” Trump said at the time, saying that “this sacred liberty” has been “threatened like never before.”
                





            Previously, Trump signed an executive order targeting “anti-Christian bias,” and he has established a faith office within the White House.
    


            The Daily Wire first reported that Trump would sign the order establishing a religious liberty commission on Thursday.
    


            Job cuts by the government represented the largest chunk of layoffs so far this year, up 680% from the same period last year. Department of Government Efficiency-related cost-cutting led to a total of 281,452 layoffs.
    


            For the month of April, US-based employers announced plans to cut 105,441 jobs, according to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report released today. That's significantly higher than the 64,789 job cuts announced last April. However, a large chunk (40,000 jobs) of last month's layoff count can be attributed to plans tied to two major employers: UPS and Intel.
    


            Earlier this week, UPS said it plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a previously announced plan to increase automation and trim its Amazon business. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel was expected to cut 20,000 workers. The company has not announced specific details for potential upcoming layoffs.
    


            There is a clear trend of economic uncertainty weighing on businesses, noted Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement and business coaching firm.
    


                    “Though the government cuts are front and center, we saw job cuts across sectors last month,” he said in a statement. “Generally, companies are citing the economy and new technology. Employers are slow to hire and limiting hiring plans as they wait and see what will happen with trade, supply chain, and consumer spending.”
                





            The US Department of Health and Human Services this morning released a 400-page review of treatment for gender dysphoria in children but did not disclose who authored or reviewed the report.
    


            The report follows several actions by President Donald Trump's administration to halt gender-affirming treatment of transgender children and adolescents and cancel research about the transgender community.
    


                    “Contributors to the review include medical doctors, medical ethicists, and a methodologist. Contributors represent a wide range of political viewpoints and were chosen for their commitment to scientific principles,” HHS said in a news release about the review, adding that contributors' names are not initially being made public “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.”
                





            The agency said chapters of the report underwent peer review but did not specify who reviewed it. The agency also said it will undergo additional review “involving stakeholders with different perspectives” in the days ahead.
    


            The document, which includes sections on evidence, ethical considerations, psychotherapy and “clinical realities,” focuses on treatment of gender dysphoria in youths, not adults. HHS said the review finds that science and evidence do not support “these drastic medical interventions for our nation's youth.”
    


For context: Major mainstream medical associations — including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry — have affirmed the practice of gender-affirming care and agree that it's clinically appropriate care that can provide lifesaving treatment for children and adults.
    


            A growing number of states have enacted laws or policies that limit the kind of care young people can get. As of March, 27 states have enacted restrictions, meaning about 40% of trans youth live in a state with limited gender-affirming health care options, according to KFF, a health policy organization.
    


            More than 60% of the public opposes major cuts to health spending and staff at federal health agencies, according to a new poll from KFF.
    


            A similar share of the survey participants — including nearly all Democrats and most independents — say the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency have been “recklessly making broad cuts to programs and staff,” while a large majority of supporters of the Make America Great Again movement — including most non-MAGA Republicans and Republican leaners — say the administration is “carefully making cuts to programs and staff to reduce fraud and waste.”
    


            But more than three-quarters of participants say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, with even MAGA supporters closely divided on the issue.
    


            Protests under the “50501” movement — short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement — in response to the Trump administration's flurry of moves over its first 100 days are set to take place across the country today for May Day.
    


            May 1 marks May Day, which shares a date with International Workers' Day and is often a day for protests and civil action for labor rights.
    


            The 50501 movement sprang out of a Reddit forum and has held multiple national days of action the last few months.
    


            The most recent came on April 19 when crowds of people attended over 80 protests at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states to oppose what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.
    


            The planned protests come two days after Trump marked 100 days in office. In that short period, he has moved to upend the world order by cracking down on immigration and immigrants' rights; instituting tariffs that threaten global trade; dismantling the administrative state under the Department of Government Efficiency's slapdash cuts; rolling back protections for transgender people; and exercising executive power with disdain for checks and balances.
    


Read more here on the protests.



            In her first major address since leaving office, former Vice President and 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris blasted President Donald Trump's first 100 days, saying his agenda displays a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals.
    


            “Instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” Harris said. “And what we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage.”
    


            Harris also accused her former rival of setting off the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history through his tariffs, and warned that his conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis.

            A pair of Republican lawmakers are set to propose a new law that would require app stores to verify the ages of all users and share that information with app developers, following a similar state law that was signed in Utah earlier this year.
    


            If passed, the legislation, called the App Store Accountability Act, could mark the first major federal online safety legislation in years and would significantly change how users engage with app stores. The law would go into effect one year after its passing.
    


            The proposed law could make it easier, in theory, for tech platforms to provide safe experiences for kids. But app store operators and privacy experts have noted that the approach could raise legal and practical questions, including how to verify the ages of young users without government IDs.
    


            The bill — set to be introduced by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. John James of Michigan on Thursday — would require app store operators with at least 5 million users to verify users' ages when they sign up for an account, according to a draft provided exclusively to CNN.
    


            App stores, including those run by Apple and Google, would be required to inform app developers of a user's age category — “young child” as under the age of 13; “child” as 13- to 15-years-old; “teenager” as 16- to 17-years-old; or “adult” as 18 or older — while protecting their personal information. Parental consent would be required before minors can download or make purchases through an app.
    


            Lee said in a statement that the legislation is designed to prevent children from accessing apps where they could be exposed to “violent and sexual material while risking contact from predators online.”
    


            “Our legislation brings age verification and accountability to the source of the problem,” Lee said.
    


            The proposal comes as lawmakers and tech platforms have faced pressure to make the internet safer, especially for young users.
    


            Its passing would be a major win for social media companies, including Meta, Snap and X, that have endorsed the idea of making app stores a sort of central clearinghouse for age verification. That way, individual platforms could provide safer experiences for young users without having to check their ages themselves.
    


            “Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,” Meta, X and Snap said in a joint statement after the similar legislation in Utah passed.
    


            Apple and Google, however, have pushed back on legislation that would require them to verify the ages of all users, saying that app stores and app developers should share responsibility for age verification. They're also pushing for privacy-protected age data to be shared only with platforms that need it.
    


            “While only a fraction of apps on the App Store may require age verification, all users would have to hand over their sensitive personally identifying information to us — regardless of whether they actually want to use one of these limited set of apps,” Apple, which has long made privacy central to its brand, said in a report published in February. “That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy.”
    


            Both Apple and Google also already take steps to prevent “objectionable” content, such as graphic violence or pornography, on their app stores. But many parents and online safety experts are most worried about mainstream social media apps like Snap and Meta's Instagram, although those companies have ramped up youth safety efforts in recent years.
    


            “We believe in shared responsibility between app stores and developers, and think it's critical to protect children's privacy and the decision rights of parents,” Google spokesperson Danielle Cohen said in a statement. “We'll continue engaging with Congressional leaders on this important issue.”
    


            Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            Privacy and legal experts have previously raised concerns about the app store age verification approach.
    


            While users wouldn't have to hand over information to verify their age across multiple platforms, they'd still need to provide personal data — likely a government ID or a scan of their face — to verify their age. And it wouldn't just apply to children, but to anyone who uses the app store, regardless of what apps they want to access.
    


            Tech industry-backed advocacy group Chamber of Progress also previously warned that the Utah law could run afoul of the First Amendment by forcing adults to choose between handing over personal information or accessing “legally protected online speech.”
    


            But the two GOP lawmakers who have proposed the App Store Accountability Act say the bill would provide needed support for parents and caregivers, who are currently under pressure to closely monitor their kids' social media use.
    


            “Kids cannot consent — and any company that exposes them to addictive or adult material should be held accountable,” James said in a statement. “The App Store Accountability Act holds Big Tech companies to the same standard as local corner stores.”

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the Trump administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he's nominating his national security adviser Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador in a major shake-up of his national security team.

The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve simultaneously as acting national security adviser while maintaining his position at the State Department.

Trump announced the moves shortly after news broke that Waltz was leaving the administration, just weeks after it was revealed that he had added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.

“I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations. From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Trump wrote on social media.

“In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN.” 

There is precedent for the secretary of state to serve simultaneously as national security adviser. Henry Kissinger held both positions from 1973 to 1975.

Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.

Trump's decision to move Waltz to the U.N. comes weeks after he pulled his pick for the job, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, from consideration. 

Stefanik went through a confirmation hearing, but her nomination was pulled in March because her vote to advance Trump's agenda remains crucial to Republicans in the House. 

 “I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” Waltz said of the nomination.

A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, had been targeting Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. 

Waltz served in the House representing Florida for three terms before being tapped for national security adviser.

In his second term, the Republican president had been looking to avoid the tumult of his first four years in office, during which he cycled through four national security advisers, four White House chiefs of staff and two secretaries of state.

The Signal chain episode also showed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop. Waltz had previously taken “full responsibility” for building the message chain and administration officials described the episode as a “mistake” but one that caused Americans no harm. Waltz maintained that he was not sure how Goldberg ended up in the messaging chain, and insisted he did not know the journalist. 

Trump and the White House — which insisted that no classified information was shared on the text chain — have stood by Waltz publicly throughout the episode. But the embattled national security adviser was also under siege from personalities such as Loomer, who had been complaining to administration officials that she had been excluded from the vetting process for National Security Council aides. 

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving the administration just weeks after it was revealed he added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans, according to two people familiar with the matter Thursday.

In her view, Waltz relied too much on “neocons” — referring to hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party — as well as others who Loomer argued were “not-MAGA-enough” types.

As reports began to circulate that Waltz could be leaving the administration, Loomer appeared to take credit in a post on the social media site X, writing: “SCALP.”

“Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart,” Loomer wrote in another post.

Loomer had taken a similar victory lap when several other NSC officials were dismissed last month one day after she met with Trump. 

Questions are also swirling around Hegseth and his role in the Signal chat. 

While Waltz set it up, Hegseth posted times for aircraft launches and bomb drops into the unsecured app and shared the same information with dozens of people in a second chat, including his wife and brother. 

The Associated Press reported that Hegseth also bypassed Pentagon security protocols to set up an unsecured line for a personal computer in his office –- beside terminals where he was receiving classified information. That raises the possibility that sensitive information could have been put at risk of potential hacking or surveillance. 

The Pentagon inspector general is investigating Hegseth's use of Signal, and he has faced criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. It has added to the turmoil at the Pentagon at a time when Hegseth has dismissed or transferred multiple close advisers. Nonetheless, Trump has maintained public confidence in Hegseth.

Waltz shift from national security adviser to U.N. ambassador nominee means he will now have to face the Senate confirmation process he was able to avoid January.

The process, which proved to be difficult for a number of Trump's Cabinet picks, will give lawmakers, especially Democrats, the first chance to grill Waltz on his decision to share information about an imminent U.S. airstrike on Signal. The group chat, which Waltz created, included several high-level Trump administration officials and the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened sanctions on anyone who buys Iranian oil, a warning that came after planned talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program were postponed.

Trump wrote on social media, “All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” He said any country or person who buys those products from Iran will not be able to do business with the United States “in any way, shape, or form.”

It was unclear how Trump would implement such a ban as he threatened to levy secondary sanctions on nations that import Iranian oil. But his statement risked further escalating tensions with China — Iran's leading customer — at a time when the relationship is severely strained over the U.S. president's tariffs.

Based on tanker tracking data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded in a report published last October that “China took nearly 90% of Iran's crude oil and condensate exports in 2023.” Trump has separately placed 145% tariffs on China as a way to raise federal revenues and rebalance global trade. 

Trump's social media threat came after Oman announced planned nuclear negotiations for this coming weekend had been postponed. Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi made the announcement in a post on the social platform X.

“For logistical reasons we are rescheduling the US Iran meeting provisionally planned for Saturday May 3rd,” he wrote. “New dates will be announced when mutually agreed.”




Al-Busaidi, who has mediated the talks through three rounds so far, did not elaborate. 

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei issued a statement describing the talks as being “postponed at the request of Oman's foreign minister.” He said Iran remain committed to reaching ”a fair and lasting agreement.”

Meanwhile, a person familiar with the U.S. negotiators said America “had never confirmed its participation” in a fourth round of talks in Rome. However, the person said the U.S. expected the talks to occur “in the near future.” The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations. 

Rome will see the Vatican begin its conclave next week to pick a new pope after the death of Pope Francis. Two other rounds of U.S.-Iran talks have been held in Muscat, the capital of Oman. 

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. The negotiations have been led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. 

Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

The U.S. president with his threat on social media would be going after Iran's major economic resource. It produced an average of 2.9 million barrels a day in 2023 of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues an airstrike campaign, called “Operation Rough Rider,” that has been targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels, who long have been backed by Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth early Thursday warned Iran over the rebels. 

“Message to IRAN: We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing,” he wrote. “You know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of — and you were warned. You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing.”

Last Saturday's round of talks, which included experts drilling down into the details of a possible deal, also took place as an explosion rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he's naming Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting national security adviser to replace Mike Waltz, whom he is nominating for United Nations ambassador.

Trump announced the moves shortly after news broke that Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong were departing the administration, just weeks after it was revealed the adviser had added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.

Other news we're following:



During a contentious exchange about deportations in his interview with ABC News' Terry Moran this week, President Donald Trump brought up — from his perspective — how Moran had gotten into the White House in the first place.

“They're giving you the break of a lifetime, you know,” Trump said in Tuesday's prime-time broadcast. “You're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's OK.”

Emphasizing again that it was his choice that Moran was there, the president scolded, “You're not being very nice.”

From an ethics perspective, it's considered a breach for a news organization to let a newsmaker dictate who will conduct an interview. In the real world of competitive journalism, things aren't always so simple.

Hey, Parsley. Thanks for writing in. AP's Paul Wiseman, Annie D'Innocenzio and Christopher Rugaber wrote about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy as American businesses are starting to cancel their shipments from China. Here's some of their reporting to help answer your question:

American businesses are cancelling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down to see what trade policy surprises President Donald Trump plans to spring on them next.

The president's massive and unpredictable taxes on imports seem likely to mean emptier shelves and higher prices for American shoppers, perhaps within weeks.

And the higher costs and paralyzing uncertainty could exact an economic toll: U.S. consumers are in the biggest funk since COVID-19 hit five years ago, and economists say recession risks are climbing.

In the next few weeks, “you could start seeing shortages ... it's likely to be concentrated in categories where the U.S. is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and there aren't a lot of alternatives and certainly quick alternatives,” said Judah Levine, research director at the global freight-booking platform Freightos. Among them: furniture, baby products and plastic goods, including toys.

Jay Foreman, CEO of toymaker Basic Fun, says “consumers will find Basic Fun toys in stores for a month or two but very quickly we will be out of stock and stock product will disappear from store shelves.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed on Thursday that the signing of a minerals deal with the U.S. was the result of negotiation that led to a “truly equal agreement.” During his nightly address he said there were no debts to be paid from past U.S. aid to Kyiv, per the signed agreement.



The Office of Management and Budget expects to roll out the federal budget Friday, according to an OMB spokesperson.

It's expected to be the initial version of the coming year's requested spending plan, a so-called skinny budget, of top-line figures with details still to come.

Capitol Hill is bracing for proposed steep cuts that are likely to reflect Trump's Department of Government Efficiency zeroing out various programs.

But it's just a proposal. Federal budgets are often referred to as a statement of a president's values, as Congress, under its constitutional power, compiles the annual spending bills.

It comes as Congress is already deep into drafting Trump's big bill of tax breaks and other spending cuts.

The two sides offered only bare-bone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund, but it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine's valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.

Trump's decision to shift Waltz to represent the U.S. at the United Nations has received approval from America's closest ally: Israel. 

Danny Danon, the Israeli Ambassador to the UN, congratulated Waltz on the nomination Thursday, saying the former Green Beret is a “true friend of the State of Israel and of the Jewish people.”

Israel has become isolated at the international body since the start of its war in Gaza in October 2023. The U.S. has remained one of a few allies for the country as other nations, including the other permanent members of the Security Council — China, Russia, the U.K. and France — have criticized its handling of the deadly war with Hamas and recent monthslong blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

“Our alliance is stronger than ever — especially in the face of the hypocrisy and moral decay that characterizes several UN institutions,” Danon said in a statement. “I am confident that we will work together to forge a clear path rooted in security, justice and accountability.”

The State Department announced Thursday that Julie Davis, a 30-year veteran of the foreign service, would be the charge d'affaires at the Kyiv embassy “during this critical moment as we move toward a peace agreement to stop the bloodshed.”

Davis is currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Cyprus.

The appointment came just a day after the U.S. and Ukraine signed an agreement on critical minerals and other resources which could pave the way for additional U.S. military support for Ukraine.

Davis, who has also previously served as ambassador to Belarus and deputy ambassador to NATO, replaces Bridget Brink at the helm of the Kyiv embassy. Brink announced she was leaving the post last month as the Trump administration pushed ahead with plans for Russia-Ukraine peace talks that many believed favored Moscow.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce was told by reporters that Trump named her boss, Rubio, as acting national security adviser.

Trump said on social media Thursday that he was nominating outgoing national security adviser Mike Waltz as United Nations ambassador.

“It is clear that I just heard this from you,” Bruce said.

She added that Trump and Rubio work well together and have gotten to know each other well.

“I have to admit these last hundred days, it's like hanging on to a freaking bullet train. I mean, it is. It is a fast dynamic,” Bruce said.

Trump announced the moves on Thursday after news broke that Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong were departing the administration.

The announcement just weeks after it was revealed that Waltz added a journalist to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans. Rubio will also continue to serve as secretary of state.

The president's threat comes after planned talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program were postponed.

Trump wrote on social media Thursday that “All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” 

He said any country or person who buys those products from Iran will not be able to do business with the U.S.

The threat came after Oman announced that talks scheduled for this coming weekend have been postponed.

Hey, Hallie. Thanks for your question.

Yesterday, a federal judge again ruled that the Trump administration needs to provide information about its efforts so far, if any, to comply with her order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. from El Salvador. Trump, meanwhile, insists that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which is why his administration won't retrieve him.

Last week, the same judge castigated the administration for ignoring court orders, obstructing the legal process and acting in “bad faith.” 

AP reporter Rebecca Boone wrote about this. Here's some of her reporting:

It's not the first time the Trump administration has faced a scathing order from a federal judge over its approach to deportation cases.

A three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia “should be shocking.” That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador in a different legal case.

Democrats and legal scholars say President Donald Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis in part by ignoring court rulings, while the White House has said it's the judges who are the problem.

The department argues in filings Wednesday that the states' lawsuits alleging harms that play a role in climate change would infringe on the federal government's authority.

The federal lawsuits raise questions over states' abilities to take climate action without federal opposition.

In court filings, the DOJ said the federal Clean Air Act “creates a comprehensive program for regulating air pollution in the United States and “displaces” the ability of States to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders.”

When burned, fossil fuels release emissions such as carbon dioxide that warm the planet.

The president signed an executive order creating the panel during a White House Rose Garden ceremony to recognize the National Day of Prayer.

Its members include Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, former U.S. housing secretary Ben Carson and TV talk-show host Phil McGraw. The commission was Patrick's idea, Trump said.

Patrick told Trump, “There has never been a president who has invoked the name of Jesus more than you.”

McGraw said Trump is a “man of deep faith … who wants this country to have a heart and have religion.”

The meeting Tuesday was the first known Trump administration contact with Syrian officials since the fall of President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December.

The new Syrian authorities arrived in the U.S. last week to attend a series of meetings in Washington and New York as part of an effort to urge relief from harsh sanctions that were imposed by America and its allies after Assad's brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that spiraled into a civil war.

In a statement released Wednesday, the State Department said while they do not discuss “private diplomatic conversations,” they continue to urge the interim authorities to “choose policies that will reinforce stability” for Syrians, “assure peace with Syria's neighbors,” while developing the war-torn country's economy.

“Any future normalization of relations or lifting of sanctions will depend on the interim authorities' actions and positive response to the specific confidence building measures we have communicated,” the State Department said.

Addressing a National Day of Prayer Event in the White House Rose Garden, Trump vowed: “We're bringing back religion in our country” and doing so “quickly and strongly.”

The president used the occasion to again promise that tax-cut legislation would work its way through Congress.

Trump noted that he was addressing “a religious ceremony” but, added that, to him, “That's part of the religion because, if your taxes go up” than some people “might give up your religion.”

“You might have no choice. You'll be working too hard to try and make it,” he said if taxes rise.

A Pentagon report released Thursday says there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023.

It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.

Defense officials say that while the decline is a good sign, the numbers of reported assaults are still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.

U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. is the first judge to rule that the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used against people whom the Republican administration claims are gang members invading the United States.

“Neither the Court nor the parties question that the Executive Branch can direct the detention and removal of aliens who engage in criminal activity in the United States,” Rodriguez wrote Thursday. But, he said, “the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.”

In March, Trump issued a proclamation claiming the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the U.S. He said he had special powers to deport immigrants, identified by his administration as gang members, without the usual court proceedings.

The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, most recently during World War II, when it was cited to intern Japanese-Americans.

The proclamation triggered a flurry of litigation as the administration tried to ship migrants it claimed were gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Rodriguez's ruling is significant because it is the first formal permanent injunction against the administration using the AEA and contends the president is misusing the law.

For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.

More than 20 of the agency's roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.

Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.

The reversals are the latest example of the haphazard approach to cuts at the agency, which have shrunk FDA's staff by an estimated 20%. In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration.

That's according to two people familiar with the matter, which marks the first major staff shakeup of President Trump's second term.

Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.

A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda.

Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, is also expected to depart, according to the people. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel move not yet made public. The National Security Council did not respond do a request for comment.

“It was a good conversation,” Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing. “Even though there wasn't a specific agreement, the important thing is that we're working on it.”

Sheinbaum, who said she and Trump spoke for 10 to 15 minutes Thursday morning, noted that the Trump administration had relaxed some of the tariffs on automobiles and auto parts this week, but said Mexico is still looking for a better deal for the automotive sector, as well as for steel and aluminum which face their own U.S. tariffs.

The U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit with Mexico, she said, noting that Mexico was working to find ways to help them do that.

The leaders agreed that their cabinet secretaries would continue negotiating.

“It is a good sign that we continue advancing,” she said.

French union leaders condemned the “Trumpization” of world politics, while in Italy, May Day protesters paraded a puppet of the American president through the streets of Turin.

Across continents, hundreds of thousands turned out for Thursday's rallies marking International Workers' Day, many united in anger over President Trump's agenda — from aggressive tariffs stoking fears of global economic turmoil to immigration crackdowns.

In the United States, organizers framed this year's protests as a pushback against what they called a sweeping assault on labor protections, diversity initiatives and federal employees.

In Germany, union leaders warned that extended workdays and rising anti-immigrant sentiment were dismantling labor protections. In Bern, Switzerland, thousands marched behind banners denouncing fascism and war — part of a wider backlash against the global surge of hard-right politics.

President Trump will travel to heavily Republican Alabama on Thursday to speak to graduating students at the University of Alabama, where he's expected to draw some protesters despite enjoying a deep well of support in the state.

Trump's evening remarks in Tuscaloosa will be the Republican president's first address to graduates in his second term and will come as he's been celebrating the first 100 days of his administration.

The White House did not offer any details about Trump's planned message.

Alabama, where Trump won a commanding 64% of the vote in 2024, is where he's staged a number of his trademark large rallies over the past decade. It also is where Trump showed early signs of strength in his first presidential campaign when he began filling stadiums for his rallies.

Administration officials say they're seeking a permanent home at the State Department for a memorial honoring fallen staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The memorial bears the names of 99 USAID and other foreign assistance workers killed in the line of duty around the world.

The Trump administration has dismantled USAID and terminated most of its programs and staff, accusing its humanitarian and development work of being wasteful and out of line with Trump's agenda. Past presidents since John F. Kennedy argued that working for a more stable and prosperous world benefited U.S. security.

The State Department says workers removed the memorial from the former USAID headquarters Wednesday. It's being held in a temporary location, the agency said.

Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller says former Vice President Kamala Harris' criticism of Trump are a “great reminder to the American people of just how blessed we all are that the leader sitting in the Oval Office today is President Donald Trump and not President Kamala Harris.”

“It would have been the end of America,” Miller said at a briefing with reporters at the White House on Thursday.

Harris said in a speech Wednesday night that Trump's tariffs are “clearly inviting a recession.”

Miller countered that, “The only things Americans want to hear from Kamala Harris is an apology” for less strict immigration policies and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said was “unforgivable.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “I think I speak for everyone at the White House, we encourage Kamala Harris to continue going out and do speaking engagements.”

The planned negotiations between Iran and the United States this weekend over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program have been postponed, Oman announced Thursday.

A message online from Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi made the announcement in a post on the social media platform X.

“For logistical reasons we are rescheduling the US Iran meeting provisionally planned for Saturday May 3rd,” he wrote. “New dates will be announced when mutually agreed.”

Al-Busaidi did not elaborate. Iran and the U.S. did not immediately acknowledge al-Busaidi's comments.

The talks Saturday were to be held in Rome.

A top White House official is defending Trump's acknowledgement that steep tariffs on China might lead to fewer goods on the shelves at higher prices.

Trump said children maybe “will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”

Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller insisted Thursday that the president was “making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with.”

In a briefing with reporters, Miller said dolls made in the U.S. had higher quality standards than ones from China that he said could contain lead paint.

“Yes, you'd probably be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,” Miller said.

China's state broadcaster has claimed in a social media post that the Trump administration has been seeking contact with Beijing through multiple channels to start negotiations over tariffs.

In a climbdown, the post by China Central Television says there's no need for China to talk with the U.S. before the U.S. takes any substantive act but also said “there is no harm” for contact.

“China needs to observe or even force out the true intent on the U.S. side to stay proactive in the talks,” reads the post.

Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said she also understands “it's getting close” for talks between the two sides but such talks will be at the working level, not yet between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

There's trouble as House Republicans race to build Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, especially over its trillions in costs and potential Medicaid changes.

Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, tax writing committee chairman Rep. Jason Smith and the chairman handling health programs, Brett Guthrie, are meeting with Trump.

Trump's administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia.

The Health and Human Services report questions standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and is likely to be used to bolster the government's abrupt shift in how to care for a subset of the population that has become a political lightning rod.

This new “best practices” report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19.

“Our duty is to protect our nation's children — not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. “We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.”

After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a deal that's expected to give Washington access to the country's critical minerals and other natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia.

According to Ukrainian officials, the version of the deal signed Wednesday is far more beneficial to Ukraine than previous versions, which they said reduced Kyiv to a junior partner and gave Washington unprecedented rights to the country's resources.

The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.

It doesn't include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new investments. Ukrainian officials have also noted that it doesn't refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits from the fund will likely not go toward the paying the U.S. back for its previous support.

To understand the Justice Department's struggles in representing President Trump's positions in court, look no further than a succession of losses last week that dealt a setback to the administration's agenda.

In orders spanning different courthouses, judges blocked a White House plan to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, ruled the Republican administration violated a settlement agreement by deporting a man to El Salvador and halted directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

That's on top of arguments in which two judges expressed misgivings to a Justice Department lawyer about the legality of Trump executive orders targeting major law firms and a department lawyer's accidental filing of an internal memo in court questioning the Trump administration's legal strategy to kill Manhattan's congestion toll — a blunder the Transportation Department called “legal malpractice.”

Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.

The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day — mostly from China — is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.

But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.

The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the U.S., fueling a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech Wednesday to sharply criticize President Donald Trump. She criticized the Republican president's handling of the economy, U.S. institutions and foreign policy.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech to sharply criticize Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor.

In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said Wednesday she's inspired by Americans fighting Trump's agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood.

Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November.

In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair.

Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar” and a “great candidate,” and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign.

Senate Republicans narrowly voted down a Democratic resolution Wednesday that would have blocked global tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month, giving the president a modest win as lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of his trade agenda.

The 49-49 vote came weeks after the Senate approved a resolution that would have thwarted Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada. That measure passed 51-48 with the votes of four Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky. But McConnell — who has been sharply critical of the tariffs but had not said how he would vote — and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were absent Wednesday, denying Democrats the votes for passage.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on President Trump withdrawing her bid for the U.N. ambassadorship, Columbia University's interim president resigning and Iran signaling openness to 'indirect' nuclear talks.

President Donald Trump tapped former national security advisor Mike Waltz for his administration's ambassador to the United Nations after Waltz was ousted from the National Security Council office earlier Thursday. 

""I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,"" Trump posted to Truth Social on Thursday. 

""From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Waltz posted to X shortly after Trump's announcement that he was ""deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.""

Trump added in his post that Rubio will simultaneously serve as his interim national security advisor after Waltz left the role on Thursday. In 1973, then-President Richard Nixon made a similar move when he named national security advisor Henry Kissinger to also serve as secretary of state, State Department records show. 

Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from their office on Thursday in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. Trump's announcement on naming Waltz as U.N. ambassador unfolded just hours after the news began circulating. 

The former national security advisor had been at the heart of the Signal chat leak debacle that unfolded in March, when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine was inadvertently added to a group chat with high-profile Trump officials such as Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Speculation had mounted for weeks that Waltz would be removed from his position amid the fallout of the chat leak, though the administration has maintained that no classified material was shared in the group chat and that the president had confidence in his National Security Council team.

Ahead of Trump tapping Waltz for the new administration role, a handful of names had been floated for U.N. ambassador after Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., withdrew her nomination in March, including David Friedman, former U.S. ambassador to Israel; Ellie Cohanim, former deputy special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism at the State Department under the first Trump administration; and special presidential envoy Richard Grenell. Grenell said he was a ""hard no"" on serving in the U.N. ambassador role ahead of Trump's announcement. 

Trump announced Stefanik as his original choice for the role in November 2024, just days after his successful election against former Vice President Kamala Harris. The New York congresswoman, however, pulled her nomination last month as concerns mounted in Trump's orbit that the GOP's slim majority in the House would grow smaller in her absence. 

TRUMP URGED TO REVIEW UN IMMUNITY, LAX VISA RULES AMID NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS

Concerns grew ahead of two special House elections in Florida on April 2, which ultimately saw both Republicans victorious, but with significantly slimmer margins than their GOP predecessors in their previous elections. 

Stefank told Fox News' Sean Hannity in March that she bowed out of the confirmation process to serve as U.N. ambassador due to both the GOP's margin in the House combined with the need for her to help combat Democratic ""corruption"" in her home state of New York.

""It was a combination of the New York corruption that we're seeing under Kathy Hochul, special elections and the House margin,"" Stefanik said on ""Hannity"" in March. ""I've been in the House. It's tough to count these votes every day. And we are going to continue to defy the political prognosticators and deliver, deliver victory on behalf of President Trump and, importantly, the voters across this country.""

""The president knows that. He and I had multiple conversations today, and we are committed to delivering results on behalf of the American people. And as always, I'm committed to delivering results on behalf of my constituents,"" she added.

Mike Waltz is out as the national security advisor, along with his deputy. Chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on the ousting and what's likely to come.

National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from their office Thursday, in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. 

Fox News confirmed Thursday morning that Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, were ousted following a Signal chat leak debacle that unfolded in March, when the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine was inadvertently added to a group chat with high-profile Trump officials such as Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Speculation had mounted for weeks that Waltz would be removed from his position amid the fallout of the chat leak, though the administration has maintained that no classified material was shared in the group chat and that the president had confidence in his National Security Council team. 

Just hours after news broke that Waltz would no longer serve in the National Security Council office, Trump announced on Truth Social that he nominated Waltz to serve as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., adding that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as the interim national security advisor. Similarly, then-President Richard Nixon in 1973 named then-national security advisor Henry Kissinger to simultaneously serve as secretary of state. 

Following the executive office shakeup, Fox News Digital took a look at who President Donald Trump could select to permanently fill the national security advisor role.

Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who has been a top U.S. negotiator with Russia amid its war against Ukraine, could be tapped for the open national security advisor position. 

Witkoff is a former real estate tycoon and longtime ally of Trump's whose focus under the Trump administration has been on negotiating with Russia for a peace deal in Ukraine, and negotiating with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Witkoff was notably credited with helping secure the reality of U.S. school teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison in February. 

Witkoff traveled to Moscow on April 25 as the White House reportedly extended its final offer to Russia as it continues waging a war against Ukraine that has raged since February 2022.

""Ambassador Witkoff is in Russia to meet with President Putin as part of President Trump's efforts to make peace,"" an official with knowledge of the talks and visit told Fox News Digital at the end of April. 

""It's long past time for the death and destruction to stop, to move past the failed strategies of the past and for an end to this devastating conflict,"" the official added, without commenting on the ""substance of negotiations.""

The war has continued, with the U.S. making strides with Ukraine, however, Wednesday, as Trump works to secure a peace deal. Ukraine signed a deal with the U.S., allowing America access to the country's rare minerals as it continues to hash out a peace agreement.

Trump could potentially tap Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany and former acting director of national intelligence under the first Trump administration, to take the national security role.

The former ambassador currently serves as the president of the Kennedy Center, the national cultural center of the U.S., under the second Trump administration.

Grenell's name has been floated for other high-profile roles under the second Trump administration, such as a potential replacement for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations after Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik withdrew her name in March to retain her seat in the House. Grenell, however, said he was a ""hard no"" on serving in the U.N. ambassador role.

The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.

FIRST ON FOX – President Donald Trump's former national security advisor is sounding the alarm about the Justice Department's proposal to break up Google's illegal monopoly on online search, saying in a letter to White House leaders that the government's proposal is overly broad and poses ""drastic"" and far-reaching national security risks. 

In a letter to the White House National Security Council, obtained by Fox News Digital, Trump's former national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, argued that the Biden-era DOJ framework is in ""direct conflict"" with Trump's policy priorities, and risks hobbling U.S. competition with China in a high-stakes race to develop new and advanced technology. 

The U.S., he said, ""now finds itself in a literal ‘technology race' – as significant and critical to our nation's strength, and the Trump Administration's objectives, as the ‘arms race' of the past century,"" O'Brien said.

""To prevail, the U.S. must maintain and expand its global leadership in key technologies."" 

TRUMP WAGERS US ECONOMY IN HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBLE AT 100-DAY MARK

The letter was sent to White House national security advisor Mike Waltz before he was ousted from his role Thursday along with his deputy, Alex Wong, in the wake of the Signal controversy earlier this year. It was not immediately clear who Trump planned to install as his replacement. A copy was also sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 

News of the letter, first reported by Fox News Digital, comes as lawyers for the Justice Department and Google continue to spar in federal court over how far Google should go to break up what a judge ruled last year to be its illegal monopoly on online search.

O'Brien in his letter said the plans proposed by the Biden-era DOJ would cripple Google's ability to compete or innovate on the global stage – undermining U.S. leadership on cutting-edge technologies, such as AI and quantum computing, in its race against China, and presenting grave new economic and national security risks. 

DOJ's Antitrust Division is ""aggressively pursuing the misguided policies of the prior Biden Administration and its European-like approach to crippling our nation's largest and most robust technology companies,"" O'Brien said.  ""By ignoring their enormous value to our country's strength, the Antitrust Division is seeking, through draconian remedies, to import European-style regulatory restrictions and prohibitions at home here in the Google Search case.""

He also urged the Trump-led Department of Justice to review the framework to restructure Google's search engine and amend it in a way that would still allow the company to compete.

""Splitting Google into smaller companies and forfeiting its intellectual property would weaken U.S. competitiveness against the giant, state-backed Chinese tech companies, since, separated entities would lack the enormous resources needed,"" O'Brien said.

""Experts in multiple fields critical to national security confirm these basic principles and loudly address the concern that handcuffing our high-tech powerhouses would undermine U.S. leadership and superiority in these key technologies, and risk ceding the world's technology leadership to China,"" he said.

The letter comes as Google and the Justice Department continue to spar in federal court in a so-called ""remedies hearing"" to break up what U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled last summer was Google's illegal monopoly in the online search engine space.

The two sides presented the court with starkly different plans for how they believe Google should go about resolving its monopoly – the first successful antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. against a major tech company since U.S. v. Microsoft in 2001. 

Justice Department lawyers said Google should be required to sell off its Chrome browser, share years of its consumer data with competitors, and potentially sell Android, Google's smartphone operating system.

Their proposed framework also includes requirements that Google be required to disclose its consumer data and search information with other companies, including rivals located outside the U.S., for the next 10 years. 

They told the court these steps could also stop Google from obtaining a monopoly in the AI space – acknowledging that technology is going to evolve, and therefore remedies must ""include the ability to evolve alongside it as well.""

Google has proposed a much narrower remedies plan, including options for shorter contracts with browser companies, like Apple and Mozilla; new contracts with Android, and other important steps they said would make the landscape more competitive. 

Google officials argue DOJ's proposal goes ""miles beyond"" the relief that was ordered by Judge Amit Mehta in August, and warned that the government's proposed framework would stifle competition, fail to regulate anticompetitive conduct, and hobble Google's ability to attract new investments or innovate in key areas like AI and quantum computing.

JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA

Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified in court Wednesday that DOJ's proposal, if adopted, would result in a ""de facto divestiture"" of Google's search engine that would allow companies to reverse-engineer ""any part"" of its tech stack, which he noted is the result of decades of investment and innovation.

If that happened, he said, it could all but kill the nearly $2 trillion company by giving its IP away to its competitors.

""It's not clear to me how to fund all the innovation we do,"" he said, ""if we were to give all of it away at marginal cost.""

O'Brien serves as the co-founder and partner emeritus of Larson LLP, a firm that has represented Google as special outside counsel in unrelated matters, though O'Brien himself has not been involved in any of those cases.

The Justice Department did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the letter from O'Brien, or whether the Trump-led DOJ had plans to amend its proposed framework in the Google remedies case.

Congressional Republicans are set to introduce legislation on Thursday aimed at giving consumers a tax-free haven for their savings interest.

The Universal Savings Account Act, sponsored by Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) in the House and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the Senate, is designed to encourage taxpayers to save by simplifying the “complex rules and restrictions” in current law.

“Washington shouldn't be in the business of micromanaging how people use their own money,” Harshbarger said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “This bill is a win for working families, a win for personal freedom, and a win for financial independence.”

Under a universal savings account, the holder would not have to pay taxes on the income earned from interest, giving consumers more flexibility for unexpected costs on housing, healthcare, and more.

Anyone 18 or older who is a citizen or permanent resident can open an account with an initial contribution limit of $10,000 in after-tax income; the limit then increases by $500 each year until it reaches $25,000.

The initial maximum for couples filing jointly is $20,000. Anyone, regardless of income, can open and contribute to an account up to the limit each year, allowing them to avoid double taxation.

The current tax code includes several types of savings accounts that receive only one layer of taxation, many of which are limited to “government-approved” purposes. 

“A simple and accessible incentive savings plan will provide families with a way to establish financial security and prosperity,” Cruz said in a statement. “This bill provides a straightforward solution to those challenges. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this bill for the future generations of Americans.”

DEMOCRATS SEE THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT INTRODUCED AGAINST TRUMP AS AN UPHILL BATTLE

Harshbarger previously introduced similar legislation last Congress that had six other Republican co-sponsors, but it was not given a floor vote. This version of the bill allows taxpayers to open custodial USAs for children. The last bill also had income phases-outs for eligibility, while this version has no income limitations.

The legislation allows the money to be invested in bonds and equities, with tax-free withdrawals at any time. The accounts are similar to a Roth IRA but allow money to be withdrawn for any reason, not just retirement. Similar legislation passed the House in 2018 but did not make it to the Senate. 

Those who oppose creating tax-advantaged savings accounts argue they disproportionately help high-income earners who have the means to invest and that workers who spend most of their income on basic needs will not benefit from the reform.

A federal judge in Texas found on Thursday that President Donald Trump did not meet the necessary criteria to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members, dealing a blow to the administration as it attempts to remove criminal illegal immigrants from the country quickly.

Judge Fernando Rodriguez, a Trump appointee, said in an order that Trump could still deport Venezuelan migrants detained in southern Texas using other, more routine authorities. However, Rodriguez said the Alien Enemies Act, a powerful wartime law, was not an option.

“The historical record renders clear that the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms,” Rodriguez said.

The Trump administration has argued that the courts lack the authority to weigh in on the president's decision to use the Alien Enemies Act, but Rodriguez disagreed.

The judge said Trump did not provide evidence that Tren de Aragua was invading the United States at the behest of the Venezuelan government, which is a necessary condition to meet under the Alien Enemies Act.

“Allowing the President to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope,” Rodriguez said.

The decision stemmed from a lawsuit brought by three Venezuelan nationals represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, who said they were wrongly accused by the U.S. government of being members of Tren de Aragua and that they were at risk of imminent deportation to a foreign prison under the statute.

The lawsuit is one of several that have cropped up across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last month that federal authorities must give “reasonable” notice to migrants ahead of deporting them under the Alien Enemies Act so that they have a chance to protest their deportations in court.

Art Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner that the ruling was surprising given the historic amount of deference courts have given administrations when an invasion or threat exists, dating back to at least World War II.

“Most American press outlets don't really understand Tren de Aragua, or they put it in the same bucket as MS-13,” Arthur said, noting the ways the gang has taken strongholds in parts of countries such as Colombia, Chile, and Brazil.

Later, in a separate lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas over the same matter, the high court ordered the Trump administration in a 7-2 decision to halt its use of the wartime law for anyone detained in that district. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.

The Trump administration is likely to appeal Rodriguez's decision, which would then send it up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which Arthur said could be inclined to reverse the judge's decision.

“They'll take a more objective look at the case law and the limits of their own authority; they don't want to be overturned by the Supreme Court either,” Arthur added.

Rodriguez also delivered another victory to the Venezuelan migrants. He agreed to class certification for all potential deportees in the Southern District of Texas, avoiding a situation in which each migrant would have to file their own petition to fight their removal.

Arthur and other legal experts have said it is highly unlikely that these plaintiffs could justify turning this case into a class action.

SUPREME COURT BLOCKS TRUMP FROM DEPORTING NATIONALS UNDER ALIEN ENEMIES ACT

“You can't do class actions,” Arthur said. “Not everybody in that class is exactly the same … there should be individual cases.”

The Department of Justice could file an appeal to Rodriguez's decision. A DOJ spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Even without Signalgate, the president wasn't likely to keep his national security adviser around long. 

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

For weeks, Washington has been waiting to see how long National Security Adviser Michael Waltz could hold on. The answer, we now know, was 101 days.

Multiple outlets reported this morning that Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, would be leaving the Trump administration. His firing comes roughly seven weeks after he added The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal chat in which top administration officials discussed a strike on Yemen before and after it took place. In legal and security terms, the mortal sin was conducting official business in an unsecured and unpreserved forum; in political terms, it was including Goldberg. Trump acknowledged last week in an interview with Goldberg, and my colleagues Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, that the scandal was “a very big story” and that his administration had learned “Maybe don't use Signal, okay?” Trump reportedly hesitated to fire Waltz because he didn't want to give the media a “scalp” or acknowledge that he cared, but his resolve apparently weakened.

Any other national security adviser would have been deservedly fired after the leak, but even without Signalgate, it's hard to imagine that Waltz would have survived very long. (He did, at least, outlast the first national security adviser of Trump's first term, Michael Flynn, who didn't reach the one-month mark.) Waltz was one of the more respected and expert hands on Trump's team, and that would have doomed him sooner or later.

Waltz's demise was foretold shortly after Signalgate, when the 9/11–conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who holds no government role, persuaded Trump to fire several NSC staffers whom she believed were insufficiently loyal. Implicit in her critique and Trump's acquiescence was a belief that Waltz wasn't really on the team, either. Waltz is a right-winger and a convert to Trumpism, but he is not a blind loyalist. He won four Bronze Stars while serving in U.S. Special Forces. He worked at the Pentagon during the George W. Bush administration, and was elected to four terms in Congress. As national security adviser, he tried to bring his expertise to the service of the president.

The problem is that Waltz was trying to serve two masters. As I wrote in January, Trump doesn't care about national security. He's not against it, or actively trying to undermine it; he's just not interested. He's not interested in hearing reasoned advice, developed through a careful process, as the National Security Council has done—especially if this advice contradicts his impulses or ideology. On an issue like the strikes on Houthis in Yemen, where Trump has fewer interests to balance, problems don't tend to arise. But on marquee issues that Trump can't ignore, and where tough trade-offs and complicated strategy enter the picture—such as with Ukraine or China—someone has to start giving him news he doesn't like.

Trump doesn't want expertise. He started his presidency by sweeping out dozens of career officials whom his team viewed as Democrats in disguise or creatures of the establishment. Since then, the ground has continued to shift. My colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker reported recently that as Waltz's control of the NSC slipped away, the real powers on the council were the longtime Trump adviser Stephen Miller and Trump's Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff. These two represent very different models: the ideologue and the old pal, respectively. Miller treats the NSC “not as a forum to weigh policy options,” Stanley-Becker wrote, “but as a platform to advance his own hard-line immigration agenda.” The handy thing about ideology is that it effaces all the hard choices that a pragmatic approach to the world requires. Witkoff, meanwhile, seems to have neither an ideology nor any expertise that might interfere with his fidelity to Trump. Though he lacks diplomatic experience, he has been friends with Trump for years, and the president has sent him ricocheting around the globe—with little to show for it so far.

Trump's allergy to expertise also helps explain why Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appears to be on more solid footing than Waltz despite worse scandals: He, too, was involved in Signalgate. Though Hegseth was not the one who added Goldberg to the chat, Hegseth did share detailed attack plans in it. He also shared sensitive information with his wife and others who had no need for it, installed an insecure line into the Pentagon, and can't manage to keep his staff from turning over. (“I think he's gonna get it together,” Trump told my colleagues in an interview last week. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.”) Waltz's ouster might be an ominous sign, however, for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a traditional Republican and Trump critic turned vassal who holds another delicate foreign-policy job.

Now Waltz joins a list of discarded Trump national security advisers, alongside Flynn, H. R. McMaster, and John Bolton. That unhappy fraternity is only likely to grow. Every administration official serves at the pleasure of the president, and nothing incurs this president's displeasure faster than trying to get him to care about national security.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Pro-natalists want America having more babies — but only one of their proposals helps actual children.

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

The pronatalists have entered the White House.

Last week, news broke that the Trump administration was considering a variety of policies to get Americans to have more kids, inspired by figures like Elon Musk (who has 14 known kids) and activists Simone and Malcolm Collins (who have four but want as many as 10). Those suggestions, which included a $5,000 baby bonus and a “National Medal of Motherhood” uncomfortably reminiscent of Nazi Germany, triggered immediate backlash. Many wondered how any of them would actually help parents, at a time when $5,000 only covers a few months of child care in some places.

Today, however, I want to look at pronatalist policies through a slightly different lens: whether they benefit kids. People who want to boost birth rates generally talk about the importance of children to society as a whole: We need more kids, they often say, to pay into Social Security and take care of us when we're old. But what about the kids themselves? Are pronatalist policies, and pronatalism in general, in their best interest?

In some cases, these questions can be easily answered with data. In others, they're more about values. Is a world with more kids inherently better for kids? Is championing childbirth the best way to show kids that they're valued? The answers to these questions are complex, but the experts I spoke to were clear about one thing: If the United States aims to be a pro-child country, we have a long way to go.

Of all the pronatalist policies reportedly under consideration, one is straightforwardly good for kids, experts told me. That would be the one where the government gives parents money.

Five thousand dollars may not pay for day care — and it may not substantially boost birth rates — but it could be enough to allow a parent to stay home for a few more weeks with a new baby, said Karen Guzzo, a family demographer and director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That extra leave would benefit baby and parents alike, research suggests.

The money could also help defray the costs of a birth (often expensive even with insurance) and of necessities like car seats and strollers (which could be about to go up in price). If it helps keep families solvent during a time of financial upheaval, a baby bonus could benefit children in the long run, since financial stability is good for kids' health and learning. “I'm all for giving families money,” Guzzo said.

In fact, a similar policy already had impressive results. During the Biden administration, the American Rescue Plan expanded the child tax credit from a maximum of $2,000 to between $3,000 and $3,600 per child per year, and made it fully available to poor families. As a result, child poverty dropped to the lowest level on record, and the number of kids going hungry appeared to decrease as well.

However, the expanded child tax credit lapsed at the end of 2021, and child poverty immediately spiked again. Republicans are reportedly interested in bringing the expanded credit back, but the path for any legislation remains unclear. For now, “it is frustrating to hear that we are thinking of giving one-time bonuses when we already had a plan that worked” to reduce child poverty, “and we got rid of that,” Guzzo said.

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

Other policies reportedly under consideration, like giving a medal to moms with more than six children or reserving a certain percentage of Fulbright scholarships for married people or parents, are unlikely to do much of anything for kids or birth rates, according to Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who studies demographic trends. 

But more broadly, it's worth thinking about whether the pronatalist project in general — producing more births — is good for children.

Some observers argue that certain countries with low birth rates have become actively anti-child. In South Korea, for example, hundreds of restaurants, museums, and other public spaces bar children from entering. These “no-kids zones” make life difficult for parents, who have begun to campaign against them, but they arguably limit kids' opportunities to enjoy and learn about the world as well.

“We don't fund school systems, we don't fund child care, we do not fund leave programs. We are so not pro-family in the United States.”

If pronatalism led to more children and therefore more tolerance of children in public space, or even to child-friendly urban design, it could benefit kids. For example, child-centric neighborhoods where kids were able to “flow out their doors” and form “their own little society” would be both fun for kids and beneficial for them as adults by potentially making them more self-sufficient and able to advocate for themselves, Trent MacNamara, a history professor at Texas A&M University who has written about fertility rates, told me. 

Some experts worry about the decline of autonomy and free play among children today, and for MacNamara, it's possible to imagine that having more children around could bring some of that freedom back. “Maybe if you do build a more child-centered society, it's easier for parents to think of kids as running their own show,” he said. 

There are also intangibles to think about — the joys (and trials) of growing up with a lot of siblings, or a lot of cousins, or as part of a big generation. Having a lot of kids around helps both adults and other children get in touch with “their wilder side” and “let go a little bit,” MacNamara said.

However, because pronatalism often goes hand in hand with patriarchal values, it's not necessarily great for the roughly half of children who happen to be girls, Cohen noted.

It's also not completely clear that a world with more births is always a better one for kids. Around the world, “the decline of fertility has been a key part of rising living standards” for kids and adults alike, Cohen said. Fewer kids can mean more resources per kid — for example, falling birth rates in the US are one reason that state and local governments have been able to expand publicly supported preschool. 

Birth rates falling below a certain point could be bad for kids — if, for example, their schools close. But when it comes to policy, the most pro-child ideas aren't necessarily the ones advocates typically bring up to increase birth rates. Kids need food, housing, health care, and education, and they need “the confidence that those things will be there for them in the future, and that their families will be there for them in the future,” Cohen said. 

Policies that would bring stability to parents and kids include robust paid leave, access to health care before and after birth, and subsidized high-quality child care, Guzzo told me. Some pronatalists have pushed for such supports, but right now, they feel out of reach in many parts of the country.

​​“We don't fund school systems, we don't fund child care, we do not fund leave programs,” Guzzo said. “We are so not pro-family in the United States.”

Three children who are US citizens were sent to Honduras last week along with their mothers, who were deported. One is a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer who was removed from the country without his medication, advocates say.

Cuts to the federal government have had a profound effect on programs serving kids, affecting everything from education to safe drinking water.

“Chicken jockey” is a thing now, I guess.

My little kid and I have been reading Nothing's Wrong! a picture book about an anxious rabbit and the bear friend who makes him feel better. My kid refers to this only as “the cool book,” for reasons that remain unclear.

Last week, my story about mental health days for kids reached Sean, a reader who is a high school student in California, when he was, in fact, taking a mental health day. 

“There is a freedom in knowing that when I take on things outside of school to boost my college resume, I can also alleviate some of the pressure that school puts on me,” he wrote. “Yesterday, the thought of going to school made me feel zombified and my usual motivation had melted away, but by the time Monday rolls around, I expect to feel at least somewhat motivated to go.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta's advertisers didn't flinch after it shook up content moderation","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-earnings-advertisers-fact-checking-content-moderation-2025-5","Thu, 01 May 2025 11:10:00 GMT","

Meta's content-moderation mishaps used to be the talk of Madison Avenue, when advertisers would lambast the tech giant over its so-called brand safety concerns.

But it's a new era, and advertisers are spending through it.

The company's first-quarter revenue, which is almost entirely derived from advertising, reached $42 billion in the quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations and up 16% year over year.

In January, Meta said it was replacing third-party fact-checkers with an X-inspired community notes system on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. The company said it also planned to bring back more political content to users' timelines and was easing content moderation rules around topics like gender identity and immigration.

Advertisers and industry analysts told BI in January that while the changes made them feel uneasy, they'd likely continue to spend with Meta as long as it delivered the large audiences and ad performance they've come to expect from the platform.

Meta's bumper earnings, released Wednesday, confirmed the theory.

On the earnings call, Meta's execs credited the momentum of its AI-powered suite of ad tools, Advantage Plus. These tools automate many aspects of creating an ad campaign, from identifying the types of users to target to creating the images in the ads themselves.

Susan Lee, Meta's chief financial officer, said there had been some spending reductions from Asia-based e-commerce advertisers targeting US users, likely in anticipation of President Donald Trump ending the de minimis tax loophole on May 2. The exemption had allowed the likes of Temu and Shein — huge Meta advertisers — to ship orders under $800 from China without paying duty fees.

Meta said its ad business would remain strong, pushing aside fears of a tariff-induced advertising slowdown. It's expecting to post revenue of between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion next quarter, ahead of the $44 billion analysts had anticipated.

Nick Manning, a former ad agency exec and founder of the marketing consultancy Encyclomedia International, told BI that major advertisers still have deep concerns about user safety and the type of content that gets published on major tech platforms. 

Part of Meta's resilience, he said, is that it's less reliant on blue-chip companies and more on the millions of small and medium-sized businesses that advertise across its sites and apps. Indeed, the company said Wednesday that online commerce companies were the largest contributors to its ad sales growth in the quarter.

""Meta, for certain kinds of advertisers, still delivers the goods — and those advertisers aren't really bothered about user safety and brand safety,"" Manning said.

Meta said in January that it continued to be focused on ensuring brand safety and suitability by offering a range of tools for advertisers.

While it faces the same macroeconomic uncertainty as many other businesses, Meta is doing so from a position of strength.

""Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty,"" said Minda Smiley, a senior analyst at the research firm EMARKETER, a BI sister company.

Just take a look at the contrasting fortunes of Snap. Its shares plummeted Tuesday after it reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that were in line with expectations but said it wouldn't share guidance for the second quarter, blaming the macroeconomic uncertainty.

He thinks so, but only if they're up.","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-stock-market-biden-tariffs-selloff-sp500-correction-bear-market-2025-4","Thu, 01 May 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Donald Trump has used the stock market as a scorecard in the past, so it might make sense to look at a chart of the S&P 500 year-to-date and wonder if the president thinks his performance could be better. 

Judging by Trump's own words on Wednesday, that's not the case. 

Following his 100th day in office, data showed the US economy contracted last quarter for the first time in three years. Stocks reacted negatively, but the president said the market still belonged to former President Joe Biden, redirecting blame for the 6% decline in the S&P 500 this year.

""This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th,"" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Wednesday.

""Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other,"" he added.

For those following along since his first term, it was a familiar sight. The president has often taken credit for stock gains—even during times he was not in the White House — and blamed others for losses.

In March, shortly after returning to the White House and as the market tumbled from all-time highs reached in February, he suggested that investors shouldn't be watching stocks, though he referred to the market's gains during his first term as an ""amazing achievement."" 

""You can't really watch the stock market,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News in early March after tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China were first unveiled. ""If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters.""

The comments shifting blame are the opposite of what Trump has claimed relatively recently. He has put the success of the stock market front and center as his doing.

The day before his inauguration, Trump said that the rise in stock prices was the ""Trump effect.""

""Everyone is calling it the — I don't want to say this, it's too braggadocious, but we'll say it anyway — the Trump effect. It's you. You're the effect,"" Trump said at a rally in Washington. ""Since the election, the stock market has surged, and small-business optimism has soared a record 41 points to a 39-year high. Bitcoin has shattered one record high after another.""

That's plausible, as markets had initially priced in a big boost to growth and economic activity. However, expectations were recalibrated once he took office, as it became clear that the trade war would be more aggressive than anyone predicted. 

However, Trump has even taken credit when he wasn't anywhere near the levers of power in Washington, DC. 

""THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET,"" Trump wrote in a January 2024 Truth Social post. ""BECAUSE MY POLLS AGAINST BIDEN ARE SO GOOD THAT INVESTORS ARE PROJECTING THAT I WILL WIN, AND THAT WILL DRIVE THE MARKET UP.""

Perhaps the best example of the president's eagerness to take credit for the market's good fortune came in 2020, when Trump sent Fox News host Lou Dobbs an autographed chart of the Dow Jones Industrial average, which shot up 2,000 points in a single day after he declared COVID-19 an emergency.

While Trump has historically highlighted the stock market to showcase his achievements as president, his team has suggested this time around that he's got his eye on a different scorecard: the 10-year US Treasury yield.

The key bond yield is a reflection of long-term interest rates in the economy. That ties into the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs for Americans, which was a central point in his campaign for president last year.

The US and Ukraine struck a major deal granting American companies privileged access to key natural resources in Ukraine — including aluminum, graphite, oil, and natural gas — that could boost the tech and automotive sectors.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent signed the deal in Washington, DC, on Wednesday.

""This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,"" the Treasury Department said in a press release. ""President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides' commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.""

The Treasury Department added that the economic partnership positions Ukraine and the US to ""work collaboratively and invest together"" to ensure that ""our mutual assets, talents, and capabilities can accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery.""

On social media, Svyrydenko wrote: ""Together with the United States we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment into our country.""

Bessent later said in a video statement that the deal would help ""unlock Ukraine's growth assets.""

The agreement comes at a time of rising supply-chain uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare earth metals are sourced from.

On April 4, China restricted exports of seven rare earth elements and related materials in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially affecting critical industries like defense, energy, and automobiles.

Ukraine possesses a rich array of natural resources that are of growing importance to the US. Graphite, lithium, and titanium are vital for EV battery production, solar panels, and military equipment. High-purity neon gas and rare earth metals are critical for semiconductor manufacturing to power the growth of AI systems.

The minerals deal was originally set to be signed on February 28, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington ended in acrimony.

The agreement was signed just days after Trump and Zelenskyy met in person on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, as cease-fire talks between Moscow and Washington continue. Trump on Wednesday called their face-to-face meeting a ""moment of solace in a sense"" in an interview with ABC News.

The White House and the  Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comments.

Traffic moves along Interstate 80 in Emeryville, California.

Republicans moved a step closer Thursday to repealing a federal waiver allowing California to ban gasoline-powered cars by 2035, a policy that had drawn opposition from automakers, fuel producers and President Donald Trump himself. 

The US House voted 246-164 to roll back an Environmental Protection Agency authorization issued under former President Joe Biden, which let California enact emissions standards even stricter than the US government's requirements to increase sales of electric and other zero-emission vehicles. Thirty-five Democrats joined with Republicans to vote in favor of the measure. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Mercedes-Benz Group AG plans to move production of another vehicle to the US as President Donald Trump's tariffs raise costs and threaten to make imported cars uncompetitive.

The German automaker said in a statement that it will shift assembly of a “core segment vehicle” to its factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, by 2027. Though Mercedes didn't specify which model, its most popular import in that category is the GLC sport utility vehicle, which sold 64,163 units in the US last year.

Defamation, piracy, Tesla's CEO search, Worldcoin and a Ponzi.

“Everything is securities fraud” is a big theme around here, and I have mused in the past about how large language models might be securities fraud. One possibility is: You go to a chatbot, you type in “is XYZ a good company,” and the chatbot hallucinates an answer like “yes they just discovered a cure for cancer” or “no they are doing huge fraud.” You buy or sell the stock, relying on the chatbot's answer, but it's totally false and the stock moves in the wrong direction. You sue the chatbot's maker for securities fraud.

There are various practical problems with that hypothetical lawsuit: Was it fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of a security? Was the chatbot's maker profiting from the alleged fraud? Were you reasonable in relying on the chatbot's output, despite a bunch of disclaimers attached to it?","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will nominate Mike Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, confirming earlier reports that Waltz was being ousted as national security advisor.

Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as interim national security advisor until that post is filled.

The announcement came hours after multiple news reports that Walz would leave that role amid continued controversy over his creation of a Signal messaging app chat thread that was used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reveal U.S. military plans to other Trump administration officials.

The editor of The Atlantic magazine had been inadvertently added to the chat thread by Waltz.

The president had previously nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for the U.N. ambassador slot. 

But Trump withdrew Stefanik's nomination in late March, citing the very slim majority that Republicans hold in the House of Representatives.

""I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday.

""From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,"" Trump wrote.

""In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Waltz, in a tweet replying to Trump's post, wrote, ""I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.""

Waltz, 51, previously served in the House, representing a Florida district. Earlier, he served in the U.S. Army as a Special Forces officer.

State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce was asked at a briefing Thursday how long Rubio would stay in the interim role as national security advisor.

'It is clear that I just heard this from you,"" Bruce told the reporter who asked that question.

In February, Trump appointed Rubio as acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Rubio is also the acting archivist of the United States.

Henry Kissinger, who served as President Richard Nixon's national security advisor, retained that position after Nixon appointed him secretary of state in 1973.

 Kissinger retained both jobs under Nixon's successor, President Gerald Ford, until Ford installed Brent Scowcroft as national security advisor in November 1975.

Reddit reported first-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on sales and guidance.

Shares of the social media company rose more than 16% in after-hours trading.

Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:

Reddit said its second-quarter sales should come in the range of $410 million to $430 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $396 million. Reddit provided the guidance and touched on the on-going trade dispute between the U.S. and China in a letter to investors, saying it is ""well-positioned to meet this moment.""

""Ever-shifting macro environments like these create both challenges and opportunities,"" Reddit CEO Steve Huffman wrote. ""We've grown through challenging times before — people need connection and information just as much in uncertain times.""

Revenue during Reddit's first quarter rose 61% year over year. Net income, meanwhile, was $26.2 million compared to a year ago when Reddit recorded a net loss of $575.1 million due to costs associated with its March 2024 initial public offering.

The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, jumped 31% year over year to 108.1 million in the first quarter. Analysts were expecting 107.3 million.

Reddit has been a big beneficiary from Google search changes and internal site improvements, which has led to an influx of new and returning users, which it refers to as logged-out users. The social media firm has focused on site updates and features intended to convince logged-out users to create accounts and become logged-in users, which are more valuable to advertisers.

The company's first-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 23% year over year to 48.7 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 38% to 59.4 million.

In February, Reddit said that a Google search algorithm change temporarily impacted the company's user growth during the fourth quarter. Search-driven traffic soon recovered in the first quarter, the company said at the time.

Reddit isn't the only company to weigh in on macroeconomic challenges.

Meta shares rose Thursday after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom. However, the company's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region came in at $8.22 billion for the first quarter, which was lower than analysts estimates of $8.42 billion.

Susan Li, Meta's finance chief, said that ""Asia-based e-commerce exporters"" have reduced their digital ad spending likely due to the de minimis trade loophole ending Friday.

Snap reported its latest earnings on Tuesday and said it ""experienced headwinds to start the current quarter,"" and declined to provide guidance because of macroeconomic uncertainties.

Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings last week, and said that Google Advertising sales jumped 8.5% year over year to $66.89 billion while YouTube ad sales rose 10% to $8.93 billion.

Pinterest reports earnings on May 8.

President Donald Trump said Thursday any country or person that buys oil or petrochemicals from Iran will not be allowed to do any business with the U.S.

U.S. crude oil futures rose $1.03, or 1.77%, to close at $59.24 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent gained $1.07, or 1.75%, to settle at $62.13. Iran is one of the biggest oil producers in OPEC.

""Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions,"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. ""They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form.""

Trump has implemented what he calls a ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran since taking office, which aims to completely shut down the Islamic Republic's oil exports. The president has accused Iran of using oil revenue to finance militant groups throughout the Middle East.

Trump also initiated negotiations with Iran last month over its nuclear program. His administration believes Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, an allegation that Tehran has denied. The president has said he would prefer to reach a deal with Iran. During his first term, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement negotiated with Iran by President Barack Obama.

Trump's comments are clearly directed at China, which is importing more than 1 million barrels per day from Iran, said Scott Modell, CEO of consulting firm Rapidan Energy. Modell said U.S. sanctions are unlikely to have an impact on Iranian oil flowing to China unless the White House targets Beijing's state-owned enterprises and infrastructure.

The president's statements ""don't signify a change in the administration's drive to reach a new deal with Iran but rather underscore Trump's belief in negotiating through strength,"" Modell, a former CIA officer, told CNBC.

Trump last month imposed what he calls ""secondary tariffs"" on any country that buys oil from Venezuela, another OPEC member.

National security advisor Mike Waltz is leaving his post in the Trump administration on the heels of controversy over his creation of a Signal messaging app group that was used to discuss U.S. military plans in March.

President Donald Trump confirmed Waltz's departure in a social media post hours after media outlets reported that the advisor was being ousted.

Trump said he would nominate Waltz as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as interim national security advisor until the post could be filled.

Deputy national security advisor Alex Wong is also expected to leave his job, according to three sources who spoke to NBC News about the two exits on Thursday.

Waltz was conspicuously absent from a Rose Garden event at the White House marking the National Day of Prayer on Thursday. Many other senior Trump administration officials were in attendance.

The Signal group that Waltz created inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of messages exchanged between high-level Trump administration officials.

The group's other members were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Goldberg reported that the texts ended with Hegseth on March 15 detailing plans that ""included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing"" of attacks on Houthi forces in Yemen, which were launched within hours of those texts.

Waltz, 51,  is the first major official to leave the White House since the beginning of Trump's second term in January.

Trump earlier this week told The Atlantic that Waltz's job was secure.

In a discussion with Atlantic reporters, Trump was asked if he believed that Hegseth would remain as Pentagon chief. 

Hegseth has been criticized for his disclosure of the attack plans on the group that included Goldberg, and for his separate use of the app to send some information about the planned strikes on Houthi forces to his wife, his brother, his attorney and some aides.

""Yeah, he's safe,"" Trump said of Hegseth.

Asked if Hegseth would stay in the administration longer than Waltz, Trump replied, ""Waltz is fine. I mean, he's here. He just left this office. He's fine. He was beat up also.""

The Pentagon's internal watchdog is investigating Hegseth for his use of Signal to discuss pending military strikes.

The probe by the Office of Inspector General will determine if Hegseth and other Defense Department staff complied with rules over the ""use of a commercial messaging application for official business,"" the office said last month.

Hegseth and others in the Trump administration have downplayed the controversy, saying no classified information was shared on the Signal chats.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday that he believed Waltz should be dismissed from his post.

""Look, they should fire him, but they're firing the wrong guy,"" Schumer said. ""They should be firing Hegseth.""

Trump's first national security advisor, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, resigned under fire in early 2017 after just 24 days for having misled then-Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition.

In late 2017, Flynn agreed to plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

Trump pardoned Flynn in late 2020, months before leaving office.

Correction: John Ratcliffe is director of the CIA. An earlier version misstated his name.

In this article

Kohl's said on Thursday it had fired CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation found he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, after little more than 100 days in the CEO job.

Buchanan engaged in transactions with this person's company on ""highly unusual terms"", Kohl's said in a filing, and also caused the company to agree to a multi-million-dollar consulting agreement with a team that included this person he was involved with. He also did not disclose the relationship, the company said.

Buchanan's firing makes the third change at the helm in as many years for the beleaguered department-store retailer, which has been struggling with several quarters of sagging sales due to stiff competition from e-commerce firms and big-box retailers such as Walmart, as well as its own strategic missteps.

Kohl's shares rose 8.4% on Thursday, as it reported better-than-expected preliminary first-quarter earnings, but the stock is still down roughly 70% over the last year.

Buchanan was not immediately available for comment when contacted on LinkedIn, while Kohl's declined to provide further comment.

Buchanan was named CEO in November, replacing Tom Kingsbury. After he took over as CEO in January, Kohl's cut about 10% of its corporate workforce to improve profitability.

""(Kohl's) desperately needs stability and changes in its business model. However, it's better to make the move to fire Buchanan rather than let the situation get worse,"" Morningstar Research analyst David Swartz said.

Buchanan is forfeiting all stock awards he received, including $15 million in restricted stock that was meant to vest over three years as long as he was still employed with the company. He also has to reimburse the company for $2.5 million of his $3.75 million signing bonus.

Buchanan joined Kohl's from Michaels Companies, a specialty retailer of arts and crafts supplies, where he was CEO since 2020. He was also the chief merchandising and chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. e-Commerce prior to that.

Kohl's expects first-quarter comparable sales to fall between 4% and 4.3%, compared with analysts' average expectation of a 6.34% decrease, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company expects a loss per share in the range of 20 cents to 24 cents, compared with estimates for a loss of 52 cents per share.

Kohl's will report first-quarter results on May 29.

Buchanan's removal does not affect Kohl's financial reporting or other employees, the company said. It named Michael Bender as its interim CEO, effective immediately, and said that the search for a permanent chief executive would begin soon.

In this article

Meta Platforms shares jumped more than 4% Thursday after the company topped earnings expectations and showed advertising resilience in a murky macroeconomic environment.

""Key here is that Meta's adv. demand trends appear to be relatively healthy and while we're watching for any impacts from macro and lower spend from China-based advertisers given the de minimis change, Meta's scale of users and advertisers + focus on newer products are offsetting some macro challenges,"" wrote Citi's Ronald Josey.

First-quarter revenues grew 16% from a year ago to $42.31 billion and topped a $41.10 billion estimate from LSEG. Earnings came in at $6.43 per share, versus the expectation of $5.28 per share. Net income reached $16.64 billion, jumping 35% from $12.37 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The company also issued in-line guidance for the current period. Meta's finance chief Susan Li said the company expects sales to range between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG had forecast $44.03 billion in revenues.

""Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reassured analysts on an earnings call Wednesday.

Investors this earnings season are watching for signs that President Donald Trump's tariff push is hampering advertising demand, in which many technology businesses make up a sizeable chunk of revenues. Snap and Google have already warned of potential headwinds to their ad businesses.

Advertising revenue for the first quarter came in at $41.39 billion, topping a forecast of $40.44 billion from Wall Street. But Li told analysts that Meta has ""seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters,"" which may stem from the ending of the de minimis trade loophole on Friday.

""The digital ad market is likely to get a bit jittery over coming months, but META's performance orientation and significant AI ad investments should mean continued relative share gains against the field,"" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler.

Meta also upped its capital expenditures range to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in artificial intelligence and a potential uptick in infrastructure hardware costs as trade uncertainty continues.

Bernstein's Mark Shmulik called the hike in spending a ""bold strategy"" against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, but called Meta the ""safest and most exciting dodgeball team around.""

""We continue to believe that Meta is well positioned for a tougher macro environment given its scaled advertiser base, highly performant platform, & vertical agnostic inventory,"" wrote JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth.

Malaysian police have cracked down on yet another illegal Bitcoin mining operation, this time in the Hulu Terengganu and Marang districts in the northeast of the country.

According to local news outlet Malay Mail, the raids on two separate premises led to the seizure of 45 Bitcoin mining machines worth roughly $52,145 (RM225,000), alongside other equipment.

Terengganu police chief Datuk Mohd Khairi Khairuddin estimated that the electricity theft cost Tenaga Nasional—Malaysia's only electricity company—around $8,342 (RM36,000) in monthly losses.

Mohd Khairi said in a statement that the syndicates behind the illegal mining operation are believed to have operated from residential and commercial properties, using electricity from the local grid illegally.

The operation was carried out in collaboration with Tenaga Nasional Berhad's (TNB) Special Engagement Against Losses (SEAL) unit. The police chief said no arrests were made during the crackdown itself, but all the seized items were taken to the appropriate district police headquarters for further investigation.

Bitcoin mining is legal in Malaysia. However, tampering with the grid's electricity connectivity is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $21,500 (RM100,000.)

Illegal Bitcoin mining operations, which siphon energy from the national grids, are a growing problem in East and Southeast Asia.

A 2025 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) highlighted that international criminal groups operating in the region are attracted to Bitcoin mining as it allows them to circumvent anti-money laundering laws compared to more traditional forms of crime. A Bloomberg report from last year indicated that China's decision to ban Bitcoin mining in 2021 may have helped to push this type of illegal activity into Southeast Asia.

This trend has had real-world consequences for Malaysia before. In February of this year, an explosion in the Bandar Puncak Alam city, Malaysia, revealed a nine-rig illegal Bitcoin mining operation.

Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, the country's deputy energy transition and water transformation minister, told Malay Mail in July 2024 that illegal crypto mining has cost the country at least $722 million (RM3.4 billion) in electricity costs between 2018 and 2023.

Neighboring Thailand has also had its fair share of high-profile crypto mining crackdowns, including one involving 1,000 machines earlier this year thought to have stolen $3 million from the nation's grid.

Key Points

Ethereum (ETH 2.31%) is in danger of being overtaken by a $58 billion threat. There isn't much that it can do immediately to mitigate this threat. And it's getting bigger.

Here's what you need to know and how to adapt your investment strategy accordingly.

One of the key metrics used to determine the valuation of any chain's native token is the total value staked on the chain. The more total value staked, the more capital there is that's on the chain and seeking a yield in exchange for keeping those funds locked there for a predetermined period of time. The yield delivered to staked capital is thus another important attribute, as it indicates the relative rewards that investors demand for taking the risk of locking up their funds on a chain when they could be deploying them elsewhere.

As of midday April 29, there was $62 billion in value staked on Ethereum, with an annual reward rate (the annualized interest rate for staking) of close to 3%. Given that Ethereum's market cap is $216 billion, about 29% of the chain's value is tied up to provide a yield via staking.

In contrast, Solana, (SOL 2.18%) despite having a much smaller market cap of $77 billion, has $58 billion in value staked on its chain, and it delivers a yield of 8.3%. For brief periods in late April, its total value staked was even higher than Ethereum's. That's a big problem for Ethereum on multiple fronts, and it won't be going away anytime soon.

Solana is a smaller chain, but investors are parking nearly as much capital there as they are on Ethereum, and getting much higher returns for doing so. That either implies that Ethereum is overvalued right now, or that Solana is undervalued -- or perhaps both. Generally speaking, capital will migrate from one chain to another when it can get better returns for the same amount of risk, and the outflows tend to be faster when one of the assets involved is overvalued. The sum of value staked on Solana is thus likely to grow, and that growth is likely to be siphoned from Ethereum, which would reduce its price significantly.

But the yield gap is just one element of Ethereum's precarious competitive position relative to Solana. The Ethereum chain is also much more expensive and much slower to use than its rival, which is one of the main factors contributing to its underperformance. Plus, during the past three years, Solana's price is up by 51% while Ethereum is down by 38%, which is sure to damp investor sentiment for it quite a bit, even if past performance doesn't predict the coin's future movements.

Ethereum isn't doomed to see its market cap fall further just because Solana's staked value is approaching and perhaps soon to exceed its own, nor because its yield is lower.

The chain's ecosystem is also significant to its valuation, and Ethereum's is the single largest cryptocurrency ecosystem that exists, covering most major segments with an extensive number of projects in each. If the coin's value does go up, it will more likely be a result of the ecosystem's projects performing well than a result of more capital being staked on the chain. Exciting applications simply make for a more compelling pitch to investors than a reliable but small yield; most investors don't hold cryptocurrency with the goal of getting a return that's similar to what's available from far safer financial instruments like U.S. Treasuries -- they're looking for growth.

This is yet another factor supporting the bear thesis for Ethereum right now. There isn't much incentive for investors to lock up their capital for long periods to get a small return that's denominated in coins that have, at least for the past few years, lost a lot of their value. Nor is there much incentive to keep capital parked on the chain in the form of stablecoins when it's cheaper to manage and hold elsewhere, like on Solana.

In short, the staking value situation is a harbinger of more tough times to come for Ethereum. It is therefore also a sign that the crypto is an excessively risky purchase right now, making it unsuitable for most investors. And, in case it wasn't clear, it would not be wise to stake your Ether right now because it could lock you into deep capital losses in exchange for a meager yield.

The round ball enters a new dimension. Forget simple passes and sliding tackles: FIFA has just taken one step further into the metaverse. On April 30th, the global football organization announced the creation of its own blockchain, simply named “FIFA Blockchain.” A decision that, at first glance, seems purely technical. But behind the lines of code, a whole crypto strategy is taking shape, much bolder than it appears.

The choice to detach from Algorand is not just a simple logistical update. It is a break. A friendly separation, to be sure, but a strategic one. Since the launch of FIFA Collect — its official NFT collection — FIFA had made Algorand its digital playground. A playground it now considers too narrow for its Web3 ambitions.

The turn is clear: welcome to an EVM-compatible blockchain (Ethereum Virtual Machine). In other words, FIFA wants more flexibility, better scalability, and, above all, to join an already well-established ecosystem. Through this change, the organization aims to align with the sector's dominant standards, where developers, users… and money are.

The migration will start at the earliest on May 20. A detail that suggests things are well prepared, yet not set in stone.

NFT holders will have nothing to do immediately. Collectibles are expected to follow automatically, unless you decide to remove them before the major switch. Algorand wallets like Pera or Defly? Soon to be archived, as connection will now be via MetaMask and WalletConnect.

Behind this new infrastructure lies a clear intent: to capture the attention of a young, tech-friendly, and global audience.

FIFA doesn't just want to sell digital cards. It wants to build a true crypto ecosystem where fans and players become active participants.

2024 has been the year of announcements. After NFTs, gaming takes center stage with FIFA Rivals, a mobile game co-developed with Mythical Games.

The concept is simple but effective: create your club, compete against other players, all within a 100% blockchain universe. The beta version is expected by May 2025, with a full launch planned for summer. The bet? Attract more than 100 million players. A colossal number, but not unrealistic when you know the weight of the FIFA brand.

This shift to a proprietary blockchain also marks a desire for control. By creating its own network, FIFA no longer depends on a third party. It becomes referee and player. It can dictate the rules of the game, set transaction fees, decide technological partnerships. In short, it becomes a fully-fledged crypto entity.

By opting for an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, FIFA does more than change technology: it chooses a side. That of a decentralized, fluid web, driven by a booming digital economy. No more experimental hesitations: enter a assumed, integrated, offensive crypto strategy.

Crypto ETF issuers may not have to wait much longer to expand beyond spot bitcoin and ether funds.



Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart now see a 75% or greater chance the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a range of spot altcoin ETFs by the end of 2025.



Eight separate spot fund proposals are currently in front of the SEC, including ETFs tied to solana (SOL), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, cardano (ADA), avalanche (AVAX), polkadot (DOT), and hedera (HBAR). Balchunas and Seyffart believe index and basket-style ETFs — which group multiple cryptocurrencies — have the highest odds of approval, pegging those chances at 90%.



The first key deadline comes on July 2, when the SEC must respond to proposals filed by firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex for basked-style funds. Decisions on single-asset ETFs like SOL, DOGE, XRP, and ADA are expected in October, with others following in November and December. These are final deadlines, meaning the SEC — which previously delayed decisions — will be required to issue a final rulings.

Some issuers have submitted intent to launch funds tracking smaller-cap tokens such as SUI, Trump Coin (TRUMP), and Melania Coin (MELANIA), but these have not yet advanced to the formal 19b-4 stage — a requirement filing to trigger an SEC review.



Seyffart noted that SUI's chances could be on par with the other altcoin filings. “I need to dive in a bit more for an official odds number, but I'd assume it would have similar prospects to the other altcoin ETFs,” he said.



The outlook for altcoin ETFs shifted sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, and his appointment of crypto friendly Paul Atkins as SEC chairman. Atkins recently told industry participants that innovation “has been stifled” and the existing regulatory framework “badly needs attention.”

The crypto market is rising, and several altcoins are positioning themselves for big moves. With major partnerships, integrations, and bullish regulatory developments, certain projects are standing out from the crowd. If you're looking for altcoins to stack right now, here are three tokens that deserve a spot on your radar, according to Altcoin Buzz.

XRP (Ripple) is causing a stir after it tried to buy Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, for $5 billion. However, Circle turned down the offer. This move was Ripple's way of trying to take control of the stablecoin market. Ripple is also allegedly meeting with the new SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, which could help solve past legal issues and lead to better times for XRP. The price of XRP is showing signs it might go up soon.

Sui (SUI) is growing fast by adding Stacks and sBTC to its platform. This allows Bitcoin holders to use their Bitcoin in new ways on Sui. Recently, Sui has become more valuable than big projects like Avalanche and Chainlink. 

The team is also preparing for the Sui Base Camp event in Dubai, where they will reveal new projects and partnerships. The co-founder of Sui believes the network could become a multi-trillion-dollar project over the next 8 to 12 years as the crypto world continues to expand.

Hedera (HBAR) has some exciting news. There's an 80% chance that an HBAR ETF will be approved soon. If it happens, it could raise the price of HBAR. Hedera is also working with the Nairobi Stock Exchange to create a digital platform that will turn real-world assets, like real estate and stocks, into digital tokens. Hedera is known for being one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains, which makes it a top choice for tokenizing assets. The price of HBAR is expected to keep rising in the next few weeks.

Metrics details

Smart waste management is vital for reducing environmental impact and improving quality of life in smart cities. This study presents an AI-driven waste classification model that integrates IoT and Blockchain technologies. IoT-connected bins transmit data to a central server, which uses blockchain to ensure secure, transparent data storage. AI algorithms, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), classify waste in real-time, optimizing waste collection and recycling. Blockchain ensures data integrity, while ML and DL models enhance sorting efficiency. The system aims to improve waste management and sustainability through intelligent decision-making and secure data handling. Performance will be assessed using retrieval metrics and visualization tools to evaluate the impact of hybrid ML and DL models on waste detection and classification.

As urban populations continue to grow, the need for smarter and more efficient waste management systems has become increasingly critical1. The integration of IoT and AI offers a transformative solution for creating greener, safer, and more efficient cities2,3,4. This research proposes an innovative, IoT-based smart container system, designed to optimize waste collection processes and reduce environmental and operational inefficiencies.

The smart container is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor that automatically and periodically scans the fill level inside the waste container, providing real-time updates on waste accumulation5. Once the sensor detects that the container has reached a certain fill threshold, it sends an immediate notification to the waste collector, allowing for more responsive and timely waste collection. This real-time data-driven approach minimizes unnecessary collection trips, ensuring that waste collection vehicles only operate when needed, thereby saving fuel, labor, and time.

Furthermore, AI enhances the system by optimizing collection routes in real-time, helping waste collection vehicles to follow the most efficient paths6. This improvement not only speeds up the collection process but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions, preserving the city's landscape, and mitigating health and environmental risks associated with waste accumulation.

One of the key components of the proposed system is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for waste classification. CNNs are a powerful deep learning model specifically designed for image recognition tasks. They are chosen for their ability to efficiently learn patterns from visual data, making them particularly effective for classifying waste materials into categories such as recyclable and non-recyclable. CNNs have been widely used in similar applications due to their high accuracy and ability to generalize from labeled datasets. The choice of CNNs over other AI models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, is based on their superior performance in processing and classifying visual data, which is critical for this waste management system where image-based waste identification is essential. The CNN model also benefits from transfer learning, enabling it to be fine-tuned using pre-trained models, thus reducing the computational load while maintaining high classification accuracy.

CNNs not only improve waste classification accuracy but also contribute significantly to energy optimization in waste management systems. By predicting waste accumulation patterns, optimizing collection routes, and reducing unnecessary vehicle trips, CNN-based models help lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. AI-driven waste collection systems have been shown to reduce fuel usage by up to 30% and decrease carbon emissions by 20% compared to conventional methods. Additionally, lightweight deep learning architectures minimize computational overhead, making real-time waste classification more energy-efficient7,8,9. The integration of AI with IoT-enabled smart bins further enhances sustainability by optimizing sensor operations and reducing energy wastage in data transmission. These improvements align with smart city initiatives, promoting eco-friendly and efficient waste management solutions.

The novelty of this system lies not only in the use of AI for waste classification but also in its integration with IoT and Blockchain technologies. The system incorporates Blockchain to organize and securely store waste-related data into distinct blocks, ensuring data integrity and security. This decentralized structure guarantees that data is tamper-proof, enhancing the reliability of the system. When the waste data needs to be processed, machine learning models can efficiently retrieve the required information from the blockchain, significantly reducing the latency associated with data access and improving processing speed.

In addition to real-time monitoring and AI-based decision-making, this system leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning classifiers for automatic decision-making and optimization. By analyzing collected data and applying sophisticated algorithms, the system can predict optimal collection schedules and routes, adapt to changes, and continuously improve its functionality, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly waste management solution.

In summary, this study introduces a novel waste management system that combines real-time monitoring, smart data processing, secure blockchain technology, and AI-based waste classification, offering significant improvements over existing systems in terms of efficiency, scalability, and security. The key contributions of this study are as follows:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has seen a significant rise in its application across various sectors, one of which is solid waste management10. This integration of AI into the waste management process has been instrumental in enhancing the efficiency of the systems from the initial stages of waste collection to its final disposal, as discussed in research by Kolekar et al.11 and Vitorino et al.12. The adoption of AI technologies in this field primarily addresses the growing challenges associated with the increasing volumes of waste and the inefficiencies tied to traditional manual sorting methods.

In an effort to enforce waste segregation policies more effectively, researchers have been exploring the use of AI for the classification and recycling of waste. This shift towards AI-driven methodologies is seen as an essential response to counter the mounting issues of waste accumulation and the limitations of manual classification systems. A detailed literature review by Abdallah et al.13 identifies several AI models that are commonly used for waste classification, including Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Genetic Algorithms. These models significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of waste sorting, which is a crucial step in the recycling process.

From a commercial perspective, there are primarily three types of AI solutions in the market that cater to waste classification and recycling needs. These include AI-based waste classification software, AI-enhanced waste classification containers, and AI-powered waste sorting machinery. Each product serves a vital role in optimizing the waste management process:

AI-based waste classification software enhances the precision in identifying and categorizing different types of waste materials.

AI-enhanced waste classification containers help in the initial sorting and categorization of waste right at the source, simplifying the first step of the waste management process.

AI-powered waste sorting machinery is utilized in advanced sorting facilities, where it further segregates waste into recyclable and non-recyclable materials, thereby fine-tuning the recycling operations.

These AI advancements not only bolster the effectiveness of waste management practices but also promote environmental sustainability. They contribute to higher recycling rates and reduce dependency on landfills. The ongoing development and integration of AI in waste management are anticipated to bring forth substantial improvements in the sector, enhancing waste handling and resource conservation on a global scale.

Moreover, recent advancements in the field of machine learning, especially through the application of supervised learning techniques and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promising results. A study by Zhao et al. In14 demonstrated that deploying a deep CNN could effectively handle a particularly challenging dataset with high success. The study also revealed that removing even a single convolutional layer from the network could significantly degrade the model's performance, highlighting the importance of each layer in the network's overall architecture. Further comparisons within the study assessed the performance of various machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks. Among these, the CNNs displayed superior accuracy, achieving a remarkable 90% accuracy rate, thus underscoring their potent capability in managing complex data sets more effectively than other popular algorithms.

Building on the effectiveness of CNN, a study by Sandler et al. In15 highlighted the application of a specific CNN architecture known as Xception Net. This model was tested on a Synthetic Aperture Radar Target Recognition Dataset, presenting a multi-class classification challenge. Xception Net was evaluated alongside prominent transfer learning models including VGG16, Resnet152, and Inception V3. The analysis demonstrated that Xception Net surpassed these models in critical performance metrics like Top-1 Accuracy and Top-5 Accuracy, showcasing its superior classification capabilities at various thresholds. The absence of fully connected layers in Xception Net's architecture might contribute to its effectiveness, indicating a potential advantage in complex image recognition tasks.

These results emphasize the progressive capabilities of CNNs and their evolving designs in addressing complex machine learning and image recognition problems, setting new standards for future research and applications. In a later study proposed in16, an advanced system for classifying waste using image processing and CNNs was developed, focusing particularly on identifying different types of plastics, primarily polyethylene. The study covered a wide range of materials, showing the system's extensive application potential.

Similarly, in17, Sreelakshmi and her team introduced an approach using Capsule Neural Networks (Capsule-Net) for solid waste management, effectively distinguishing between plastic and non-plastic materials. This innovation marks a significant advancement in waste management technology. The study achieved high accuracy rates on two publicly available datasets and tested the integration across various hardware platforms.

Additional research in18 by Huiyu, O. G., and Kim S. H. introduced a novel waste classification model using deep learning techniques aimed at recycling applications. In the same vein, Adedeji and Wang19 proposed a deep learning framework that autonomously recognized and classified waste materials, proving effective in identifying recyclables.

Furthermore, Nowakowski and Pamuła20 presented a waste classification method using a pre-trained CNN model, ResNet-50, combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM), achieving 87% accuracy on a public dataset. Misra et al.21 explored a system for identifying and classifying electronic waste using a CNN and a Region-based CNN, obtaining detection and classification accuracy between 90 and 97%.

These studies predominantly focus on the architectural design of waste classification systems using deep learning, without integrating IoT for waste management. Conversely, Samann22 described a significant advancement in automated waste management processes with a smart trash bin equipped with sensors and a real-time monitoring system, though this did not incorporate machine learning. Similarly, Malapur and Pattanshetti23 introduced a cost-effective smart trash bin enhanced with IoT technology, capable of notifying users via SMS when waste levels exceeded set thresholds, incorporating additional features like a PIR motion sensor and audio messages for user interaction.

The author noted that the system operated satisfactorily. In their research24 introduced an economical and efficient waste management approach for smart cities. Similarly, ALFoudery et al.25 developed a Raspberry Pi and infrared sensor-based IoT model to enhance waste collection, with the system manager overseeing the scheduling and routing to maximize efficiency. In another study, Balaji et al.26 created a smart trash bin that could detect fill levels using an infrared sensor, with data sent to an Android app via a Wi-Fi and web server setup. Hong et al.27 also presented a smart trash can utilizing IoT technology and a Raspberry Pi. Additionally, Bai et al.28 implemented an IoT-based smart garbage system to minimize food waste, using mesh technology for effective component management and integrating a router and server to gather and analyze data related to food poisoning, resulting in a 33% reduction in food waste.

Several studies have advocated for IoT-based waste management systems, though none have explored structural designs using deep learning. Muthugala et al.29 introduced a waste collection robot that navigated autonomously and used deep learning to detect waste with 95% accuracy. Spanhol et al.30 proposed a floor cleaning robot that used a fuzzy inference system to optimize area coverage and energy consumption, employing the Weighted Sum Model (WSM) for decision-making based on user-defined preferences.

While the works of29 and30 presented innovative robotic solutions, they did not focus on IoT contributions. Zhu et al.31 discussed the fundamental aspects of blockchain and IoT, reviewing interconnection, interoperability, reliability, and security in daily operations. Reyna et al.32 highlighted the challenges, future prospects, and benefits of integrating blockchain with IoT, proposing a lightweight blockchain framework for IoT devices that significantly reduces overhead and processing time while enhancing security, as shown in research by33. Samaniego et al.34 focused on blockchain as a service within IoT, exploring various case studies and simulations with reported accuracies. Novo35 detailed an architecture for managing roles and permissions in realistic IoT scenarios, proposing a scalable architecture with clear advantages.

A decentralized solution has been presented in36 for solid waste management by integrating blockchain technology with Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). It utilizes advanced ultra-high frequency (UHF) technology and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enable real-time tracking of waste vehicles and detection of waste bins. Geo-fencing techniques are employed to monitor and ensure timely waste collection from designated spots. The application of blockchain enhances the security, reliability, and trustworthiness of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications across IoT devices. Experimental results from a pilot project in Karachi, Pakistan, demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-time tracking, intelligent identification of waste bins, trash weighing, and monitoring waste collection using geo-fencing. The study suggests that blockchain-enabled VANETs could be applied to route management, intelligent transportation, and fleet management systems in the future.

Heidari et al.37 addresses the challenges of rapid urbanization and inadequate solid waste management by proposing a smart waste management system that leverages blockchain technology. The system aims to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts associated with traditional waste management services. By utilizing blockchain and smart contracts, the proposed system enhances transparency, accountability, and efficiency in waste management processes. The study emphasizes the potential of blockchain to revolutionize waste management by providing a secure and transparent framework for waste tracking and disposal.

The IoT architecture of the proposed waste management system is designed to support efficient data collection, processing, and transmission from sensor nodes installed in waste containers. The system integrates various sensor types, each serving a specific function to monitor and optimize waste management operations.

Ultrasonic sensors are employed to measure the fill level of the waste containers. These sensors emit sound waves, and by calculating the time it takes for the waves to reflect back, they determine the distance to the waste, providing an accurate measurement of the container's fill level. Additionally, load sensors are installed at the base of the containers to measure the weight of the accumulated waste. These sensors provide data on the total weight of the waste, enabling the system to monitor the amount of waste collected. Camera modules are also incorporated into the system, capturing images of the waste inside the containers. These images are sent to the system for analysis, where deep learning models, specifically CNNs, classify the waste into recyclable and non-recyclable categories.

The proposed system incorporates a blockchain-based architecture to ensure data integrity, security, and transparency in waste classification and management. This architecture consists of multiple layers, each serving a distinct function. The Application Layer hosts decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, which automate data logging and waste classification verification. The Consensus Layer ensures secure validation of transactions using a consensus mechanism, preventing unauthorized modifications to recorded data. The Network Layer facilitates peer-to-peer communication between IoT-enabled waste bins, cloud servers, and blockchain nodes, enabling real-time data sharing. Finally, the Data Layer is responsible for securely storing waste classification records in an immutable ledger, ensuring traceability and accountability. By leveraging this layered architecture, the system enhances security and operational efficiency while supporting automated, data-driven decision-making in smart waste management (see Fig. 1). Blockchain technology ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof waste management. However, like any distributed system, blockchain is vulnerable to various security threats at different layers. Table 2 summarizes the common attacks on each blockchain layer along with their respective solutions to enhance the security of the proposed system.

Blockchain layer architecture.

To facilitate efficient data transmission, the system uses two primary communication protocols: MQTT and CoAP. MQTT is a lightweight, publish/subscribe protocol that is ideal for real-time communication in low-bandwidth environments. It ensures low-latency data transmission, allowing for timely decision-making. CoAP, on the other hand, is designed for resource-constrained devices and supports simple request/response communication, making it a suitable choice for transmitting data from the various sensor nodes.

Once the data is collected by the sensors, it is processed by a microcontroller and transmitted to a cloud-based platform for further analysis and storage. Both MQTT and CoAP are utilized depending on the sensor's capabilities and the data's specific requirements. The data is then analyzed using AI algorithms to generate optimized waste collection schedules, identify inefficiencies, and trigger automated actions, such as notifying waste collection personnel or adjusting collection routes. Blockchain technology is integrated into the system to ensure the integrity and security of the transmitted data, storing it in a tamper-proof ledger for transparency and accountability.

In response to the growing challenges of waste classification in smart cities, this study proposes an AI-driven waste management framework. The methodology is structured around two primary components: waste classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the architectural design of smart trash bins equipped with real-time data monitoring via the Internet of Things (IoT). This dual approach enhances efficiency in waste management systems.

The first component of the methodology involves the application of CNNs, a deep learning algorithm optimized for image recognition, to classify waste materials. This enables the accurate identification and categorization of waste into recyclable and non-recyclable materials. CNNs are particularly suitable for this task as they can learn and generalize patterns associated with various waste types from labeled image datasets.

Since large-scale waste classification datasets are limited, transfer learning techniques were employed, utilizing pre-trained CNN models that are fine-tuned for this specific application. This approach not only enhances classification accuracy but also reduces computational overhead. To perform the classification, the CNN uses softmax activation for multi-class classification:

where P(yi∣x) is the probability of class iii given input x, zi is the output of the final fully connected layer before softmax, The denominator ensures that all class probabilities sum to 1.

The loss function for classification is cross-entropy:

where yi is the true label (one-hot encoded), \(\hat{y}_{i}\) is the predicted probability for class iii.

The second component of the methodology focuses on the development of smart trash bins. These bins are equipped with IoT-enabled sensors that facilitate real-time waste monitoring and data transmission. The system includes:

Camera Module: Captures images of waste items and transmits them to the microcontroller for processing.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the available space in the bin by detecting waste levels.

Load Sensor: Determines the total weight of waste accumulated over time.

Microcontroller & Servo Motor: Processes CNN classification results and controls the bin's sorting mechanism. Based on classification outputs, the servo motor directs waste to the appropriate bin (digestible or indigestible).

A block diagram of the system architecture illustrates the interaction between these components, ensuring seamless integration of AI and IoT functionalities (see Fig. 2). The collected data is transmitted to a cloud-based platform and accessed via the Blynk application, enabling remote waste monitoring and management.

Block diagram of the proposed mechanism.

The bin's fill level is determined by the ultrasonic sensor using:

where d is the distance to the waste, v is the speed of sound in air (~ 343 m/s), t is the time taken for the signal to return.

The bin's fullness percentage is:

where H is the total height of the bin.

The total accumulated weight of waste is measured using:

where W is the weight of the waste, F is the force exerted on the load sensor, g is the gravitational acceleration (~ 9.81 m/s2).

This study introduces an AI-enabled waste classification management framework encompassing waste collection, sorting, and disposal. AI algorithms continuously analyze waste data, improving classification accuracy and optimizing resource allocation. The framework includes:

Automated Waste Sorting: AI models refine the waste classification process, minimizing manual intervention.

Integration with Smart City Infrastructure: The system enables real-time tracking of waste levels and disposal patterns.

Sustainable Waste Processing: AI enhances recycling strategies by improving material recovery rates and minimizing landfill contributions.

Sorting accuracy improvement using AI can be represented as:

where TP and TN are true positives and true negatives, FP and FN are false positives and false negatives.

AI optimizes waste collection using predictive analytics. A simplified optimization function:

where di is the distance to waste bin i, Wi is the weight of waste at iii.

The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while maximizing collected waste.

The AI-driven system classifies waste into four categories:

Food waste: Requires specialized processing due to decomposition properties.

Hazardous waste: Demands careful handling to prevent contamination.

Residual waste: Often directed to incineration or landfills, but AI-based reclassification reduces waste disposal inefficiencies.

Recyclable waste: Advanced sorting technologies facilitate material recovery, supporting circular economy initiatives.

The efficiency of AI-enhanced recycling is:

where Mr is the mass of successfully recycled materials, Mt is the total recyclable waste input.

Once classified, waste is directed to appropriate treatment facilities, including recycling plants, hazardous waste centers, and municipal sanitation systems. The AI-driven system replaces traditional manual sorting, reducing human error and improving waste management efficiency.

By leveraging AI and IoT, this methodology paves the way for a more sustainable and cost-effective waste management system, aligning with smart city initiatives and environmental sustainability goals. Table 3 summarizes the algorithm of the proposed mechanism.

The simulation section of the study was carried out to assess the performance of the proposed AI-driven waste classification model and its integration with Blockchain technology and optimized waste collection strategies. The system used for simulation was designed to evaluate various aspects of the model, including classification accuracy, processing time, data integrity, waste collection efficiency, and environmental impact. The simulation environment included high-performance computing hardware to run deep learning models, enabling the efficient processing of images for waste classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning. This setup was key to achieving a low latency of 1.2 s per image, ensuring that the waste sorting process was efficient and real-time.

In addition to the waste classification component, the system incorporated Blockchain technology to ensure secure and tamper-proof data management. The Blockchain framework was employed to store and track waste management data on a decentralized ledger, providing data integrity and real-time traceability. The system also included optimized waste collection mechanisms, such as route planning and resource allocation algorithms, aimed at improving collection efficiency and minimizing environmental impact. The results from this simulation were used to compare the performance of the proposed method with the Blockchain-Enabled VANET scheme36 and smart waste management system37 approaches, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the new system.

According to Fig. 3, the proposed AI-driven waste classification model, utilizing a CNN with transfer learning, significantly improves accuracy compared to previous methods. The 202136 and 202237 models relied on traditional machine learning approaches, such as SVM and decision trees, which lacked deep feature extraction capabilities. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and fine-tuning them for waste classification, our approach achieves an accuracy of 95%, outperforming the 88% (2021) and 90% (2022) methods. The higher accuracy ensures that recyclable materials are correctly classified, leading to improved waste sorting efficiency and reduced contamination in recycling streams.

Waste classification accuracy.

Figure 4 depicts the processing time over three different mechanisms. One of the major advantages of our system is its lower latency (1.2 s per image) compared to 2.5 s (2021) and 1.8 s (2022). The 2021 model used traditional feature extraction techniques, which required additional processing time. The 2022 method incorporated deep learning but lacked optimization for real-time execution. Our methodology optimizes CNN inference using lightweight architectures and edge computing, reducing computational overhead and making real-time classification feasible. This low latency is essential for practical deployment in smart bins, allowing waste to be sorted instantaneously without significant delays.

Environment impact.

Figure 8 showcases the precision performance of the proposed AI-driven waste classification system, achieving a high precision of 93%, surpassing the 2021 (85%) and 2022 (89%) methods. Precision, which measures the proportion of correctly identified recyclable items among all predicted recyclables, is crucial for minimizing contamination in recycling streams. The improvement in precision can be attributed to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning, allowing the system to capture complex waste patterns and reduce false positives. This enhancement ensures that only actual recyclable materials are classified, improving the efficiency and quality of waste sorting and contributing to more sustainable waste management.

Precision.

Figure 9 illustrates the recall metric of the proposed AI-driven waste classification system in comparison to the 2021 and 2022 methods. Recall is a crucial performance metric that measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all relevant instances, specifically the proportion of actual positive instances (True Positives) that are correctly detected by the model (True Positives + False Negatives). In the context of waste management, a higher recall ensures that most recyclable materials are accurately identified and categorized, minimizing the risk of recyclable items being discarded as waste. The proposed method achieves a recall of 91%, surpassing the 2021 method (78%) and the 2022 method (83%). This improvement is primarily due to the fine-tuning of pre-trained deep learning models through transfer learning, which allows the system to better recognize and classify a wider range of waste materials, reducing the number of false negatives. This enhancement in recall plays a vital role in ensuring that recycling systems are more efficient and reliable, ultimately contributing to the reduction of contamination in recycling streams and supporting the goals of sustainable waste management in smart cities.

Recall.

Figure 10 presents the F1-score performance of the proposed AI-driven waste classification system, achieving a significant improvement over the 2021 (0.89) and 2022 (0.92) methods with an F1-score of 0.94. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's ability to correctly classify recyclable waste while minimizing both false positives and false negatives. The improvement in the F1-score can be attributed to the optimized CNN model, which leverages transfer learning to enhance both precision and recall. A higher F1-score indicates that the proposed system not only accurately classifies recyclable materials but also reduces misclassification, leading to more reliable waste sorting and better overall waste management efficiency.

F1-score.

Figure 11 presents the latency comparison among three systems: the proposed method, the 2021 Method, and the 2022 Method. Latency, defined as the time delay between data input and system response, is a critical factor in real-time waste management. The proposed method achieves the lowest latency at 1.2 s per image, compared to 2.5 s for the 2021 model and 1.8 s for the 2022 model. This improvement is primarily due to the use of lightweight deep learning architectures and the integration of edge computing, which allows for faster data processing closer to the data source. Despite the high classification accuracy of 95%, the proposed method successfully balances accuracy and speed, maintaining real-time processing capabilities essential for smart city waste management operations. However, it is important to note that as model complexity increases (e.g., deeper CNNs or hybrid DL models), processing speed may be impacted if not optimized, highlighting the need for efficient model design and hardware acceleration.

Latency.

Figure 12 illustrates the computational complexity analysis of the proposed AI-driven waste management system compared to the 2021 and 2022 methods. The proposed system demonstrates higher computational complexity, primarily due to the integration of deep learning models, real-time processing requirements, and the addition of blockchain technology. The use of advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning increases the depth and number of parameters in the model, enhancing classification accuracy to 95% but also requiring greater computational resources. Additionally, the system performs real-time waste classification and monitoring, which demands high-performance processing to maintain a low latency of 1.2 s per image. The incorporation of blockchain, utilizing a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, introduces further processing overhead to ensure secure, decentralized data management. Despite these complexities, the system balances trade-offs between accuracy, processing speed, and efficiency through optimized CNN architectures, edge computing, and lightweight blockchain protocols. As a result, while the computational complexity is higher in the proposed framework, it is justified by significant improvements in accuracy, data integrity, and operational efficiency, making the system well-suited for real-time smart waste management applications. Table 4 presents a detailed comparison of classification accuracy, processing time, blockchain security, waste collection efficiency, CO2 reduction, and other critical performance metrics.

Computaional complexity.

IoT-based waste management systems typically follow a layered architecture to ensure seamless operation and efficiency2. The perception layer involves sensors and smart trash bins that collect real-time data on waste levels, types, and fill status. The network layer is responsible for transmitting this data through various communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or LoRaWAN, ensuring efficient and reliable data transfer to cloud platforms or local processing units. The edge computing layer processes this data closer to the source, reducing latency and optimizing decision-making for real-time waste sorting. Finally, the application layer analyzes thedata to provide actionable insights, including waste classification and optimization of collection schedules. The proposed AI-driven waste management framework enhances this IoT infrastructure by incorporating CNN for waste classification and IoT-enabled smart bins for seamless integration of real-time monitoring and sorting, addressing key challenges in waste management and contributing to the overall sustainability of smart cities.

MNASNet is another effecient CNN model optimized for mobile and embedded devices, leveraging neural architecture search (NAS) to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional CNNs, which may require significant computational resources, MNASNet reduces power consumption and latency, making it ideal for real-time mobile applications. However, for this study, we selected a traditional CNN because of its proven robustness, versatility, and ability to handle large datasets with high accuracy. CNNs have a long track record in various domains, providing reliable and consistent results, which is crucial for achieving optimal performance in our specific application. The use of CNNs for waste classification shows a substantial leap in accuracy over traditional machine learning methods. By employing transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models, we achieved a classification accuracy of 95%, outperforming the 88% accuracy of the 2021 method and the 90% of the 2022 model. This improvement can be attributed to the deep feature extraction capabilities of CNNs, which allow for more nuanced and accurate categorization of waste types, especially when dealing with complex materials. This level of precision ensures that recyclable materials are properly identified, reducing contamination and enhancing the overall recycling process. As a result, the AI-driven waste classification not only increases the effectiveness of waste sorting but also supports sustainable recycling efforts by diverting more materials from landfills.

In terms of processing time, the proposed system outperforms its predecessors by reducing the latency to just 1.2 s per image, a notable improvement over the 2.5 s of the 2021 model and 1.8 s of the 2022 method. This reduction is essential for practical implementation in real-time waste sorting, where delays in waste categorization could hinder the effectiveness of smart bins. The optimization of CNN inference through lightweight architectures and edge computing makes real-time processing feasible, ensuring that waste sorting can occur without significant delays and enhancing the system's responsiveness in dynamic environments.

The integration of blockchain technology further strengthens the proposed system by ensuring secure, tamper-proof data management. With a data integrity score of 98%, the proposed method offers a significant improvement over the 85% data integrity of the 2021 method and the 90% of the 2022 model. Blockchain's decentralized ledger system.

enhances the security and authenticity of waste management data, offering traceability and reducing the risk of data manipulation or breaches. This is particularly important in waste management contracts and audits, where accurate and reliable data is crucial for monitoring compliance and optimizing operational efficiency. The improvements in cryptographic mechanisms and consensus algorithms in our framework contribute to the higher data integrity score, ensuring more robust and trustworthy waste management operations.

In terms of efficiency, the proposed system achieves a waste collection efficiency of 92%, surpassing the 80% of the 2021 method and the 85% of the 2022 model.

The system's ability to predict optimal collection schedules based on real-time data and AI algorithms allows for more efficient waste collection, reducing unnecessary trips and optimizing fleet management. The higher efficiency also suggests that the AI system is able to better prioritize waste collection in areas where bins are nearing full capacity, minimizing the risk of overflows and improving overall service quality.

Finally, the proposed methodology demonstrates a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, with a 30% reduction compared to 15% and 20% reductions in the 2021 and 2022 methods, respectively. This is a direct result of improved operational efficiency, including optimized routing and reduced fuel consumption. By reducing the number of unnecessary waste collection trips, the proposed system minimizes the carbon footprint associated with waste management operations, contributing to the environmental sustainability goals of smart cities.

Practical considerations for handling children's data in financial services

On 1 April 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) published its review on the use of children's data in the financial services sector, highlighting good practices, risks to data protection compliance and areas needing improvement. This review followed the ICO's engagement with various organisations within the sector. 

This article summarises some of the key findings from the ICO's report and provides practical tips for financial services organisations to consider.

Children were identified by the ICO as a vulnerable group within its ICO25 strategic plan. The protection of children's data is therefore a current priority for the ICO (and an area where we are likely to see more regulatory scrutiny in the future).

Children are also important customers for financial institutions, as they represent their future customer base. Children's products are therefore a key area of development and focus for many organisations. However, the ICO's review highlights the complexities faced by organisations from a compliance perspective when processing children's data. 

We identified the following key themes from the ICO's recent review:

(a) Lack of governance for ongoing compliance

It is evident from the ICO's findings that many organisations treat compliance as a one-time exercise. In particular:

Organisations should ensure that they incorporate appropriate touchpoints in their product lifecycle for younger customers and assess appropriate intervals at which to seek refreshed consent (directly from the child) and remind children of their right to withdraw consent. 

(b) Challenges with transparency 

Whilst half of organisations reported having age-appropriate privacy information, the ICO found that (in reality) the number was lower. Several organisations were also found to pass their transparency responsibilities onto parents, which increased the risk that children are recorded as having agreed to terms and conditions and privacy information that they do not understand. 

To improve transparency for children, organisations should:

Unfortunately, it isn't the case that organisations can simply amend their general customer privacy notice to make it more child-friendly. Organisations should also ensure that only relevant information is provided to children– this will likely involve creating supplementary notices and a product roadmap to understand when information on processing activities will become relevant.

(c) Assessing a child's competence 

Children have the same data protection rights as adults under the UK GDPR. However, 88% of organisations lack processes to assess a child's understanding of these rights (the child's so-called ‘competency'). 

It is important to note that there isn't a “one size fits all” approach to assessing competency. Whilst setting an age limit could be a useful factor, the ICO is clear that this cannot be used to prevent children accessing their information rights unless there is good reason to think they are not competent. This means that organisations should focus on the nature of the request, rather than relying on a fixed age limit. 

(d) Marketing  

8% of participants provided marketing communications to children. However, whilst there is nothing in the UK GDPR that prohibits profiling or marketing to children, children's data merits specific protection. Organisations should therefore undertake a DPIA to evaluate risk and consider their practices in this area (including ensuring that children understand how their data is used for marketing/profiling).

It is clear from the ICO's review that there are some significant improvements for organisations to make in order to comply with the UK GDPR in this area. However, there is also a real opportunity for financial institutions to differentiate themselves in the sector and to empower the data protection rights of children. 

The ICO's review highlights that there are some challenges and complexities in this area and organisations in the financial services sector should review their current practices and processes in light of the ICO's review. TLT's Data Privacy and Cybersecurity team are extremely well-placed to support you with this review and any next steps - if you would like to talk to us in more detail, please do get in touch.

The crypto market remains in prolonged consolidation with the overall market cap approaching $3 trillion as analysts eye a possible bitcoin (BTC) breakout that could push the market higher.

Bitcoin hovered near $95,00 on Thursday, while ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB and Solana's SOL remained stagnant. XRP and Cardano's ADA dropped 2%, while dogecoin (DOGE) fell 3%.

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) lost $56 million on Wednesday, breaking an eight-day streak that saw nearly $3 billion flow into these U.S.-listed products.

Markets have been generally range-bound in the past week, setting the course for what could be an explosive move higher, some say.

“Such long consolidations usually accumulate strength for further movement. The next major trigger is likely to be Friday's labour market data,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. 

“For the past five days, the market has fluctuated in a very narrow range, with some tendency towards shallower declines. Still, it has been unable to exceed its 200-day moving average, which is now passing through $3.01 trillion. A global positive is needed for a breakout, but it would open the way to the $3.5 trillion area,” Kuptsikevich added, indicating strong movements in altcoins.

Pat Zhang, head of research at WOO X, mirrored the sentiment. “BTC continues to experience volatility, forming a consolidation range between $93,000 and $95,000 since April 25, building momentum for a potential breakout,” he said in a Telegram message.

“The average funding rate for BTC has been negative over the past week, which is rare, indicating intense whale activity both on and off exchanges,” Zhang added.

Over the past two years, the financing rate for bitcoin contracts has been negative only four times, specifically during Sept. 19- Sept. 22, 2023, Oct. 20-Oct. 27, 2023, Aug. 16- Aug. 24, 2024, and Sept. 10- Sept. 17, 2024.

“Following these periods of negative financing rates, BTC experienced strong upward trends, suggesting that whale accumulation could be positioning BTC for a potential upward move,” Zhang noted.

Macroeconomic sentiment remains dented as traders globally eye the next steps made by President Donald Trump in the ongoing tariff tussles.

Per Bloomberg, Trump acknowledged Wednesday that his tariff program had a perception problem and posed a significant political risk, but he remained determined to push on. He said “potential deals” with South Korea, India, and Japan were already in place and that a deal with China was progressing in his favor.

Morgan Stanley (MS) is planning to bring cryptocurrency trading to its E*Trade platform, marking the most serious move yet by a major U.S. bank to offer retail users direct access to cryptocurrencies.

The initiative, still in early stages, could debut next year. The bank, Bloomberg reports, is weighing partnerships with crypto-native firms to help build out the infrastructure for spot trading.

The effort would mark a notable expansion of the firm's crypto offerings, which currently include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, and futures contracts tailored to its wealthier clients. Internal discussions reportedly picked up after Donald Trump's return to the White House last year sparked regulatory rollbacks across the crypto space.

Depending on how Morgan Stanley brings crypto trading to E*Trade, the move could heighten competition for crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.

Other institutions are following suit. Charles Schwab has signaled its own interest in adding spot trading, while SoFi is weighing a major push into the cryptocurrency space after seeing a “fundamental shift” in its landscape in the U.S.

 “The world looks to New York, and the world looks to [its] Department of Financial Services,” veteran crypto regulator Ken Coghill told a Cornell audience. 

Love it or leave it, New York State has been a force in crypto regulation.

Ten years ago, the state created the United States' first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.

In September 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued its first BitLicense to Circle Internet Financial, enabling the company to conduct digital currency business activity in the state. Ripple Markets received the second BitLicense in 2016. Circle and Ripple went on to become giant players in the global cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry.

Today, the NYDFS regulates one of the largest pools of crypto firms in the world, and it is often cited as the gold standard for crypto regulation in the US.

It's against that background that Ken Coghill, NYDFS's deputy superintendent for virtual currencies, appeared at Cornell Tech's blockchain conference on April 25 to discuss “A New Era of U.S. Innovation in Crypto.” 

Most of the firms that have come to the NYDFS for a BitLicense are crypto-native firms, and often, they are new to the financial world and not used to dealing with regulators. Many times they don't fully understand that they are in control of someone else's asset, noted Coghill at the New York City conference, adding:

“We set the guardrails,” Coghill said, and it's the industry's job to figure out how to stay within those guardrails. The NYDFS can't possibly contemplate every element that's going to go wrong in a business.

These days, more conventional financial institutions are becoming interested in crypto as well, added Coghill. Large banks are beginning to offer crypto custody services, and others are starting to provide settlement services. “The conventional [bank] model is being brought into the crypto [sphere] primarily because it makes people feel comfortable,” said Coghill.

And while the NYDFS has only issued 22 BitLicenses to date, it appears to be ready to handle a tide of applications from TradFi firms if and when they materialize. “On a per capita basis, we have more supervisory resources focused on crypto businesses than we do for all of those other [non-crypto] businesses,” said Coghill. This includes 3,000 banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. 

It wasn't a direct route that brought Coghill to the NYDFS in July 2024. He spent the previous 12 years in the Middle East working for the Dubai Financial Services Authority, eventually becoming the agency's head of innovation and technology risk supervision.

It was a “whim” that took him to the Middle East in the first place, he recalled. “I went for three years and stayed for 12 years,” spending that time primarily as an official regulating global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs. There, he was called upon to develop a cryptocurrency supervision model, and so he “spent the last six years regulating cryptocurrency in the Middle East.”

Eventually, an opportunity arose to return to the US, where he had worked earlier as a manager in the department of market regulation at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Before that he was an options trader. He took the new assignment with the NYDFS, among other reasons, because “the world looks to New York, and the world looks to the DFS” when it comes to regulation, he told the Cornell Tech audience.

Panel moderator Neil DeSilva asked Coghill what good regulation looks like. “Good regulation is regulation that doesn't prohibit activity but that applies appropriate guardrails that reduces risk to clients,” he answered. One can't eliminate risk entirely; to do so would quash all business activity.

He compares regulation to a pendulum constantly swinging between two extremes: too lenient and too restrictive. “The pendulum swung too far to one end of the regulation in the last few years [i.e., too restrictive]. Now it's swinging back.”

What does the state regulator make of the fevered regulatory activity in Washington, DC at the federal level these days? There seem to be some “positive tailwinds” behind cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, noted DeSilva, himself a former chief financial officer for PayPal's Digital Currencies and Remittances business. 

“For DFS, it's largely business as usual,” Coghill commented. That's because New York State has long had crypto rules in place. In fact, “much of what's happening now in Washington” — at the federal level — “is influenced by what we've done over the last 10 years” at the state level.

The state agency has regularly communicated with the powers-that-be in the US capital regarding digital currencies. “We have a team that practically sits in Washington and has discussions with Congressional members, talking about what we think will work and what won't work.”

The NYDFS' crypto initiatives have influenced other US states. California's crypto reform legislation (AB 1934), signed into law in late September 2024, for instance, builds on New York State's BitLicense and its limited-purpose trust charter regulations for digital currency businesses — even though BitLicense's licensing requirements are relatively strict.

Not all in the crypto industry have been enamored with the state's crypto licensing regime, either, declaring BitLicenses too expensive. Its application fee is $5,000 — too strict with its detailed anti-money laundering protocols and required audits and generally too much of an obstacle for innovative crypto-native firms. Crypto exchange Kraken exited the state when New York implemented its BitLicense requirement, for instance. 

Coghill was asked by DeSilva how the NYDFS actually looks at decentralized protocols compared with how it views the centralized financial institutions that it has historically regulated. 

It's important to look at the actual purpose of the product, Coghill answered. What's its underlying intent? Who does it serve, and what are its good and bad impacts? “There are lots of innovations that are created for no purpose other than making a lot of money off of its customers,” said Coghill. “And so it's incumbent on us to filter those out.” 

“We're paid to look at everything in a dark, dark way. It's not our job to look at and say, ‘Yes, this is fantastic.'” Rather, they examine a potential product and ask, “How is this bad for efficiency?” or “How is this bad for inclusion?” 

How does he think things will play out at the federal level this year regarding crypto and stablecoin legislation?

In the meantime, “we're still accepting applications. We're still processing those applications. We're still focusing on our underlying objectives: protecting the market, protecting the consumers, supporting innovation.”

 $3 billion of MAG's luxury real estate will be tokenized on MultiBank's platform, powered by Mavryk blockchain and governed by the MBG token. 

MultiBank Group, the world's largest financial derivatives institution based in Dubai, has signed a landmark $3 billion real-world asset (RWA) tokenization agreement with United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based real estate giant MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk.

The deal represents the largest RWA tokenization initiative globally to date and highlights the upcoming launch of MultiBank's native utility token, MBG, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.

The partnership will bring MAG's ultra-luxury real estate projects — including The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Dubai, Creekside and the Keturah Reserve — onto the blockchain via MultiBank.io's regulated RWA marketplace.

Once tokenized, these assets will be available to global investors and will generate daily yield for holders directly on the platform.

“$3B worth of MAG's real estate will be tokenized as individual RWA tokens on MultiBank's platform, each represented on the Mavryk blockchain, as the underlying layer-1 infrastructure,” Talal Moafaq Al Gaddah, senior executive vice chairman of MAG, told Cointelegraph.

Al Gaddah added that “$MBG token provides ecosystem utility, including trading discounts, early access to properties, and a deflationary buyback-and-burn model.”

MAG, one of the UAE's most prominent developers, will contribute its premium real estate portfolio for tokenization.

Mavryk will handle blockchain issuance and DeFi integrations, while MultiBank Group will manage regulatory compliance, liquidity and governance, with the MBG token at the core of the system.

“Tokenized assets issued by MultiBank will have dual utility. Within the MultiBank Group, they can be used as collateral for derivatives, creating a seamless bridge between traditional finance and tokenized assets,” Al Gaddah said.

He said that these tokens are fully interoperable with the broader Mavryk DeFi ecosystem.

The MBG token will power staking, fee payments, VIP tiers and user rewards. It also features a buyback-and-burn mechanism tied to platform revenues, creating long-term value for both institutional and retail participants.

The platform aims to scale beyond the initial $3 billion to as much as $10 billion in tokenized assets.

The announcement comes amid renewed interest in RWA tokenization.

On April 30, BlackRock filed to create digital ledger technology shares from one of the firm's money market funds, which will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors.

The DLT shares will track BlackRock's BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY).

The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash.

Trump Quietly Halts Money to States for Preventing Disaster Damage

President Trump is the first president in at least three decades to deny governors' requests for funding that's meant to protect people and property

By Thomas Frank & E&E News 

President Donald Trump is considering a major overhaul to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

CLIMATEWIRE | The Trump administration is scaling back a multibillion-dollar program that has been the backbone of state efforts to protect homes, hospitals and other structures from floods, hurricanes and earthquakes.

President Donald Trump stopped approving new allocations in early April from a federal program that has been a top funding source for protecting people and property from disasters since 1989. The Hazard Mitigation and Grant Program has been used to elevate or demolish flood-prone homes, install tornado-safe rooms and strengthen buildings in hurricane or earthquake zones.

The program, overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been crucial for states such as Florida, Oklahoma, California and Missouri. Louisiana has received $2.5 billion to protect 10,000 properties, records show.

“It's an extremely important program for hazard mitigation,” said Anna Weber, senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Instead of just rebuilding, we're building resilience so we're preventing future damages, deaths and injuries.”

The program has allocated nearly $18 billion to states to safeguard 185,000 properties, according to an analysis of FEMA records by POLITICO's E&E News.

On roughly one-third of the properties, flood-prone buildings were demolished and the land was left vacant as part of local efforts to reduce flood damage.

More than $11 billion has been used to fortify medical facilities, power plants, roads and bridges so they will continue to operate during disasters, the analysis shows.

The move is Trump's latest step to cut federal disaster spending and weaken FEMA as he considers abolishing or shrinking the agency. On Monday, Trump named 13 members to a council he charged with reviewing the agency and recommending overhauls.

Trump's spending halt from the hazard-mitigation program comes weeks after he canceled another multibillion-dollar FEMA grant program, raising concerns that states and localities will stop efforts to minimize damage from future disasters. FEMA's mitigation programs have been widely praised for reducing long-term disaster costs.

“HMGP is more cost-effective in the long-term because it helps communities rebuild from disasters stronger than before,” Virginia Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said in a statement to POLITICO's E&E News.

Trump's action will not affect roughly $11 billion in hazard-mitigation funding that has been approved but not spent. North Carolina, for example, still has $1.7 billion that was approved by then-President Joe Biden after Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage last year.

The Trump administration has not announced changes to the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Neither FEMA nor the White House responded to requests for comment.

But an internal FEMA document and Trump's handling of two recent disasters show the administration's new approach.

On April 4, in a seemingly routine decision, Trump approved a disaster declaration for Virginia to help it recover from recent flooding.

But while Trump agreed to help 16 counties rebuild, he took the highly unusual step of refusing a request by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, for hazard-mitigation money as part of the disaster-aid package.

It was the first time in at least 27 years that a president had denied a state's request for hazard-mitigation money while approving its disaster declaration request, according to FEMA records that go back 27 years. Governors routinely request — and presidents routinely approve — mitigation money for disasters.

Trump himself approved mitigation money when he declared disasters in Kentucky, West Virginia and Oklahoma in February and March — the first three declarations of his second term. In his first term, Trump approved $4.7 billion in hazard-mitigation grants.

“We are deeply concerned communities will have fewer resources available to protect against the impacts of extreme weather events,” Kaine and Warner said in their statement, noting Trump's recent cancellation of another FEMA mitigation program.

The Virginia Department of Emergency Management said in an email, “FEMA has informed us that his request is still in the review process.”

In an April 12 memo to the White House, FEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton suggested that Trump “not automatically approve the Hazard Mitigation Program” when declaring a disaster.

“This is an action the President has already taken,” Hamilton wrote to the Office of Management and Budget in an apparent reference to Trump's denial of mitigation funds for Virginia. “This will serve as a precursor to further evaluating and redesigning mitigation grant programs.”

The six-page memo, first reported by CNN, suggests making other cuts to FEMA programs, such as denying aid for smaller disasters and for snowstorms.

Trump indicated his intention to follow Hamilton's recommendation on the mitigation program when he approved a second disaster declaration for Kentucky on April 25 without including mitigation money.

“When I saw Kentucky, I saw that now there's a pattern, and this is consistent with the recommendation Hamilton made to OMB,” former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen said, referring to the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, applauded FEMA for approving disaster aid for households hit by recent flooding and did not reply to E&E News questions about the absence of mitigation money.

A hazard-mitigation grant is usually equal to 15 percent of the amount of money that FEMA projects it will spend on an individual disaster.

Last year, the Biden administration altered the program to help states spend their hazard-mitigation grants. The program had come under scrutiny for its complexity, which resulted in states not spending billions of dollars they were allocated.

Trump has said his overhaul of FEMA aims to give states more financial and logistical responsibility for disaster recovery — a position embraced by some experts and former FEMA leaders.

But states are not likely to replace FEMA hazard-mitigation money, said Kelly McKinney, a former deputy commissioner of New York City Emergency Management.

Many state programs are strongly backed by advocates who “weigh-in in a very big, noisy way” to protect spending, McKinney said. “There aren't a lot of stakeholders for mitigation.”

States also would have difficulty mounting a legal challenge to reverse Trump's freeze of hazard-mitigation spending because the government is not required to run the program, according to Weber of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

In early April, Trump canceled another FEMA mitigation program, named Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, and froze $3.6 billion of unspent funds that had been approved for states. Although FEMA created the program during Trump's first term, the agency recently called it a “wasteful, politicized grant program.”

Fossils of footprints over 160 million years old have helped palaeontologists at the University of Leicester to narrow down when pterosaurs adapted to live on the ground.

These awe-inspiring flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era are often imagined soaring over the heads of dinosaurs. But new research shows that some of these ancient creatures were just as comfortable walking on the ground.

In a groundbreaking new study published today in Current Biology (1 May), scientists at the University of Leicester have successfully linked fossilised footprints to the types of pterosaurs that produced them. By using 3D modelling, detailed analysis, and comparisons with pterosaur skeletons, the team has shown that at least three different types of tracks match up with distinct groups of pterosaurs.

Tracks of giant ground-stalkers, comb-jawed coastal waders, and specialized shell crushers, shed light on how pterosaurs lived, moved, and evolved.

The new study supports the idea that pterosaurs underwent a major ecological shift during the middle part of the Age of Dinosaurs, about 160 million years ago, with several groups becoming more terrestrial.

Lead author Robert Smyth, a doctoral researcher in the in the Centre for Palaeobiology and Biosphere Evolution (School of Geography, Geology and the Environment at the University of Leicester), explained: ""Footprints offer a unique opportunity to study pterosaurs in their natural environment. They reveal not only where these creatures lived and how they moved, but also offer clues about their behaviour and daily activities in ecosystems that have long since vanished.""

The study uncovered three distinct types of pterosaur footprints, each shedding light on different lifestyles and behaviours. By linking footprints to specific groups, scientists now have a powerful new way to study how these flying reptiles lived, moved, and adapted to different ecosystems across time.

Co-author Dr David Unwin from the School of Museum Studies, University of Leicester explained: ""Finally, 88 years after first discovering pterosaur tracks, we now know exactly who made them and how.""

Perhaps the most striking discovery comes from a group of pterosaurs called neoazhdarchians which includes Quetzalcoatlus, with a 10 m wingspan one of the largest flying animals ever to have existed. Their footprints have been found in coastal and inland areas around the world, supporting the idea that these long-legged creatures not only dominated the skies but were also frequent ground dwellers, inhabiting the same environments as many dinosaur species. Some of these tracks are present right up until the asteroid impact event, 66 million years ago, which led to the extinction of both pterosaurs and dinosaurs.

One group of pterosaurs, ctenochasmatoids, known for their long jaws and needle-like teeth, left behind tracks most commonly found in coastal deposits. These animals likely waded along muddy shores or in shallow lagoons, using their specialised feeding strategies to catch small fish or floating prey. The abundance of these tracks suggests that these coastal pterosaurs were far more common in these environments than their rare bodily remains indicate.

Another type of footprint was discovered in rock layers that also preserve the fossilised skeletons of the same pterosaurs. The close association between the footprints and skeletons provides compelling evidence for identifying the print makers. Known as dsungaripterids, these pterosaurs had powerful limbs and jaws, with toothless, curved beak tips designed for prising out prey, while large, rounded teeth at the back of their jaws were perfect for crushing shellfish and other tough food items.

Smyth explains: ""Tracks are often overlooked when studying pterosaurs, but they provide a wealth of information about how these creatures moved, behaved, and interacted with their environments. By closely examining footprints, we can now discover things about their biology and ecology that we can't learn anywhere else.""

Metrics details

Genetically modified rabies virus can map neural circuits retrogradely from genetically determined cells. However, similar tools for anterograde tracing are not available. Here, we describe a method for anterograde transsynaptic tracing from genetically determined neurons based on a rationally designed protein, ATLAS. Expression of ATLAS in neurons causes presynaptic release of a payload composed of an antibody-like protein, AMPA.FingR, which binds to the N terminus of GluA1, and a recombinase. In the synaptic cleft, AMPA.FingR binds to GluA1, causing the payload to be endocytosed into postsynaptic cells and delivered to the nucleus, where it triggers expression of a recombinase-dependent reporter. In mice, ATLAS mediates monosynaptic transneuronal tracing from random or genetically determined cells that is strictly anterograde, synaptic and nontoxic. Moreover, ATLAS-mediated tracing shows activity dependence, suggesting that it can label active circuits underlying specific behaviors. Finally, ATLAS is composed of modular components that can be independently replaced or modified.

Neural circuits underlying sleep1, interoception2, tactile sensory processing3, sexual behavior4, digestion5 and parenting6 have been studied by identifying critical cellular components using activity-dependent reporters and activating those cells optogenetically or through sensory stimulation. However, fully defining the anatomy and function of these circuits requires the identification of cells upstream and downstream of starter cells. This task is difficult due to the heterogeneity of cell types present in relatively small volumes of neural tissue7. Thus, classical tracing methods using proteins such as wheat germ agglutinin and horse radish peroxidase8, which are taken up by most neurons, cannot be used to define most neuronal circuits precisely.

A genetically modified form of rabies virus was developed that specifically infects neurons expressing the Avian sarcoma leucosis virus receptor, TVA, enabling tracing from specific cell types9. Neural circuits carry information from presynaptic to postsynaptic cells, or anterogradely, but modified rabies virus infects neurons that are presynaptic to starter neurons, traveling retrogradely10. In addition, it is engineered to jump a single synapse, allowing for precise mapping11,12. Although modified rabies virus has been broadly used for tracing circuits retrogradely13, there is currently no comparable method for tracing circuits from genetically determined cells anterogradely. In particular, although two viruses have recently been used for anterograde tracing from nonspecific cells, an adeno-associated virus (AAV1) and a genetically modified yellow fever virus (YFV), neither can mediate tracing from genetically determined cells14,15,16.

Here, we introduce ATLAS (anterograde transsynaptic label based on antibody-like sensors), a rationally designed protein that mediates anterograde transsynaptic labeling from genetically determined cells. ATLAS can be expressed specifically in Cre-expressing neurons in transgenic animals and label neurons to which they project. Labeling is strictly anterograde, monosynaptic and activity-dependent in vivo. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that transneuronal labeling mediated by ATLAS is exclusively transsynaptic. Finally, we show that components of ATLAS can be independently replaced, demonstrating that it is a versatile platform that can be upgraded or modified to perform specific tasks.

We used messenger RNA (mRNA) display, an in vitro selection procedure17, to identify binders to amino acids 1–394 of Rat GluA1 from a library of mRNA–protein fusions encoding the 10FNIII domain of human FN1, with 17 random residues engineered into the BC and FG loops18,19. We expressed the selected fibronectin clones in COS7 cells with GluA1 fused to a hemagglutinin tag (GluA1-HA) and Stargazin-V5. Nonpermeabilized labeling of MYC showed that four fibronectin (Fn) clones labeled the surface of COS7 cells colabeled for HA (Extended Data Fig. 1). Following expression in dissociated cultures of cortical neurons, clone Fn9.3 gave the most robust labeling (Extended Data Fig. 1). We refer to this clone as AMPA.FingR (AF; FingR stands for fibronectin intrabody generated with mRNA display18).

We generated AF-HA protein and found that it bound specifically to a band colabeled with a GluA1 antibody on a western blot of neuronal lysate (Fig. 1a,b). To characterize AF further, we coexpressed a secreted version of it, ss-AF-YFP (ss refers to the GluA1 signal sequence), in dissociated cortical neurons with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP, which labels postsynaptic sites18. We found that AF labeling partially overlapped with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP, suggesting a perisynaptic localization (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1). AF also colocalized with endogenous clathrin, consistent with localization to endocytic zones (Fig. 1d). We then tested whether AF-HA protein is endocytosed by adding it to the medium of cortical neurons in culture. We found that virtually all neurons displayed HA labeling (37 of 38, n = 5 independent cultures, Fig. 1e) within 1 h. Furthermore, the addition of 10 mg ml−1 chlorpromazine, a clathrin inhibitor, significantly reduced HA labeling (4.2 ± 0.8 versus 2.1 ± 0.5, P = 0.012, n = 5 cultures, Mann–Whitney U-test, Fig. 1f), confirming that internalization was mediated by endocytosis. All values are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.

Source data

Since AF binds to GluA1 receptors and is endocytosed postsynaptically, we reasoned that we could make a transsynaptic tracer if we targeted AF to synaptic vesicles by fusing it to the luminal domain of the presynaptic protein, synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) (ref. 20). We inserted a BACE1 (β-secretase) cleavage site (BACEcs)21 between AF and VAMP2 (to give VAMP2-BACEcs-AF), enabling endogenous BACE to cleave AF from VAMP2, leaving it free to exit the lumen of the synaptic vesicle on exocytosis. In addition, an ALFA-tag (At) was added to label VAMP2 (ref. 22). To test our strategy, we substituted super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)20 for AF and coexpressed the resulting plasmid (VAMP2-At-BACEcs-SEP, Fig. 1b) with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP in cortical neurons in culture. The release from acidic synaptic vesicles into the neutral pH of the synaptic cleft is expected to cause a sudden increase in the fluorescence of SEP, allowing it to be visualized20. Following overnight expression of VAMP2-At-BACEcs-SEP in neuronal cultures, we imaged SEP using widefield epifluorescence microscopy. We saw flashes of fluorescence lasting approximately 2–8 s (images taken at 1 Hz) appearing at points opposite postsynaptic sites (Fig. 1g). This result is consistent with VAMP2 delivering SEP to synaptic vesicles, BACE cleaving off SEP, and SEP being released into the synaptic cleft. We also fused AF to SEP and expressed the resulting protein (VAMP2-At-BACEcs-AF-SEP, Fig. 1b) in culture and observed flashes that were brighter and decayed with a longer time constant (6 ± 2 versus 405 ± 60 s, n = 5 independent cultures, Fig. 1h,i), a significant difference (P < 0.0001, t-test). This result is consistent with AF binding to the postsynaptic membrane following release and remaining until it is endocytosed. To further test whether AF-SEP is released from synaptic vesicles, we examined whether depolarization increases the number of release events. We imaged the same cultures before and after adding 100 mM KCl and counted the number of bright flashes corresponding to release events. We found a roughly 15-fold increase in release events with KCl (50 ± 6 versus 3 ± 1 for control, P = 0.02, t-test, n = 5 independent cultures; Fig. 1j–l). Together, these results are consistent with AF-SEP being released from synaptic vesicles, moving across the synaptic cleft, binding to the adjacent postsynaptic neuron perisynaptically and then being endocytosed.

Given that AF likely binds to the extracellular N-terminal domain of GluA1, we tested whether the expression of ss-AF-YFP affects synaptic transmission to hippocampal CA1 neurons. We found that in cells in hippocampal slices transfected with ss-AF-YFP using biolistics, the amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) of AMPA (n = 10, P = 0.31, t-test), NMDA receptors (n = 8, P = 0.70, t-test) and paired-pulse facilitation (n = 6, P = 0.19, t-test) were not significantly different from control cells, consistent with the expression of AF not affecting synaptic transmission (Fig. 1m–p). All pairs of recordings were made from distinct cultured slices and, thus, each is a biological replicate.

To generate a protein capable of mediating transsynaptic tracing, we replaced SEP with Cre in VAMP2-At-BACEcs-AF-SEP to give VAMP2-At-BACEcs-AF-Cre (ATLASCre, Fig. 1b). Following expression of ATLASCre, AF-Cre should be released into the synaptic cleft and then bind to AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. Subsequently, it needs to be endocytosed and carried to the nucleus to provide genetic access to the postsynaptic cell (Fig. 2a). To facilitate this final step, we added the DNA binding domain from CCR5 (refs. 18,23) to the ATLAS protein, as it contains a robust nuclear localization signal. To test our strategy, we transfected ATLASCre into dissociated cultures infected with AAV encoding a floxed green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (AAV8-DIO-GFP). We observed cells with GFP and Cre that were not labeled with the starter cell marker, At, consistent with the transneuronal transport of Cre and recombination of the floxed allele, implying transport of Cre to the nucleus (Fig. 2b–e and Extended Data Fig. 2). Furthermore, At-labeled presynaptic structures were found to be overlapping or immediately adjacent to dendrites belonging to each of the GFP-labeled neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, our results are consistent with ATLASCre mediating transsynaptic tracing and providing genetic access to postsynaptic cells.

a, ATLASCre protein (VAMP2-At-BACEcs-AF-Cre) is expressed in a presynaptic starter cell and (1) targeted to synaptic vesicles by a VAMP2 domain. (2) A BACE cleavage site within the ATLAS protein is cleaved before release. (3) A peptide domain consisting of AF fused to Cre is released into the synaptic cleft and (4) subsequently binds to the extracellular domain of postsynaptic GluA1. (5) It is internalized through endocytosis and transported to the endosome. (6) AF-Cre moves to the nucleus, where Cre can catalyze the expression of a floxed reporter gene. b, Cortical neuron in culture expressing ATLASCre protein (arrow) following transfection, stained with anti-ALFA-tag (At) nanobody. Four other neurons shown (arrowheads) do not express At. c, Cre staining of the same neurons as in b including a neuron expressing ATLASCre (arrow), and four not expressing ATLASCre (arrowheads). d, GFP labeling of postsynaptic cells (arrowheads, green) following infection of AAV8-DIO-GFP. e, Combined labeling of At, GFP and Cre showing presynaptic (arrow) and postsynaptic neurons (arrowheads). Scale bars, 100 μm.

To test our strategy in vivo, we injected AAV8-ATLAScre into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and AAV8-DIO-mCherry into the striatum (Str) of an adult mouse (Fig. 3a). After 1 week, we found At staining in mPFC and abundant mCherry staining in Str (Fig. 3b,c). In contrast, there was negligible mCherry staining in a control experiment without AAV8-ATLAScre (Fig. 3d). Because the projection from mPFC to Str is strictly anterograde24, this result is consistent with AAV8-ATLAScre mediating the transsynaptic transport of Cre into the nucleus of the postsynaptic cell, causing mCherry labeling.

To mediate genetically determined tracing, we generated AAV8-DIO-ATLASFLP (Fig. 1b), where expression of ATLAS is Cre-dependent and the payload is FLP (Flip recombinase). To test this construct, we traced the projection from the primary visual cortex (V1) to the superior colliculus (SC), which is strictly anterograde25. We coinjected Lenti-CamkII-Cre (a lentivirus expressing Cre specifically in excitatory neurons) and AAV8-DIO-ATLASFLP into V1 and AAV8-fDIO-mCherry into SC of wild-type mice. In addition to At staining in V1, we saw abundant staining for mCherry in SC (391 ± 37 cells, n = 7 samples from three mice, Fig. 3e–h and Supplementary Table 1) and a small number of faint cells on the control (35 ± 6, n = 6 samples from three mice), which was subtracted from the previous count. All cell counts are expressed as the number of cells per 0.1 mm unless otherwise specified to allow for comparisons. An advantage of this strategy is that lentivirus has no intrinsic retrograde or anterograde transneuronal transport that could cloud the interpretation of the results, unlike virtually every pseudotype of AAV15.

To test ATLAS tracing in transgenic Cre mouse lines, we examined the projection from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to V1 in a VIPR2-Cre line expressing Cre in neurons in the dLGN26. We injected AAV8-DIO-ATLASFLP into dLGN and AAV8-fDIO-mCherry into V1. Staining of At was found specifically in the dLGN, and mCherry staining in V1 (267 ± 54 cells, n = 5 samples from three mice) was dense in layer IV and less dense in layers II/III and V (Fig. 3i–l), consistent with known anatomy27. These results are consistent with ATLAS tracing anterogradely from Cre-expressing neurons in wild-type and transgenic mice.

To measure the efficiency of ATLAS tracing, we injected AAV8-ATLASCre in mPFC and AAV8-DIO-mCherry in Str and counted the number of labeled cells as before after 1 week of incubation. Initially, we observed 144 ± 17 labeled cells (n = 6 samples from three mice). One possible inefficiency in our system is that there may be insufficient endogenous BACE in presynaptic cells to cleave all the AF-Cre from VAMP2. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed exogenous BACE with ATLASCre and measured the resulting efficiency. When we coinjected AAV8-BACE-HA and AAV8-ATLASCre into mPFC in equal amounts, it did not significantly affect the number of postsynaptic cells labeled with mCherry (180 ± 20 cells, n = 6 samples from three mice, P = 0.38, Tukey's multiple comparisons, Extended Data Fig. 3). However, when we injected AAV8-BACE-HA and AAV8-ATLASCre in a 5:1 ratio (viral particles), we saw a significant increase in the number of cells in Str labeled with mCherry, compared to both AAV8-ATLAS + BACE 1:1 (P = 0.0027) and AAV-ATLAS alone (286 ± 17, P = 0.0002), n = 6 samples from three mice; Tukey's multiple comparisons test, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). With this ratio of BACE to ATLAS, we saw approximately 10% of postsynaptic neurons labeled (Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, when supplemented with exogenous BACE, ATLAS labels cells in the Str at a similar density to YFV14.

Given its design, it is likely that transneuronal labeling mediated by ATLAS occurs exclusively through synapses. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we asked whether transneuronal labeling could happen from inhibitory neurons. Since the uptake of ATLAS is mediated by GluA1 receptors, which are not found at inhibitory synapses, if we expressed ATLAS in inhibitory neurons, any transneuronal labeling would have to be nonsynaptic (Fig. 4a). Accordingly, we injected AAV8-DIO-ATLASFLP and AAV8-fDIO-mCherry into V1 of an SST-Cre mouse, where somatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons express Cre28. When we examined labeling in the cortex after 2 weeks, we saw 483 cells labeled with mCherry and, of those, only 20 cells were not colabeled with At (Fig. 4b–d and Supplementary Table 1, n = 3 mice). This labeling rate was less than the background rate measured over an equivalent number of sections for control experiments where only AAV8-fDIO-mCherry was injected into V1 (100 cells, n = 3 mice), consistent with no transneuronal labeling above background. This result leads us to conclude that ATLAS labels postsynaptic neurons exclusively through the transsynaptic transfer of proteins.

Source data

To test whether ATLAS disrupts synaptic transmission, we coinfected AAV8-ATLASsnCre (Fig. 1b), AAV8-BACE-HA and AAV8-DIO-Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-GFP into the mPFC and AAV8-DIO-mCherry in the Str of wild-type mice. Since we found that ATLAS labels ~10% of target neurons in this circuit (Extended Data Fig. 3), we reasoned that it should be possible to find both labeled and nonlabeled cells that are synaptically connected to ChR2-expressing neurons to compare whether ATLAS labeling affects the cell's physiological properties. Four weeks after the virus injection, we cut coronal slices of Str approximately 350 μm thick and incubated them in artificial cerebral spinal fluid for in vitro slice recording. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed to measure 470-nm optically evoked EPSC (eEPSC) from striatal cells (Extended Data Fig. 4). To evaluate the potential effect of ATLAS tracing on synaptic transmission, we compared the striatal cells with and without mCherry expression. Robust evoked EPSCs were recorded in mCherry-expressing cells with an onset latency of <5 ms following the light flash in eight out of eight cells (from three mice), indicating that the presynaptic ChR2-expressing cells were synaptically connected with mCherry-labeled cells (Extended Data Fig. 4). Furthermore, when labeled postsynaptic cells were recorded from, the amplitude of ChR2-evoked EPSCs exhibited a nonsignificant increase compared with those of unlabeled cells (Extended Data Fig. 4, n = 8 labeled cells, n = 7 unlabeled cells from three mice for both, P = 0.28, t-test). Thus, ATLAS did not block synaptic transmission. In addition, there were no significant changes in onset latency (P = 0.22, t-test) and time constant (P = 0.78, t-test, Extended Data Fig. 4). This result is consistent with transsynaptic labeling with ATLAS not causing detectable toxicity. Moreover, we verified that evoked currents are monosynaptic through the sequential application of Tetrodotoxin, which blocks action potentials and polysynaptic transmission, and 4-aminopyridine, which blocks K+ channels and facilitates direct activation of presynaptic terminals.

To test for the specificity of ATLAS tracing, we measured optogenetically evoked currents in the circuit from the primary visual cortex to the Str29. We coinfected AAV8-ATLASsnCre (Fig. 1b) and AAV8-BACE-HA in V1, and AAV8-DIO-mCherry/tdTomato in the dorsomedial Str (DMS). Two weeks later, we injected AAV8-DIO-ChR2-GFP in the same area in V1 as the first injection to manipulate ATLAS-labeled presynaptic inputs while minimizing expression competition between ATLAS and ChR2. Histology 2 weeks after the second injection revealed efficient expression of At, HA, ChR2 in V1 and Cre-dependent mCherry/tdTomato in DMS, consistent with the projection pattern of DMS-projecting V1 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4). To compare V1 innervation between ATLAS-labeled versus unlabeled postsynaptic neurons, we measured optically evoked EPSCs (oEPSCs) following a 2-ms flash of 473-nm blue light in acute brain slices prepared from mice injected with virus 4 weeks earlier (Fig. 4e). We performed sequential, paired whole-cell recordings where we measured oEPSCs of an ATLAS-labeled (mCherry/tdTomato+) and an unlabeled (mCherry/tdTomato−) neuron in the same field of view (100 × 100 μm; Fig. 4e–h). Ten pairs of cells (from four mice) were recorded, in which ten out of ten labeled cells carried a current, compared with seven out of ten unlabeled cells (Fig. 4f). To assess the baseline connection probability of the V1-DMS circuit, we randomly patched onto DMS neurons in striatal areas where we saw prominent fiber labeling with GFP. Of the 17 random cells we patched (n = 3 mice), 41% of cells were connected (7 out of 17, Fig. 4f). oEPSCs recorded from labeled cells were significantly larger in amplitude and total charge compared with those of paired unlabeled cells (amplitude −134 ± 38 versus −66 ± 21 pA, P = 0.0020, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, total charge −0.121 ± 0.03 versus −0.038 ± 0.01 pC, P = 0.0020, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 10 mice, plotted as absolute values in Fig. 4g,h). Furthermore, in ten out of ten pairs, the current recorded from the labeled cell had a larger amplitude than that from the unlabeled cell (Fig. 4h). Together, these results indicate that when ATLASCre and a Cre-dependent reporter are simultaneously expressed in different brain regions, cells exhibiting Cre-dependent labeling are likely to receive synaptic inputs from cells expressing ATLASsnCre. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cells with stronger synaptic connections are more likely to be labeled by ATLAS.

A limitation of many virally based anterograde transneuronal labeling methods is that they also mediate labeling in the retrograde direction14,15. To determine whether ATLAS mediates retrograde labeling in vivo, we injected AAV8-DIO-ATLASFLP and Lenti-hsyn-Cre into Str and AAV8-fDIO-mCherry into mPFC (Fig. 5a). Because the mPFC to Str projection is unidirectional and lentivirus does not spread retrogradely, any labeling in mPFC would be due to retrograde transneuronal labeling mediated by ATLAS. However, despite abundant At labeling in Str, indicating that ATLAS was expressed at a high level, we found no labeling above background in mPFC (20 ± 4 cells for experiment, n = 6 samples from three mice, versus 45 ± 14 for control, n = 6 samples from three mice, P = 0.11, t-test, Fig. 5b–e and Supplementary Table 1). These data are consistent with ATLAS not mediating retrograde labeling.

To test whether ATLAS can mediate transsynaptic labeling that is monosynaptic, a critical property for transsynaptic tracing results to be interpretable, we tried tracing the polysynaptic pathway from V1 to SC to the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG)14. We injected AAV8-ATLASCre into V1 and AAV8-DIO-mCherry into SC and PBG (Fig. 5f). We found AT labeling in V1 and abundant transsynaptic mCherry labeling in SC (Fig. 5g,h) but no staining significantly above background in PBG (3 ± 1 cells for experiment, n = 8 samples from three mice, versus 19 ± 3 for control, n = 6 samples from three mice, P = 0.35, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Tukey's test, Fig. 5i,n). Furthermore, when we injected AAV8-ATLASCre into SC, we saw abundant labeling in PBG (181 ± 30 cells, n = 3 samples from three mice) that was significantly above both background and labeling from V1 to PBG (P < 0.0001 for both, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparisons, Fig. 5j–n), demonstrating that ATLAS is capable of tracing the SC to PBG pathway. Thus, transsynaptic labeling mediated by ATLAS is exclusively anterograde and monosynaptic.

Because ATLAS mediates transsynaptic labeling by releasing AF-recombinase from synaptic vesicles, transsynaptic labeling is likely activity-dependent. To test for activity dependence of transsynaptic labeling in vivo, we injected AAV8-ATLASsnCre + AAV8-hHM3Dq-mCherry, an excitatory Dreadd30, into mPFC and AAV8-DIO-GFP into Str (Extended Data Fig. 5) in two mice. We then injected one mouse daily with clozapine N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneally but not the other. After 1 week, we perfused the mice and performed immunocytochemisty. We found abundant c-FOS labeling in the mPFC of the CNO+ mouse, which overlapped with At labeling (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, there was negligible c-FOS labeling in the mPFC of the CNO− mouse (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, GFP labeling appeared to increase in terms of total fluorescence and number of labeled cells in the CNO+ mouse (Extended Data Fig. 5). We then pooled these data with those from similar experiments using AAV8-ATLASCre and found that CNO+ mice had significantly higher postsynaptic GFP labeling in the Str versus CNO- mice both in terms of the number of cells labeled (88 ± 12 versus 52 ± 7, n = 5 mice, P = 0.0357, t-test, Extended Data Fig. 5) and total fluorescence (38 ± 4 versus 19 ± 2 a.u., P = 0.0025, t-test, Extended Data Fig. 5). In contrast, the number of presynaptic At stained cells was not significantly different between CNO+ and CNO− mice (1,200 ± 100 versus 1,200 ± 100, P = 0.7492, t-test, Extended Data Fig. 5). Thus, our results indicate that the efficiency of transsynaptic labeling was significantly higher in CNO+ mice versus CNO− mice, consistent with ATLAS mediating activity-dependent transsynaptic labeling.

ATLAS is composed of multiple independent components, each of which can, in principle, be modified or upgraded to improve efficiency or alter function. We took advantage of this property to optimize the VAMP2 component of ATLAS, which is responsible for presynaptic targeting. Although VAMP2 is widely used as a presynaptic marker, it can produce toxicity when expressed at a high level. Indeed, we saw evidence of toxicity when ATLAS was expressed in the mPFC for 2 and 4 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 6). Accordingly, we exchanged the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 for a nanobody against Synaptotagmin 1 (SYTnb)31 to give SYTnb-VAMP2Δ-At-BACEcs-AF-Cre (ATLASsnCre, Figs. 1b and 6a), where VAMP2Δ consists of the lumenal and transmembrane domains of VAMP2. When we expressed ATLASsnCre in the mPFC for 2 or 4 weeks, we saw no evidence of toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 6). To test ATLASsnCre, we transfected it into dissociated cultures of cortical neurons while infecting them with AAV8-DIO-mCherry. We saw abundant cells labeled with mCherry but not with At, indicating they were labeled transsynaptically (Fig. 6b). A closeup image of such a postsynaptic cell revealed At labeling opposite its dendritic spines, consistent with presynaptic labeling (Fig. 6b, inset).

To test AAV8-ATLASsnCre in vivo, we injected it and AAV8-BACE-HA into the mPFC and AAV8-DIO-mCherry into the Str. After 2 weeks of incubation, we saw expression of At in the mPFC and abundant mCherry labeling in Str (Fig. 6c,d and Extended Data Fig. 7). The dorsal region of postsynaptic mCherry labeling colocalized almost perfectly with At labeling representing presynaptic termini (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 7), consistent with ATLASsn mediating transsynaptic labeling. To further test ATLASsn in vivo, we coinfected AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-BACE-GFP in M1 cortex and AAV8-DIO-mCherry in the Str and thalamus (Thal, Fig. 6e). After 2 weeks of incubation, staining of GFP and mCherry revealed labeled presynaptic cells in M1 (Fig. 6f) and postsynaptic cells in Str (Fig. 6g) and Thal (Fig. 6h). Overlap of GFP and mCherry labeling in Str and Thal (Extended Data Fig. 7) is consistent with transsynaptic labeling. Furthermore, minimal background was observed in the Str when AAV8-DIO-mCherry alone was injected (Extended Data Fig. 7).

To further test ATLASsn, we used it to trace three additional pathways: from the auditory cortex (A1) to the inferior colliculus, the mPFC to the claustrum and the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, respectively. In each case, we injected AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-BACE-HA into the presynaptic area and AAV8-DIO-GFP into the corresponding postsynaptic area. After 2 weeks, we stained presynaptic cells for At and postsynaptic cells for GFP. In each experiment, we found cells with At and GFP labeling, consistent with efficient transsynaptic labeling (inferior colliculus, 173 ± 13 cells, n = 8 samples from three mice; claustrum, 71 ± 14 cells, n = 7 samples from three mice; hippocampus, 132 ± 30 cells, n = 4 samples from two mice, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 1). Thus, ATLAS is capable of tracing multiple different pathways.

In addition, to understand the time course over which transsynaptic labeling happens, we coexpressed AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-BACE-HA in the mPFC and AAV8-DIO-GFP in the Str and waited 4, 7, 14 and 21 days (n = 8 samples from four mice in each case) before perfusing animals and staining for presynaptic and postsynaptic labels. After 4 days, we found faint labeling of presynaptic cells with At, although labeled cells were relatively abundant (534 ± 114 cells, Extended Data Fig. 9). In contrast, GFP-labeled postsynaptic cells were very sparse at this time point (2 ± 1 cells), and total GFP labeling was minimal (3 ± 1 a.u.). After 7 days, the number of presynaptic cells labeled with At increased (1,150 ± 300, Extended Data Fig. 9), but not significantly (P = 0.3279, one-way ANOVA). However, both the number of labeled postsynaptic cells (52 ± 7 cells) and the total GFP label (35 ± 3 a.u.) were significantly higher (P < 0.0001, ANOVA; Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus, postsynaptically labeled cells become visible between 4 and 7 days postinjection. After 14 and 21 days, the number of labeled presynaptic cells (1,270 ± 260 and 1,070 ± 270 cells) was not significantly different from 7 days (P = 0.9874, P = 9943, ANOVA; Extended Data Fig. 9). The number of postsynaptic cells labeled with GFP at 14 days (63 ± 5 cells) was not significantly different from the number at 7 days (P = 0.4514, ANOVA; Extended Data Fig. 9). However, the cell number at 21 days (86 ± 5 cells) was significantly higher than at 14 days (P = 0.0116, ANOVA). The labeling intensity increased significantly at 14 and 21 days versus 7 days (65 ± 2 and 82 ± 6 a.u., P < 0.0001, ANOVA; Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus, ATLAS transsynaptic labeling increases notably in the first 7 days and at a slower rate thereafter in terms of cell number, but increases in a relatively linear manner in total intensity. In contrast, labeling of presynaptic cells is constant after the first week.

It is highly desirable for transsynaptic labeling techniques to work in systems other than the mouse. Accordingly, we tested whether ATLAS would work in the rat by injecting AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-BACE-HA into the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus and AAV8-DIO-tdTomato into the nucleus accumbens (ACB, Fig. 6i), to which the CA1 neurons project. We observed At staining in CA1 (Fig. 6j) and abundant tdTomato-labeled cells in ACB (115 ± 11, n = 3 rats, Fig. 6k), consistent with transsynaptic labeling. Finally, tdTomato labeling of axons within the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) (Fig. 6l), which receives axonal projections from ACB32, confirms the postsynaptic labeling of neurons within ACB.

ATLAS is a rationally designed protein that mediates transsynaptic tracing from genetically determined neurons via a precisely defined mechanism. In contrast, viruses such as rabies, YFV, AAVs and the protein used in the nonviral method Trans-Seq have modes of egress from starter cells and entry into recipient cells that remain mysterious10,14,15,33. In addition, AAV1, YFV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) undergo a measurable component of retrograde transport in addition to anterograde and have not been shown to mediate tracing that is exclusively transsynaptic14,15,16,34,35.

Because ATLAS protein does not have an intrinsic amplification mechanism like rabies and similar viruses9, tracing using ATLAS requires the expression of a recombinase-dependent reporter in the postsynaptic cell. While this could be interpreted as a drawback, it is also a benefit because amplification that occurs in rabies or VSV infection is associated with toxicity36,37. In the case of tracing using AAV1, which also requires amplification, a transgenic mouse with a floxed reporter transgene can be used instead of postsynaptic injections15,16. Efficient and consistent transsynaptic labeling occurred in some but not all cases when we expressed ATLASCre in the ai75 floxed reporter mice38. Thus, broad regions containing postsynaptic target areas must be identified a priori and injected with a floxed reporter, which is not required for many virus-based transneuronal labeling techniques. However, this should not be a difficult problem to surmount as regions postsynaptic to specific cell types are easily identified by exogenously expressing a presynaptic marker such as VAMP2 (ref. 39).

Our finding that 100% of postsynaptic striatal cells labeled following expression of ATLAS in V1 were synaptically connected to cells expressing ChR2-GFP, which was coinfected with ATLAS, indicates that postsynaptic cells with Cre-dependent labeling are likely to be synaptically connected with presynaptic starter cells in which ATLASCre is expressed. Also, 70% of neurons not labeled with ATLAS but immediately adjacent to labeled cells were found to be connected to presynaptic cells expressing ChR2-GFP. This result could be due to many factors, including the fact that transsynaptic labeling with ATLAS is not 100% efficient. In addition, Cre-dependent expression of ChR2-GFP could occur in neurons in V1 that are connected with starter cells through local connections, leading to more widespread expression of ChR2-GFP than of ATLAS. In contrast to paired unlabeled neurons, ~40% of random unlabeled cells chosen near labeled presynaptic terminals from V1 were found to be connected to those terminals. These data are consistent with postsynaptic neurons labeled with ATLAS being connected to labeled presynaptic neurons at a rate considerably higher than chance.

Because ATLAS is a protein, it can be evolved to change its properties and improve performance similar to GCaMP40 or GRAB sensors41. For instance, ATLAS, as described in this paper, works only for anterograde tracing from excitatory neurons. However, AF can, in principle, be replaced by a recombinant binder to a neurotransmitter receptor, such as a GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) or acetylcholine receptor, or even to a receptor for a neuromodulator, such as dopamine or serotonin. The resulting modified ATLAS could be used for tracing virtually any neuronal circuit mediated by the corresponding neurotransmitter–receptor combination. Also, because of its activity dependence, ATLAS could be used to mark circuits that respond to specific stimuli, especially if ATLAS tracing could be gated to occur during a particular time interval. Finally, it may be possible to modify ATLAS to label circuit changes during events such as memory formation42 or specific developmental processes such as synaptic pruning43.

Amino acids 1–394 of GluA1 grown in Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells was used as a target for an mRNA display selection, carried out as described in ref. 44. FingRs amplified from the ninth round of selection were fused to a Myc tag and coexpressed in Cos7 cells (ATCC, CRL-1651) with ss-GluA1-HA (ss, signal sequence of GluA1) and Stargazin-V5. Cos7 cells were stained live with anti-MYC antibody, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for HA and V5. Fibronectins labeling the surface of cells expressing GluA1 and Stargazin were then expressed in dissociated cultures. Fibronectin 9.3-labeled endogenous GluA1 and was designated AF.

The ss-AF-YFP consists of DNA encoding amino acids 1–18 of GluA1 inserted upstream of AF and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). For ATLAS constructs, VAMP2 complementary DNA (cDNA) was inserted upstream of ALFA-tag (SRLEEELRRRLTE) followed by a BACEcs (β-site Amyloid Precursor Protein-cleaving enzyme 1) cut site (EISEVNLDAEFR). VAMP2-BACEcs-SEP has SEP downstream of BACEcs. VAMP2-BACEcs-AF-SEP has AF and SEP downstream of BACEcs. ATLASCre has AF and Cre cDNA downstream of BACEcs. DIO-ATLASFlp has a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) followed by FLP1 cDNA downstream of BACEcs and nested LoxP sites on either side of the coding sequence. GFP-HA-BACE1 plasmid was purchased (Addgene, no. 165032), and GFP was removed to make BACE-HA. The above sequences were ligated into a pAAV plasmid containing the human synapsin (hsyn) promoter and a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE). Lenti-hsyn-Cre was purchased from Addgene (no. 86641), and the hSYN1 promoter was replaced with the CamKIIα promoter to generate Lenti-CamKII-Cre.

Pups from timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats (E19) were used for cultured cortical neurons, prepared as in ref. 45. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with the plasmid pCAG-ss-AF-3XHA-TEVcs-HALOTag and the secreted protein AF-HA-TEVcs-HALOTag was collected and incubated with HaloLink resin (Promega, cat. no. G1914) overnight at 4 °C. and then with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (New England Biolabs, cat. no. P8112S) overnight at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and incubated with NEBExpress Ni Resin (New England Biolabs, cat. no. S1428S) overnight at 4 °C to remove the TEV protease. Purified protein was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES, 250 mM NaCl pH 7.4 and concentrated using the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (cat. no. UFC501096).

Neuronal cultures were incubated with 1 mM purified AF-HA protein for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, cultures were washed three times with 1× Hanks Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for anti-HA (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 3724S) and anti-Map2 (Abcam, cat. no. ab5392).

Plasmids encoding VAMP2-BACEcs-SEP (1 μg) or VAMP2-BACEcs-AF-SEP (1 μg) with BACE-HA (2 μg) were transfected into 15–18 day in vitro (DIV) cultured neurons. Two days before transfection, cultures were infected with AAV8-Cre and AAV8-DIO-PSD-95.FingR-TdTomato to label postsynaptic sites. Neurons were imaged 3 to 5 days later with or without 100 mM KCl. Time-lapse imaging was performed for either 100 or 200 frames at an interval of 1,000 ms and an exposure of 500 ms. Time constants were measured using curve fitting functions in GraphPad Prism. Videos of SEP release events were generated using ImageJ by taking the difference of adjacent image frames to eliminate background and SEP fluorescence beyond the initial frame after release.

The following viruses were purchased from Addgene: AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry no. 50459, AAV8-EF1a-fDIO-mCherry no. 114471, AAV8-hsyn-DIO-eGFP no. 50457 and AAV8.hSyn.hM3D.mCherry no. 50474. All other viruses were generated in the Arnold laboratory using standard methods.

Neuronal cultures (14 DIV) were transfected with plasmids for ATLAS (1 μg) and BACE-HA (2 μg) using the calcium phosphate method. Transfection was followed immediately by infection with AAV8-hsyn-DIO-GFP and incubated for 7 days. Neurons were fixed and probed as described.

Neurons were stained using: anti-GFP, 1:10,000, Aves GFP-1020; anti-MYC, 1:1,000, Novus Biologicals NB600-334; anti-Map2, 1:1,000, Abcam ab5392; anti-clathrin, 1:1,000, GeneTex GTX80218; anti-mCherry, 1:1,000, Rockland M11217; anti-RFP, 1:1,000, Invitrogen MA5-15257; anti-GluA1, 1:1,000, EMD Millipore ABN241; anti-PSD-95, 1:3,000, NeuroMab 75-348; anti-HA, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling 3724S; anti-Cre, 1:1,000, EMD Millipore MAB3120; Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken, 1:1,000, Invitrogen A-11006; Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit, 1:1,000, Invitrogen A-11012; Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse, 1:1,000, Invitrogen A-11005; Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse, 1:1,000, Invitrogen A-21235; Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit, 1:1,000, Invitrogen A-21244; JF549 halotag ligand, 1:1,000, Janelia Farm; JF647 halotag ligand, 1:1,000, Janelia Farm; FluoTag-X2 anti-alfa 647, 1:1,000, NanoTag biotechnologies N1502 AF647. Neurons were mounted using Dapi-fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Services, 17984-24).

All experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California. As previously described, 400-μm-thick rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from male and female P6 to P8 Sprague Dawley rats46. Sparse biolistic transfections were performed on DIV1 as previously described47,48. Next, 50 μg of mixed plasmid DNA encoding ss-AF-YFP was coated on 1-μm diameter gold particles. Construct expression was confirmed by YFP epifluorescence. Dual whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons were performed on DIV7–8 through simultaneous recordings from a transfected neuron and a neighboring, nontransfected control neuron. Synaptic responses were evoked by stimulating with a monopolar glass electrode filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in the stratum radiatum. AMPAR-evoked EPSCS (-eEPSCs) were measured at −70 mV. NMDAR-eEPSCs were measured at +40 mV and were temporally isolated by measuring amplitudes 150 ms after the stimulus. For paired-pulse facilitation, paired pulses at 40-ms interpulse interval were delivered and the ratio of peak amplitudes was analyzed to generate barplots depicting mean ± s.e.m. Data analysis was performed using Igor Pro v.9.

All procedures in Figs. 3, 4b–d, 5 and 6c,d and Extended Data Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7a,b, 8 and 9 were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California. Male and female wild-type mice (C57BL/6J, Jackson Laboratories, strain no. 000664), Vipr2-Cre (Cre expression in dLGN, Jackson Laboratories, strain no. 031332) and Sst-IRES-Cre (Cre expression in somatostatin interneurons, Jackson Laboratories strain no. 013044) mice aged 2–6 months were used. For stereotaxic viral injection, mice were anesthetized in an induction chamber containing 4% isoflurane mixed with oxygen and transferred to a stereotaxic frame with a heating pad. Then, 1.5% isoflurane was delivered throughout the procedure through a nose cone at a rate of 0.5 l min−1. Injection coordinates based on ref. 49 were used to mark the location where a small hole (0.5 mm diameter) was drilled. Viruses were delivered through pulled glass micropipettes using pressure injection via a micropump. Total injection volumes ranged from 50 to 800 nl, at 20–60 nl min−1. Following injection, the micropipette was left in place for 15 min to minimize virus diffusion into the pipette track. Animals were administered Ketoprofen (5 mg kg−1) at the beginning of the surgical procedure and again every 24 h for 2 d following surgery.

For experiments in Figs. 3, 4b–d, 5, 6c,d and Extended Data Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7a,b, 8 and 9, anterograde tracing experiments using ATLAScre, 400–600 nl of either ATLASCre or ATLASsnCre virus was injected into presynaptic cells in the PFC, Primary auditory cortex (A1) or entorhinal cortex. AAV8-DIO reporter virus (400–800 nl), diluted to minimize the background signal, was injected into postsynaptic cells in the Str, ipsilateral claustrum, bilateral inferior colliculus or ipsilateral dentate gyrus. The animals were euthanized 2 weeks following the injections.

In experiments with DIO-ATLASFlp, transgenic VIPR2-Cre mice were injected with AAV8-DIO-ATLASFlp (600 nl, 1.0 × 1013) at the ipsilateral LGN. A second injection of AAV8-EF1a-fDIO-mCherry (600 nl, 5.0 × 1012) was administered at the primary visual cortex (V1). The animals were euthanized after 2 weeks. To test AAV-DIO-ATLASFlp, C57BL/6J mice were injected with a viral mixture of AAV8-DIO-ATLASFlp and Lenti-hsyn-Cre at V1 and AAV8-EF1a-fDIO-mCherry (600 nl, 5.0 × 12) in the ipsilateral SC and euthanized 2 weeks later. Transgenic SST-Cre mice were injected with a mixture of AAV8-DIO-ATLASFlp and AAV8-ef1a-fDIO-mCherry (at 1:1 ratio based on viral particles) at V1 and euthanized 1 week later.

For testing the potential retrograde spread of ATLAS, AAV8-DIO-ATLASFlp and Lenti-hsyn-Cre were injected into Str of C57BL/6J mice, and AAV8-EF1a-fDIO-mCherry (800 μl, 5.0 × 1012) was injected into mPFC. As the negative control, a group of C57BL/6J mice was injected with AAV8-ef1a-fDIO-mCherry (800 μl, 5.0 × 1012) in mPFC. All animals were then euthanized 2 weeks following the injections.

To test for monosynaptic tracing, C57BL/6J mice were injected with AAV8-ATLASCre (600 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in V1 and AAV8-hsyn-DIO-mCherry (400 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in the PBG. As the positive control, C57BL/6J mice were injected with AAV8-ATLASCre (600 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in SC and AAV8-hsyn-DIO-mCherry (400 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in PBG. As a negative control, wild-type mice were injected with AAV8-hsyn-DIO-mCherry (400 nl, 1.0 × 1013) at PBG. Animals were euthanized 2 weeks following injections.

To test supplementing ATLAS with BACE, mixtures with the following ratios of AAV8-ATLASCre and AAV8-hsyn-BACE-HA: 1:1 ATLAS: BACE, 1:5 ATLAS: BACE, or no BACE based on number of viral particles. These were injected into the C57BL/6J mice in mPFC. AAV8-hsyn-DIO-GFP (800 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in ipsilateral Str to visualize postsynaptic cells. Animals were euthanized 2 weeks following injections. To examine the effect of incubation time on efficiency of ATLAS, C57BL/6J mice were injected with a viral mixture of AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-hsyn-BACE-HA (600 nl, 1:3 based on viral particles) in mPFC and AAV8-hsyn-DIO-GFP (800 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in ipsilateral Str. Animals were euthanized 4, 7, 14 or 21 days following injections.

For testing the effect of neuronal activity on ATLAS tracing, C57BL/6J mice were injected with AAV8-ATLASsnCre or AAV8-ATLASCre, AAV8-hsyn-BACE and AAV8-hHM3Dq-mCherry (600 nl, 1:3:1 based on viral particles) in mPFC and AAV8-hsyn-DIO-GFP (800 nl, 1.0 × 1013) in ipsilateral Str. CNO (200 μl, 1.1 mM) was administered to experiment animals through intraperitoneal injection daily following viral injections. Animals were euthanized 7 days after viral injections. A final dose of CNO was administered 45 min before the perfusion.

To determine whether ATLAS shows toxicity compared to ATLASsn, one group of C57BL/6J mice were injected with 600 nl of AAV8-ATLASCre and AAV8-hsyn-BACE (1:3 based on viral particles), and the other group of mice were injected with 600 nl of viral mixture of AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-hsyn-BACE (at a 1:3 ratio based on viral particles) at mPFC. AAV8-hsyn-DIO-GFP (800 nl) was injected into the ipsilateral Str of both groups. Animals were euthanized 14 and 28 days following injections.

In all experiments listed above, presynaptic and postsynaptic injections were performed during the same surgery. Bregma and Lambda coordinates are in millimeters as follows: anteroposterior is the distance from Lambda, mediolateral is the distance from midline and dorsoventral is the distance from Lambda except for V1, A1 and SC, which use the distance from the surface of the cortex. mPFC (6.3, 0.3, 1.7); Str (5.1, 1.8, 3.4); dLGN (2.2, 2.2, 2.9); primary visual cortex (V1) (0.8, 2.4, 0.6); primary auditory cortex (A1) (1.5, 4.2, 0.6); SC (0.6, 0.8, 1.2); inferior colliculus (−0.7, 0.8, 0.6); PBG (0.1, 1.8, 3.3); claustrum (5.4, 2.5, 4.0); entorhinal cortex (0.0, 3.6, 3.6) and dentate gyrus (0.6, 2.8, 2.5).

Mouse brains were perfused with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then 40 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Figs. 3, 4b–d, 5, 6c,d and Extended Data Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7a,b, 8 and 9). The brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4oC and dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution for at least 48 h. Brains were embedded in tissue freezing medium at −45 °C and sectioned to a thickness of 25–35 µm using a cryostat. For immunohistochemistry, antibodies used were: rabbit anti-RFP, Rockland (cat. no. 600-401-379), 1:1,000; chicken anti-GFP antibody, AVES (gfp-1020, cat. no. NC9510598), 1:1,000; Fluotag-X2 anti-ALFA, NanoTag (cat. no. N1502-ALFA647-L), 1:1,000; mouse anti-NeuN antibody, EMD Millipore (cat. no. MAB377), 1:1,000, c-Fos (cat. no. 9F6) Rabbit mAb, Cell Signaling Technology (cat. no. 2250T), 1:1,000; Alexa Flour 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken (A-11039) or anti-mouse IgG (cat. no. A-28175), Thermo Fisher, 1:1,000; Alexa Flour 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Thermo Fisher (cat. no. A-11012), 1:1,000; Alexa Flour 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Thermo Fisher, 1:1,000 (cat. no. A-21235).

Labeled presynaptic cells (At) and postsynaptic cells (GFP or mCherry) were counted within an identical 1-mm2 region of 25-μm-thick stained sections of target regions. All sections examined were roughly equal distance from the site of AAV injection. We quantified cells in two representative sections, each 25 µm apart. Then, the data from the selected sections was pooled and multiplied by two to estimate the number of labeled cells within 100 µm. To account for the background expression from spontaneous recombination by the DIO reporter construct, we subtracted the cell counts from control experiments from those in corresponding ATLAS experiments. To quantify activity-dependent transsynaptic labeling, total GFP fluorescence minus background was measured identically in Str in sections at equivalent distances from injection sites using ImageJ. For the SST experiment, At-labeled cells and mCherry-labeled cells were counted within an identical 1 mm2 region of 25-μm-thick stained sections. The number of mCherry+ cells over the mCherry and At colabeled cells was then calculated.

All experiments in Fig. 6e–h were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NIH. The ATLASsnCre viral vector AAV8-SYTnb-VAMP2Δ-At-BACEcs-AF-Cre and AAV8-BACE-GFP (1:1, 200 nl) were injected stereotaxically into the motor cortex of wild-type mice at (1.0, 2.0, 1.8) (Fig. 6e–h). They also received an injection of a Cre-dependent reporter vector: AAV8-Ef1a-FLEX-tdTomato (Addgene, 28306) into the Str (0.5, 2.0, 4.0) and thalamus (−1.55, 1.5, 3.75). Following a survival time of 2 weeks, animals were perfused and 50-μm sections were cut with a freezing microtome. The following antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry: rabbit anti-RFP (cat. no. 600-401-379, Rockland Immunochemicals), chicken anti-GFP (cat. no. A10262, Invitrogen), goat anti-chicken 488 (cat. no. A32931, Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit 555 (cat. no. A32732, Invitrogen). Sections were counterstained with Neurotrace Blue 435 (cat. no. N21479, Invitrogen) and coverslipped with Aqua-polymount (cat. no. 18606, Polysciences). Slides with 12–15 coronal brain sections were imaged on a Zeiss EpiFluorescence Microscope equipped with Xylis broad spectrum LED illumination (Excelitas Technologies), a Hammamatsu Orca Flash4.0 camera and Ludl stage drive controlled by Neurolucida 360 Imaging software (MBF Bioscience). Images were registered using NeuroInfo v.2022.1.1.

All experiments were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo) weighing 300–400 g were injected with viruses delivered using a micro-infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus) connected to a 33-gauge microsyringe injector attached to a PE20 catheter and Hamilton syringe. Flow rate was 5 μl min−1. Injectors were left in place for 3 min postinjection. Viruses were incubated for 21 days after injection. AAV8-ATLASsnCre was unilaterally injected into the CA1v at: −4.9 mm anteroposterior, ±4.8 mm mediolateral, −7.8 mm dorsoventral (zeroing at skull site). AAV-pCAG-FLEX-tdTomato-WPRE (Addgene; cat. no. 51503) was unilaterally injected into the ACB: +1.2 mm anteroposterior, ±1.0 mm mediolateral, −6.75 mm dorsoventral (zeroing at dura). Injection volume was 100 nl per site. For control experiments animals were injected with AAV-pCAG-FLEX-tdTomato-WPRE unilaterally in the ACB, but no injection was made in the ventral CA1. Photomicrographs were acquired using a Nikon 80i (Nikon DS-QI1, 1,280 × 1,024 resolution, 1.45 megapixel) microscope under epifluorescence controlled by NIS-Elements v.C6.10.01.

Following perfusion and fixation, Brains were sectioned into 30-μm sections on a microtome cooled with dry ice, collected in an antifreeze solution and stored in a −20 °C freezer. The following antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry: Rabbit anti-RFP (1:2,000, Rockland Inc.; cat. no. 600-401-379; Clonality: Polyclonal) and FluoTag-X2 anti-ALFA (1:1,000, NanoTag Biotechnologies; cat. no. N1502).

For experiments to quantify transsynaptic labeling with and without BACE, mCherry-expressing cells were counted within an identical 1-mm2 region over four consecutive 25-μm stained sections of Str. For experiments to quantify activity-dependent transsynaptic labeling, total GFP fluorescence minus background was measured identically in Str sections using ImageJ v.1.49b, Slidebook v.8 and Zen Microscopy v.3.11.

For experiments in Extended Data Fig. 4, wild-type C57BL/6J mice coinfected with AAV8-ATLASsnFLP, AAV8-BACE-HA and AAV8-DIO-ChR2-GFP into the mPFC, and DIO-mCherry in Str were used for slice recording. Details of the stereotaxic surgery are the same as in Figs. 3a–d and 6c,d. Four weeks following injections, animals were decapitated following anesthesia, and the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in an ice-cold dissection buffer (composition 60 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 115 mM sucrose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2; saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2; pH 7.4). Coronal slices of 350 µm thickness were sectioned by a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000s) and recovered for 30 min in a submersion chamber filled with warmed (35 °C) ACSF (composition 119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mM VC). Str neurons surrounded by GFP+ fibers were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51 WI). Patch pipettes (~4–5 MΩ resistance) filled with a cesium-based internal solution (composition 125 mM cesium gluconate, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 2 mM NaCl, 2 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP, 0.3 mM GTP and 10 mM phosphocreatine; pH 7.25; 290 mOsm) were used for whole-cell recordings. Signals were recorded under voltage-clamp mode at a holding voltage of −70 mV for excitatory currents, filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Tetrodotoxin (1 μM) and 4-aminopyridine (1 mM) were added to the external solution for recording monosynaptic responses to blue light stimulation (5-ms pulse, 3-mW power, 5–10 trials).

Experiments in Fig. 4e–h were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School. Injections were performed through a pulled glass at a rate of 30 nl min−1. After injections, pipettes were slowly withdrawn (less than 100 µm s−1) at least 5 min after the end of the infusion. Viruses were injected in two rounds of surgeries to minimize expression competition between ATLAS viruses (that is ATLASsnCre, BACE-HA) and Cre-dependent ChR2. Wild-type animals undergo the first round of surgery between 4 and 8 weeks of age (Fig. 4e–h). Before the start of surgery, presynaptic virus cocktail was prepared by mixing AAV8-hSyn-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-hSyn-BACE-HA in 3:1 ratio (titer is 2 × 1013 gc ml−1 for both viruses). During surgery, presynaptic virus cocktail was injected at three separate sites in V1. In addition, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry or AAV9-CAG-DIO-tdTomato was injected into two separate sites in Str. Then 14 days after the first surgery, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-ChR2-GFP was injected at the same three V1 sites as the first surgery.

Coordinates of V1 injection sites were as follows (coordinates are relative to bregma and dorsoventral is relative to the brain surface, below). Here, 300 nl of presynaptic virus cocktail (AAV8-ATLASsnCre and AAV8-BACE-HA) was injected per site for the first surgery. Then 200 nl of AAV8-hSyn-DIO-ChR2 was injected per site for the second surgery.

V1 site 1: −2.75 mm anteroposterior, ±2.5 mm mediolateral, −0.65 mm dorsoventral

V1 site 2: −3.80 mm anteroposterior, ±2.9 mm mediolateral, −0.65 mm dorsoventral

V1 site 3: −3.80 mm anteroposterior, ±2.0 mm mediolateral, −0.65 mm dorsoventral

Next, 500 nl of postsynaptic virus (Cre-dependent mCherry or tdTomato) was injected at Str site 1 (anterior) while 400 nl of virus was injected at Str site 2 (posterior).

Str site 1: 0.70 mm anteroposterior, ±1.60 mm mediolateral, −2.22 mm dorsoventral

Str site 2: −0.58 mm anteroposterior, ±2.75 mm mediolateral, −2.75 mm dorsoventral

For experiments in Fig. 4e–h, brain slices were obtained from 2- to 3-month-old mice (both male and female) using standard techniques. The experiments closely followed the procedures outlined in previous studies50,51. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation and subsequently subjected to transcardial perfusion with ice-cold ACSF composed of the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 11 glucose (final osmolarity of 300–305 mOsm kg−1). The brain was removed from the skull, placed in ice-cold ACSF and 250–300-μm coronal brain slices were cut and initially placed in a holding chamber for 10 min at 34 °C in a choline-based solution composed of (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 11.6 ascorbic acid and 3.1 pyruvic acid. Following choline incubation, slices were transferred to a second chamber with ACSF at 34 °C for a minimum of 30 min. The chamber was subsequently shifted to room temperature for the duration of the experiment. All recordings were made within 4–5 h of slicing. The temperature was maintained at 32 °C and carbogen-bubbled ACSF was perfused at a rate of 2–3 ml min−1 for all experiments.

Monosynaptically connected striatal neurons were identified by their mCherry-positive or tdTomato-positive somata. Fluorescence-negative neurons with GABAergic interneuron physiological properties (membrane tau decay <0.8 ms for both fast-spiking and persistent low-threshold spiking subtypes; input resistance >500 MΩ in persistent low-threshold spiking subtype) were excluded from the analysis.

Striatal neurons were patched in whole-cell voltage-clamp configurations using borosilicate glass electrodes (3–5 MΩ) filled with cesium-based (voltage clamp) internal solution to measure EPSCs. The solution contained (in mM): 135 CsMeSO3, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl− salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 Na2-phosphocreatine, with pH adjusted to 7.3 using CsOH, resulting in an osmolarity of 295 mOsm kg−1. All recorded neurons exhibited electrophysiological characteristics of spiny projection neurons. All synaptic currents were recorded with a cesium-based internal and monitored at a holding potential of −70 mV. Fluorescent positive and negative neurons were patched as randomly ordered sequential pairs, strictly within one field of view of each other. ChR2-mediated synaptic currents from V1 were optically evoked using 2-ms pulses of 473-nm light at light powers of 2 mW controlled through an acousto-optic modulator.

To assess the baseline connection probability of V1-DMS circuit viruses were injected in V1 at identical locations, titer and volume and at identical times as described above (see Surgery section for Fig. 4e–h). After 4 weeks, brain slices were obtained and patched in whole-cell voltage-clamp configurations as described above. We first found the field of view with maximal ChR2 fiber expression in DMS and randomly patched cells within it. ChR2-mediated synaptic currents from V1 were optically evoked using as above.

Quality control criteria were a stable baseline membrane resistance (variation in Rm < 10%) and a stable baseline resting potential with median standard deviation of ≤0.5 mV across recordings. Optically evoked EPSCs were analyzed post hoc using MATLAB v.2024a.

Experiments in Fig. 1c were performed in three independent cultures; in Fig. 1d, two cultures; in Fig. 1e–g, five cultures; in Fig. 1h, four cultures; in Fig. 1n, ten slices; in Fig. 1o, eight slices; in Fig. 1p, six slices; in Fig. 2b–e, in three independent cultures. Experiments in Figs. 3l and 4b–d were performed in one mouse bilaterally and another mouse unilaterally. Experiments in Fig. 6b were performed in three cultures, in Fig. 6c–h, in three mice and in Fig. 6j–l, in three rats.

Experiments in Extended Data Figs. 1a–h and 2a–g were performed in two cultures; in Extended Data Fig. 6, in two mice; in Extended Data Fig. 7, in three mice. All values are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.

Metrics details

Sex differences in physiological and disease traits are pervasive and begin during early development, but the genetic architecture of these differences is largely unknown. Here, we leverage the human placenta, a transient organ during pregnancy critical to fetal development, to investigate the impact of sex in the regulatory landscape of placental autosomal methylome and transcriptome, and its relevance to health and disease. We find that placental methylation and its genetic regulation are extensively impacted by fetal sex, whereas sex differences in placental gene expression and its genetic regulation are limited. We identify molecular processes and regulatory targets that are enriched in a sex-specific manner, and find enrichment of imprinted genes in sex-differentiated placental methylation, including female-biased methylation within the well-known KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C imprinting cluster of genes expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner. We establish that several sex-differentiated genetic effects on placental methylation and gene expression colocalize with birthweight and adult disease genetic associations, facilitating mechanistic insights on early life origins of health and disease outcomes shaped by sex.

Sex differences in physiological traits and disease risk are pervasive, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Phenotypic and developmental differences between males and females begin before birth, and differences manifest across the life span in disease prevalence, severity, and treatment response1. It has long been known that male fetus-bearing pregnancies have faster fetal growth rate2, higher vulnerability to complications such as pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, premature delivery, and post-partum hemorrhage, and greater risk of perinatal mortality2,3,4. Recent studies have shown that autosomal genetic factors contribute to sex-differentiated phenotypes in adults, with some of these having prenatal molecular foundations1,5. Transcriptional regulation by methylation and gene expression can be a key underlying mechanism of these differences. Thus, investigating how fetal sex shapes the regulation of methylation and gene expression in tissues from early human development can unlock the molecular origins of health outcomes across the lifespan.

Successful fetal development relies on the placenta, a temporary organ during pregnancy at the maternal-fetal interface that exhibits sex differences in function, morphology, and response to environmental exposures6,7,8,9,10,11. Placental dysfunction can lead to pregnancy complications and early programming of diseases that manifest in later life in a sex-dependent fashion12,13. Accumulating evidence suggests that fetal sex-specific placental transcript expression14,15,16,17 and methylation18,19,20 may be among key molecular antecedents to male and female differences in placental function and neonatal outcomes21,22. Studies that integrated placental multi-omics have offered insights into the molecular bases of human complex traits23,24. Yet, to what extent sex influences the genetic regulation of both placental methylation and gene expression is unknown. Whether sex-differentiated placental methylation is linked with gene expression regulation in their nearby genomic region is unclear. Moreover, studies on sex differences in placental methylation and gene expression are rare in ancestrally diverse human populations.

In this study, we investigated the landscape of human placental methylation and gene expression impacted by fetal sex and its relevance to health and disease by integrating genome-wide placental methylation, gene expression, and genotype datasets from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies–Singleton cohort. We report (i) sex differences in placental methylation and its genetic regulation, and in placental gene expression and its genetic regulation; (ii) the biological significance of these sex-differentiated signals through functional annotations and omics integration; and (iii) the impact of these discoveries in advancing the molecular underpinnings of neonatal traits and adult diseases, revealing placental embedding of sex differences in human physiology and pathology.

The discovery analyses employed data from participants of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies–Singleton cohort25. There was no significant sex difference in maternal race/ethnicity, age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, and gestational age at delivery (Supplementary Data 1). Figure 1 provides a flow chart of the study. Briefly, a total of 301 samples (152 males and 149 females) were used to identify autosomal differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) between male and female placentas (sex-DM); a sub-sample of 291 (147 males and 144 females) was used to identify sex-biased methylation quantitative trait loci, which are genetic variants associated with different methylation levels in male and female placenta (sex-mQTL); 80 samples (43 males and 37 females) were used to identify differentially expressed autosomal genes between male and female placentas (sex-DE); and 71 samples (38 males and 33 females) were used to identify sex-biased expression quantitative trait loci, which are genetic variants associated with different gene expression levels in male and female placenta (sex-eQTL). Convergence between sex-biased methylation and gene expression was evaluated, and biological insights were gained through functional annotations. Phenotypic relevance was examined by testing the correlation of sex-DM and sex-DE with neonatal and placental anthropometry traits and through colocalization analysis of sex-mQTL and sex-eQTL with published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci for complex diseases and traits. The novelty of sex-DM and sex-DE was determined by comparing with previous studies. Loci found to be sex-DE, sex-mQTL, or sex-eQTL were further assessed in an independent dataset from the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS; 74 males and 74 females; more than 70% self-identified White; no sex difference in maternal race/ethnicity, age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, and gestational age at delivery; Supplementary Data 1)26.

The workflow summarizes the procedures in identifying sex-biased methylation, gene expression, and genetic regulation in the placenta; functional characterization through assessment of co-occurrence among identified loci and functional annotation using various databases; and illustration of the relevance of the identified loci in disease and health traits in neonates and adults. sex-DM: sex-differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs); sex-DE: sex-differentially expressed genes; sex-mQTL: sex-biased methylation quantitative trait locus; sex-eQTL: sex-biased expression quantitative trait locus; GWAS: a genome-wide association study.

We identified 6077 sex-DM at a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05. Out of the 6077 sex-DM, 41.1% (2497/6077) were previously unreported, and the remaining 58.9% have previously been reported with consistent effect direction18,19,20,27,28,29 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 2). Sex-DM CpGs were two times more likely to be male-hypermethylated than female-hypermethylated (66.9% vs. 33.1%), consistent with previous observations18,19,28.

Each panel includes a Manhattan plot of -log10 P-values and the corresponding quantile-quantile plot of observed vs expected -log10 P-values and genomic control factor (λ). a sex-differences in methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (sex-DM). b sex-biased genetic association with methylation (cis methylation quantitative trait loci (sex-mQTL). c sex-differences in gene expression (sex-DE). d sex-biased genetic association with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (sex-eQTL). Two-sided t tests were performed for (a) using limma with n = 301, df = 299, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment and BACON correction applied for multiple testing corrections. Two-sided t tests were performed for (b) using MatrixEQTL with n = 291, df = 289, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment applied for multiple testing corrections. Two-sided likelihood ratio tests were performed for (c) using edgeR with n = 80, df = 1, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment applied for multiple testing corrections. Two-sided t tests were performed for (d) using MatrixEQTL with n = 71, df = 69, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment applied for multiple testing corrections. Red dots indicate statistically significant results.

We assessed whether the sex-differentially methylated sites are correlated with nearby gene expression more than expected by chance. Methylation at sex-DM CpGs was more likely to be significantly correlated with nearby gene expression in the placenta at FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 than non-sex-DM CpGs on the methylation array (63/3636 vs. 1288/277343; χ2 = 120.6, P = 4.67 × 10−28). An additional 13 CpG-gene correlations were identified by testing the correlation of each sex-DM CpG against all genes within a 200 kb distance. These findings suggest that sex-dependent methylation is not randomly distributed across the genome but is clustered at CpG loci more likely to have impacts on gene transcript levels (Supplementary Data 3).

Differentially methylated sites may be involved in transcript regulation, but their precise effect is likely to depend on the genomic context30. In our data, positive sex-DM CpG-gene correlations (i.e., higher methylation correlated with higher gene expression) were more common than negative correlations. Moreover, the majority of CpGs positively correlated with gene expression were in the gene body, whereas the majority of those with negative correlation were in the gene transcription start site (TSS) (Supplementary Data 3). These findings are consistent with long-known theory and recent evidence that methylation within the gene body is often positively correlated with gene expression, while methylation in TSS is often negatively correlated with gene expression30,31,32,33,34,35,36.

The top four strongest male-hypermethylated CpG-gene and top four strongest female-hypermethylated CpG-gene correlations are presented in Figs. 3a–d and 4a–d, respectively. Among male-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs correlated with gene expression, methylation of cg11291313, located in ZNF300 TSS, and ZNF300 expression showed the strongest inverse correlation (Spearman r (rs) = − 0.56, P = 3.51 × 10−7); and cg02563011, located within CSMD1 gene body (167.4 kb from gene start), and CSMD1 showed the strongest positive correlation (rs = 0.73, P = 3.44 × 10−13). Previously, male bias has been found in a 225 kb locus of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the gene body of CSMD1 and in transcript abundance of CSMD1 in placenta37, although the relationship of the DMRs with CSMD1 transcript abundance was not elucidated. The two CpGs that we found to be correlated with ZNF300 and CSMD1 overlap with predicted active TSS-promoter and enhancer peaks, respectively, based on ENCODE and RoadMap Epigenomic annotations. Among female-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs correlated with gene expression, cg01070760, located in PSMA8 exon (193 bp from gene start), and PSMA8 showed the strongest inverse correlation (rs = − 0.69, P = 3.07 × 10−11); and cg25948255, located within the gene body of CADM2 (504 kb from gene start), and CADM2 showed the strongest positive correlation (rs = 0.65, P = 1.17 × 10−9). The CpG linked to PSMA8 overlaps with a predicted enhancer and with a long-range chromatin interaction loop (based on high throughput chromosome conformation capture, Hi-C) in placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells38. The CpG linked to CADM2 overlaps with a predicted enhancer and active chromatin in EVT cells38 and overlaps with a predicted polycomb-associated heterochromatin by ENCODE and RoadMap Epigenomic Annotations. ZNF300, CSMD1, and CADM2 have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion39,40,41, features mirrored by the invasive, immunologic, and angiogenic properties of placental cells42. ZNF300 methylation has been correlated with placental morphology43, and invasive placental trophoblast cells may drive sex differences at ZNF300 methylation27.

We identified 1839 sex-mQTL consisting of 1529 unique genetic variants and 521 unique CpGs (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 4). The mean (± standard deviation [sd]) distance between the genetic variant and target CpG in a sex-mQTL was 394.3 (± 306.4) kb pairs, suggesting that genetic variants anywhere within the 1 Mb distance can have sex-dependent effects on methylation in the placenta. As expected44, the genetic variant's distance from its associated CpG was inversely correlated with its sex-biased effect on methylation (rs = −0.20, P = 7.32 × 10−19). However, genetic variants may induce epigenetic regulation in the placenta through long-range chromatin interactions38 and distal transcript regulatory elements such as enhancers45,46. Among our sex-mQTL SNPs, 37 SNPs overlap with predicted placental enhancers by Owen et al.46, and 36 SNPs overlap with predicted placental enhancers by Zhang et al.45. The majority of SNPs that showed enhancer overlaps (i.e., 94.5% (35/37) in ref. 46 and 66.7% (24/36) in ref. 45) were more than 100 kb away from the sex-mQTL CpG (Supplementary Data 4).

A sex-QTL association can fall into a sex-specific, concordant, or opposite effect category based on the relative direction and magnitude of the allelic effect in males and females (see Methods section). In a sex-stratified analysis of the 1839 sex-mQTL pairs, 92.5% (1701/1839) had FDR-significant mQTL association in male and/or female placenta and further showed a significant difference in effect estimates between males and females at FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05. Among the 1701 sex-mQTLs with effects that differed by sex, 83.8% (1426/1701) were specific to one sex only, the strongest male-specific effect being for rs12242275/rs7093024-cg09082518 [CCDC6] (βmale(M) = − 0.13, PM = 6.77 × 10−18, βfemale(F) = − 0.0026, PF = 0.49; Pdiff = 1.13 × 10−13; minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5.2%) and the strongest female-specific effect being for rs4351362-cg14735364 [NRF1] (βM = − 0.003, PM = 0.46, βF = 0.12, PF = 1.64 × 10−12; Pdiff = 7.06 × 10−10; MAF = 5.7%) (Figs. 5a–c). Downregulation of CCDC6 in the placenta has previously been linked to preterm deliveries47. NRF1 encodes a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, and its reduced placental expression has been linked to preeclampsia48. 7.9% (134/1701) of sex-mQTLs had concordant effects in males and females (i.e., directionally consistent effects that differ in magnitude), rs530705354-cg14711243[ACAD9] being the top sex-differentiated with a stronger effect in males than in females (βM = 0.27, PM = 1.31 × 10−36, βF = 0.11, PF = 2.45 × 10−10; Pdiff = 9.12 × 10−10; MAF = 6.2%). The remaining 8.3% (141/1,701) sex-mQTLs had opposite effects in males and females, with rs71304466-cg07784293[WWTR1] exhibiting FDR-adjusted association in both males and females and the strongest sex difference (βM = − 0.04, PM = 7.23 × 10−8, βF = 0.01, PF = 3.43 × 10−3; Pdiff = 3.29 × 10−8; MAF = 6%) (Supplementary Data 4). WWTR1 encodes a transcription cofactor that regulates trophoblast cell fate during placentation, and defective expression in the placenta has associations with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia49. 778 sex-mQTL SNP-CpG pairs were available and tested in the RICHS dataset, and 19 were significant at FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 and with consistent effect direction. The strongest male-specific mQTL association identified (i.e., rs12242275/rs7093024-cg09082518 [CCDC6]) was among those replicated in the RICHS dataset (Supplementary Data 5). One of our sex-mQTLs (rs34571066-cg13299927 [ARHGEF10L]) has previously been reported20.

We found 14 sex-DE (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05), of which sex-DE of ANGPT2 has been previously reported20 and 13 were previously unreported (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 6). In the RICHS dataset, 12 sex-DE transcripts were available, and 10 showed directionally consistent sex-DE associations, but none was significant after FDR adjustment (Supplementary Data 6). None of the 14 genes exhibited sex difference in non-placental tissues from the genotype tissue expression (GTEx) portal50, aligning with evidence of poor correlation of sex-differentiated autosomal gene expression between term placenta and 42 non-reproductive adult tissues from GTEx51. None of the sex-DE has placenta-specific RNA expression as compared to other human tissues based on tissue-specificity metrics in the Human Protein Altas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download#protein_atlas_data) or in a placental RNA-sequencing study (Supplementary Data 6)52,53.

We identified 13 previously unreported sex-eQTL (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05), consisting of 13 unique variants and 9 unique gene transcripts (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Data 7). The mean (± sd) distance between a sex-eQTL SNP and target gene was 419.9 (± 216.5) kb pairs, covering a broad region within the 1 Mb genomic window. In a sex-stratified analysis of the 13 sex-eQTL pairs, 92.3% (12/13) had FDR-significant eQTL association in male and/or female placenta and further showed a significant difference in effect estimate between males and females (FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05). All 12 sex-eQTLs exhibited a genetic effect in one sex only, the strongest female-specific effect being for rs79910893-LPCAT3 (βM = − 0.002, PM = 0.96, βF = 1.42, PF = 4.72 × 10−7; MAF = 5.6%) and the strongest male-specific effect being for rs11986287-SLC52A2 (βM = 0.88, PM = 1.26 x 10-12, βF = − 0.03, PF = 0.14; MAF = 5.6%) (Fig. 6a–c). None of the sex-eQTLs overlap with sex-eQTLs in 44 non-placental tissues from GTEx (https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/qtl)50, consistent with evidence that sex differences in genetic regulation of gene expression are highly tissue-specific50,54,55. Out of the 13 sex-eQTLs, only rs10892219-ATP5MG was available in the RICHS dataset and did not exhibit significant association after FDR adjustment.

To identify loci which may concurrently exhibit sex differences in methylation level, gene expression level, genetic regulation of methylation, and genetic regulation of gene expression, we looked for overlaps among our results (i.e., sex-DM, sex-DE, sex-mQTL, sex-eQTL). Only two overlaps were found: (i) A co-occurrence of sex-DM and sex-DE: male-biased cg25364822 methylation at the transcription start site of FNDC5 and female-biased expression of FNDC5. In turn, higher methylation at cg25364822 was significantly correlated with lower FNDC5 expression in males (rs = − 0.36, P = 0.023), but not in females (rs = 0.02, P = 0.91). FNDC5 is a precursor of irisin, which protects the placenta from oxidative stress, dysregulation of placental trophoblast differentiation, and insulin resistance56,57. Lower irisin levels have been linked to preeclampsia56,57, a placenta insufficiency-disorder correlated with smaller placental weight58. In our data, increased cg25364822 methylation and decreased FNDC5 expression were correlated with smaller placental weight (rs = − 0.12, P = 0.04; rs = 0.29, P = 0.01, respectively), suggesting a sex-biased epigenetic process that may regulate gene expression levels that impact placental function. (ii) A co-occurrence of sex-DM and sex-mQTL: male-biased cg27576576 methylation and male-biased association of the G allele of rs6459811 (PTPRN2) with higher cg27576576 methylation. The rarity of overlaps suggests that sex-QTL effects in the placenta are not largely explained by or accompanied with sex differences in methylation or sex differences in gene expression. Similarly, distinct genetic loci have been implicated in sex-biased eQTL and sex-biased gene expression in other tissues50,59. Furthermore, we found significantly high correlations in expression levels of sex-eQTL target genes between males and females (rs = 0.83, P = 0.0083) and in methylation levels of sex-mQTL target CpGs (rs = 1, P < 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 7a, b), suggesting largely non-overlapping sex-dependent placental methylation and gene expression.

As the placenta is a cell-heterogenous organ, we assessed whether the sex-QTL associations were due to sex differences in placental cell composition. We found no significant sex difference in placental cell type proportion derived in silico using methylation data60 or RNA-seq data61 (Supplementary Data 8). Second, cell type proportions were correlated with the top three methylation principal components (Supplementary Fig. 1) and top three RNA principal components (Supplementary Fig. 2), which were regressed out of the methylation and expression data, respectively, prior to sex-QTL analysis. Third, expression variance components (i.e., PEER factors), which may capture cell type signals were regressed out prior to the sex-eQTL analysis. Therefore, the sex-QTLs identified were unlikely to arise from sex differences in placental cell composition.

Male-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs in the placenta were more likely than female-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs to be positively correlated (P < 0.05) with neonatal weight, length, or head circumference (48.4% vs. 0.8%, chi-squared test P = 2.61 × 10−321), whereas female-hypermethylated sex-DM were more likely than male-hypermethylated sex-DM and to be positively correlated with placental weight or placental weight/birth weight ratio (20.3% vs. 3.5%, chi-squared test P = 2.11 × 10−207) (Supplementary Data 2and Fig. 8). Among male-hypermethylated CpGs, ten were positively correlated with all three neonatal anthropometry measures and negatively correlated with placenta-birthweight ratio (CpGs map to EGLN1, FNBP1L, TSPAN14, TEAD1, MIR130A, TMEM223, DOCK9, SLC1A5, DGCR6L, and ST6GALC6 genes). EGLN1 encodes a protein in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and is important for placental development through its role as an oxygen sensor and regulator of HIF1A expression in trophoblast cells62,63. Among female-hypermethylated CpGs, three were positively correlated with placenta-birth weight ratio and negatively correlated with at least two neonatal anthropometry measures (CpGs map to SHANK3, POP4, and GRHL3 genes). SHANK3 encodes a synaptic protein that is crucial for the development of brain circuits64. The SHANK3 gene locus has been implicated in cognitive function measurement and schizophrenia65,66 and in autism spectrum disorders64, which is more commonly diagnosed in males than females67. Placental hypomethylation at a nearby locus (22q13.33) has been linked with autism68, and hypomethylation of our female-hypermethylated CpG in adult blood DNA has been associated with brain gray matter volume69.

The figures display the number of male-hypermethylated (a) and female-hypermethylated (b) CpG sites that are positively correlated with neonatal and placental measures, and the number of male-hypermethylated (c) and female-hypermethylated (d) CpG sites that are negatively correlated with neonatal and placental measures. The measures are head circumference (HC), birth length (BL), birth weight (BW), placental weight (PW), and placental-birth weight ratio (PW/BW). Vertical lines connecting black-shaded circles denote measures that exhibited a shared correlation with the number of CpGs in bars.

We assessed whether the sex-biased loci have previously been implicated in fetoplacental growth. A male-hypermethylated sex-DM at cg10806146 (5'UTR of SLC20A2) has previously been associated with higher birthweight70. Slc20a2 is required for normal placental phosphate transport function in mice, and its deficiency has been linked with defective vascularization, increased calcification of the placenta, and fetal growth restriction71. In addition, three genes near sex-DM CpGs (HSPA4, SLC45A4, and SLC6A2) and two genes near sex-mQTL CpGs (SLC45A4 and ARHGAP26) map fetal genetic variants associated with placental weight in previous GWAS72.

Further, we looked up the sex-biased loci in the EWAS (epigenome-wide association study) Atlas, EWAS Catalog, and GWAS Catalog. Several sex-DM and sex-mQTL CpGs overlapped with CpGs in blood previously reported to be associated with pregnancy complications (e.g., preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus), fetal and child growth, adult complex diseases (e.g., aging), and prenatal environmental exposures. Sex-mQTL genetic variants, genes near sex-DM CpGs, and sex-DE genes have links with GWAS traits in adults (Supplementary Data 9).

To explore the usefulness of sex-QTLs in understanding the molecular basis of complex trait GWAS discoveries, we performed colocalization analysis by integrating sex-stratified QTL in the placenta with GWAS. Among sex-mQTLs, we identified 18 CpGs colocalized with 19 distinct GWAS loci for birthweight (eCAVIAR posterior probability of sharing the same causal variant ≥ 0.01), revealing the importance of sex-differentiated epigenetic mechanisms in the placenta to interpret genetic associations with fetal growth, a sex-differentiated trait tightly regulated by the placenta2. The strongest colocalizations were between cg10611863 (ENTPD4) and birthweight for female-stratified mQTL, and between cg02370022 (CCND1) and birthweight for male-stratified mQTL. Among sex-eQTLs, we identified 4 colocalized gene-adult trait pairs, of which female-stratified eQTLs at ATP5MG and FAM83A colocalized with asthma/hay fever/eczema and breast cancer and male-stratified eQTLs at FAM103A2P and SLC52A2 colocalized with breast cancer and educational attainment, respectively (Supplementary Data 10).

Imprinting, an epigenetic regulation of gene expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner, has well-known roles in regulating placental development and function22,73. Sex bias has been reported in the regulation of imprinted genes in rodent placenta74,75, so we tested whether there is enrichment of imprinting regions among the sex-DM. We found significant enrichment of imprinted genes in sex-DM genes (61 imprinted genes out of 2225 unique sex-DM genes compared to 228 known imprinted genes in the human genome; hypergeometric test P = 2.599 × 10−9). The largest regional cluster of sex-DM CpGs was a 63 kb region in the maternally expressed TP73 gene and the homeobox family genes (HOXA3, HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXB2, HOXB3, and HOXC9), known for their crucial roles in regulating placental and fetal development76. Thirteen of the 61 imprinted genes are known to be imprinted specifically in the placenta only77 (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 11).

The identified imprinting overlaps included a cluster of 13 female-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs within the well-known KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C imprinting domain in chromosome 11p15.5 genomic region. In the human placenta, the KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C imprinting domain harbors genes such as CDKN1C, PHLDA2, and SLC22A18 that are maternally expressed in the first trimester and term placenta, a long non-coding RNA (KCNQ1OT1/kvDMR1) with paternal expression in the first trimester and biallelic expression in term placenta, and other genes such as KCNQ1 which exhibits maternal expression in first-trimester placenta and biallelic expression in term placenta78. The imprinting domain is regulated by a maternally methylated DMR imprinting control region (ICR) located in intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene78. A genetic variant in intron 10 of KCNQ1 has shown a maternal parent-of-origin effect on placental weight72. Out of the 13 sex-DM CpGs, 8 were located within KCNQ1 at 13.7–165.1 kb distance from the ICR and overlap with histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a posttranslational epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional repression. Given these annotations, we assessed whether methylation at the 8 CpGs has a potential sex-dependent relationship with the placental expression of genes in the chr11p15.5 imprinting domain. Higher CpG methylation showed correlation with increased KCNQ1OT1 expression in females and trended with decreased KCNQ1OT1 expression in males (cg03030994-KCNQ1OT1: rm = − 0.26, Pm = 0.12; rf = 0.36, Pf = 0.04), increased CDKN1C expression in females (cg00446023-CDKN1C: rm = − 0.09, Pm = 0.58, rf = 0.35, Pf = 0.046), and decreased SLC22A18 and KCNQ1 expression in males (cg05457684-SLC22A18: rm = − 0.44, Pm = 0.006, rf = 0.04, Pf = 0.83; cg05457684-KCNQ1: rm = − 0.46, Pm = 0.004; rf = 0.05, Pf = 0.79; cg06960356-KCNQ1: rm = − 0.42, Pm = 0.009; rf = 0.14, Pf = 0.45). The KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C domain has been linked to diseases and trait differences. For example, imprinting dysregulation of genes in the KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C domain has been linked to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a disorder of growth regulation characterized by somatic overgrowth and tumor predisposition79. Moreover, increased placental expression of the maternally expressed CDKN1C, PHLDA2, and SLC22A18 genes has been linked with fetal growth restriction and smaller neonatal size80,81,82,83,84. We found that three female hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs showed correlation, albeit weakly, with lower birthweight (cg25548316: rs = − 0.13, P = 0.03), higher placental weight (cg13536051: rs = 0.11, P = 0.048; cg15782852: rs = 0.18, P = 0.002), and higher placenta-birthweight ratio (cg13536051: rs = 0.2, P = 0.001; cg15782852: rs = 0.14, P = 0.02).

Most canonical pathways and hallmark gene sets that were enriched for genes near male-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs differed from those enriched for female-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs (Fig. 9, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 12). The top canonical pathways enriched only in male-biased methylation included extracellular matrix organization, hemostasis, and immune response (e.g., chemokine and Family B G-protein-coupled receptors); pathways enriched only in female-biased methylation included transcription regulation, transportation of small molecules in cells, and regulation of genes involved in metabolism by the tumor suppressor protein TP53. The top hallmark gene sets enriched only in male-biased methylation included coagulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, upregulation of KRAS signaling, myogenesis, and allograft rejection; hallmark gene sets enriched only in female-biased methylation included mitotic spindle, early estrogen response, apoptosis, and glycolysis. For the minority of pathways and hallmark gene sets that overlapped between male- and female-hypermethylated sex-DM CpGs, few or no genes were common between males and females. Such gene set convergence through different genes suggests that male and female placentas may coordinate different CpGs/genes for an essentially identical biological process or potential compensatory mechanisms.

Transcription factor (TF) activity can contribute to sex-biased gene regulation55. We found that several transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are enriched for the sex-biased methylation loci. The identified TFBS are associated with TFs that regulate target genes through diverse mechanisms. Specifically, the sex-mQTL genetic variants were significantly enriched for three TFBS associated with TFs that regulate target genes via functions such as nuclear hormone receptors (e.g., NR2C2), sequence-specific DNA binding (SP2), and epigenetic remodeling (REST) (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). NR2C2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group C member 2) encodes the testicular receptor 4 protein TR4. In vivo mice studies have shown that Nr2c2 plays key roles in fetal growth, early postnatal survival, fertility, and sensitivity to environmental stimuli85,86. Male Nr2c2-null mice exhibit delayed spermatogenesis and reduced fertility86, and females exhibit maternal behavioral abnormalities85. Sex-DM and sex-mQTL CpG genomic positions were significantly enriched for TFBS associated with TFs in the zinc finger family, cell cycle regulation (E2F), sequence-specific DNA binding (THAP), site-specific DNA binding and embryogenesis (AP-2) (Supplementary Fig. 4).

This study offered several unique insights about the landscape of sex differences in the level and genetic regulation of methylation and gene expression in the human placenta. Key findings include the following: (i) Placental autosomal methylation and its genetic regulation are extensively impacted by fetal sex, whereas sex differences in both the level and the genetic regulation of placental autosomal gene expression are limited. (ii) The vast majority of placental methylation sites and gene transcripts impacted by sex-biased genetic effects did not exhibit methylation and gene expression differences by sex. Moreover, methylation sites that were sex-biased were not enriched for predicted TF binding, did not largely correlate with annotated gene expression, and were enriched for molecular pathways largely distinct from previously described pathways related to sex-biased gene expression in placenta14,17. These observations suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie sex-dependent placental methylation, gene expression, and their genetic regulation. (iii) The sex-biased methylation sites overlapped with genetic loci implicated in several human phenotypes. Notably, several sex-differentiated genetic effects on methylation and gene expression in the placenta colocalized with birthweight, and adult traits such as breast cancer and allergic diseases, contributing to the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS signals. These findings suggest the potential role of placenta-mediated sex differences in developmental and later-life physiological traits and diseases.

Many genetic variants showing sex-biased association with placental methylation and gene expression had a single-sex effect, unveiling biological insights that would be masked or attenuated in standard combined-sex QTL studies. One such example is an mQTL near STMN3 (Stathmin-3) (rs1151625-cg14862171), identified previously by a combined-sex analysis of placenta samples87, and was found in the present study to be a sex-mQTL locus conforming to a female-specific effect. The genetic variant's effect on methylation was 45-fold stronger in females than male placenta and 1.29-fold stronger in female than combined-sex sample placenta. These results clarify that the previously reported association based on combined-sex analysis87 was most likely driven by the effect of the genetic variant on methylation in the female placenta only. STMN3 encodes a microtubule destabilizing protein that regulates placentation in early pregnancy in vitro88. The largely distinct sex-DM and sex-DE associations detected in the present study align with a recent report20. Our study implemented more omics-integrated analyses, including directly testing association of sex-DM CpGs with nearby gene expression, identifying sex-eQTL associations, and implementing analyses models that included interaction terms between sex and genetic variants. These approaches yielded unique insights that sex-DM CpGs were more likely to be associated with nearby gene expression alteration and enabled the detection of several previously undetected sex-mQTLs and sex-eQTLs with single-sex effects.

Male fetus-bearing pregnancies are at increased risk for major pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and post-partum hemorrhage, all of which have molecular origins tied to placentation and hemostasis4. In our study, male-biased placental methylation was markedly enriched for the hemostasis/coagulation hallmark gene set that has not previously been characterized as sex-differentiated. The placenta expresses coagulation components involved in hemostasis and placental vascular development89. The male-enriched coagulation hallmark gene set included tissue factor protein inhibitor-2 (TFPI2; aka placental protein 5 (PP5)), an extracellular matrix-associated protein known to be abundantly produced by the placenta and is actively involved in coagulation and hemostasis processes90. Transition to a state of hypercoagulability is maximal around the term to prevent maternal and child health complications due to excessive bleeding91. Our finding suggests that epigenetically induced suppression of coagulation pathways can be one potential explanation for male preponderance in pregnancy pathologies and contributes to emerging knowledge on coagulation-inflammation/immune response crosstalk during pregnancy.

We found a previously unrecognized enrichment of imprinting genes in sex-differentiated placental methylation, including a cluster of female-biased methylation within the KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C imprinting domain implicated in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome78,79. In our data, higher methylation of the female-hypermethylated CpGs was associated with female-specific upregulation or male-specific downregulation of genes in this imprinting domain. These findings suggest a potential crosstalk between sex and imprinting regulation in the placenta. The unique epigenetic architecture of imprinting in the human placenta may be permissive to epigenetic alterations. For example, in the KCNQ1OT1/CDKN1C cluster, loss of imprinting is variable, and gene repression by the KCNQ1OT1 lncRNA is incomplete92. Human placental DMRs are uniquely highly polymorphic73,78,93. Placental DMRs are associated with variable histone marks94 which are mechanistically linked to DNA methylation that influences imprinting stability95 and potentially with underlying genetic variation93. Collectively, these studies and our findings suggest that the imprinting domains may be vulnerable to epigenetic alterations from other factors that influence allelic bias in a sex-dependent manner, but future work should investigate this and its relevance to sex differences in pregnancy physiology and clinical complications.

Our study has limitations. First, placental gene expression and methylation are dynamic over gestation16,17. However, the current study is unable to distinguish sex differences that emerge in early gestation from those that emerge in later gestation because the placenta samples were obtained at or near-term gestation. Second, genetic regulation of methylation and gene expression in the placenta may vary by cell type. We found that in silico-derived placental cell type composition did not vary by sex and did not explain the observed sex-QTLs. Similar to ours, the GTEx study did not find sex differences in cell composition for 41 out of 44 tissues tested50. These findings should be seen in light of the caveat that existing in-silico methods for estimating the cell type composition of the placenta do not fully characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the placenta. Better insights may be gained in the future through single-cell analysis of the placenta from different developmental stages. Third, differences related to sex chromosomes will require future methodological advances that can facilitate analyses that integrate the autosomes with the haploid Y chromosome and dosage compensation of the X chromosome1. Fourth, the detection of sex-eQTLs may have been limited by the sample size of our placental RNA-seq dataset. The inclusion of covariates to account for genetic population structure and cell heterogeneity may have further impacted the study's power in detecting weaker signals. Similar to our findings, the limited sex difference in gene expression regulation has been observed in 44 non-placental tissues from GTEx50 and in adult blood96,97. Moreover, one study demonstrated that samples of millions of individuals would be required to detect sex-biased eQTLs in the blood that appreciably mediate sex-biased genetic associations with complex traits96. Larger datasets and accounting for factors that influence QTLs can improve the transferability of sex-QTLs found to be limited in our study as well as others50,98.

In conclusion, this multi-omics study in the placenta identified sex-specific regulatory processes and molecular pathways and potential crosstalk between placental sex and imprinting. Sex-biased genetic regulation of placental methylation and gene expression colocalized with GWAS loci for neonatal traits and adult diseases, revealing placental embedding of sex differences in human health and disease across the life span.

The RICHS study was approved by institutional review boards of Emory University and Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island.

Datasets from placenta samples obtained at delivery as part of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies – Singletons were included in the discovery analysis. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies – Singletons recruited 2802 pregnant women between July 2009 and January 2013 at 12 clinical sites in the United States from four race/ethnic groups (i.e., non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander) between 8–13 gestational weeks and followed through delivery. To be enrolled, women had to have no past adverse pregnancy outcomes and no major pre-existing medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, chronic hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, or psychiatric disorders. Gestational age was determined using the date of the last menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound between 8 weeks to 13 weeks and 6 days of gestation. After the first ultrasound, pregnant women underwent up to five standardized ultrasounds with measurement of fetal biometry at a priori-defined gestational ages25. Birth weight was measured in grams (g) using an electronic infant scale or beam balance scale, and birth length and head circumference were measured in centimeters (cm). Placenta weight was measured in grams (g). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

Placental biopsies measuring 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm were taken from the fetal side (n = 312) within one hour of delivery, and samples were placed in RNAlater and frozen in − 80 °C for molecular analysis87. DNA extracted from the placental biopsies was genotyped using HumanOmni2.5 Beadchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). For the genotype dataset, detailed quality control procedures have been described previously21,87,99,100. Briefly, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with >5% missing values, minor allele frequency <0.5%, and not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10−4) we removed. SNP genotypes were imputed using the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/) using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 genotype reference (https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/reference/), and filters were applied to remove insertion-deletions, SNPs with minor allele frequency < 0.5% and SNPs with imputation dosage r2 < 0.3. Infant sex (male or female) was obtained from medical charts and was compared with sex predicted based on X chromosome heterozygosity (inbreeding coefficient estimate F > 0.8 male, F < 0.2 female)21,87,99,100.

DNA methylation was profiled on the 312 samples using Illumina's Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Probes which were cross-reactive, non-autosomal, had mean detection P ≥ 0.05, or had CpGs located within 20 base pairs of known SNPs were removed. Samples that had discrepancies between sex obtained from medical charts and predicted from genotypes, were outliers from the distribution of the samples' genetic clusters or had a mismatching sample identifier were removed, as previously described21,87,99,100.

RNA from a subset of the placental samples (n = 80) was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, MA), and RNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2000 system with 100 bp paired-end reads. The reads were mapped to the human reference genome (NCBI/build 37.2) using Tophat version 2.0.4. The raw placental RNA-seq dataset had a total of 33,690 RNA transcripts. Read count data were normalized across libraries using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization technique implemented in the R/Bioconductor package “edgeR”101. Transcripts in autosomal chromosomes without 6 or more reads in at least 3 samples or without depth-normalized counts per million (CPM) of 0.1 or higher in at least 3 samples were removed, as previously described22,87.

The following datasets that passed previously performed quality control filters mentioned above were included in the present analyses: 301 samples (152 males and 149 females) with placental methylation data at 408,680 CpGs were included in sex-DM analysis, of which 291 samples (147 males and 144 females) with fetal genotype data at 5,359,103 genetic variants as well as placental methylation data at 408,680 CpGs were included in sex-mQTL analysis. A total of 80 sub-samples (43 males and 37 females) with placental RNA-seq data at 21,550 transcripts were included in sex-DE analysis, of which 71 samples (38 males and 33 females) with fetal genotype data at 5,337,343 genetic variants as well as RNA-seq at 21,550 transcripts were included in sex-eQTL analysis.

A total of 301 samples (152 males and 149 females) with placental methylation data at 408,680 CpGs were included in the sex-DM analysis. We estimated placental cell type proportion in silico using DNA methylation beta values with the R/Bioconductor package “planet” (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/planet.html)60. Genotype-based principal components (PCs) representing population structure were estimated using fetal genome-wide SNP genotype data. Methylation PCs were estimated using the R package “prcomp”102. To identify sex-differentiated methylation (sex-DM), epigenome-wide analyses were performed with fetal sex as the predictor and placenta DNA methylation at each CpG site as the outcome using the R/Bioconductor package “limma”103. The analysis included linear regression models that were adjusted for self-reported maternal race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian), gestational age at delivery, methylation sample plate (n = 5), the first three methylation PCs, the first 10 genotype PCs to account for population structure, and predicted cell type proportions for six placental cell types60. To account for the inflation of statistical tests, we implemented a Bayesian method to obtain BACON-corrected inflation estimates and BACON-corrected P-values using the R/Bioconductor package “BACON”104. Quantile-quantile (QQ) plots of P-values and the corresponding inflation estimate after BACON-correction (λ = 1.271) are reported in Fig. 2a. BACON-corrected P-values were then controlled for false discovery rate (FDR), giving BACON-corrected FDR-adjusted P-values.

To evaluate relations between sex-DM CpGs and gene expression, we tested whether methylation at each sex-DM CpG is correlated with the placental expression of its closest gene. This test was performed between 3636 sex-DM CpGs located in or near a gene (i.e., in gene body, 3'untranslated region (UTR), 5'UTR, exon, transcription start site (TSS) based on the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome reference annotation; https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway105) and placenta nearby gene expression levels in our dataset. In further exploration, we assessed the correlation between methylation at each sex-DM CpG and placental expression of all genes within 200 kb distance from the CpG site.

A total of 291 samples (147 males and 144 females) with both placental methylation data at 408,680 CpGs and fetal genotype data at 5,359,103 genetic variants were included in the sex-mQTL analysis. Sex-mQTL analysis was performed to identify sex-mQTLs, i.e., SNPs whose effect on placental methylation differs in magnitude between male and female pregnancies. The sex-mQTL analysis was performed in two stages to accommodate the computational burden of the model for analysis in MatrixEQTL106. First, residuals of each methylation site were obtained by running a linear regression model with each methylation site as an independent outcome and race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, methylation plate, 3 methylation PCs, and 10 genotype PCs as covariates. Next, each methylation residual was fit as the outcome in a linear regression model with SNPs within 1 Mb distance and an interaction term between SNP and sex using MatrixEQTL106. The QQ plot of P-values for the SNP*sex interaction term of the mQTL mapping showed the absence of inflation (λ = 1.001) (Fig. 2b). Statistical significance for the interaction term was defined based on FDR-adjusted P < 0.05.

Next, sex-stratified cis-mQTL analyses were performed on the FDR-significant mQTL-CpG pairs in a linear regression model with methylation as outcome, SNP within 1 Mb distance as predictor, and race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, methylation plate, 10 genotype PCs, and 3 methylation PCs as covariates. For pairs found to have FDR-significant mQTL association in either or both males and females (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05, accounting for the total number of mQTL-CpG pairs tested in the two strata), we performed a t-test of the difference between the standardized male-specific and female-specific effect estimates, assuming unequal variance (Pdiff). Lastly, we classified the sex-mQTLs with FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05 into one of the following three categories: (i) concordant effect: association found to be FDR-significant in one sex and nominally significant (P < 0.05) or FDR-significant in the other sex with a consistent effect direction but different magnitude; FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05. (ii) opposite effect: association found to be FDR-significant in one sex and nominally significant (P < 0.05) or FDR-significant in the other sex a with an opposite effect direction; FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05. (iii) Single-sex effect: association found to be FDR-significant in one sex but not nominally significant (P < 0.05) in the other sex; FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05.

A total of 80 samples (43 males and 37 females) with placental RNA-seq data at 21,550 transcripts were included in the sex-DE analysis. Analysis was performed using edgeR, adjusted for race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, and 10 genotype PCs. Quantile-quantile (QQ) plots of P-values and the corresponding inflation estimate after BACON correction (λ = 1.326) are reported in Fig. 2c.

A total of 71 individuals (38 males and 33 females) with both fetal genotype data at 5,337,343 genetic variants and RNA-seq at 21,550 transcripts were included in sex-eQTL analysis. Sex-eQTL analysis was performed in two stages to accommodate the computational burden of the model for MatrixEQTL106. First, residuals of each transcript were obtained by running a linear regression model with each transcript as the independent outcome and race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, 10 PEER factors (i.e., expression variance components)107, 3 RNA PCs, and 10 genotype PCs as covariates. Next, each transcript's residual was fit as an outcome in a linear regression model with SNPs within 1 Mb distance, and an interaction term between SNP and sex using MatrixEQTL106. The QQ plot of P-values for the SNP*sex interaction term of the eQTL mapping showed the absence of inflation (λ = 0.988) (Fig. 2d). Statistical significance for the interaction term was defined based on FDR-adjusted P < 0.05.

Next, sex-stratified cis-eQTL analyses were performed in a linear regression model with gene expression as an outcome, SNP within 1 Mb distance as the predictor, and race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, 3 PEER factors, 4 genotype PCs, and 3 RNA PCs as covariates. The same workflow described for sex-mQTL was implemented to classify the sex-eQTLs with FDR-adjusted Pdiff < 0.05 into concordant effect, opposite effect, or single-sex effect.

The sex-DE, sex-mQTL, and sex-eQTL associations discovered were assessed in a dataset from the RICHS cohort (n = 148; 74 males, 74 females). Mother and infant pairs were recruited following delivery at the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island from 2009 to 2013. The study included infants born small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and controls born appropriate for gestational age-matched on sex, gestational age, and maternal age26. Placental RNA-seq data from a subset of samples (n = 200) were obtained using the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform; placental DNA methylation data (n = 220) were obtained using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array (Illumina); and genotype data for 159 infants were obtained using the Illumina MegaEX array and imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panel. Both sex-mQTL and sex-eQTL analyses were performed on 148 samples (74 male, 74 female) with genotype, DNA methylation data, and RNA-seq data. Of the 1839 SNP-CpG pairs in the sex-mQTL associations discovered in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies cohort, 778 SNP-CpG pairs were available and tested in RICHS. Of the 14 SNP-gene pairs in the sex-eQTL associations discovered, only 1 pair (rs10892219-ATP5MG) was present and tested in RICHS. Of the 14 sex-DE associations discovered, 12 transcripts with RNA-seq data in RICHS were tested. Sex-QTL analyses were performed using linear regression models as in the discovery analysis with adjustment for self-reported ethnicity, methylation or RNA-seq batch, top 10 genotype PCs, and top 3 expression PCs (for sex-eQTL) or methylation PCs (for sex-mQTL). Sex-DE analyses were performed using linear regression models as in the discovery analysis with adjustment for race/ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, and 10 genotype PCs.

For each of our samples, we derived proportions for 6 placental cell types (trophoblast, stromal, Hofbauer, endothelial, nucleated red blood cells (nRBC), syncytiotrophoblast) using methylation data and a reference panel of placental cell counts as implemented in the R package “planet” (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/planet.html)60. We evaluated whether cell type proportions were different between males and females using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P < 0.05/6). We further assessed the correlation between cell proportion and methylation PCs 1-3, which were regressed out of the methylation data during sex-mQTL analysis.

For RNA-seq, we also derived proportions for 27 placental cell types with CIBERSORTx61 based on placental single-cell sequencing reference composed of 19 fetal and 8 maternal cell types108 and tested whether cell type proportions were different between males and females using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P < 0.05/27). We further assessed the correlation between cell proportion and RNA PCs 1-3, which were regressed out of the transcript data during sex-eQTL analysis.

To assess whether a shared causal genetic variant underlies both a complex phenotype and sex-biased gene expression/methylation in the placenta, we performed GWAS-QTL colocalization analysis using the ezQTL Web platform (https://analysistools.cancer.gov/ezqtl/#/home)109. ezQTL performs colocalization analysis using two methods (eCAVIAR and HyPrColoc) by integrating GWAS summary statistics, QTL results, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix data. GWAS summary statistics for birthweight were obtained from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium (https://egg-consortium.org/birth-weight-2019.html). We performed colocalization analysis on the sex-QTL loci separately for male- and female-stratified QTL, each integrated with GWAS summary statistics and LD matrix data from the 1000 G samples (Supplementary Data 13). A sex-QTL locus was tested for GWAS-colocalization provided a given GWAS summary statistics dataset (from 423 publicly available GWAS trait summary statistics available in ezQTL) contains a SNP within 1 Mb window from the QTL lead SNP with a GWAS association P < 5 × 10−8. 63 eQTL-GWAS locus pairs representing 42 unique phenotypes and 96 mQTL-GWAS locus pairs representing 16 unique phenotypes which fulfilled this requirement were tested, separately for males and females. Colocalization was considered significant if eCAVIAR colocalization posterior probability was ≥0.01 or HyprColoc posterior probability was ≥ 0.5 based on a window of 50 SNPs around the GWAS lead SNP, as recommended in ezQTL.

Associations of sex-DM CpGs or sex-DE transcripts with measures of neonatal anthropometry measured at birth (i.e., birthweight, birth length, head circumference) and placental size (i.e., placental weight and placental/birth weight ratio) were tested using the Spearman correlation test. The EWAS catalog (http://ewascatalog.org/)110 and EWASAtlas (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ewas/atlas/index)111 were searched to check whether the sex-DM and sex-mQTL CpGs overlap with previously known EWAS loci. The GWAS catalog v1.0.2 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/; downloaded on December 2, 2021)112 was searched to check whether the sex-eQTL SNPs, sex-mQTL SNPs, sex-DE genes, and sex-DM genes overlap with previously known GWAS loci.

To test the enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the QTL genetic variants, we separately submitted sex-eQTL and sex-mQTL SNPs to SNP2TFBS (https://epd.expasy.org/snp2tfbs/; a web interface for querying genetic variants that affect transcription binding sites)113. The sex-DM and sex-mQTL target CpGs were annotated for regulatory features from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and GENCODE (https://zwdzwd.github.io/InfiniumAnnotation/EPIC_hm450_hg19.html). Enrichment of TFBS in the genomic region flanking 200 bp from sex-DM or sex-mQTL target CpGs was tested using the JASPAR enrichment tool (https://jaspar.genereg.net/)114. JASPAR implements enrichment computations in the LOLA tool to test whether TFBS from the JASPAR database are enriched in our genomic regions of interest compared to CpG probes from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k microarray, separately for the following three sets of CpGs: i) CpGs hypermethylated in males, ii) CpGs hypermethylated in females, and iii) sex-mQTL targets CpG sites. We tested for enrichment of CpG positions with the functional elements DNase 1 hypersensitive sites (DHS), 15-state chromatin marks, and H3 histone marks compared to CpGs on the Illumina 450k array based on functional information from the Consolidated Roadmap Epigenomics database using eFORGE v2.0 (https://eforge.altiusinstitute.org/)115.

Two sets of sex-DM genes (i.e., genes mapping male-hypermethylated CpG sites and female-hypermethylated CpGs) were separately annotated in biological context using the GENE2FUNC option using FUMA, a web-based platform that facilitates functional annotation of GWAS results (https://fuma.ctglab.nl/)116. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using FUMA to test whether the input genes were enriched in GO Biological Process ontology and hallmark gene sets, which are biological states displaying coordinated expression as defined by the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB v7.0).

It's Friday night in the club, and I'm on LinkedIn again. While all the cool kids in the crowd around me are grooving to the bouncy techno beats, I'm just fiddling with my phone.

I swipe open the work-focused social network, scroll through a sea of notifications that indicate which of my connections found which brand's turgid post “insightful,” and finally spot what I'm looking for: Queens. It's one of the little daily logic games available on LinkedIn. Today's unique puzzle will reset at midnight, and if I don't complete it by then, I'll mess up my current streak of playing this game for nearly 100 days in a row. It is 11:56 pm and the band just launched into one of my favorite songs. But I'm locked in, tapping the Queens on my screen.

With all of the anxiety-inducing social services installed on my phone, I never expected stodgy old LinkedIn to be the one to give me FOMO. I'd never spent all that much time on the relatively anodyne site—even when job hunting—but one year ago today, LinkedIn introduced games to its platform, and I have never left.

The puzzles manifest in the form of simple brain teasers, some of them word-based, some of them logic-oriented. LinkedIn Games started with three puzzles—the chess-like Queens, the phrase guesser Pinpoint, and the Wordle-lite Crossclimb. Since then, it has slowly added additional puzzles, including the grid harmonizer Tango and, most recently, the swipey maze game Zip.

“It's a breather for me,” says Peter Rubin, head of publishing at Automattic and a former WIRED contributing editor who is also a self-described giant puzzle nerd. “They're the perfect sort of bite-size things. I don't think about them before. I don't think about them after. That's it.”

You're crushing it on Queens.

When you complete a game, LinkedIn tells you your score, the average time it takes you to solve that game, and which of your connections have played. (I reached out to Rubin because LinkedIn told me he played nearly every day, just like me.) There isn't a real ranking system, though if you do well enough, LinkedIn will congratulate you by saying you've done better than some percentage of CEOs on the platform.

“I just instantly got hooked,” says Tavonne Thomas, a photographer in London. “Listen, when it says you are smarter than a certain percent of the CEOs, I can't help but feel good about myself that day.”

The move to add games was inspired by hits like Wordle and the absolute puzzle juggernaut that is the games division of The New York Times. A year ago at launch, I was skeptical and called LinkedIn's efforts “a little bit of a ripoff” of Times games. Insiders wouldn't totally disagree. Lakshman Somasundaram, who runs LinkedIn's games division, video, and other internal efforts to boost site engagement the company calls “moonshots,” admits they did indeed take inspiration from the puzzle behemoths before them.

“A lot of credit to the Times,” Somasundaram says. “We are standing on the shoulders of giants at the Times who have done an incredible job.”

Then he pivots to head off my very obvious next question of why LinkedIn? Why put games on a website primarily meant for finding jobs, building a professional brand, and sometimes rolling your eyes at cringeworthy posts by out-of-touch business bros?

“I like to think of it as we are very much playing our own game,” Somasundaram says. “We want LinkedIn to feel like the world's best workplaces. We need to find a way to bring that fun element onto our platform.”

Gamifying LinkedIn may conjure up flashbacks to early 2010s era Facebook, when the likes of FarmVille and Mafia Wars spread like a plague across all your weird uncle's feeds. But the goal for LinkedIn's games, Somasundaram says, is to be more precise. He wants games to be quick and simple to understand but interesting enough to tease your brain, spark conversations, build connections, and, of course, entice you to stick around on LinkedIn a while longer. For some people (yes, me included) that has worked out quite well. For me and many others, the games have become more of a priority than the other services on LinkedIn.

“I was on there to look at cringe and to look at just what everybody was posting,” says Kelli Frye, an accountant and data analyst in Tennessee. “Then all of a sudden I realized, oh, I'm just really interested in puzzles.”

Frye's favorite games are Queens and Tango. She says that while she plays them every day, they haven't led to much in the way of connections on the platform. Though people in her real life have certainly heard of them.

“I talk to friends about the puzzles, but they don't do them,” Frye says “But they're like, you're very much obsessed and we love that for you.”

It takes one to Tango.

Andrew Shaw, an engineer, had occasionally used LinkedIn to try to find a job but soon became smitten with the games on the platform.

“I've been hooked ever since,” Shaw says via email. “I've never gone on LinkedIn so much as in the past six months. I feel like I have to play every morning. Often from the toilet at work. I want to keep up my win streak for all the games.”

Shaw is in so deep that he started a LinkedIn group called I'm Just Here for the Puzzle Games. At the time of this writing there are 104 people in the group but only three posts in the group's newsfeed, including one by me asking whether anyone wanted to talk for this story. No one replied, but I should have known better, because clearly the group lives up to its name.

“I figured there must be others like me,” Shaw says. “Not on LinkedIn to share some cringey hiring story or half-hearted comment on a sappy story. Or now strangely sharing political views! I'm just there for the puzzle games.”

In an era rich with generative tools that could be used to instantly create puzzles with a simple prompt, LinkedIn's games feel organic and human. That's because none of the puzzles are computer- or AI-generated; every board is thought through and designed by a puzzle master. Crossword creator Paolo Pasco is LinkedIn's games editor. Thomas Snyder, a puzzle creator and sudoku champion, helps craft logic puzzles like Queens and Zip.

In the comments of each game you'll find dozens of people posting their scores using Wordle-style blocks of emoji. They also tend to discuss methodology for how best to tackle a puzzle, boost their scores, and better their time.

“The solver encounters a path while they're solving that almost makes it like they're having a conversation back with me,” the puzzle creator Snyder says. “I've left a trail of breadcrumbs in the forest, and now they've followed it to find where the cabin is.”

The platform's dedication to games doesn't sit quite so well with some LinkedIn users.

Mitchell Tan, who runs a messaging service that he says was born out of hatred for LinkedIn's inbox, finds the existence of LinkedIn's games frustrating. He says he uses the platform to find and secure business connections who will then go on to buy services from him. But connecting and talking directly on LinkedIn feels more difficult to navigate than it should be, and to Tan, LinkedIn putting resources into efforts like games ignores people using the platform to make a living.

“​​LinkedIn is where you make money,” Tan says. “There's a lot of leverage here. These people are not random teenagers on TikTok, they're VPs of sales who make millions of dollars a year, and they actually read your stuff if it's good enough. You have really fancy CEOs and VCs posting all day, and so you have access to commercial influence. That's why we're here.”

As an example, he takes issue with games like Zip, which the user can play in a desktop browser using the arrow keys on their keyboard. But the arrow keys don't work to navigate LinkedIn's inbox, which he feels is a misuse of resources that prioritizes a more frivolous feature over the parts used by LinkedIn's power users.

“What the heck is this multibillion-dollar company doing?” Tan says. “We are literally making this platform valuable. In the world of people hustling and trying to build their business, the idea of coming to LinkedIn for entertainment is kind of odd.”

Despite asking several times, LinkedIn wouldn't share any specific numbers about how many people engage in games on the platform, other than to say that 830,000 people have subscribed to its daily Games newsletter and that “84 percent of players return the next day after playing.” Does that mean games are a net boon to LinkedIn's wider services? Maybe.

“A lot of real life is solving problems that may or may not have an answer,” Snyder says. “A puzzle is a pretty organized thing that should have an answer if you just get about doing it. Puzzles are a small way to get into thinking about life.”

“LinkedIn is one of the few social media outlets that doesn't feel tainted to the point of unusability,” Rubin says. “Games don't interrupt it or pollute the play experience with a lot of other things, with pop-ups or trying to pull you to this part of the site. It's a very easy thing to go into and get out five minutes later.”

“The work day is hard. Job hunting is harder,” says Thomas, the photographer. “So being able to take a break, but also do something you can achieve and finish quickly, is a good reward.”

Richard Liverman is a UK consultant who has built a following off his cheeky blog posts and curated Spotify playlists based around trying to solve LinkedIn's category-guessing game Pinpoint. As a self-anointed “King of Pinpoint,” Liverman says engaging in a tongue-in-cheek bit based on LinkedIn's games has led him to connections with upwards of 200 people on the site.

“LinkedIn is getting better, but it can be a little bit stuffy,” Liverman says. “You know what it's like when you're networking, you can tell people that are really trying and it's just almost uncomfortable. So Pinpoint and all the games, I think it's allowed people to network and communicate in a much more fun way.”

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is pissed off at Apple. Really, really pissed off. 

In Rogers' newly released 80-page decision, she took Apple and its executives to task for defying the court's orders in its original case with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Though Apple largely won that round, as it was determined the tech giant was not a monopolist, the court decided that Apple was behaving in an anticompetitive fashion in one specific area: by not allowing app developers to offer their customers other ways to pay outside of Apple's own payment platform.

The judge ruled that developers should be able to link to other ways to make purchases from inside their apps, so they could process payments via their own website and payment systems. In doing so, developers should have been able to forgo paying Apple's 30% commission on in-app purchases.

Apple, however, made it even more onerous for any developers who chose this option. It only dropped its commission to 27% for these outside purchases and added “scare screens”: warnings to dissuade customers who may have been tempted to go the route of outside purchases. With only a 3% discount off Apple's original commission, this method could end up costing developers even more when their own payment processing fees were taken into consideration.

As a result, Apple protected its lucrative App Store business model at the expense of its reputation, its relationship with the iOS developer community, and its good standing in the eyes of the law.

In Rogers' decision, it's clear she's had enough of Apple's tactics, and the ruling is full of juicy tidbits where she clearly expresses so. 

Apple responded to the court's ruling with the following statement: “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.”

If you don't have time to read all 80 pages yourself, we've rounded up some of the best bits below. 

“Apple's response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up (the 2024 evidentiary hearing).”

“In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath.”

“Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly …The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.”

…

“As Mr. Schiller was not advocating for a commission, and Mr. Maestri was fully advocating for the lucrative approach, Mr. Cook was the tie-breaker.” 

(Anyone notice that Maestri isn't at Apple anymore, by the way?) 

“This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.”

“Apple engaged in tactics to delay the proceedings. The Court later concluded that delay equaled profits.”

“Ultimately, Epic and Apple hired three special masters to review Apple's privilege claims after its re-review. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1191.) Apple's production positions, after its dissembling at the evidentiary hearing, revealed that delay worked to its advantage.”

…

“THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that Apple's abuse of attorney-client privilege designations to delay proceedings and obscure its decision-making process warrants sanction to deter future misconduct. Apple is SANCTIONED in the amount of the full cost of the special masters' review and Epic's attorneys' fees on this issue alone through approximately May 15, 2025, the anticipated date of completion. The parties shall meet and confer on the actual amount due.”

“In its most simple configuration, ‘linked-out purchases' after the Injunction are purchases made off the Apple platform, but from which a consumer can leave the platform using a link on the app. Now, under the revised Guidelines, Apple not only charges developers ‘a 27% commission,' but also expanded the scope of the commission requirement by demanding a 27% commission on digital goods and services transactions that take place on a developer's website upon immediate use of the link, and payment for any ‘digital goods and services transactions that take place on a developer's website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link … to an external website.' … Apple hid its decision-making process from the Court only to have it uncovered at the second evidentiary hearing in 2025.”

…

“Apple coded its activities relating to Injunction compliance as ‘Project Michigan' … When the Ninth Circuit issued its stay of the Injunction on December 8, 2021 (Dkt. No. 841), Apple appears to have ceased any compliance efforts.”

“Despite the fact that the Court now has evidence that Apple investigated the landscape, knew how it would harm developers, and understood it would not comply with the goal of the Injunction, Apple nonetheless determined at the June 20, 2023 meeting that it would charge a commission on link-out purchases, although it had not yet decided what that commission would be … Apple's knowledge and consideration of these issues was hidden from the Court and not revealed until the 2025 hearing.”

“The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of Finance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even went so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables to estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that developers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out purchases.”

…

“Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose on linked-out purchases:

Q. And I take it that Apple decided to impose a 27 percent fee on linked purchases prior to January 16, 2024, correct?

A. The decision was made that day. 

Q. It's your testimony that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it's going to impose on linked purchases?

A. That is correct.”

“Another lie under oath: contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple's plan, including the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023.

Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies. They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken (although Apple did request that the Court strike other testimony). Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court.”

“Apple deployed a warning message, referred to as a ‘scare screen,' to deter users from using third-party payment options.”

…

“The screen on the right is called a ‘sheet,' which is a full screen takeover after the user clicks on an externallink. Moving left to right, the warning level to the user increases. Again, Apple chose the most anticompetitive option, namely the full screen takeover.”

…

“Again, Apple decided on the most anticompetitive option, that is, the ‘even worse' option of including the developer's name rather than the app name. All of this was hidden from the Court and not revealed in the May 2024 evidentiary hearings.”

“Few developers signed up for the link entitlement program (external purchase links).”

“As of the May 2024 hearing, only 34 developers out of the approximately 136,000 total developers on the App Store applied for the program, and seventeen of those developers had not offered in-app purchases in the first place. In May 2024, Apple argued that it would take more time for developers to take advantage of the Link Entitlement and that the adoption rates could not be known.  Apple attempted here to mislead.”

“There are several issues with Apple's argument. First, it is ludicrous to expect any court to repeat the contents of a 180-page order issued in conjunction with a simultaneously issued one-paragraph injunction. The latter flows from the former. To suggest otherwise strains credulity. Second, even limited to the four corners of the Injunction, Apple violated the literal text. Third, contrary to Apple's position, other courts within this and other circuits will look to the spirit of the injunction when a litigant applies a dubiously literal interpretation of the injunction, particularly where that interpretation is designed to evade the injunction's goals.”

…

“In short, Apple's conduct lacks any justification: it does not comport with the text of the Injunction, requires a strained and questionable interpretation of that language, completely ignores this Court's 180-page Injunction and the Ninth Circuit's 91-page opinion, and prompted lies on the witness stand. The law requires that Apple be on notice of the scope of permissible conduct to hold Apple in civil contempt.”

“Apple's justifications for these requirements (set forth above) strain credulity. Most notably, and to underscore Apple's meritless justifications, Apple does not require developers selling physical goods to apply for a link entitlement before deploying link-out transactions. Apple imposes these restrictions only for link-outs that compete with IAP.”

“Apple's conduct violates the Injunction. The non-compliance was far from ‘technical or de minimis.' Apple's lack of adequate justification, knowledge of the economic non-viability of its compliance program, motive to protect its illegal revenue stream and institute a new de facto anticompetitive structure, and then create a reverse-engineered justification to proffer to the Court cannot, in any universe, real or virtual, be viewed as product of good faith or a reasonable interpretation of the Court's orders. The Court HOLDS Apple in civil contempt. Sanctions and relief with respect to Apple's noncompliance are set forth infra Section IV.”

…

“Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court's Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple.”

Why not treason? Any lawyers know?


reply



The same reason almost no one is ever charged with treason, given the plethora of other criminal charges available to anything that might remotely be similar to treason: Article III, Section 3 of the US Constitution: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.”Even where the first part (in which, it should be noted, the terms involved are interpreted very narrowly) is not problematic, the “two witnesses"" rule, which is applied independently to each fact necessary to sustain the conviction, is usually quite difficult to overcome, so its usually vastly easier to get a conviction for something else.

Trump appointee Darren Beattie requested records regarding a large list of high-profile names, organizations, and right-wing buzzwords for a “Twitter files”-style document dump about alleged conservative censorship.

A previously unreported document distributed by senior US State Department official Darren Beattie reveals a sweeping effort to uncover all communications between the staff of a small government office focused on online disinformation and a lengthy list of public and private figures—many of whom are longtime targets of the political right. 

The document, originally shared in person with roughly a dozen State Department employees in early March, requested staff emails and other records with or about a host of individuals and organizations that track or write about foreign disinformation—including Atlantic journalist Anne Applebaum, former US cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, and the Stanford Internet Observatory—or have criticized President Donald Trump and his allies, such as the conservative anti-Trump commentator Bill Kristol. 

The document also seeks all staff communications that merely reference Trump or people in his orbit, like Alex Jones, Glenn Greenwald, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In addition, it directs a search of communications for a long list of keywords, including “Pepe the Frog,” “incel,” “q-anon,” “Black Lives Matter,” “great replacement theory,” “far-right,” and “infodemic.”

For several people who received or saw the document, the broad requests for unredacted information felt like a “witch hunt,” one official says—one that could put the privacy and security of numerous individuals and organizations at risk. 

Beattie, whom Trump appointed in February to be the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, told State Department officials that his goal in seeking these records was a “Twitter files”-like release of internal State Department documents “to rebuild trust with the American public,” according to a State Department employee who heard the remarks. (Beattie was referring to the internal Twitter documents that were released after Elon Musk bought the platform, in an attempt to prove that the company had previously silenced conservatives. While the effort provided more detail on the challenges and mistakes Twitter had already admitted to, it failed to produce a smoking gun.)

“What would be the innocent reason for doing that?” Bill Kristol

The document, dated March 11, 2025, focuses specifically on records and communications from the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub, a small office in the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy that tracked and countered foreign disinformation campaigns; it was created after the Global Engagement Center (GEC), which had the same mission, shut down at the end of 2024. MIT Technology Review broke the news earlier this month that R/FIMI would be shuttered. 

Some R/FIMI staff were at the meeting where the document was initially shared, as were State Department lawyers and staff from the department's Bureau of Administration, who are responsible for conducting searches to fulfill public records requests. 

Also included among the nearly 60 individuals and organizations caught up in Beattie's information dragnet are Bill Gates; the open-source journalism outlet Bellingcat; former FBI special agent Clint Watts; Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister; Daniel Fried, a career State Department official and former US ambassador to Poland; Renée DiResta, an expert in online disinformation who led research at Stanford Internet Observatory; and Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who briefly led the Disinformation Governance Board at the US Department of Homeland Security.

When told of their inclusion in the records request, multiple people expressed alarm that such a list exists at all in an American institution. “When I was in government I'd never done anything like that,” Kristol, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, says. “What would be the innocent reason for doing that?”

Fried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn't collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I've never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.” 

He adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.” 

Both GEC and R/FIMI, its pared-down successor office, focused on tracking and countering foreign disinformation efforts from Russia, China, and Iran, among others, but GEC was frequently accused—and was even sued—by conservative critics who claimed that it enabled censorship of conservative Americans' views. A judge threw out one of those claims against GEC in 2022 (while finding that other parts of the Biden administration did exert undue pressure on tech platforms). 

Beattie has also personally promoted these views. Before joining the State Department, he started Revolver News, a website that espouses far-right talking points that often gain traction in certain conservative circles. Among the ideas promoted in Revolver News is that GEC was part of a “censorship industrial complex” aimed at suppressing American conservative voices, even though GEC's mission was foreign disinformation. This idea has taken hold more broadly; the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing titled the “Censorship-Industrial Complex: The Need for First Amendment Safeguards at the State Department,” on April 1 focused on GEC. 

Most people on the list appear to have focused at some point on tracking or challenging disinformation broadly, or on countering specific false claims, including those related to the 2020 election. A few of the individuals appear primarily to be critics of Trump, Beattie, or others in the right-wing media ecosystem. Many have been the subject of Trump's public grievances for years. (Trump called Krebs, for instance, a “significant bad-faith actor” in an executive order targeting him earlier this month.)   

Beattie specifically asked for “all documents, emails, correspondence, or other records of communications amongst/between employees, contractors, subcontractors or consultants at the GEC or R/FIMI” since 2017 with all the named individuals, as well as communications that merely referenced them. He sought communications that referenced any of the listed organizations.  

Finally, he sought a list of additional unredacted agency records—including all GEC grants and contracts, as well as subgrants, which are particularly sensitive due to the risks of retaliation to subgrantees, who often work in local journalism, fact-checking, or pro-democracy organizations under repressive regimes. It also asked for “all documents mentioning” the Election Integrity Partnership, a research collaboration between academics and tech companies that has been a target of right-wing criticism. 

Several State Department staffers call the records requests “unusual” and “improper” in their scope. MIT Technology Review spoke to three people who had personally seen the document, as well as two others who were aware of it; we agreed to allow them to speak anonymously due to their fears of retaliation. 

While they acknowledge that previous political appointees have, on occasion, made information requests through the records management system, Beattie's request was something wholly different. 

Never had “an incoming political appointee” sought to “search through seven years' worth of all staff emails to see whether anything negative had been said about his friends,” says one staffer. 

Another staffer calls it a “pet project” for Beattie. 

Beattie delivered the request, which he framed as a “transparency” initiative, to the State Department officials in a conference room at its Washington, D.C., headquarters on a Tuesday afternoon in early March, in the form of an 11-page packet titled, “SO [Senior Official] Beattie Inquiry for GEC/R/FIMI Records.” The documents were printed out, rather than emailed.

Labeled “sensitive but unclassified,” the document lays out Beattie's requests in 12 separate, but sometimes repetitive, bullet points. In total, he sought communications about 16 organizations, including Harvard's Berkman Klein Center and the US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), as well as with and about 39 individuals. 

Conservative critics have long accused the State Department's Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub of helping to censor the American right.

Notably, this includes several journalists: In addition to Bellingcat and Applebaum, the document also asks for communications with NBC News senior reporter Brandy Zadrozny. 

Press-freedom advocates expressed alarm about the inclusion of journalists on the list, as well as the possibility of their communications being released to the public, which goes “considerably well beyond the scope of what … leak investigations in the past have typically focused on,” says Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Rather, the effort seems like “a tactic designed to … make it much harder for journalists to strike up those source relationships in the first instance.”

Beattie also requested a search for communications that mentioned Trump and more than a dozen other prominent right-leaning figures. In addition to Jones, Greenwald, and “RFK Jr.,” the list includes “Don Jr.,” Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk, Marine Le Pen, “Bolsonaro” (which could cover either Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, or his son Eduardo, who is seeking political asylum in the US), and Beattie himself. It also asked for a search for 32 right-wing buzzwords related to abortion, immigration, election denial, and January 6, suggesting a determined effort to find State Department staff who even just discussed such matters. 

(Staffers say they doubt that Beattie will find much, unless, one says, it's “previous [FOIA] queries from people like Beattie” or discussions about “some Russian or PRC [Chinese] narrative that includes some of this stuff.”)

Multiple sources say State Department employees raised alarms internally about the records requests. They worried about the sensitivity and impropriety of the broad scope of the information requested, particularly because records would be unredacted, as well as about how the search would be conducted: through the eRecords file management system, which makes it easy for administrative staff to search through and retrieve State Department employees' emails, typically in response to FOIA requests. 

This felt, they say, like a powerful misuse of the public records system—or as Jankowicz, the disinformation researcher and former DHS official, put it, “weaponizing the access [Beattie] has to internal communications in order to upend people's lives.”

“It stank to high heaven,” one staffer says. “This could be used for retaliation. This could be used for any kind of improper purposes, and our oversight committees should be informed of this.”

Another employee expressed concerns about the request for information on the agency's subgrantees—who were often on the ground in repressive countries and whose information was closely guarded and not shared digitally, unlike the public lists of contractors and grantees typically available on websites like Grants.gov or USAspending.gov. “Making it known that [they] took money from the United States would put a target on them,” this individual explains. “We kept that information very secure. We wouldn't even email subgrant names back and forth.”

Several people familiar with the matter say that by early April, Beattie had received many of the documents he'd requested, retrieved through eRecords, as well as a list of grantees. One source says the more sensitive list of subgrantees was not shared.  

Neither the State Department nor Beattie responded to requests for comment. A CISA spokesperson emailed, “We do not comment on intergovernmental documents and would refer you back to the State Department.” We reached out to all individuals whose communications were requested and are named here; many declined to comment on the record.

Five weeks after Beattie made his requests for information, the State Department shut down R/FIMI. 

An hour after staff members were informed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio published a blog post announcing the news on the Federalist, one of the outlets that sued the GEC over allegations of censorship. He then discussed in an interview with the influential right-wing Internet personality Mike Benz plans for Beattie to lead a “transparency effort.”  

“What we have to do now—and Darren will be big involved in that as well—is sort of document what happened … because I think people who were harmed deserve to know that, and be able to prove that they were harmed,” Rubio told Benz.

This is what Beattie—and Benz—have long called for. Many of the names and keywords he included in his request reflect conspiracy theories and grievances promoted by Revolver News—which Beattie founded after being fired from his job as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration when CNN reported that he had spoken at a conference with white nationalists. 

Ultimately, the State Department staffers say they fear that a selective disclosure of documents, taken out of context, could be distorted to fit any kind of narrative Beattie, Rubio, or others create. 

Weaponizing any speech they consider to be critical by deeming it disinformation is not only ironic, says Jankowicz—it will also have “chilling effects” on anyone who conducts disinformation research, and it will result in “less oversight and transparency over tech platforms, over adversarial activities, over, frankly, people who are legitimately trying to disenfranchise US voters.” 

That, she warns, “is something we should all be alarmed about.” 

Conservative critics have long accused the State Department's Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub of helping to censor the American right.

First party accessories generally are the most reliable, but they can be pretty pricy and some of the stuff third party manufacturers are putting together are real cool. 8Bitdo is one of the bigger names in third party controllers these past couple console generations, leveraging hard into nostalgia with a lot of options that reflect the controller designs of yesteryear. However, the 8Bitdo Pro 2 Bluetooth controller is the company playing straight. This is just a solid, modern controller for your Switch or PC meant to be a solid alternative to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, and right now it's only $39.

Layout-wise, the 8Bitdo Pro 2 controller closely resembles the original Super Nintendo controller. The D-Pad is a dream come true for platformer lovers. The controller adds in modern design elements such as having dual analogue sticks on bottom matching that of the PlayStation family of controllers. It also has grip handles to prevent your hands from cramping. I have an older version of this controller which lacks the handles, and let me tell you. As much as I love playing with it, I can only do it in short bursts before my hands begin to hurt. The grips are a welcomed addition.

See at Amazon

The controller has more of everything you'd expect on a modern day controller from rumble vibrations to motion controls. It's compatible with the Switch, but can also be used with a Steam Deck via Bluetooth, the 2.4g adapter, or a USB cable or it can be used with any Windows PC with the 2.4g adapter or USB cable.

If you're upgrading from your Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers to this 8Bitdo one, a massive improvement you'll find is with the Hall Effect stick. The Joy-Cons notoriously do not stand up to the test of time, with many users reporting various levels of stick drift in which the controller registers directional input even when its not being touched. This results in you character running endlessly to the side or the camera spinning out of control. Hall Effect is quickly becoming the new industry standard for joystick manufacturing and its is much more reliable. You won't experience anymore stick drift.

The 8Bitdo controller also has two pro back paddle buttons which can be assigned to any input. You can also set up custom profiles for different buttons configurations. This is great for siblings with different preferences who share controllers or for single owners when your preferred button paddle assignment differs between games. Just swap between your profiles on the fly.

These are all situations in which you might decide you need a new Windows 11 Pro build. It's always a good idea to have a copy around, even if you don't think you'll need it. Because as soon as you don't think you do, you will. And right now, thanks to this deal from StackSocial, you can get one or multiple keys at an absolutely mind-boggling price.

See at StackSocial

Head on over to StackSocial to take advantage of a $15 Windows 11 Pro activation key, marked down from $199. That's a whopping 92% off, and maybe one of the best deals we've ever seen on the platform. You can choose from Windows 11 Pro or Home editions, with Home 89% off from its normal price of $139. Why not buy both at this price? There is one thing to keep in mind here, however. These keys are for PCs that need a new Windows license. Your PC must be compatible and must be able to use Windows Update to install the free Windows 11 upgrade first.

Windows 11 Pro is super versatile, at least as far as operating systems go.

It combines advanced security, usability, and productivity-enhancing tools to make a must-have OS, and you'll notice it's a much sleeker experience than previous Windows releases.

This version of Windows 11 Pro comes with lifetime access. It also has tons of built-in software like Microsoft Teams, Widgets for quick updates, and more as well as the AI-powered Windows Copilot, which you can use via taskbar or shortcuts to summarize websites, make setting adjustments, create images, or even help you with code.

 May 01, 2025  

Food allergies increased a child's risk for being bullied, according to a new study published in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 

Children who said they had been bullied also had a higher prevalence of mental health and allergic conditions such as anxiety and asthma than their peers who had allergies but had not been subject to harassment. Experiencing bullying was also associated with a previous history of food allergy reactions at school or other public places. 

Most incidents of reported bullying took place inside or around school and were perpetrated by schoolmates. Roughly one quarter of respondents said teachers and school staff were the offenders, a finding in other studies as well. 

“With food allergy management, we focus a lot on physical safety,” but a child's mental, emotional, and social health are sometimes warrant equal attention, said Lisa Bartnikas, MD, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, and senior author of the study. 

Bartnikas and her colleagues conducted a cross-sectional survey of nearly 300 parents and their children aged 5-17 years who had food allergies. A little over one third of children reported having been bullied owing to their food allergies. Overall, approximately 1 in 4 of children aged 6-18 years say they have been bullied, according to a 2024 report from Institute of Education Sciences. 

Respondents were recruited from Boston Children's Hospital and on social media outlets. Bartnikas said that the findings may not be generalizable, because the children were primarily White (about 89%) and had parents with relatively high family incomes (80% had an annual household income of $100,000 or more). 

Children with anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were more at risk for harm from their peers. About 31% of bullied children were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, compared with roughly 9% of those who had not been bullied, the survey found. 

“If you're bullied, that might make you more likely to feel anxious,” Bartnikas said. “And if you're someone who's presenting as more anxious, that can make you more likely to be a target of bullying.” 

Coexisting allergic conditions associated with an increased risk for bullying included asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome, which can cause severe gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting. 

Children who had ever experienced severe or public reactions, such as having an allergic event at school or staying in the hospital overnight, were more likely to be bullied. 

Reported physical acts of bullying included waiving a food allergen in front of the child's face (29%), throwing the item at them (19.4%), touching them with it (12.9%), property damage (12.9%), physical attacks (9.7%), and putting the allergen inside their food (6.5%). Children also experienced teasing, social exclusion, threats, and having rumors spread about them. 

“One child I treated with multiple food allergens was devastated because he was excluded from a social group event and was told that he was not wanted — that because of his food allergies he was ‘too difficult and the other kids couldn't eat what they wanted,'” said Elizabeth Lippner, MD, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not associated with the study.

About 60% of kids reported feeling depressed or anxious as a result of harassment. About half said they felt embarrassed or experienced loneliness. Children also reported feeling worthless, experiencing fatigue, and getting poor grades in school. 

Clinicians should ask patients about how school is going and if anyone is making them feel bad about their allergy, especially if they have risk factors noted in the study, Bartnikas said. If a clinician senses the child is being bullied, they should also screen for mental health issues, she said. 

“In my practice, we try to screen every child with a food allergy for bullying at least once per year,” Lippner said. “It is built into my note template so that all healthcare team members are reminded to address this.” 

The study adds to previous literature showing that kids who are bullied because of their food allergies experience a decline in quality of life. Other research has shown that allergic conditions such as asthma increase the risk for bullying. Clinicians can work with families to develop coping strategies, provide referrals to mental health treatment, offer antibullying resources, and advise parents to notify their child's school, Bartnikas said. 

“I recommend that parents talk to the school in detail to make sure the bullying is handled in such a way so that it does not draw unnecessary or unwanted attention to their child being bullied and so that their child can gain a sense of confidence and control over the situation,” Bartnikas said. 

Bartnikas and Lippner report no relevant disclosures. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Two former U.S. Men's National Team stars have warned Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney not to sign an American player for the sake of it in order to capitalize on Wrexham's growing popularity Stateside.

Since the debut of the FX docuseries Welcome To Wrexham in 2022, the Red Dragons have become something of a cultural phenomenon in the U.S. Following Hollywood stars Reynolds and McElhenney's journey as owners of the Welsh soccer team, fans around the globe have tuned in across three series' as Wrexham have gone from National League minnows to Premier League dreamers.

Wrexham's notoriety in the U.S. prompted Phil Parkinson's side to travel across the pond during their 2023 and 2024 preseasons, with newfound Red Dragons fans from across the country flocking to see them in action. However, while the prospect of signing a USMNT star could help fuel their growth in America, former internationals Herculez Gomez and Kasey Keller don't believe it should be done for the sake of promoting the team.

“If the good people of Wrexham, who understand TV and understand marketing and understand how to promote things, didn't see it fit to have - at any level - an American, I don't think it's necessary that they have an American now,” Gomez suggested on ESPN FC's Futbol Americas.

As for Keller, he added, “To me, it's not about the token American. To me, it's about finding the right player. If that right player happens to be American, fine, no problem. I'm not a fan of tokenism at all. I want to see Wrexham, clearly they have had success - there is no issue of thinking: ‘Hey, would this sell a couple more jerseys in California?' I think they are doing it the right way.”

Having recently confirmed their third straight promotion, this time to the Championship via a 3-0 win against Charlton Athletic, Wrexham will soon likely look to add to their already experienced roster ahead of their first season in the second division since 1982.

Yet to be linked with any USMNT stars, they have been suggested as a potential landing spot for several other international stars, including Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, Arsenal's Raheem Sterling, Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester United's Jonny Evans, and Rangers' Tom Lawrence, according to the Daily Mail.

That being said, whoever is ultimately brought in to bolster their team ahead of what will undoubtedly be a tough season, Parkinson has made it crystal clear that they have a “no superstar” policy in place.

“I think that a lot of tough decisions will be made this summer, in terms of who we bring in and how we add to this fantastic squad of lads we've got, but let's see if we can build a squad to compete at that level,” he explained, via ESPN.

“I think it's interesting because the jump in salaries is incredible, mind-blowing. Even coming up to this level [League One], the jump to get players of Championship quality is expensive but obviously with the next level, I don't think people outside football quite realise.

“They think players in League One must be multi-millionaires, but the drop-off from what people read about Premier League players when they come down, is huge.

“That is a challenge, but what we've always tried to do is make sure the culture in the club is right and I think that's key - no superstars, no egos in the dressing room and we've got to try and get that balance right again.”","{'href': 'https://www.themirror.com', 'title': 'The Mirror US'}","soccer"

Manchester City cannot get ahead of themselves and need to stay on their toes when they travel to the United States to participate in the Club World Cup between June and July, Pep Guardiola has said.

City will feature in the 32-club tournament and represent the Premier League alongside Chelsea as Guardiola's side prepare for the new season, giving the Blues another opportunity to claim silverware after reaching the FA Cup final last weekend.

Goals from Rico Lewis and Josko Gvardiol helped Manchester City to a 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup semi-final as the 2023 treble winners edge closer to an eighth FA Cup title in the club's history.

     

After failing to challenge for the Premier League title for only the second time since Guardiola was appointed manager in 2016, Manchester City can do with every bit of competitive football to earn their spark back ahead of the new campaign.

“We will see how we finish the season and see how we arrive in that tournament together and then we will see what happens. Normally whenever I start a competition for example like the Premier League, never do I start thinking ‘Oh, we are going to win etc',” Guardiola said in an in-house club interview.

“So, one step at a time, try to play better than we played in the league, arrive in better conditions everyone and after we see. What's happening today in football, even in domestic leagues, there are different managers, different cultures, different styles and ways to play and of course you play teams from Oceania, Asia, South America.”

City take on Wolves in the Premier League this weekend and Guardiola will know the importance of taking one game at a time as his side look to continue their rich vein of form and take one step towards qualification for next season's UEFA Champions League.

Josko Gvardiol has stressed on the importance of the Club World Cup in Manchester City's preparations for the 2025-26 season and has called on his teammates to give the competition the respect it deserves when City do fly out to the United States in June.

Guardiola added: “It (Club World Cup) is a new one and that's why its football, right? It's not always the same style, it's different visions, different types of players, that's culture so that's nice.”

Manchester City have a big summer ahead and have been allowed by the Premier League to register new signings for a 10-day period between 1-10 June – before they begin their Club World Cup campaign – when they will come up against Wydad AC, Al Ain and Juventus to begin with.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is coming to Miami, and with it, an unparalleled opportunity that surpasses anything this city has ever encountered. This isn't just a sporting event—it's a cultural and economic transformation with the potential to reshape the future of our community – if not the entire region.

Let's make one thing abundantly clear: the World Cup has the capacity to outshine events like the Super Bowl, Art Basel, Formula 1, or college championships.

Consider the impact of the 2020 Super Bowl. It generated a staggering $572 million in economic value in just one day. Now, fast-forward to 2026. We're talking about a month-long, globally televised tournament. Hundreds of thousands of visitors from all corners of the world will converge on Miami during the summer—a time traditionally known for a tourism lull.

Early estimates indicate the economic impact could reach $1.3 billion, and I'll stress again: this is a conservative estimate. Between 700,000 and 1 million visitors will flood Miami during June and July, driving substantial demand for accommodations, dining, and local services. The revenue generated from just tourism taxes alone could easily justify the investment in hosting this global spectacle.

But it's not just about the dollars. The media exposure Miami will receive from the World Cup is unprecedented. Experts predict hundreds of millions in media value from broadcasting and global branding. This is the kind of international spotlight few cities ever see. For Miami, it's a rare opportunity to showcase our vibrant culture, hospitality, and unique identity – to an audience of billions.

Beyond the immediate economic surge, the World Cup will leave an enduring legacy. FIFA's legacy program will drive significant investments in youth sports, education, public health, infrastructure, and sustainability. These initiatives will directly benefit our community, especially young people, and improve the quality of life for years to come.

This is not a distant hope—it is a reality. Miami fought hard to secure the World Cup, going head-to-head with global powerhouses. We won, and now it's our responsibility to deliver on that promise.

Supporting the World Cup is not a matter of debate—it's a clear, common-sense decision for Miami's future. This is not about politics or controversy; it's about coming together as a community—across all sectors—government, business, and residents alike—to make this event a resounding success.

The countdown has begun, and the world is watching. This is our moment to prove to the world that Miami is not just a city—it's an international hub of culture, innovation, and passion.

The time to act is now. Let's show the world why Miami is unlike anywhere else.

Francisco Cerundolo advanced to his second career Masters 1000 semi-final with an impressive comeback win over Jakub Mensik.

The Argentine star has proved himself to be one of the best clay-court players on the ATP Tour in 2025, winning more matches (16) than any other player on the surface.

He picked up a big win in the fourth round, as Cerundolo stunned Alexander Zverev in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3.

He then made his way through to his first Masters 1000 semi-final in three years, with a comeback win over Jakub Mensik, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2.

However, while Cerundolo and Mensik provided some thrilling action in Madrid, the match may be better remembered for highlighting a ‘ridiculous' issue which continues to plague the sport.

The two Adidas athletes turned up to their Madrid Open quarterfinal match in identical kits.

In doing so, fans watching around the world struggled to tell the difference between the two players throughout.

Many took to X to share their thoughts on the ‘ridiculous' kit clash.

“This is ridiculous,” said one fan.

“Tennis is so ridiculous sometimes,” added another.

Cerundolo & Mensik: same shorts, shirt, wristband. Same cap, worn in the same way. Same shoes and socks. Not helpful for viewers..

One fan suggested the choice of attire wasn't ‘helpful' for the viewers.

“[Francisco] Cerundolo and [Jakub] Mensik: same shorts, shirt, wristband,” they said.

“Same cap, worn in the same way. Same shoes and socks. Not helpful for viewers.”

“Unwatchable even for a diehard tennis fan,” said one disgruntled viewer on X.

“Imagine a casual observer tuning in. Tennis has got to be the stupidest sport sometimes.”

Several other fans called for a rule change, after seeing Cerundolo and Mensik battle it out.

we gotta stop with these kit clashes in tennis man, I look down for a minute and I just forget who's who.

“We've got to stop with these kit clashes in tennis man, I look down for a minute and I just forget who's who,” said one fan.

“This is just horrible to watch, and should be illegal in any sport.”

“This is so unhinged,” added another.

“Ban wearing the same outfit immediately.”

The same issue occurred during Jack Draper's win over Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final earlier this year, as the two Nike athletes wore the exact same kit.

The problem, from a distance at least, seems to have a very simple solution. Ban players from wearing the same kits.

Every major tennis apparel company has more than one kit available to use, so there could be a simple rule in place to prevent players from taking to the court with an identical outfit to their opponent.

If players chose to be stubborn about who of the pair needed to change, the decision could be made by ranking, forcing the lower-ranked player to swap into a different kit.

It remains to be seen if ATP Tour officials will look into such a change, but there certainly seems to be some real demand for a solution.

Cerundolo won't be too bothered by the kit drama, having booked his place in the Madrid Open semis with a thrilling win over Mensik.

Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Cerundolo looked ahead to his last four encounter with Norway's Casper Ruud.

“Playing Casper [Ruud] in the semi-finals is going to be a super tough match, I think it's 5-3, the head-to-head, but we play on clay maybe four or five times, 2-2 or 3-2 to him, I think,” he said.

“It's going to be a fight tomorrow. I saw him today, he's playing really good this week, I think he hasn't lost a set, so it's going to be a fight again.”

The clay head-to-head record is level at 2-2, although Ruud has won their previous two matches on the surface.

Ruud beat Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals to book his place in the semi-finals and looked dominant throughout.

Only time will tell if Cerundolo can retake the lead in his clay head-to-head with Ruud when they face off for a place in the Madrid Open final.

Cerundolo and Ruud will play their Madrid Open semi-final match on Friday, May 2.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Jack Draper will be in the top five of the ATP rankings for the first time in his career on Monday.

The British number one confirmed he will leapfrog Novak Djokovic after reaching the semi-finals of the Madrid Open.

Draper beat Italy's Matteo Arnaldi 6-0, 6-4 in their last eight encounter on Thursday.

The fifth seed will now face either Lorenzo Musetti or Gabriel Diallo on Friday for a place in the final.

By beating Arnaldi, Draper has ensured he will be at least fifth in the latest ATP rankings.

As well as overtaking Djokovic, he has also equalled a feat previously achieved by another tennis great.

Draper is only the second left-handed player to be ranked in the top five this century.

He follows in the footsteps of 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal.

It is 20 years since the former world number first entered the top five back in May 2005.

Nadal would not leave the top five positions on the rankings for the next decade.

Reflecting on his win over Arnaldi, Draper told Sky Sports: ""I feel stronger every time I play.

""Against these guys I used to feel like I would be the one on the back foot, the one defending, so the next part of my game was getting capable physically to do the things I know I can do and bully these guys.

""I have been doing everything in all areas pretty well and am excited to keep on going. Hopefully it keeps coming together.

""You see guys like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have no fear and so I just want to go after it, I suppose.

""My forehand is doing a lot of damage and I want to keep it up.

""I know I can win any match and lose any match. I am fearful I could lose but that helps me compete the way I do.""

Draper's ascension to the top five is the latest achievement in an already impressive year for the Brit.

The 23-year-old won his first ATP Masters 1000 title at the Indian Wells Open back in March.

After reaching the final, he saw off Denmark's Holger Rune to clinch the title.

Draper could add another such victory this weekend, with either Francisco Cerundolo or Casper Ruud waiting if he makes the final.

The second match in Aix-en-Provence saw back-to-back French upsets, if you go by seeding. Borna Coric conquered Rinderknech in a heated straight-set battle, 7-6 (3), 6-4. Rinderknech struck nine aces to Coric's zero, but the Croat won all first-serve points in the second set to maintain an unbeaten record against the Frenchman.The final Frenchman to take the court was Moutet, who began Thursday by completing his first-round match against Pavel Kotov. The two battled to 7-5, 3-6, 5-5 on Wednesday—during which Moutet reported receiving death threats from Kotov.Upon restarting, Moutet won eight of ten points to edge out the Russian. There was no handshake exchanged between the two players at net.

Awful Announcing

Bored of complaining about TNT Sports' relationship with the NBA, Charles Barkley turned his attention to the French Open.

As Inside the NBA was winding down very early Thursday morning, Ernie Johnson read a promo for Roland-Garros, also known as the French Open, which will air on TNT Sports later this month. And as Johnson read the promo proudly, touting the new partnership between TNT Sports and Roland-Garros, Barkley offered some thoughts on the French Open's more official name.

“Probably the last time we'll run that promo” – Ernie Johnson 🤣 pic.twitter.com/lNAA3W9vWR

— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) May 1, 2025


“Changing that from French Open to Roland-Garros is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard,” Barkley ranted.

“Stop. Stop,” Johnson interjected before reminding Barkley, “We're trying to keep a nice relationship with our new partners!”

Barkley, however, cannot be tamed.

“We gave them $60 million a year, we've been good for them,” Barkley fired back. “We gave them $60 million a year, they can shut the hell up.”

“Wow,” Johnson said with surprise. “Probably the last time we'll run that promo.”

TNT Sports begins a 10-year, $650 million deal with the French Open, or as Chuck likes to call it, Roland-Garros, this month. The partnership was announced last June, serving as part of TNT's sports blitz in the wake of losing its NBA game package.

Despite Barkley's newfound disdain for the name, the French Open has been known as Roland-Garros since 1928, which is when the tournament moved to Roland-Garros stadium. But what appears to have changed is the way it's being promoted in the United States.

NBC previously carried the tournament for 41 years and it was branded as the French Open, with Roland-Garros more often appearing as a secondary name. Since joining TNT Sports, however, the tournament is seemingly being promoted by its more official name, Roland-Garros.

Maybe this was at the request of the tournament. Or maybe the decision to promote it as Roland-Garros was made by TNT Sports executives. Barkley may have been a bit harsh in his wording, but he's right. Especially in their first year carrying the tournament, every graphic, commercial and ad read on TNT should mention “French Open” alongside Roland-Garros. Because if Barkley didn't know the French Open has long been called Roland-Garros, chances are others seeing these ads were similarly unaware.

The thwock thwock of tennis ball on racket echoes around Rouken Glen. They come from a practice session under a watery sun in the south of Glasgow. They are the shots, though, that have been heard around the world.

Aidan Moody, at 21, has played in two Australian Opens, has served and volleyed at Wimbledon, represented Team GB and is heading to a world finals in Kazakhstan next week.

His coach, Gary Smith, once helped Andy Murray on his rise to the very top and also played at elite level, representing his country.

They are bound together by a tennis story that is profoundly inspiring. Both have faced challenges, indeed still do. Both have found tennis to be a healing balm.

Moody was diagnosed with autism at four. He found tennis at his primary school. It has led him towards a new, fulfilling life. He competes in the learning disability category. This is part of the Australian Open schedule. ‘We play on the courts of the Open during the tournament. In front of the crowds, in front of the cameras,' he says after practice ends for the day.

Now in the top ten in the world, he has qualified for the Australian Open twice. He was put out in the quarter-finals last year and in the semis this year. He finished runner-up in the doubles on both occasions.

‘The Australian Open is the only major that has a learning disability category at the moment,' says Smith. ‘But I believe the other majors will follow.'

Moody has, though, played twice in competitions at Wimbledon but not under the banner or at the same time as the prestigious tournament.

He is now preparing for the LD Virtus world tennis championships in Kazakhstan from May 3-11. He will travel with other members of Team GB.

It has already been a spectacular journey. ‘This is my third time representing Team GB,' says Moody. ‘It is an honour to represent your country and I am very proud to pull on the jersey with the flag.'

He enjoys travelling to and playing in tournaments in Britain and abroad. ‘It's always a good atmosphere with different players from around the world.'

It has led to a meeting with Andy Murray, his hero. ‘He was coming off court after a session at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton and he looked tired. But he gave me a chance to take a photograph and wished me good luck. He's my idol and I look up to him. To be in the NTC is great, but to meet Andy...'

Moody and his father, Stephen, a mortgage adviser, have already banked special memories. This year at the Australian Open they met and chatted to Jim Courier, who is now a commentator but is also a grand slam winner. Ben Shelton, the American player, also stopped for a chat in the tunnels that link courts in Melbourne.

Young Moody has been enthused by all this but he has a focus. ‘My ambition is probably building up my world ranking,' he says. ‘I am in the top 10 and I want to go further — top five, top three. See where it goes.'

He has been coached by Smith for six years. Moody was introduced to tennis when Giffnock tennis club did an outreach programme at Our Lady of the Missions primary school in Thornliebank.

‘I was just nine then but I enjoyed it so much,' says Aidan. ‘I fell in love with the sport and joined Giffnock.'

He benefited from coaching there and also attended a dedicated session every week with Glasgow Disability Tennis.

His link with Smith began after his previous coach moved away from Giffnock. The Smith brothers have serious form in coaching. Leon captained Team GB to a Davis Cup victory and also coached Murray as a teenager with Gary helping out. Leon is head of men's tennis at the LTA. Toby is now national manager for players aged 16 and under at Tennis Scotland.

Gary has been with the best. He regularly hit with Murray and has coached 11 players who have played in majors at junior and elite level. However, he has also had to deal with a brain injury inflicted in a mugging 20 years ago.

Now 44, he has to manage his time and efforts. ‘The mugging changed how much I could play,' he says. ‘I initially came back from that but for periods I could not go on. I didn't have PTSD because I had no memory of my incident. I know it could have cost me my life but I moved on mentally very quickly.

‘Physically it took me a good while to get up and about. But then I won a few tournaments here and there.'

However, he adds: ‘The damage to the brain grew into something over the years and it became problematic. Doing continuous session after session without a break was taking its toll. I was getting more tired. I had to take periods of time off coaching. That was difficult.'

The collaboration with Moody, though, has been invigorating. ‘It is a new challenge,' says Smith. ‘He was entrusted to me when his previous coach moved from Giffnock. I was more than happy to take him on. We got on well very straight away. It's all about creating relationships with players.

‘We were just working away before any notion of grand slams came on the horizon. I didn't want to know the details of his disability. For me, he was just another player and every player has things he or she must work on. I have coached a lot of players and I find it easier with him, to be honest.

‘He is constantly improving. There is a boom in LD sport and he is ready to profit for that. He has achieved success early on. In my experience, he is also a better person as well as a better tennis player.'

Smith points out that the other grand slam tournaments at Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows and Roland Garros are like to follow Australia's lead in including LD tennis.

‘This is going to grow and Aidan at 21 is living it now. He will be one of the pioneers of this sport,' he says.

Stephen Moody watches the practice from the sidelines. He has travelled the world with his son.

‘When we go to Australia, I take it as part of my annual leave and obviously we have to fund it,' he says. He has been repaid in experience. ‘It is wonderful to walk about the Australian Open with the credentials lanyard on and bumping into the greats. Andy Murray was wonderful with Aidan too at the NTC.'

The greatest reward, of course, is to witness his son finding satisfaction and even joy. ‘Tennis has been simply brilliant for him,' he says. ‘He had great pals at primary school but at high school he was pretty much isolated and not through anybody's fault. Tennis has helped him cope with all of that and he now has a good group of friends locally as well as the many friends he has met through tennis. He loves travelling with Team GB. He is the youngest but it's a welcoming environment.'

Aidan's mother, Amanda, a teacher, says: ‘Tennis has had a huge impact on him. He was extremely quiet at school. He didn't have a lot of confidence. Tennis has been a bit of a lifeline for him. It has given him a platform to succeed. He has found something he is good at, he has found something he has a passion for. That really helped his confidence and self-esteem.'

This all unfolds in front of one's eyes at Rouken Glen. Moody plays with focus, determination and undiluted passion. His demeanour when he leaves court is quiet but there is that hint of satisfaction that glows after a productive session.

Most wonderfully, though, there is the sense of a young man taking on the world despite his problems. It is humbling to realise that having learning difficulties does not mean one can't teach the rest of us a lesson.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

He's also shared new single ""Old Phone"" to celebrate the news.

	The forecast for Ed Sheeran fans is looking especially bright this week, as the megastar is entering his “big pop” era with new album Play.


	After much teasing, Sheeran has announced on Thursday (May 1) that his eighth studio album will be released on Sept. 12 via Gingerbread Man Records and Atlantic Records, marking his first full-length effort since 2023's Autumn Variations. The record will feature the Persian-influenced hit “Azizam,” which peaked at No. 3 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart in April and No. 28 on the Billboard Hot 100.


	“Play was an album that was made as a direct response to the darkest period of my life. Coming out of all of that I just wanted to create joy and technicolour, and explore cultures in the countries I was touring,” he wrote in part of the new album in an Instagram post. “It's a real rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish, it encapsulates everything that I love about music, and the fun in it, but also where I am in life as a human, a partner, a father.”

	










A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)


	The announcement also coincides with the release of emotive single “Old Phone,” which was preceded by the launch of a new Instagram account on Tuesday (April 29). With dozens of never-before-seen pictures, texts and lyric notes, @teddysoldphone offers an intimate look back through the four-time Grammy winner's mobile phone that he retired a decade ago, including snaps with Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and more.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I wrote the song ‘Old Phone' on my own at 2am whilst jet lagged in India finishing the album, and recorded it that morning,” Sheeran shared on the account. “It feels like a song that should've been on my debut album, but also a song I couldn't have written until I experienced real life things happening to me.”


	A tracklist for Play has yet to be announced; pre-orders are available via the musician's official website. The album's neon pink artwork, meanwhile, features a manifesto of sorts: “Play is leaving the past behind. Play is colourful. Play is dancing. Play is nostalgic. Play is mirror images,” it reads.


	“Play is capturing moments. Play is knee jerk reactions. Play is telling people you love them while you have the chance. Play is longing. Play is getting lost in the night. Play is everlasting. Play is youth. Play is a gift. Play is now.” See the artwork below.


	In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this year, the 34-year-old revealed that Play will form part of a coordinated series. “When I was like 18, I had an idea for 10 albums. It's Plus, Multiply, Divide, Subtract, Equals and then Play, Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind and Stop,” he explained.  

	











	“So, I wanna do my 10 and then every now and then do a side project,” added Sheeran, who has released the aforementioned Autumn Variations and 2019's No. 6 Collaborations Project and in addition to his mathematical series.


	In May, Sheeran will kick off an extensive European tour in support of his new LP. Kicking off in Madrid, Spain on May 30, he will perform in stadiums across the continent through September, with support from rising British star Myles Smith.


	Sheeran made a surprise appearance at this year's Coachella festival with the creation of his bespoke pop-up British pub, The Old Phone, where he performed the song live for the first time.

""It can't even be called music,"" the embattled rapper spewed of Cole. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Ye (formerly Kanye West) hasn't let up when it comes to repeatedly taking shots at J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar. During a livestream on Wednesday (April 30), West claimed he hates Cole's music and disparaged the Compton rapper along with Lamar's fans.


	“I hate J. Cole. It can't even be called music. I hate J. Cole,” Ye told Toronto rapper Top5. “And it's something about both J. Cole and Kendrick that kinda, that leaves me sorta like — it reminds me of each other and s–t like that. It's just not that sauce to me.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Ye continued that if anyone in the room with him at that moment was a J. Cole fan, he didn't want them to tell him because otherwise, he'd devalue their opinion. The embattled rapper then turned his attention back to Lamar and took shots at any fan who would list the Pulitzer-winning rapper as their GOAT.


	“Anybody that say Kendrick is one of their favorite rappers, don't know about rap, doesn't know about real rap,” he claimed.


Billboard has reached out to J. Cole and Lamar's reps for comment.


	Cole and Kendrick have been frequent targets for Ye when he's been lashing out at his peers during recent rants on X. 


	“I DON'T LIKE KENDRICK LAMARS MUSIC,” he wrote in March. “HE RAPS VERY GOOD BUT I DIDNT NEED TO HEAR HIM ON CARTI ALBUM.”


	While there's plenty of history between Cole and West, the Chicago native — who has faced widespread criticism for his repeated hate speech — claimed in early April that Cole's music was for “virgins” and he's “hurting hip-hop.”


	“I hate J Cole music so much,” West said matter-of-factly on X. “It's like between Kendrick and J Cole I bet you industry plants asked J Cole to diss Drake then we would have been accosted with a J Cole Super Bowl commercial with no SZA song to save it… No one listens to J Cole after loosing [sic] their virginity.”


	Kanye also dissed J. Cole last year with his “Like That” remix. “Play J. Cole get the p—y dry,” he raps on the track. Cole has jabbed at West on multiple occasions in the past. He previously checked him on 2016's “False Prophets” and 2019's “Middle Child,” saying he feels West hasn't lived up to the billing of his legend status.


	However, following the repeated shots, Cole took the high road and showed Ye love during his set at Dreamville Fest 2025 in April, where he saluted West for clearing samples for him throughout his decorated career. 

	











	“I know n—-s feel a way about him right now, but I got love for [Ye] and I really appreciate him. He cleared all these f—ing samples for me,” he said.


	On the music front, Ye is staying busy. He uploaded his lost 2022 Donda 2 album to streaming services for the first time on Tuesday night (April 29).

Noise begets noise begets noise: when everything is content, is anything real?

This analysis is part of Billboard's music technology newsletter Machine Learnings. Sign up for Machine Learnings, and other Billboard newsletters for free here.


	Last week, I had a drink with a source who works in music marketing. They showed me their latest handiwork: a TikTok page where every post features their client's song paired with an AI-generated video of a scenic landscape. I promised them anonymity, so I can't share these videos, but rest assured — all of them were convincingly realistic.


	My source has started paying a fan to post hundreds of these AI videos — generated in seconds using OpenAI's video tool, Sora — to TikTok to promote their artist's new single, with the hope that at least one of the videos will go viral. And they're not the only ones experimenting with AI to automate digital marketing. I also recently met with RHEI, a company that claims its proprietary AI agents — AI systems that can make decisions and take actions — can generate lyric videos and populate fan pages for artists without anyone lifting a finger. Already, music companies like Symphonic, Lyrical Lemonade and MNRK use RHEI's products. Though this technology is still in its infancy, using AI agents or video generators is clearly the super-charged next step for what's known as “fan page marketing,” which is the promotional method du jour in 2025. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Music marketers have complained for the last few years that social media, especially TikTok, is oversaturated with content and music, and that breaking through the noise is becoming harder. Their response to this, almost universally, has been to combat the noise by turning up the metaphorical volume even louder. Nowadays, asking artists to post “did I just make the song of the summer?” videos isn't enough. Now, marketers are promoting artists by circulating thousands of repurposed interview and livestream clips, user-generated content remixes, memes, live videos and — increasingly — AI-generated videos on “fan pages” run or paid for by the artists' team. Typically, this is all still coupled with classic influencer campaigns where various content creators are paid to make videos to a song, often without disclosing that these are paid advertisements. 


	More is also more in the world of streaming. In 2018, Luminate reported that about 45,000 songs were uploaded to Spotify daily. Five years later, in 2023, Luminate said that number had grown to 120,000. In some ways, it's a beautiful thing — it's easier to release a song than ever before, allowing countless DIY artists chances at success they never would have had otherwise. But it's also led to what Lucian Grainge, chairman/CEO of Universal Music Group, has called a “content oversupply,” of which he said, “AI has already been a major contributor.” 


	Major-label artists have some part in this too. Taking advantage of streaming's infinite shelf, top artists have started to release longer and longer albums. Migos' 24-track Culture II (2018), Rae Sremmurd's 27-track SR3MM (2018) and Drake's 25-track Scorpion (2018), are all popular, early examples of this phenomenon which is now common to see across all genres. More recently, Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, The Kid LAROI and Taylor Swift have all released projects that span more than 30 tracks — something which rarely happened in the days of CDs and cassettes, given those formats' physical limitations. 


	Major artists are also trying to capture attention in the age of “content oversupply” by releasing alternate versions of albums and songs, and more remixes than ever. Take Republic Records signee Ariana Grande. She released 12 versions and remixes of her single “yes, and?' last year (including sped up, slowed down, a capella, extended, and instrumental variations), five versions of “we can't be friends (wait for your love),” five versions of “the boy is mine” and six versions of the album those songs are on, eternal sunshine. 


	This strategy has bled over to vinyl, too. Over the last year, Swift, for example, released 36 different vinyl editions of varying colors and contents of The Tortured Poets Department to continue to engage fans and to further its monetary (and chart) success. 


	In the end, for artists and their teams, there's no strong downside to any of these marketing strategies on social media, streaming services or physical products, and thus, they're likely to persist and keep growing. The more songs on an album, the higher the likelihood that fans will stream them — and generate the significant royalties that come with it. And if a single's a capella version doesn't do well, that's not a problem: it's virtually free to silence the instrumentals on a track and put that result on streaming services. Why not try? Even a few curiosity listens from major fans make it worth it. On social media, the main result of a big fan page and creator campaign push is the appearance of a groundswell of support for the artist. The only danger is that this appearance is a facade.


	It's true that constant promotion can wear out fans. I've seen it from time to time, especially with excessive vinyl variants, but really, with fans' attention being pulled in so many directions at every moment, how many of them will notice just how big all the promotion has become? And how many of them are even aware that some of the fan pages and influencer co-signs they see are part of that campaign anyway? 


	Streaming services have started to take the effects of saturation seriously — Spotify is now curbing mass uploads and SoundCloud is de-monetizing AI tracks — but that's not enough to stop the flood, especially not as AI music and content creation surges. Deezer reported last week that 18% of its daily uploaded songs are now fully AI-generated, nearly double the count it reported in January. Sora, meanwhile, became so popular after its release in December that, a few days later, it had to pause users' ability to make new accounts, citing extremely high demand. 


	Surely, there's some limit to how hard the music business can push these pro-saturation tactics. But I also believe this might just be the new state of the internet, where the rise of AI tools are making it easier to flood online platforms with various forms of content. Will the “dead internet theory” — the idea that there's so much AI slop and even human-made saturation that nothing can be found or trusted — come to pass, or will music marketers continue to break through the exponentially growing noise by fighting back with even more noise?

			By Dominic Patten, Sean Piccoli 


	Days before jury selection is set to start in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex trafficking trial, a federal judge today sought confirmation from the Bad Boys Records founder that prosecutors put forth a plea deal and that he rebuffed it.


	“Yes, I did,” a bespectacled Combs said in a Manhattan courtroom Thursday before Judge Arun Subramanian. Offering a reduction in time served if Combs took the deal and entered a guilty plea, the agreement put before the “All About the Benjamins” performer seems to have been on the table in the last few weeks.


	Beyond that, no details are known about the written offer. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is keeping it that way. In the legal ether for months, the plea deal was made public in an almost casual manner by an assistant U.S. attorney at an April 25 hearing.

	











	Looking at likely life behind bars if found guilty on the racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution charges and more, the 55-year-old Combs (a.k.a .inmate 37452-054), who has pleaded not guilty, has been held in one of the more low-key units of Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest last September. A defendant not just in this criminal case, but in dozens and dozens of civil cases alleging assaults and abuse, Diddy has always sworn he is innocent, and all the interactions were consensual.


	A major element in Combs' rejection of the plea deal appears to be he truly wants his day in court to prove his innocence and beat the charges, well-placed sources tell us.


	The rest of today's hearing dealt with jury selection questionnaires and procedure, including what will and will not happen in open court.


	Determined to keep the sometimes-wayward case on track, Judge Subramanian once again made it clear to Combs, prosecutors and the defense Thursday that he wants jury selection to begin on May 5. A panel needs to be seated for opening statements on May 12 in the Manhattan courtroom, the judge has insisted. At the end of the less than one-hour hearing, Judge Subramanian told everyone he looked forward to seeing them on Monday morning.


	Of course, a spanner in the works of that could be the quickly settled ($30 million) assault and abuse suit and more from Victim-1, a.k.a former Combs girlfriend Cassie Ventura.

	











	Unlike many such high-profile cases and the other accusations against Combs, there is visual evidence of the violence and attacks Ventura says she endured from Diddy for years. Judge Subramanian ruled last week that 2016 L.A. hotel security footage of the couple, that CNN aired last spring, will be shown to the jury.


	The video, which Combs apologized for on social media when it became public, shows a half-naked Combs chasing an escaping Ventura down a corridor hitting and kicking her and dragging her back to his room where allegedly one of his so-called freak offs was happening. Having deleted his seemingly forced Instagram apology now, Combs and his lawyers have tried almost every trick in the book to undermine or dispute the footage – footage that Combs almost immediately bought for $50,000 the day after the apparent attack occurred


	Add to that, among four victims id'd by the feds, Ventura has said she will testify in open court in this trial under her own name. Prosecutors allege that Combs and his aides coerced Ventura, other women and men into marathon debauched sexual encounters called “freak-offs.” The sessions included male and female prostitutes, drug use, threats of violence and imprisonment in the hotel rooms where the acts were staged and videotaped.


	Direct questioning of about 150 jury candidates starts on Monday morning.


	Judge Subramanian intends to bring each prospect into his courtroom, one at a time, to ask them about their backgrounds and potential biases, with none of the other jury candidates present. The judge called it  “sequestered questioning,” designed to protect juror privacy around sensitive personal matters in a case dealing with sex trafficking. Prospective jurors will also be allowed to answer some questions in sidebar conferences with the judge and lawyers, out of earshot of reporters, if they consider the information to be too personal to discuss in open court, the judge said.


	If all goes as scheduled, it will take three days of sequestered questioning to whittle the field down to 45 jury and alternate candidates, who will then undergo voir dire questioning  on bias, etc by the lawyers for both sides. The aim is to seat the 12 jurors and handful of alternates who will hear the case beginning the following week. Emphasizing that “time is of the essence,” Judge Subramanian today wondered aloud whether they can stay on schedule if sequestered questioning leads to a lot of breaks in the action for privacy sidebars.


	No one in court Thursday could promise him it wouldn't be an issue. 


	In what will likely be a bmajor tenet of the soon to expand Marc Agnifilo- and Teny Geragos-led legal team's approach against SDNY, the defense has repeatedly complained the feds are using “racist” laws against Combs and seeking to “police non-conforming sexual activity.” Back on February 24, the defense took a swipe at “unconstitutionally broad” search warrants that had been used on Combs as part of spring 2024 raids of his Los Angeles and Miami homes, devices, digital storage and more.


	After coming up short over and over in requests for release on bail and keeping certain evidence out of the case, this week saw a small but significant notch in the defense's belt.


	One time mini-mogul Combs received permission on Wednesday from the court to wear “non-prison clothing” during his six-week estimated trial.

	











	To that, the April 30 order says that starting next week, the past and present Sean John Combs is allowed “up to five button down shirts, up to five pairs of pants, up to five sweaters, up to five pairs of socks, and up to two pairs of shoes without laces to wear to court.” No mention of hair dye, so the prospective jurors will see Combs with the white hair he has had since being arrested last September.


	Unlike almost all the past hearings in this case, no blood members of Combs' family appeared to be in court Thursday offering their support. A self-declared “godbrother' was there and Combs waved to him from the defense table.

	It's going to be a big Memorial Day weekend. Three-weekend tracking just hit, and Disney‘s live-action take on its 2002 toon Lilo & Stitch is heading to $120M over four days while Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning is eyeing $80M over the Friday-Monday frame. The two movies are looking forward to a combined $200M+ in 4-day openings. The two movies couldn't be more complementary in a Barbenheimer kind of weekend. What do we name this frame? Lilo & Stitch: Impossible?


	Note, that the highest-grossing Memorial Day weekend ever remains 2013, when Fast & Furious 6 and The Hangover 3 drove a $314M frame. Paramount's Tom Cruise sequel Top Gun: Maverick — the top-grossing pic of the actor's nearly 45-year career — owns the best opening over Memorial Day weekend with $160M; that 2022 holiday frame counted $223.3M for all titles, according to Box Office Mojo.

Lilo & Stitch currently has an unaided awareness that's higher than A Minecraft Movie ($162.7M 3-day), but this latest from Disney is hot particularly with women under 25 and Hispanic and Latina moviegoers. Also families and teens also are strong. There is a nostalgia factor with this weekend, which only means there is more upside. Remember, in regards to Minecraft, it came on lower than it opened, around $60M, and exploded days before release in Warner Bros. last-minute mega-push of the film.

	Tickets for Lilo & Stitch go on sale on Tuesday, May 6, after the opening of Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* this Friday. 


	Disney's biggest opener over Memorial Day weekend is 2007's Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End with $139.8M. The studio's next-biggest opening over that period is The Little Mermaid at $118.8M in 2023. Lilo & Stitch is outstripping Little Mermaid in unaided awareness among women.

	The Tom Cruise movie is strong out of the gate with higher unaided awareness, interest and first than the previous pic in the franchise, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning. The last movie opened to $76M over five days in 2023. Mission: Impossible movies typically have a 3.5x multiple off opening. Working in the sequel's favor is that it has Imax for three weeks. And note the fanfare and bullhorns and Cruise stunts haven't begun yet out of Cannes. Tickets for Final Reckoning are on sale now.

	











	This isn't the first time Lilo and Stitch and have squared off with Cruise. The original Disney toon and the actor's Minority Report opened on the same weekend in 2002.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Filo Opens Up to Fans After ‘Bittersweet' Elimination from ‘American Idol'","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/filo-message-comments-after-elimination/","Thu, 01 May 2025 20:21:05 GMT","

Two nights after his surprise elimination from season 23 of “American Idol” on April 28, 2025, Egyptian-born crooner Filo addressed fans eager to hear how he was doing. Many fans  — and even the judges — were shocked seeing the gifted singer go home, but he's handled the disappointment with grace and gratitude. 

In honor of the April 28 episode's theme, “Iconic Idol Moments,” Filo performed “And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,” which was a standout moment during Jennifer Hudson‘s journey on the show. The 23-year-old was in tears as the judges gave him a standing ovation, the crowd chanted his name and and both Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie said it was his best performance of the season.

But Filo, who received one of the judges' coveted Platinum Tickets following his impressive audition, didn't garner enough viewer votes during the live episode to advance into the top 10. He and British R&B singer Ché Chesterman were sent home at the end of the show — Chesterman back to Essex, England, and Filo to his family's home base near San Francisco. 

A post shared by Filo (@filosings)

Filo remained silent until about 24 hours after his elimination. On the night of April 29, he posted only a photo in his Instagram Stories from inside his flight home with a brief message. He tagged Hollywood Burbank Airport, and wrote, “This marks the end of an incredible journey. I have so much to get off my chest…but in the meantime, I love you all for your support and I can't wait to show you what's to come ❤️”

By the evening of April 30, however, he had gathered his thoughts and posted a much lengthier farewell to the show and words of gratitude to his new friends and fans. 

“And just like that, my @AmericanIdol journey comes to an end,” he wrote. “It's hard to put into words what this experience has meant to me. The dream of being on the show felt far-off, and the fact that God gave me the opportunity to be a part of the Idol family is something that I will never take for granted.”

Filo, who graduated from the prestigious Berklee School of Music in 2024, wrote to his fans, “To everyone who's supported me, I owe you a great deal of gratitude,” the Berklee . I can't express to you enough how much it means to me that you believed in me and took the time to show your love and support. Making it to the #TOP12 is no easy feat, and I truly couldn't have done it without each and every one of you!” 

He also thanked his new “family” of contestants he bonded with since auditions, which took place in the fall of 2024, noting that “as bittersweet as this moment is, the bitterness is from how much I'm going to miss my Idol family❤️” 

“I have met some of the most wonderful and loving people I've ever known,” he continued. “To my fellow contestants, thank you so much for being the light in the midst of this intense rollercoaster. I love every single one of you with all my heart and I can't wait to see what God has in store for all of you!🤩”

Filo also thanked his brother Arssani and mom, Haidi, whom he called “my rock in this world.” They were frequently seen in the studio audience as she sobbed during each of her son's performances. The family fled Egypt when Filo was in middle school to escape persecution of Coptic Orthodox Christians.

Speaking with reporter Dean McCarthy after the April 28 show, judge Carrie Underwood was she felt “overwhelmed” by the level of talent among season 23's top contestants, which means very gifted singers will wind up going home. 

“It was an incredible night of showcasing talent,” she said, “but then the end, losing Che and Filo, was just heartbreaking. Both of them — Filo especially was one of my favorite favorites, so it was like, ‘Oh my gosh!'” 

“And he was so great,” she continued. “That makes it even worse when it's like, ‘You had a great night!' So it's like, ‘You didn't do anything wrong,' you know?”  

Underwood wasn't the only one stunned by Filo's departure. Fans flooded social media, including one who wrote on his April 30 post, “those votes weren't right i'm telling you. Even the Judges were shocked.”

“My jaw dropped and stayed on the floor for a solid 15 minutes when you didn't make it into the top 10,” another wrote. “You should have won.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Marcus Rosner Surprises Lucky Fan With Role in New Movie: 'She Was Amazing' (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/marcus-rosner-meeting-fans-movie-role/","Thu, 01 May 2025 19:07:51 GMT","

When Shawna Delong won the trip of a lifetime to watch longtime Hallmark star Marcus Rosner film his latest project, she never expected to wind up in the movie. But when “The Final Victim” co-starring Brittany Bristow premieres on Lifetime, Delong will make her onscreen debut right alongside them. 

In late April 2025, Rosner told EntertainmentNOW that DeLong won the epic trip during a raffle held on board Expedia Cruises' “Cruising With Friends” fan trip in January featuring him, Jesse Hutch, and Jen Lilley. There was no promise of a walk-on role, but Rosner said he wanted to make the trip extra special for Delong — a fellow Canadian who flew from Ontario to Edmonton with her mom, Kimberley Delong, and was “so enthusiastic” about being there. 

“If she was nervous, she did not show it,” Rosner marveled. “She had the greatest disposition for this event. Like, she just seemed excited and interested, but also quite calm. She didn't seem overwhelmed at all, which was great, because I could totally see a fan getting this experience and being overwhelmed. Shawna was seemingly the perfect pick.” 

Rosner was able to coordinate the cool prize package with Expedia Cruises because “The Last Victim” was produced by Northern Gateway Films, the Canadian production company he co-founded. Noting that Shawna and Kim “were just thrilled to be here,” Rosner first had lunch with them at a favorite spot in Edmonton, Chianti. 

Once they got to the movie set, Rosner decided to elevate the experience, explaining, “We got Shawna into a cop uniform. She appears early in the movie, in the background, as I'm sort of walking up to interview Brittany's character. I play a cop, a detective in the film, and you'll see a shot of Shawna in the back.” 

“But then later that week,” Rosner continued, “we did a night shoot on top of this rooftop in downtown Edmonton, and in this scene, we are about to raid the killer (who's) up there. So Shawna's in there, behind me. She's got the earpiece on, she's bringing up the rear as we're sort of swatting this killer. Yeah, it was great and she was amazing.”

Rosner also invited his brothers to join the scene, dressed as fellow cops, and wrote on Instagram that it was an “unforgettable” night of filming. The “Notes of Autumn” star said he was impressed by how relaxed Shawna was throughout the whole experience, including filming overnight until 5 a.m. and when a medical emergency occurred on the set. 

“We had a medical situation with somebody on set one night that we haven't encountered before,” he told EntertainmentNOW. “I won't say exactly what happened, but it was very stressful for a bit, and Shawna and her mom very quietly came up at one point. They were like, ‘Should we leave?' And I was like, ‘Nah, stick around, things will be touch and go for a bit, but you guys can stay.' They just didn't stress me out at all. It was very cool with them being around.”

A post shared by Marcus Rosner (@marcus_rosner)

Although Rosner frequently has visitors watching from the sidelines on movie sets, this was the first time a fan has won a trip like this with him. He told EntertainmentNOW he was very relieved Shawna enjoyed it, because he often worries it won't be very fun for bystanders. 

“Anytime someone comes to watch, I always feel this great insecurity or self-consciousness, because I know that it'll be less glamorous than they were imagining,” he said. “It'll be more tedious than they were imagining, and it'll take longer, and their interest may devolve into boredom, and then I will feel sort of responsible for that. So that's always my underlying fear.” 

“But if Shawna and Kim felt any of that along the way, they didn't express it, and they just seemed excited in all the ways,” he smiled, adding that he's open to doing something similar in the future.

In fact, Rosner said that now that he has multiple fan experiences under his belt, he's definitely open to participating in more. Rosner told EntertainmentNOW in the fall that he was a bit nervous about agreeing to take part in several fan events for the first time, including December's first-ever Hallmark Christmas Experience.  

But in April, looking back on the event, Rosner gushed, “I loved that weekend, I loved hanging out with those people, I loved the way Hallmark ran it. It was just, like, perfectly spaced out. I never felt overstretched. I always felt like I knew what I was doing, and just the level of clarity and organization was so greatly appreciated.” 

Rosner and his wife also set sail with fans on the Expedia Cruises excursion in early January, a five-day trip to the Bahamas, where Shawna won the trip that led to her upcoming movie debut. Rosner said he suspects “The Final Victim” will air on Lifetime in the fall and said he's also just wrapped a new Hallmark Christmas movie. 

Meanwhile, Expedia Cruises plans to announce which stars will be aboard its 2026 “Cruising With Friends” trip soon, with details to be released first on via its private Facebook group.

Who would've thought “Bad Lieutenant” would become a quasi-franchise? We're guessing not Abel Ferrara, but after Werner Herzog did his own version, the “franchise” is continuing with yet another unlikely auteur taking on the themes of the original neo-noir film: Japanese master Takashi Miike. 

Miike's next film is “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo,” and shortly after the film was reported as a hot package due to hit the Cannes market, Neon announced on Wednesday evening that it was boarding the film with plans to both release it theatrically in North America as well as represent the sales rights at Cannes internationally. 

 










“Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” will star Shun Oguri (“Godzilla v. Kong”) and Lily James (“Pam and Tommy”), as well as WWE star Liv Morgan joining the cast. The film follows the Bad Lieutenant (Oguri), a corrupt gambler in the Metropolitan Police Force, who finds himself thrown into a tangled case after an enigmatic FBI agent (James) arrives in Tokyo to investigate the disappearance of a politician's daughter (Morgan). Meanwhile, a deviant killer operating in the yakuza underworld seems to be shadowing their moves.

Filming on the project is expected to begin this month. 

Daisuke Tengan, who worked with Miike on “Audition,” “Imprint,” and “13 Assassins” will now collaborate for the fourth time; Tengan wrote the script based on the IP first produced by Edward R. Pressman. The idea is to preserve the DNA of the original film while transporting the story to the streets of Tokyo.

“A team of incredibly talented actors and crew has gathered in Tokyo. Now. I'm about to throw a fastball straight down the middle of your strike zone — no tricks, no gimmicks,” Miike said in a statement. “I'm confident we are about to break through every limit, to create unforgettable entertainment. Get ready for the ride with us!!”

The film will be a U.S.-Japan co-production, produced by Jeremy Thomas for Recorded Picture Company, Sam Pressman for Pressman Film, Naoaki Kitajima for Nippon TV, and Misako Saka for OLM. Executive producers include Tom Quinn, Yuzo Kuwahara, Tetsu Fujimura, Paula Paizes, Alainée Kent, Peter Watson, Ivan Kelava, Max Loeb and Mike Apgar. The deal was negotiated by Neon's Sarah Colvin, VP of Acquisitions, and Paula Paizes from Pressman Film, and Recorded Picture Company's Ivan Kelava on behalf of the filmmakers.

 










“We're all delighted to reinterpret this iconic IP with a master filmmaker like Takashi Miike,” said producer Jeremy Thomas of Recorded Picture Company. “We've produced 10 films in Japan, most recently “Grand Maison Paris” which has grossed over $28M domestically, and it's a fertile place to create and distribute films. I feel the time is right for this irreverent hybrid.”

“Director Miike brings a fearless new vision to the Bad Lieutenant, a character defined by the auteur. Just as maestros Ferrara and Herzog delivered films as radically different as their own voices, Miike's adaptation is unrelentingly wild and unique,” said Sam Pressman, CEO of Pressman Film, “My father Edward R. Pressman, always believed this story of corruption, both of police and the human soul, has a global resonance. To realize this next evolution now in Tokyo with Director Miike, Neon and my father's lifelong friend Jeremy Thomas — all true believers in the power of independent cinema — is both an honor and a dream come true.”

Miike is also producing a new adaptation of his classic horror film “Audition” for Focus Features, which has Charli XCX in talks to star in the project.

Neon also has a number of films it's presenting at Cannes, including Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” Julia Ducouranu's “Alpha,” Raoul Peck's “Orwell,” and Michael Angelo Covino's “Splitsville.” 

 










Miike is represented by CAA and Atlas Artists. Oguri is represented by Tristone Entertainment Inc. James is represented by Tavistock Wood Management, Independent Talent Group, and UTA.

Bruce Springsteen has released the first song ever from his long-ago shelved soundtrack to Faithless, a film that was never made. Springsteen recorded much of the album in the months after his 2005 Devils & Dust tour concluded. It is one of seven albums to be unvaulted for his new collection Tracks II: The Lost Albums, out June 27. Listen to the title track of Faithless below.

“This was a really unusual collection of songs,” Springsteen said in press materials. “You could recognize details and maybe a character or two. But for the most part, I just wrote atmospheric music that I thought would fit.” Among the 11 tracks are four instrumentals, but Springsteen plays and sings solo for much of the record. Ron Aniello produced, and some touring E Street Band members—Soozie Tyrell, Lisa Lowell, Curtis King Jr., Michelle Moore and Ada Dyer—contribute alongside Patti Scialfa and Evan and Sam Springsteen.

	Asawin Suebsaeng



Donald Trump's trade wars with China and other nations are widely expected to cause sharp economic pain, but some experts have warned consumers not to hoard supplies and goods before prices skyrocket, arguing that mass stockpiling could backfire spectacularly.


	Well, many Americans aren't listening to that advice, according to survey data this year, instead preparing for the possibility of store shelves being bare amid a Trump-inflicted recession. Funnily enough, this includes a number of government officials and staffers working directly for the man who launched these massive new trade wars, all on the grounds of bad tariff math and the flimsy premise that he would bring economic “liberation” to America and make the country “wealthy again.”


	Two Trump administration officials and a Trump aide tell Rolling Stone that they have done some stockpiling of their own in recent weeks or months, and that they know others working in Republican politics — inside and outside of the administration — who are doing the same. One of the Trump officials says they have already run to Target to bulk-buy toilet paper, some types of food, and other household supplies. 

	











	When asked why they're doing this, the Trump aide — who says they and their partner have done similar household-supply hoarding lately, and are also “stashing cash” reserves in their D.C.-area home — simply replies: “Because it would be stupid not to!” The aide adds that they still believe in Trump's tariffs regime, though, citing the supposed advantage of “short-term pain” in exchange for long-term “prosperity.”


	The trend is symptomatic of a larger panic taking place within the Trump-dominated Republican elite. A significant share of the GOP luminaries on Capitol Hill, members of the Republican donor class, and some top-ranking officials in the Trump administration are privately (and sometimes publicly) extremely fearful that Trump's trade warfare is going to throttle the U.S. economy and further drive down his and the party's approval ratings ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

	But because Trump commands a towering personality cult among the Republican base and rules over his party with catty malice, these GOP bigwigs mostly have to just go along with it and smile. They'll tell the American people one thing (Trump's got this, they'll claim), and behave privately another way (hoarding toilet tissue for themselves, and occasionally trying to talk the president off his Peter Navarro-shaped ledge). 

	











	In the corridors of power within Trump's own administration, there is a growing belief that the Chinese government indeed has the upper hand in this stage of the trade standoff, and that Trump is strategically flailing and looking for easy wins that don't actually exist, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter attest. Many in the GOP's upper echelons are keeping their fingers crossed that the president will find some outs and declare imaginary victory before his economic war inflicts too much damage on the average American voter.


	Nobody — not even Trump, it seems — knows how long this is going to last. The American public has been trying to tell the president that they won't put up with it for very long.


	“U.S. consumer confidence plummets to Covid-era low as trade war stokes anxiety,” The Associated Press reported on Tuesday, referencing the last time Trump was in office overseeing a crisis that also involved numerous Americans hoarding toilet paper, amid a supply chain crisis. (A similar supply shock is on its way.)


	In recent days, multiple high-quality polls have separately shown the president's approval rating sinking, in some data to the thirties. The poor numbers have infuriated Trump enough for him to call for criminal investigations of pollsters.

	He has reason to be upset. Widespread dissatisfaction with the American economy is a primary reason Trump won, and why the last president had his legacy ripped apart. As CNN reported on Monday: “A 59 percent majority of the public now says President Donald Trump's policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, up from 51 percent in March and on par with the worst numbers Joe Biden saw during his presidency.”


	On Tuesday, after it was first reported by Punchbowl News that Amazon planned to “display how much of an item's cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product's total listed price,” the Trump White House slammed it as a “hostile” act, and a reportedly “pissed” Trump quickly got Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the phone. The president later claimed “Bezos was very nice” and “solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”


	By Wednesday morning, when news broke that the American economy had shrank and, per The Wall Street Journal, that “the 0.3 percent decline in GDP fell short of the 0.4 percent growth that economists surveyed” predicted, the president did the only thing he could think to do: He took to the internet to try to pin the blame for the mess he's made on former President Joe Biden.

	











	“We will get back to the GDP, etc., moving forward, and we remain convinced and confident this president knows exactly what he is doing. He is the ultimate dealmaker,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins insisted to a Fox News host, who really did not sound like he was buying what she was selling.


	Rollins' appeal to good vibes aside, as indicators have worsened by the week, some close Trump allies and conservative-economics stalwarts aren't bothering to dissuade the American people — and Trump officials, evidently — from hoarding certain goods and products. In fact, some are openly saying it's a perfectly rational response to the Trump administration's tariff salvos.


	“We had a pretty good consumer spending report a few days ago, and the hunch is that people are buying in advance of the tariffs; that sounds plausible,” says Stephen Moore, a conservative writer and Project 2025 contributor who has advised Trump on economic matters for years. 


	“That's just logical consumer behavior,” he adds. “The tariffs in the short term will probably bump prices up, [so] it might make sense to buy in advance of that. This is like a tax increase; basically, you buy before the tax increase takes effect … But the problem is that now it is getting too late to buy in advance because tariffs are already having an effect. Consumers are gonna change their behavior based on these things, if it's something that's imported. If Trump starts to get a few of these deals done, then it'll alleviate some of that pressure, but I don't know where they are on that right now.”


	Moore is just one example of a long-established figure in the national GOP ecosystem and right-wing media who continues to counsel and support Trump, despite his and other conservative diehards' misgivings about the tariffs. For years, the president, unlike more traditional Republicans, has viewed massive tariffs as a net positive for the country and as his perfect negotiating tool in high-stakes international trade standoffs. He also believes he can impose his tariff blitzes unilaterally as president, a legally dubious claim that is currently working its way through the courts.


	“When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump tweeted in 2018, when he was president the first time and toying with trade warfare on a smaller scale than now. “When we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore — we win big. It's easy!”

	











	Senior officials from Trump's first administration are about as convinced by that argument today as they were when they worked for him.


	“If we continue down this path, I think it's going to be pretty bleak for the economy,” says Marc Short, who once served as Trump's White House legislative affairs director and as a top aide to Mike Pence. “There's likely going to be significant job losses and potential supply problems in your stores. I do think the president is very adept at claiming victory and reversing his policies, so there's a question about how long this actually goes. But if you look at the data on trucking and shipping right now, I think by the end of May, you're going to see more shortages and supply disruptions.”

	Short continues: “On Tuesday morning, there was data that showed how the monthly trade deficit ballooned to one of the highest levels ever, and the tariffs in theory were about fixing that deficit. But it's only gotten worse. I think this could mean a lot of Americans — not just White House staff — are out there ordering supplies ahead of what they expect to be a rougher period. Thankfully we live in a relatively free economy that's dynamic, but in the past we [in the Republican Party] have criticized central planners on the left. But I think there are currently central planners in this White House who think they can control what Americans buy and sell through their trade policies.”


	He concludes: “I don't think it works.”

   11:54 EDT 01 May 2025, updated  16:02 EDT 01 May 2025    By CHRIS MELORE, ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM and ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

A bipartisan congressional briefing Thursday revealed startling details of a never-before-seen UFO hovering over the US. 

Government officials heard from scientists who said they need a larger role in the investigation into UFOs and other strange phenomena the government has been keeping secret.

The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, with help from the UAP Disclosure Fund, held the briefing Thursday called 'Understanding UAP: Science, National Security & Innovation.'

It's focused on UFOs (or UAPs, as they're now called) and what the government knows about these unusual sightings.

Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official who investigated UAPs before becoming a UFO whistleblower, and Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, were the main speakers.

They're pushing for the government to release more UAP data and for the development of better ways of detecting these unidentified objects.

The hearing was led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, the Republican congresswoman from Florida charged by President Trump with overseeing the disclosure of several classified events, including UFO sightings.

Former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo held up an unvetted photo of a UAP taken by a civilian pilot Thursday.

According to the Pentagon whistleblower, the image came from a regular camera, taken at 21,000 feet as the enormous silver craft hovered over the ground.

The UFO was said to be approximately 1,000 feet long, the size of a ocean cruise ship.

Elizondo highlighted the uncertainty that military, commercial, and civilian aviators face when they witness and/or document UAPs in US airspace: 'Do they report it to the FAA? Do they report it to NORAD? Maybe the airforce?' he asked.

'Once again, you would think this information would be important for somebody to look at,' he added. 

'If these are over sensitive military installations, whose are they? What are their capabilities? What is the intent?' 







Dr Anna Brady-Estevez, a founding partner of American DeepTech, a technology investment firm, revealed that companies in the private sector are allegedly building new inventions based on alien systems.

Brady-Estevez, who previously worked with NASA on space economic policy, said she had funded entrepreneurs who described their inventions as being inspired by UFOs.

'They were working on advanced energy. They were working on advanced communications,' the tech investor explained.

'I funded companies working on what the entrepreneurs later described as UAP-adjacent or UAP-inspired technologies,' Brady-Estevez added.

She added that these inventors were not allowed to go into detail about their tech because of the classified nature of the research.

Mike Gold, a former NASA associate administrator, revealed the amazing images sitting in the space agency's archives that have yet to be investigated as possible UAPs.

Gold, the current president of civil and international space at tech company Redwire revealed several shocking images of unexplained phenomena that has been photographed by NASA on Mars and the moon.

Those images included another sighting of the so-called 'Tic Tac' UFO, which recently appeared on the surface of Mars after multiple sightings over the Pacific Ocean.

'Why are we not investigating this?' Gold asked.

'It's certainly worth the effort to investigate and we're not doing it!' he added.







A newly publshed poll found that 44 percent of Americans believe that the government is hiding information about the existance of UAPs, while 28 percent disagree and another 28 percent are unsure.

The poll, conducted by NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ, surveyed 521 Republicans, 559 Democrats, 349 independents and 18 'other' voters. 

Young Americans were found to be especially suspiscious of the government's UAP knowledge, with 49 percent of Gen Z respondents and 48 percent of millenials claiming that federal officials know more than they're letting on, compared to just 39 percent of baby boomers.

Republicans were also revealed to be more suspiscious than Democrats or Independants, with 48 percent saying the government hides UAP information. Just 39 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Independants felt the same. 

Intelligence community expert Christopher Mellon added on Thursday that the military has recently submitted roughly 1,800 reports involving UFOs in just the last few years.

The reports went to AARO, the Defense Department's office for investigating and assessing the threat posed by UFOs and UAPs.

They add to a growing list of events that the US military have taken as serious threats to national security.

There are dozens of unsolved cases going back to the 1960s that occurred over nuclear missile installations, Navy ships, and a desert in New Mexico.

The FBI, CIA, and other government branches have spent years looking into these reports, but have yet to determine what the objects were and where they came from.

In just the last few months, the skies over New Jersey were filled with unidentified aircraft and drones that required a formal response from both the Biden and Trump presidencies.



Christopher Mellon, a national security expert who spent nearly 20 years in the US intelligence community, suggested that there is a massive coverup of data that would prove the extistence of UFOs visiting Earth.

During his presentation at Thursday's hearing, Mellon revealed that the US government has some of the most powerful radar and satellite technology on Earth but has somehow never recorded any information about UAPs.

'Either we've spent billions of dollars on a system that's not performing as it should be... or it's simply so highly classified the information is not reaching AARO,' Mellon said.

AARO is the military's department which assesses the potential threat from UAPs.

Mellon noted that the Solid State Phased Array Radar System is one of the most powerful sensor systems on the planet, which would be detected by any extraterrestrial civilization anywhere near Earth.

However, the radar system has made zero reports of UAPs to AARO over the last 20 years.

'How is that possible?' Mellon asked.

Mellon called on the US Inspector General to look into the lack of reporting coming from key military radar posts regarding UFO sightings.

This comes despite documented reports that the military has scrambled aircraft to follow UFOs they've detected near US airspace.

Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral at Thursday's UFO hearing, says a secret military document was removed from his computer without his permission.

Admiral Gallaudet said the classifed memo described the urgent need to address near-misses Navy pilots were having with UFOs.

Gallaudet, who was in charge of safety and flight while serving as the chief meteorologist in the Navy, said the email had an infamous UFO video attached to it.

The email, which sought urgent information about the origin of the UFO threatening Navy planes, was mysteriously wiped from his computer a day after the admiral received it.

'It didn't sit well with me,' Gallaudet said. 

He added that it's the reason he's gone public with what he knows and why he's calling on the White House to disclose what the government knows about UFOs.

Research physicist Dr Eric Davis said during Thursday's hearing that the US government has been operating a secret program that recovers crashed UFOs since the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s.

Dr Davis worked as a subcontractor and then a consultant for the Pentagon UFO program since 2007. 

According to him, the secret program originated after the discovery of a crashed UFO in 1944.

Since then, Davis claimed much of the technology recovered from these wrecks over the years has been secretly moved to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

All of this activity, Davis said, was being done without congressional oversight or approval, with project code names regularly changing every few years to cover up the Defense Department's actions.

He previously said that examination of some materials recovered by the program failed to determine their source and led him to conclude, 'we couldn't make it ourselves.' 



A retired US Navy admiral slammed an alleged 'disinformation' campaign by the US intelligence community which he claimed was covering up military sightings of UFOs.

Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral, spoke at Thursday's hearing, claiming that the Navy 'has a trove' of data on UFO sightings from pilots and other personnel who have spotted UAPs while on duty - much of which has not been officially released.

Admiral Gallaudet publicly called on the White House to reveal this information and noted that he had just received reports from members of the Navy who had been involved in recent UFO sightings.

He also compared the urgency needed on this topic to the current climate change emergency researchers are well funded to study in depth.





During the hearing, Loeb referenced fragments of metal that he and his colleagues recovered from the Pacific Ocean in 2023.

The remnants came from a meteor-like object that originated from 'interstellar space' and crashed off the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2014. Loeb has not ruled out the possibility that this object could have been an alien craft, or part of one.

'This is a historic discovery because it represents the first time that humans put their hand on materials from a large object that arrived to Earth from outside the solar system, he said at the time. 

Loeb is working to raise funds for another expedition to the location where these fragments were recovered to look for more physical evidence of alien technology.



Avi Loeb told Thursday's congressional hearing that 'there are objects in the sky that we don't understand' while explaining the need for increased funding for UFO detection.

Loeb said that at least one billion dollars needs to be committed to improving America's efforts to track and monitor the movements of UFOs and UAPs.

The Harvard astrophysicist added that he was upset with the lack of data available currently in terms of tracking objects flying over our skies.

Loeb went to discuss the possibility of alien civilizations that could have developed long before humans developed into a modern society.





Days before Thursday' hearing, the whistleblower behind a stunning report submitted to Congress - exposing what he claims is a secret Pentagon program tracking unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) - revealed his identity and says he fears for his future after speaking out.

Matthew Brown, a former US national security official, publicly identified himself as the whistleblower on an episode of WEAPONIZED - a podcast released Tuesday that is hosted by investigative journalists and UFO experts Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp.

A bipartisan congressional briefing Thursday revealed startling details of a never-before-seen UFO hovering over the US. 

Government officials heard from scientists who said they need a larger role in the investigation into UFOs and other strange phenomena the government has been keeping secret.

The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, with help from the UAP Disclosure Fund, held the briefing Thursday called 'Understanding UAP: Science, National Security & Innovation.'

It's focused on UFOs (or UAPs, as they're now called) and what the government knows about these unusual sightings.

Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official who investigated UAPs before becoming a UFO whistleblower, and Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, were the main speakers.

They're pushing for the government to release more UAP data and for the development of better ways of detecting these unidentified objects.

The hearing was led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, the Republican congresswoman from Florida charged by President Trump with overseeing the disclosure of several classified events, including UFO sightings.

Former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo held up an unvetted photo of a UAP taken by a civilian pilot Thursday.

According to the Pentagon whistleblower, the image came from a regular camera, taken at 21,000 feet as the enormous silver craft hovered over the ground.

The UFO was said to be approximately 1,000 feet long, the size of a ocean cruise ship.

Elizondo highlighted the uncertainty that military, commercial, and civilian aviators face when they witness and/or document UAPs in US airspace: 'Do they report it to the FAA? Do they report it to NORAD? Maybe the airforce?' he asked.

'Once again, you would think this information would be important for somebody to look at,' he added. 

'If these are over sensitive military installations, whose are they? What are their capabilities? What is the intent?' 







Dr Anna Brady-Estevez, a founding partner of American DeepTech, a technology investment firm, revealed that companies in the private sector are allegedly building new inventions based on alien systems.

Brady-Estevez, who previously worked with NASA on space economic policy, said she had funded entrepreneurs who described their inventions as being inspired by UFOs.

'They were working on advanced energy. They were working on advanced communications,' the tech investor explained.

'I funded companies working on what the entrepreneurs later described as UAP-adjacent or UAP-inspired technologies,' Brady-Estevez added.

She added that these inventors were not allowed to go into detail about their tech because of the classified nature of the research.

Mike Gold, a former NASA associate administrator, revealed the amazing images sitting in the space agency's archives that have yet to be investigated as possible UAPs.

Gold, the current president of civil and international space at tech company Redwire revealed several shocking images of unexplained phenomena that has been photographed by NASA on Mars and the moon.

Those images included another sighting of the so-called 'Tic Tac' UFO, which recently appeared on the surface of Mars after multiple sightings over the Pacific Ocean.

'Why are we not investigating this?' Gold asked.

'It's certainly worth the effort to investigate and we're not doing it!' he added.







A newly publshed poll found that 44 percent of Americans believe that the government is hiding information about the existance of UAPs, while 28 percent disagree and another 28 percent are unsure.

The poll, conducted by NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ, surveyed 521 Republicans, 559 Democrats, 349 independents and 18 'other' voters. 

Young Americans were found to be especially suspiscious of the government's UAP knowledge, with 49 percent of Gen Z respondents and 48 percent of millenials claiming that federal officials know more than they're letting on, compared to just 39 percent of baby boomers.

Republicans were also revealed to be more suspiscious than Democrats or Independants, with 48 percent saying the government hides UAP information. Just 39 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Independants felt the same. 

Intelligence community expert Christopher Mellon added on Thursday that the military has recently submitted roughly 1,800 reports involving UFOs in just the last few years.

The reports went to AARO, the Defense Department's office for investigating and assessing the threat posed by UFOs and UAPs.

They add to a growing list of events that the US military have taken as serious threats to national security.

There are dozens of unsolved cases going back to the 1960s that occurred over nuclear missile installations, Navy ships, and a desert in New Mexico.

The FBI, CIA, and other government branches have spent years looking into these reports, but have yet to determine what the objects were and where they came from.

In just the last few months, the skies over New Jersey were filled with unidentified aircraft and drones that required a formal response from both the Biden and Trump presidencies.



Christopher Mellon, a national security expert who spent nearly 20 years in the US intelligence community, suggested that there is a massive coverup of data that would prove the extistence of UFOs visiting Earth.

During his presentation at Thursday's hearing, Mellon revealed that the US government has some of the most powerful radar and satellite technology on Earth but has somehow never recorded any information about UAPs.

'Either we've spent billions of dollars on a system that's not performing as it should be... or it's simply so highly classified the information is not reaching AARO,' Mellon said.

AARO is the military's department which assesses the potential threat from UAPs.

Mellon noted that the Solid State Phased Array Radar System is one of the most powerful sensor systems on the planet, which would be detected by any extraterrestrial civilization anywhere near Earth.

However, the radar system has made zero reports of UAPs to AARO over the last 20 years.

'How is that possible?' Mellon asked.

Mellon called on the US Inspector General to look into the lack of reporting coming from key military radar posts regarding UFO sightings.

This comes despite documented reports that the military has scrambled aircraft to follow UFOs they've detected near US airspace.

Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy Rear Admiral at Thursday's UFO hearing, says a secret military document was removed from his computer without his permission.

Admiral Gallaudet said the classifed memo described the urgent need to address near-misses Navy pilots were having with UFOs.

Gallaudet, who was in charge of safety and flight while serving as the chief meteorologist in the Navy, said the email had an infamous UFO video attached to it.

The email, which sought urgent information about the origin of the UFO threatening Navy planes, was mysteriously wiped from his computer a day after the admiral received it.

'It didn't sit well with me,' Gallaudet said. 

He added that it's the reason he's gone public with what he knows and why he's calling on the White House to disclose what the government knows about UFOs.

With increasing trends like tarot card reading and astrology apps, psychic services are, once again, becoming a popular tool in mainstream culture. Of course, the effectiveness of these services is hotly contested, but the benefits often extend past the “psychic” of it all. Between self-reflection, emotional guidance, and seeking clarity, plenty of people find these tools useful regardless of whether or not they believe that spirits are leading the charge.

Let's say that tarot card reading is as much of a random draw as a poker game — that doesn't mean you can't get something useful from it. A significant portion of psychic reading centers on identifying clients' problems and helping them self-reflect to decide what to do. Ultimately, the cultural shift toward embracing mysticism has led to a focus on intuition, introspection, and seeking meaning when things are difficult.

Self-help tools and wellness are all the rage, and psychic services are turning those trends on their heads to see past logic and rationality. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Platforms like PsychicOz, Yes Psychic, and Fortune Psychics allow individuals to connect remotely with practitioners to self-reflect from the comfort of their couch. 

Whether it's relationship advice, career direction, or even a space to feel seen and heard, unjudged, psychic services offer comfort and introspection to many clients worldwide. Through a series of questions, emotional exploration prompts, and listening to gut feelings, many clients describe these services as “therapeutic” — just in an unconventional way that focuses on possibilities rather than certainty.

So, what makes psychic services stand out? Well, options like tarot cards, numerology, or mediumship focus on intuition and emotional resonance. Most people using these services aren't looking to find out what day they'll die or the eye color of their one true love. They're simply seeking personally meaningful guidance in a way that feels exciting and fun.

Psychics and fortune-telling aren't new concepts in the slightest. These practices go all the way back to cultures like ancient Mesopotamia. From there, they made their way to 19th-century spiritualists and continued growing into the psychic practices available today. 





By nature, humans have always sought answers to the same questions, such as: “Who are we and why are we here?” Mysticism has long been a tool to help people answer those questions for themselves and humanity as a whole.

The beauty of psychic services is their versatility. It doesn't matter whether or not you believe a tarot card is being hand-picked for you by the spirits or if you're using the practice as a means to ask yourself questions in a novel and entertaining way. 

People find value in the experience itself. Each person can decide for themselves to what extent they believe in mysticism. At their core, psychic services allow each person to interpret their own meaning while trusting their intuition.

Naturally, not everyone believes in the usefulness or efficacy of psychic services. Scientific evidence is lacking, and some people warn against becoming over-reliant on unverified guidance. Yet, most aspects of life hinge on moderation.

Is it healthy to seek out psychic readings for every decision you make? Probably not. But that doesn't mean it can't be a helpful and intuitive tool to help people better understand themselves and their lives. 

At the end of the day, many psychic services aren't giving you advice: They're helping you connect with yourself to follow your own advice. Ultimately, psychic services don't promise absolute truths. Instead, they give people an opportunity to look within themselves for guidance. And who knows you better than you? Sometimes, you just need a little nudge to listen.

By framing Exercise Hammer Strike as a mix of innovation and technological modernisation, Pakistan army chief Syed Asim Munir Ahmed Shah is trying to project the image of a powerful general, top Indian intelligence sources have told CNN-News18.

“The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) release is a multilayered psyops tool,"" said a source. “It warns India against aggression while reassuring China of Pakistan's strategic utility.""

According to intelligence sources, this serves as a calculated psychological operation by the Pakistan army chief. This is designed to project military strength against India and shape domestic and international narratives.

“This exercise is to highlight cutting-edge weapon systems, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation technologies,"" a source said. “This signals Pakistan's ability to counter India's military edge: S-400 missiles and Rafale jets.""

Munir's statement, where he said, “Any misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response"", reinforces nuclear ambiguity and conventional readiness and resembles India's Cold Start, said sources.

Pakistan is showcasing niche technologies, likely Chinese-origin systems like HQ-9 SAMs and Wing Loong drones, they added. This indicates heavy dependence on Chinese artillery.

In this, they have shown the JF-17 Block III with Chinese AESA radars/PL-15 missiles, positioned to challenge India's Rafales.

This is timed at heightened India-Pakistan tensions post-Pahalgam attack to preemptively counter Indian military posturing, sources stated.

This distracts from domestic crises like economic collapse and political instability by redirecting focus to national security, they added.

This exercise, according to them, counters India's global narrative of Pakistan as a terror sponsor by reframing the army as a professional, tech-savvy force. The presence of senior formations with him shows solidarity.

Munir visited the Tilla Field Firing Ranges (TFFR) on Thursday to observe Exercise Hammer Strike— a high-intensity field training exercise conducted by the Pakistan army's Mangla Strike Corps, according to ISPR.

The military's media wing highlighted that the exercise demonstrated the army's growing integration of advanced and emerging technologies to enhance both kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities.

During his visit, General Munir praised the professionalism, morale, and combat readiness of the participating troops, describing them as a true representation of the Pakistan Army's operational excellence.

While addressing the troops, he reiterated the armed forces' unwavering commitment to defending Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and elevated response. While Pakistan remains devoted to regional peace, our readiness and determination to protect national interests are absolute,"" he emphasised.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Trump: I've axed Mike Waltz as national security chief","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/05/01/mike-waltz-quit-latest-donald-trump/","Thu, 01 May 2025 20:06:57 GMT","

Donald Trump has announced he is removing his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and appointing him instead to the role of UN ambassador.

The announcement followed hours of breathless speculation that Mr Waltz was being ousted entirely by the Trump administration.

The reshuffle will be viewed by many as a demotion for Mr Waltz, with Mr Trump having little interest in the affairs of the UN.

The move is viewed partly as a response to the Signal-gate fiasco, in which Mr Waltz accidentally leaked military plans to a journalist.

Mr Trump said that Mr Waltz had “worked hard to put our nation's interests first” in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, will take on his role temporarily while remaining in his role as the nation's top diplomat.

“From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my national security adviser, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Mr Trump said.

“I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser, while continuing his strong leadership at the state department.”

The US president chose not to dismiss his national security adviser, the first Green Beret elected to Congress, in the direct aftermath of the Signal-gate furore, insisting he had “learnt a lesson, and is a good man”.

However, members of the administration privately called for the resignation of Mr Waltz, who took “full responsibility” for adding Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of Atlantic Magazine, to a Signal chat for top members of the Trump administration, used to plan a strike on the Houthis.

Mr Waltz's hawkish views on Russia were out of step with the isolationist faction of Maga, which viewed him with suspicion.On Monday, Mr Waltz is said to have argued for sharp sanctions against Russia if it fails to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine, a proposal to which the president is said to be resistant.

He worked his way into the president's good graces during the former president's time in exile after his 2020 election defeat and became a regular advocate for Mr Trump on cable TV.

The Signal-gate scandal is said to have soured his relationship with Mr Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles. The president delayed sacking his national security adviser so as to avoid handing a scalp to the liberal media.

Mr Waltz has remained on shaky ground, losing much of his influence in the West Wing, and his standing never really recovered, according to CNN.

Central to his reduction in stature was Ms Wiles, who is said to be one of the officials most unimpressed with Mr Waltz, who struggled to manage his sprawling foreign policy brief.

“The system isn't running properly,” under Mr Waltz, a source said.

Speaking in the Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, Mr Rubio and Pete Hegseth, who was also seen as vulnerable after Signal-gate, were praised by the president.

Instrumental to the decision to oust Mr Waltz from his current role is thought to be Laura Loomer, the conservative conspiracy theorist, who has made him a target since his appointment in January.

In April, she marched into a White House meeting with a sheaf of papers accusing members of his top team of being insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda.

As a result, Mr Waltz was forced to fire six national security officials.

A long-term supporter of Mr Trump, Ms Loomer was one of his most vicious online enforcers during the 2024 campaign.

“Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz alose depart,” she wrote on X.

Thanks for following the updates here. This live blog is now closed.

Mike Waltz faces “brutal” confirmation hearings to become the US ambassador to the UN, Democrats have said.

Mr Waltz will need to be confirmed to the position by a Senate vote, and will almost inevitably be grilled over his role in the Signal-gate disaster, where he accidentally leaked military plans to Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

“I think it would be pretty brutal,” Mark Warner, a Democrat senator, told NBC.

John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, told the BBC: “Signal-gate will now be a major part of Mike Waltz's confirmation process.”

John Bolton, Donald Trump's third national security adviser in his third term, has said Mike Waltz's ousting is a sign of the US president's “chaotic” administration.

He wrote in The Wall Street Journal:

Donald Trump's chaotic national-security governance is in full flood.

Whether it's risking American military operations, making volatile, highly dubious tariff decisions, hiring uninformed senior advisers, or seeing senior government officials dissenting from presidential decisions, the disarray is palpable and likely to spread.

It did Thursday, with the ouster of national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Mike Waltz has issued a brief statement after being ousted as US national security adviser:

I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation. pic.twitter.com/FFTPjnIYkI

And there we have it. After staying silent on the issue so far, Mr Trump has now announced that Mike Waltz will go to New York to be his permanent representative to the UN, while Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, will wear two hats and act temporarily as national security adviser.

Mr Trump is desperate for this administration not to go the same way as his chaotic first. He managed to wait 101 days before making a major change to his top team. 

And rather than dumping Mr Waltz entirely he has found a face-saving post elsewhere (albeit a demotion). That is a reflection of how tight this team is and is something of a reward for a figure who has remained totally loyal up to this point.

At the same time, Mr Rubio, who as a more traditional conservative hawk may have wondered if he too were on thin ice, takes on more responsibility. That will reassure European allies that Mr Trump has grown-ups in key places and shows that Mr Rubio is safe in his role.

Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, was “barely” on speaking terms with Mike Waltz, Politico reports.

Officials are said to have been alarmed at how his authority drained away following the Signal-gate fiasco as Laura Loomer, the Right-wing activist, convinced Donald Trump to sack key members of his national security team.

Approached by the news outlet amid reports of Mr Waltz's ousting, Ms Loomer replied: “Loomered.”

Mike Waltz deserved to lose his job, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has said, adding that Pete Hegseth should be fired too.

“Look, they should fire him, but they're firing the wrong guy. They should be firing Hegseth,” Mr Schumer told reporters.

Arizona senator Mark Kelly also called for Mr Hegseth's dismissal.

“I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” he said, adding that he thought Mr Waltz accidentally including a journalist on Signal was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Mr Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk”.

Following the Signal-gate leak, Maga faithful lined up to back Mr Hegseth, leaving Mr Waltz to take the fall.

Mike Waltz quit as national security adviser after his relationship soured with Donald Trump's chief of staff.

Relations between Susie Wiles, nicknamed the president's “Ice Maiden”, and Mr Waltz reportedly became strained, even before the Signal-gate Fiasco.

Mr Trump had considered firing his national security adviser after Mr Waltz leaked military plans to a journalist, but he refrained to avoid providing fodder to his opponents, according to CNN.

Yet Mr Waltz remained on shaky ground, losing much of his influence in the West Wing, and his standing never really recovered, four sources told the outlet.

Central to his reduction in stature was Ms Wiles, who was allegedly one of the officials most unimpressed with Mr Waltz.

Speaking in the Rose Garden at an event to mark the National Day of Prayer, Donald Trump made a point to say that Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, was doing a “great job”.

The president reeled off members of his cabinet and congratulated them for their good work, missing out Mike Waltz. However, he was quick to mention Mr Hegseth, who is also vulnerable.

The defence secretary was part of the Signal group chat into which Mr Waltz mistakenly added a journalist.

Mr Hegseth discussed sensitive information including times and locations of Houthi strikes.

In recent weeks, the Pentagon boss has been the subject of a myriad of negative headlines claiming he is disorganised and unprofessional.

The Trump administration and the president himself have repeatedly reassured Mr Hegseth's job is safe.

Mike Waltz's ousting comes after Laura Loomer purged his staff last month.

Responding to today's announcement, Ms Loomer said that “hopefully” the rest of Mr Waltz's staff are also forced out.

The Right-wing conspiracy theorist has targeted Mr Waltz, marching into a White House meeting in April with a sheaf of papers accusing members of his  top team of being insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda.

As a result, Mr Waltz was forced to fire six national security officials.

A long-term supporter of Mr Trump, Ms Loomer was one of his most vicious online enforcers during the 2024 campaign.

BREAKING:National Security Advisor Mike Waltz @MikeWaltz47 along with his Chinese deputy NSC Advisor Alex Wong have ""resigned"" from the Trump admin today.Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart.

Mike Waltz struggled to manage his sprawling foreign policy brief, a source told the AP.

A person familiar with the cabinet's internal dynamics said Mr Waltz was too hawkish for the war-averse Trump and was seen as not effectively coordinating foreign policy among a variety of agencies, a key role for the national security adviser.

“The system isn't running properly,” under Mr Waltz, the source said.

Mike Waltz gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to take on the role of national security adviser in Mr Trump's top team. 

He was previously the representative for Florida's 6th congressional district.

He was replaced by Republican Randy Fine.

Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy, is the clear front-runner to replace Mike Waltz as national security advisor.Largely considered to be one of Donald Trump's closet confidants, he's been credit with securing a peace deal in Gaza and been at the forefront of negotiations in Ukraine.But no decision is final until Mr Trump pulls the trigger.

In the meantime, Marco Rubio, the high-flying secretary of state, is being eyed up to replace Waltz on a temporary basis, the The Telegraph understands.

Christopher Landau, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, is also among replacement options, according to a White House source.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and British media host Seb Gorka may also be in the running, owing to their firm commitment to the president's vision, Trump allies told CBS.

 

Donald Trump likes to fill his Cabinets with conflicting views, setting up key figures to argue against each other before he makes the final decision.

Mike Waltz, a former Green Beret with hawkish views on Russia, was often out of step with the isolationist Maga world, which viewed him with suspicion as a neo-con.

But Mr Waltz had worked his way into the Trump orbit during the former president's time in exile after the 2020 election defeat. He became a regular booster for Mr Trump on cable TV and, with his political base in Florida, he was a natural fit for the tight circle that grew up around Mar-a-Lago.

However, after the Signal-gate debacle, reports surfaced that his working relationship with Susie Wiles, a big beast of Florida politics and White House chief of staff, had soured.

The result was that he was living on borrowed time, left in limbo while Mr Trump delayed a final decision so it would not look as if he were bowing to media pressure.

Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's pick for vice-president, posted on X: “Mike Waltz has left the chat.”

The post is a reference to a Signal group chat, into which Mr Waltz erroneously added Jeffery Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic.

The chat, which also contained Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, and Mr Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, was used to discuss sensitive information on Houthi strikes.

At the time, Mr Waltz took responsibility for the error and apologised.

Mr Trump and his team insisted Mr Waltz would not be let go over the “huge mistake”.

Donald Trump is speaking at the White House Rose Garden.

It is not clear whether he will address the departure of Mike Waltz.

Mike Waltz reportedly argued for sanctions on Russia as recently as Monday.

Mr Waltz, who has long been viewed by some in Donald Trump's top team as too hawkish to implement the president's brand of foreign policy, is reported to have frequently urged sanctions on Russia.

The national security adviser apparently asked Mr Trump to take tougher action on Monday, according to the New York Times.

Although Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions on social media, no action has so-far been taken as the US attempts to thrash out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

A senior White House source said: “Nothing is final until it is announced.”

Both Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth, who was also seen as vulnerable after Signal-gate, were at the White House on Thursday for National Prayer Day.

Eyebrows were raised earlier this week when Mike Waltz did not join the president on board Air Force One.

According to CNN, the ousted national security adviser joined Mr Trump in Marine One but when he left the helicopter, Mr Waltz did not join him.

The network also reported Mr Waltz was warned his job was on the line but had been “fighting all week” to keep it.

Mike Waltz is the second member of the House of Representatives pulled into Donald Trump's cabinet who now no longer has a seat.

The former Florida representative has been ousted as national security adviser, The Telegraph understands.

His exit follows Matt Gaetz, a former Florida congressman, who withdrew from being confirmed as defence secretary.

Elise Stefanik, the New York congresswoman, was also due to be drafted in as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN, but was forced to withdraw amid concern that the Republicans could lose control of the House in the midterms.

When members of Congress enter the administration, they are forced to give up their House seats.

With Democrats holding a narrow seven seat majority in the House, Mr Trump's decision to draft in members for his cabinet could leave his party exposed in next year's midterm elections.

Mike Waltz was sent out on the airwaves to bat for Donald Trump just hours before it was revealed he is leaving the administration.

Mr Waltz heaped praise on Mr Trump and Pete Hegseth, his defence secretary, in an interview with Fox News just this morning.

“Nobody said (it) could be done. President Trump said ‘get it done',” he said about Mr Trump's minerals deal with Ukraine, showing no awareness of his imminent departure.

Saying Mr Trump has boosted US military recruitment, he added: “This is leadership at its finest, led by our commander in chief, who loves the troops and they love him.”

News of Mike Waltz leaving Donald Trump's cabinet comes after the national security adviser accidentally added a journalist to a group chat where members of Mr Trump's cabinet discussed plans to bomb Yemen.

Mr Waltz became the subject of a briefing war among Republicans after it emerged he was the one who invited Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, to the Signal messaging forum.

Mike Waltz is the first person to officially be ousted from the second Trump administration.

During his first term, Donald Trump had record-breaking turnover levels with around 60 per cent of his team thought to have been let go.

Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's first national security adviser, lasted just 25 days. He was forced to resign in February 2017 after it emerged he had lied to Mike Pence, the vice-president at the time, about his contact with Russia during the transition period.

Marco Rubio, the high-flying secretary of state, is being eyed up to replace Mike Waltz on a temporary basis, The Telegraph understands.

Christopher Landau, the United States deputy secretary of state, is also a likely replacement, according to a White House source.

Alex Wong, the US principal deputy national security adviser, spent last night defending Donald Trump.

“We are moving forward on a broad set of policies, a broad set of priorities, whether it's security, whether it's trade to make America stronger, and again, when America is stronger, so are our partners, and the world is safe,” he told BBC Newsnight.

Mr Wong and Mike Waltz, Mr Trump's national security adviser, have today left office, The Telegraph understands.

Mr Waltz, a neoconservative Republican who has taken a hawkish stance on China, Iran and Ukraine, was already reported to be in a perilous position within the Trump cabinet.

The New York Times reported earlier this month that people close to Mr Trump viewed Mr Waltz as a potential early casualty, even as he takes part in negotiations to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Three sources told the paper that Mr Trump was suspicious of Mr Waltz's previous firm backing for Ukraine, criticism of Vladimir Putin and earlier backing of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, Mr Waltz helped his case by describing Volodymyr Zelensky as like an “ex-girlfriend that wants to argue”, falling more in line with the style of Mr Trump who has been critical of the Ukrainian president.

Donald Trump is acting “in the best interest of the American people”, a state department spokesman said, amid reports his national security adviser has quit.

The Telegraph understands that Milke Waltz has become the first member of Mr Trump's cabinet to leave the administration.

Addressing reports that Mr Waltz has been pushed out, Tammy Bruce said that the president is “hands on” about who he chooses to advise him.

“The President is engaged in every aspect of the country, and the choices he makes moving forward will be, as usual, excellent and will be in the best interest of the American people,” Ms Bruce said.

She declined to get ahead of an official White House announcement on the decision, which is expected to come during a Trump speech in the coming hours.

Mike Waltz, Donald Trump's national security adviser, will leave his role amid reports the president was preparing to fire him.

Mr Waltz, who faced calls to resign after accidentally leaking top secret war plans to a journalist in a Signal group chat, will leave his job along with his deputy Alex Wong.

A White House source told The Telegraph that Mr Waltz was “out” although it remains unclear if he will resign or has been sacked by Mr Trump.

Donald Trump had been preparing to fire his national security adviser as early as today amid unhappiness over his performance, according to reports.

According to Politico, the leading candidate to replace Mike Waltz is special envoy Steve Witkoff.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he would nominate national security adviser Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador, after widespread reports that Trump planned to oust him, in the first major staff shakeup since the president took office in January.
    


            The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio would replace Waltz in the prior role on an interim basis.
    


            “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.”
    


            Trump informed Waltz that he was removing him from his role as national security adviser and nominating him as UN ambassador Thursday morning, a White House official told CNN.
    


            “I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” Waltz wrote on X after Trump's announcement.
    


            Waltz's job has been in limbo after it was made clear to him earlier this week that his time leading the National Security Council had come to an end, according to a source familiar with the matter. Alex Wong, the deputy national security adviser, and other national security advisers are expected to depart their roles as well, per multiple sources familiar with conversations, though timing is unclear.
    


            Rubio now fills four roles within the administration: secretary of state, national security adviser, national archivist and acting administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
    


            Waltz is heading to a potentially contentious confirmation fight in the Senate. Multiple people close to Trump said the president does not view the UN ambassador role as a high priority. That's in part why he never intervened early on to speed along the nomination of his first pick, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Trump also did not move quickly to pick a new person for the role, after Republicans' narrow House majority forced Stefanik to remain in Congress.
    


            Waltz had been on shaky ground within the administration – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes.
    


            Trump had considered firing him after the incident, but declined to do so because he didn't want to provide his enemies a perceived victory, and he hoped to avoid the type of chaos that colored his first administration.
    


            But while Trump stood by him at the time, Waltz's standing hadn't ever really recovered, according to four sources, and he lost clout with top aides inside the West Wing. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has privately been one of the officials most unimpressed with Waltz — even before the Signal fiasco.
    


            At 100 days into his second term, Trump no longer appears as concerned about the appearance of disorder.
    


            Waltz's influence internally had been waning for weeks, illustrated best by Trump's decision to dismiss several staffers from the National Security Council at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who told him they were disloyal. Loomer told CNN Thursday she had previously tried to raise concerns about Waltz directly with Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office, where Loomer was urging the removal of certain national security officials. She said she planned to show Trump a 2016 campaign ad in which Waltz criticized him, but before she could play the clip on her phone, Waltz entered the room.
    


            Loomer said she had also targeted Wong, citing his past work for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.
    


            Mark Halperin first reported the news of Waltz being pushed out.
    


            Before Trump announced his new plans for Waltz, Democrats on Capitol Hill largely reacted to news of his ouster by saying Trump was going after the wrong national security official. They believed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserved the boot more after he discussed bomb targets in Yemen in the Signal chat.
    


            “I think they're holding the wrong guy accountable,” Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said, adding that he thought Waltz accidentally including a journalist on the Signal chat was an “unfortunate mistake” but that he found it most troubling that Hegseth shared “incredibly sensitive information about a strike off of an aircraft carrier, putting pilots at risk.”
    


            But Trump's thinking on Hegseth has sharply differed from how he regarded Waltz after the Signal episode, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was never able to move beyond the question of how Waltz invited Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic into the group chat in the first place, people familiar with the matter say.
    


            While Trump did not think Hegseth exercised good judgment in sharing the Yemen war plan in at least two group chats, according to the people familiar, he believed his Defense secretary should not be dismissed after the administration spent so much political capital to confirm him.
    


            Hegseth also has more far support outside the administration through the Trump-inspired MAGA movement than Waltz, who was viewed with deep suspicion among the base. Plus, unlike Hegseth, replacing Waltz does not involve a Senate confirmation fight.
    


            Still, Hegseth has faced internal scrutiny. Wiles has ordered Hegseth and the Pentagon to step up their performance, offering an admonition weeks ago that there is “no room for more mistakes or embarrassments.”
    


            But behind the scenes, some administration officials had begun quietly discussing an off-ramp for Waltz over the last several days. Trump has expressed frustration with him on multiple fronts, including the Signal episode. He was also irritated the Florida congressional race to replace Waltz was closer than expected, two sources familiar with the conversations told CNN.
    


            “President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” one source said.
    


            Waltz boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday, but when his colleagues boarded Air Force One about 10 minutes later, he instead remained on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. One White House official said he was never slated to travel with the president to Michigan, but the move was viewed as odd by other aides inside the administration.
    


            Asked about the impact of Waltz's dismissal as national security adviser, before Rubio was named as a replacement, multiple foreign officials — including some from the Middle East — expressed apprehension about who would fill the role.
    


            “Of all of them, we never thought he would be the first [to be fired],” said a senior western official.

Tesla's board chair has denied that the company ever considered replacing Elon Musk as CEO amid a stock price slump and global brand crisis sparked by his work at DOGE.

Robyn Denholm said on Wednesday that the board had high confidence in the billionaire's leadership, after The Wall Street Journal reported that board members had searched for a new CEO.

The Journal reported that as Tesla's stock price plunged in March and April amid collapsing sales and public blowback over Musk's work at DOGE, unnamed Tesla board members reached out to recruitment firms to work on a process to select Tesla's next CEO.

Board members had also told Musk he needed to spend more time at Tesla and reaffirm his commitment to the company publicly, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.

In Tesla's first quarter earnings last week, Musk announced he would step back from his White House role in May and allocate more time to leading Tesla, with the company's stock price surging in response.

""Now, we're getting more of a rhythm, and so the amount of time that it's necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies — which they need me,"" Musk said in an interview with reporters in the White House on Wednesday evening, before the Journal's story was published. 

In a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday, chairwoman Robyn Denholm called the Journal's report ""absolutely false.""

""The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,"" said Denholm. Musk also denied the article in a post on X.

It comes amid a rocky start to the year for Tesla.

The automaker has been hit by a global wave of protests over Musk's role in cutting the federal workforce, which has also turned its vehicles into targets for vandalism and pushed some owners to sell up.

The brand crisis has fuelled a sales collapse, with Tesla reporting its lowest quarterly sales since 2022 last month.

The company is also facing growing competition in the EV space, especially from China, with the Warren Buffett-backed BYD besting Tesla in sales and revenue so far this year.

Tesla's stock price, which surged after the US election, has plunged around 30% since the start of the year, causing investors to ring the alarm about how much attention Musk is paying to Tesla.

In a Wednesday note, Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said Musk did the right thing in stepping back from his DOGE role and that Musk would likely stay on as CEO for at least another five years.

""This situation with Musk at DOGE was reaching a breaking point, but we believe that cooler heads have now prevailed,"" said Ives, describing the reported search for possible replacements as a ""game of high-stakes poker"" between Tesla's board and Musk.

Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment sent outside normal working hours.

Coinbase will suspend trading of Movement's MOVE token, citing ""recent reviews,"" following a CoinDesk investigation into market-making deals that experts said incentivized price manipulation. 

The token fell more than 13% on the trading suspension news, while the broader market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index rose 4.4%. 

Movement Labs is currently investigating how a market maker may have gained access to a significant number of its tokens, which were then dumped on retail investors, causing its price to tank. The market maker, Web3Port, appears in contracts previously reported by CoinDesk. 

According to the CoinDesk report, Movement Labs co-founder Cooper Scanlon told employees last month that the firm was investigating how Rentech, which Movement believed was a subsidiary of Web3Port, got a hold of over 5% of Web3Port's MOVE tokens. 

According to contracts obtained by CoinDesk, Rentech had the ability to liquidate all of its tokens under certain circumstances, which experts said could have created an incentive for the firm to increase the token's value. 

Crypto exchange Binance later banned Web3Port, the market-maker, after $38 million in MOVE tokens in wallets tied to Web3Port were liquidated following MOVE's exchange debut. 

Coinbase did not share many details about the trading suspension, just announcing that it would do so on May 15 by 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (21:00 UTC). 

We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on recent reviews, we will suspend trading for Movement (MOVE) on May 15, 2025, on or around 2 PM ET.

Coinbase said it has already switched its order books to ""limit-only mode"" for MOVE tokens, meaning trades will only be executed at certain prices, rather than a token's spot price.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","What Caused the European Power Outage?","https://www.wired.com/story/what-caused-the-european-power-outage-spain-blackout/","Thu, 01 May 2025 19:41:03 GMT","

The causes of the power outage that left millions in Spain and Portugal without electricity on Monday have yet to be fully determined, though service has now been restored across 99 percent of the Iberian peninsula. Red Eléctrica, the public company in charge of operating Spain's transmission infrastructure, has preliminarily ruled out a cyberattack, human error, or unusual weather or atmospheric conditions as a cause of the outage. The company points out that the incident could have originated from two “disconnections of generation,” possibly linked to the inherent volatility of renewable sources.

Specialists emphasize that this type of total blackout—an exceptional and infrequent event—is also a security mechanism of the electricity system itself. For a grid to operate stably, energy production must be kept in balance with consumption; imbalances can cause blackouts as well as potentially damage infrastructure.

Maintaining grid balance is the responsibility of the system operator, who monitors parameters such as electrical frequency, voltage, and load from substations in real time. When there are significant discrepancies between generation and demand, automatic disconnections are activated in specific areas of the grid to avoid imbalances. In the most serious situations, the impacts of these triggered disconnections can extend to the entire network.

“This generalized blackout occurred because, in just five seconds, more than half of the electricity-generation capacity was lost,” Álvaro de la Puente Gil, professor of electrical engineering at the School of Mining Engineering of the University of León, said in comments to the Science Media Centre (SMC) in Spain. The grid, unable to balance such a sharp drop between generation and demand, protected itself by automatically disconnecting both internally and from the rest of the European grid.

In comments to the SMC, Miguel de Simón Martín, professor of electrical engineering at the University of León, explains that balance on a grid is typically guaranteed by three things. First is a complex network of interconnected lines, known as meshes, that distribute electrical flows across the grid to prevent overloads. Second, there are interconnections with neighboring countries' grids, which allow energy to be imported or exported as needed to balance generation and demand.

Finally, there is something called “mechanical inertia.” Synchronous generators—the large spinning machines that generate electricity in power stations—also store a lot of energy in their very large rotating parts. Imagine, say, a coal-fired power station. Even if it stops burning coal to generate more power, the huge, heavy turbines it uses to create electricity will continue spinning for some time because of the energy stored up in them. Known as mechanical inertia, this phenomenon can act as a buffer against abrupt fluctuations in the grid. When there are imbalances between energy generation and demand, synchronous generators can speed up or slow down their rotational speed to balance things out, essentially acting as a shock absorber to the grid by absorbing or releasing energy as needed.

“A large, well-meshed grid, with strong interconnections and abundant synchronous generators, will be more stable and less prone to failures,” says De Simón Martín “The Spanish peninsular power grid has historically been robust and reliable thanks to its high degree of meshing at high and very high voltage, as well as its large synchronous generation capacity. However, its weak point has always been its limited international interconnection, conditioned by the geographical barrier of the Pyrenees.”

According to his data, the electricity exchange capacity between Spain and the rest of Europe—in other words, how much energy the country can draw from or send into the continent—barely represents 3 percent of the country's installed capacity. This is well below the European Union's 15 percent target for member states to achieve by 2030.

Users board buses outside Atocha station in Madrid after its closure due to a massive blackout that affected Spain on April 28, 2025.

The increasing integration of renewable energy into the Spanish system may have exacerbated the disconnection issues and subsequent need to balance the grid. According to Spain's National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, the country has set a target for 81 percent of its electricity to come from clean sources by 2030. At the end of last year, renewables already accounted for 66 percent of installed capacity in Spain and generated 58.95 percent of the country's electricity. The main sources were wind, solar, and hydro.

De Simón Martín points out that, unlike thermal or hydroelectric power plants, wind and solar systems lack mechanical inertia, as they are connected to the grid not via synchronous generators but by electronic inverters. The robustness of the overall energy system therefore falls as the proportion of these inertia-lacking energy sources grows—essentially, fewer synchronous generators means less grid-wide ability to handle sudden changes in balance. “With low interconnection capacity and a high share of inverter-based renewable generation, our grid today is more vulnerable and has less margin to react to disturbances,” De Simón Martíne concludes.

Although the probability of a similar event occurring again in the short or medium term is low, experts agree that it is urgent to implement measures to strengthen the resilience of the system.

Manuel Alcázar Ortega, deputy director of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, told the SMC that an immediate solution would be to “limit the production of photovoltaic energy at times of low demand, in favor rolling generation that provides inertia to the system and can respond better to frequency variations.” He also considers it necessary to incorporate frequency and voltage stabilizers in the grid to counteract the loss of inertia caused by the high presence of renewables.

De la Puente Gil adds that a priority should be “to increase electricity interconnections with France and other European countries, so that the peninsula is no longer so isolated.” He also thinks there needs to be more flexibility in the existing system on the peninsula, with “more storage mechanisms that can compensate for the variability of renewable energies. All of this requires investment, planning and a clear strategy for a secure energy transition.”

In press conference held on Tuesday, Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, denied that high use of solar and wind or poor links with the European power grid were the main causes of the outage, but also said that no hypotheses as to what happened could be ruled out. Both the Spanish government and the European Commission have said that they are launching investigations into what caused the grid to fail.

Products shipped from local warehouses unaffected.

Third-party gaming controller and peripherals maker 8BitDo is putting a halt on shipments from its China warehouse to the U.S. In a notice posted on its official online store, the company cited newly introduced U.S. tariffs as the reason for the change. The notice also said that only products stored in its U.S. warehouse would be available for shipment to American customers, while international fulfillment from China was temporarily on hold. The firm has now changed its stance.

The aforementioned notice, blaming U.S. tariffs, was active on the company's official online store up until yesterday. However, the company updated the notice today. The notice now suggests that the company's warehouse in China will be shut from 1 to 5 May 2025 due to Labor Day, and customers can expect shipments to resume starting 6 May. There is no mention of what will happen after that date, or of the impact of U.S. tariffs.

For now, it is unclear why the wording of the notice was revised. We've reached out to 8BitDo for clarification on the company's intentions and what actions it plans to take moving forward.

At the time of writing, U.S. customers can still buy 8BitDo controllers, mice, keyboards, and other products that are already available in the company's U.S. warehouse. However, the website doesn't show which items are available locally. The only way to know that is at the checkout page, where it tells you if a product can or cannot be shipped to your location...

For those who haven't heard of the brand, 8BitDo specializes in retro-inspired gaming controllers and peripherals. It sells high-quality wireless controllers that offer compatibility with platforms like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PC, Android, and even some classic consoles. 8BitDo's products often come with eye-catching vintage aesthetics paired with modern features such as support for wireless connectivity, customization software, and USB-C charging.

The situation with 8BitDo isn't unique, as ripple effects of the newly announced tariffs are being felt across the PC hardware industry. Multiple companies are reportedly rethinking their logistics and pricing strategies. Just last week, PC case and component maker Hyte announced a pause in shipments of certain products to the U.S., citing the financial burden of increased tariffs. While certain PC cases may currently be exempt from the full 145% rate, they still face existing import duties, including a 20% base tariff and an additional 25% on aluminum-related materials.

As U.S. trade policy evolves, companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, components, or materials are struggling to deal with rising costs and maintaining affordability for consumers. Smaller and mid-sized hardware manufacturers are being forced to either absorb their losses, pass the additional costs onto customers, or make changes and relocate their manufacturing.
