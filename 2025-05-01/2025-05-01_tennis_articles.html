                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Draper beat Italy's Matteo Arnaldi 6-0, 6-4 in their last eight encounter on Thursday. The fifth seed will now face either Lorenzo Musetti or Gabriel Diallo on Friday for a place in the final. By beating Arnaldi, Draper has ensured he will be at least fifth in the latest ATP rankings. As well as overtaking Djokovic, he has also equalled a feat previously achieved by another tennis great. Draper is only the second left-handed player to be ranked in the top five this century. He follows in the footsteps of 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal. It is 20 years since the former world number first entered the top five back in May 2005. Reflecting on his win over Arnaldi, Draper told Sky Sports: "I feel stronger every time I play. "Against these guys I used to feel like I would be the one on the back foot, the one defending, so the next part of my game was getting capable physically to do the things I know I can do and bully these guys. "I have been doing everything in all areas pretty well and am excited to keep on going. "You see guys like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have no fear and so I just want to go after it, I suppose. "My forehand is doing a lot of damage and I want to keep it up. The 23-year-old won his first ATP Masters 1000 title at the Indian Wells Open back in March. Draper could add another such victory this weekend, with either Francisco Cerundolo or Casper Ruud waiting if he makes the final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Francisco Cerundolo advanced to his second career Masters 1000 semi-final with an impressive comeback win over Jakub Mensik. He picked up a big win in the fourth round, as Cerundolo stunned Alexander Zverev in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3. He then made his way through to his first Masters 1000 semi-final in three years, with a comeback win over Jakub Mensik, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2. However, while Cerundolo and Mensik provided some thrilling action in Madrid, the match may be better remembered for highlighting a ‘ridiculous' issue which continues to plague the sport. The two Adidas athletes turned up to their Madrid Open quarterfinal match in identical kits. “[Francisco] Cerundolo and [Jakub] Mensik: same shorts, shirt, wristband,” they said. “Unwatchable even for a diehard tennis fan,” said one disgruntled viewer on X. Tennis has got to be the stupidest sport sometimes.” Several other fans called for a rule change, after seeing Cerundolo and Mensik battle it out. we gotta stop with these kit clashes in tennis man, I look down for a minute and I just forget who's who. “We've got to stop with these kit clashes in tennis man, I look down for a minute and I just forget who's who,” said one fan. “This is just horrible to watch, and should be illegal in any sport.” If players chose to be stubborn about who of the pair needed to change, the decision could be made by ranking, forcing the lower-ranked player to swap into a different kit. It remains to be seen if ATP Tour officials will look into such a change, but there certainly seems to be some real demand for a solution. Cerundolo won't be too bothered by the kit drama, having booked his place in the Madrid Open semis with a thrilling win over Mensik. Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Cerundolo looked ahead to his last four encounter with Norway's Casper Ruud. “Playing Casper [Ruud] in the semi-finals is going to be a super tough match, I think it's 5-3, the head-to-head, but we play on clay maybe four or five times, 2-2 or 3-2 to him, I think,” he said. I saw him today, he's playing really good this week, I think he hasn't lost a set, so it's going to be a fight again.” The clay head-to-head record is level at 2-2, although Ruud has won their previous two matches on the surface. Ruud beat Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals to book his place in the semi-finals and looked dominant throughout. Only time will tell if Cerundolo can retake the lead in his clay head-to-head with Ruud when they face off for a place in the Madrid Open final. Cerundolo and Ruud will play their Madrid Open semi-final match on Friday, May 2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aidan Moody, at 21, has played in two Australian Opens, has served and volleyed at Wimbledon, represented Team GB and is heading to a world finals in Kazakhstan next week. They are bound together by a tennis story that is profoundly inspiring. Both have faced challenges, indeed still do. Both have found tennis to be a healing balm. Moody was diagnosed with autism at four. He found tennis at his primary school. It has led him towards a new, fulfilling life. He competes in the learning disability category. This is part of the Australian Open schedule. He finished runner-up in the doubles on both occasions. ‘But I believe the other majors will follow.' He is now preparing for the LD Virtus world tennis championships in Kazakhstan from May 3-11. He will travel with other members of Team GB. It has already been a spectacular journey. ‘This is my third time representing Team GB,' says Moody. ‘It is an honour to represent your country and I am very proud to pull on the jersey with the flag.' ‘It's always a good atmosphere with different players from around the world.' It has led to a meeting with Andy Murray, his hero. ‘He was coming off court after a session at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton and he looked tired. He's my idol and I look up to him. Moody and his father, Stephen, a mortgage adviser, have already banked special memories. This year at the Australian Open they met and chatted to Jim Courier, who is now a commentator but is also a grand slam winner. Ben Shelton, the American player, also stopped for a chat in the tunnels that link courts in Melbourne. He has been coached by Smith for six years. Moody was introduced to tennis when Giffnock tennis club did an outreach programme at Our Lady of the Missions primary school in Thornliebank. ‘I fell in love with the sport and joined Giffnock.' He benefited from coaching there and also attended a dedicated session every week with Glasgow Disability Tennis. The Smith brothers have serious form in coaching. Leon captained Team GB to a Davis Cup victory and also coached Murray as a teenager with Gary helping out. Leon is head of men's tennis at the LTA. Toby is now national manager for players aged 16 and under at Tennis Scotland. He regularly hit with Murray and has coached 11 players who have played in majors at junior and elite level. Now 44, he has to manage his time and efforts. ‘The mugging changed how much I could play,' he says. ‘Physically it took me a good while to get up and about. But then I won a few tournaments here and there.' I had to take periods of time off coaching. The collaboration with Moody, though, has been invigorating. ‘It is a new challenge,' says Smith. ‘He was entrusted to me when his previous coach moved from Giffnock. I was more than happy to take him on. We got on well very straight away. It's all about creating relationships with players. ‘We were just working away before any notion of grand slams came on the horizon. I didn't want to know the details of his disability. For me, he was just another player and every player has things he or she must work on. Smith points out that the other grand slam tournaments at Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows and Roland Garros are like to follow Australia's lead in including LD tennis. He has travelled the world with his son. ‘When we go to Australia, I take it as part of my annual leave and obviously we have to fund it,' he says. Andy Murray was wonderful with Aidan too at the NTC.' The greatest reward, of course, is to witness his son finding satisfaction and even joy. ‘Tennis has been simply brilliant for him,' he says. ‘He had great pals at primary school but at high school he was pretty much isolated and not through anybody's fault. Tennis has helped him cope with all of that and he now has a good group of friends locally as well as the many friends he has met through tennis. He is the youngest but it's a welcoming environment.' He didn't have a lot of confidence. It has given him a platform to succeed. That really helped his confidence and self-esteem.' This all unfolds in front of one's eyes at Rouken Glen. Moody plays with focus, determination and undiluted passion. His demeanour when he leaves court is quiet but there is that hint of satisfaction that glows after a productive session. Most wonderfully, though, there is the sense of a young man taking on the world despite his problems. It is humbling to realise that having learning difficulties does not mean one can't teach the rest of us a lesson.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Inside the NBA was winding down very early Thursday morning, Ernie Johnson read a promo for Roland-Garros, also known as the French Open, which will air on TNT Sports later this month. “Probably the last time we'll run that promo” – Ernie Johnson 🤣 pic.twitter.com/lNAA3W9vWR “Changing that from French Open to Roland-Garros is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard,” Barkley ranted. Stop,” Johnson interjected before reminding Barkley, “We're trying to keep a nice relationship with our new partners!” “We gave them $60 million a year, they can shut the hell up.” TNT Sports begins a 10-year, $650 million deal with the French Open, or as Chuck likes to call it, Roland-Garros, this month. NBC previously carried the tournament for 41 years and it was branded as the French Open, with Roland-Garros more often appearing as a secondary name. Since joining TNT Sports, however, the tournament is seemingly being promoted by its more official name, Roland-Garros. Or maybe the decision to promote it as Roland-Garros was made by TNT Sports executives. Barkley may have been a bit harsh in his wording, but he's right. Especially in their first year carrying the tournament, every graphic, commercial and ad read on TNT should mention “French Open” alongside Roland-Garros. Because if Barkley didn't know the French Open has long been called Roland-Garros, chances are others seeing these ads were similarly unaware.

But hold on to your seats, folks, because there's a twist in this comeback story that will leave you shocked! While fans were ecstatic to hear about Kyrgios' Roland Garros appearance, it has been revealed that the Australian star will not be competing in the singles competition. Despite the disappointment of not seeing Kyrgios in singles action, fans can still look forward to a dynamic duo on the doubles court as Kyrgios and Thompson team up to take on the competition at Roland Garros. Criticism has been directed towards the French Tennis Federation (FFT) for their strict wildcard policy, which often favors homegrown talents over international players. This policy has put players like Kyrgios in a tough spot, forcing them to explore alternative routes to participate in prestigious tournaments like the French Open. As the tennis world buzzes with speculation and anticipation, one thing is for sure – Nick Kyrgios is back, and he's ready to make a statement in Paris.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas' Participation in Upcoming Tennis Exhibition Hangs in the Balance Due to Scheduling Conflict The anticipation is high as Spain's renowned tennis duo, Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas, are slated to showcase their talent in an exhibition match scheduled to take place in Huelva this July. Joining them on the court will be Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, promising an exciting display of skill and sportsmanship. Adding to the uncertainty is Paula Badosa's current physical condition, as she is recuperating from a recent back injury. Sustained during the third round of the Miami Open in a match against Clara Tauson, Badosa displayed her resilience by clinching victory in straight sets with a score of 6-3, 7-6. In a recent interview with the WTA, Badosa shared insights into her recovery journey, expressing optimism about her progress. She revealed, “My back is good, slowly getting better. It's been a tough injury, honestly, this one because it was totally different from the last one. Stay tuned for more developments as the tennis season unfolds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Merseyside once again will be playing host to the 23rd Liverpool International Tennis Tournament in what is expected to be a huge week for the city. The event will take place on June 19 and run until June 21 at the Liverpool Cricket Ground in Aigburth, as it has done since 2014. Previous competitors include the likes of former world number one, Novak Djokovic, Emma Raducanu and Wimbledon Champion, Neal Scupski who was present in Liverpool just last year. The tournament was first introduced by Northern Vision Sporting Events in 2002 as a warm up event for players before Wimbledon. After last year's event, organisers at Northern Vision have evolved and become more engaged with the community. As a result of this, organisers are now in a position to give local players wildcards to junior tournaments that can give their career a chance to ignite. Event organiser Anders Borg, is delighted with the progress Northern Vision has had over the last year regarding community aspects. Being the organiser, we are able to give local players wildcards. It is a real community value for us.” A positive from Northern Vision's community development involves Liverpool's very own, Abi Redman, who will be competing at the event this year. “The atmosphere is so fun, and I love playing on grass. Growing up locally, my Grandad used to umpire at this event so I used to come and watch, hoping one day I would also play here.” After a successful period, Redman is now ranked around 600th in the world as she looks ahead to Liverpool Internationals in June. Opportunities for Redman first soared when she had the chance to compete internationally in 2022 after she received a wildcard from event organiser Borg, to compete in her first ITF main draw in Liverpool. “I've learned how vital self-belief is when playing at these high levels. Redman is also extremely grateful for the opportunity that was handed to her by Borg especially with the unfortunate circumstances that were in front of her. Having someone like Anders [Borg] to support you with Wild Cards can help with confidence and progress my game to what it is today," she said. After progress off the court, this year's tournament promises to be better than ever and Borg can not wait. “I am always very excited when the spring and summer comes around, the grass court season has started. We want to bring tennis out of a little bit of a snobbish environment and bring it out to the people," he said. “This year we are hosting it at the legendary Liverpool Cricket Club, which is one of the oldest sporting grounds in England. “It is certainly the highlight of our tennis schedule throughout the other organised events in Norway and in Spain. I have been there for 23 years and saw how the city has evolved over the years- it has become a fantastic place.” Tickets start at just £22 with children able to go for free and VIP access also available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andre Agassi, the eight-time tennis Grand Slam champion, made his professional pickleball debut at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championship in Naples, Florida on April 30. "She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play," Agassi told CNBC. Agassi and Waters were pushed to three games in their first match at noon, where they faced the teen duo of Tristan Dussault, 16, and Stevie Petrpouleas, 13. "Coming out here with Anna Leigh, I was more nervous than a gypsy with a mortgage," Agassi told CBS Sports. "This is a metaphor for life: choose your partners well." While Agassi struggled early, he and Waters settled down to avoid an upset. Tied 7-7 in the final game, Agassi and Waters scored four consecutive times, with Agassi scoring the game-winning point for a 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 victory. Agassi and Waters didn't fare as well in the second match at 6:30 p.m., losing to Len Yang and Trang Huynh-McClain in three sets, 7-11, 11-4, 11-7. "I'm really excited," Huynh-McClain said on the YouTube Pickleball Channel. And I'm happy that we went out with a win." Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas. Agassi's wife is fellow tennis legend Steffi Graf, 55. The pair married in 2001 and have two children: son Jaden Gil Agassi, 23, and daughter Jaz Elle Agassi, 21. Aggasi and Graf live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Agassi was asked by Us Weekly where he stands with Shields after the release of her book, "Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old." “I guess maybe one of the reasons why I don't know much about it is because I don't want to be in a position to necessarily comment on it one way or another, except rooting for her. His pro tennis career earnings total $31,152,975, per the ATP Tour. During his tennis career, Agassi had deals with Nike and Adidas, worth millions. According to the LA Times, Agassi's Nike deal, which ended in 2005, was reportedly worth $120 million over 10 years. Contributing: Ed Reed, Dan DeLuca, Naples Daily News</p>

Grey Days is a long tribute to the timeless quality of the brand's lasting legacy in its signature color: grey. And while the brand's styles evolved to embrace modern technology and creative innovation, the color continues to represent New Balance's style legacy. New Balance will launch the shade across 21 footwear styles and 11 apparel designs throughout May, ranging from all-time classics to modern favorites. The CG2 introduces a mid-cut silhouette, providing a bold, non-traditional look that differenciates it from the typical tennis shoe. The shoe is designed to improve court-ready performance while elevating the creative vision of Gauff's signature model. The shoe's dual-density FuelCell midsole not only provides exceptional cushioning, but it also grants energy returns to assist a player's response when recovering to the baseline. This is the second time Gauff will bring the Grey Day celebration to grand slam tennis. The Coco CG2 ($160) is currently available in multiple colorways on newbalance.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Andre Agassi's pro pickleball debut at the US Open Pickleball Championships has come to an end, after he and partner Anna Leigh Waters fell in their second match to Len Yang and Trang Huynh-McClain. Agassi – an eight-time grand slam singles champion on the tennis court – and Waters clinched a victory in their first match over Stevie Petropouleas and Tristan Dussault with a 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 win in the mixed pro division on Wednesday in Naples, Florida. Agassi had nothing but praise for Waters – the 18 year old No. 1-ranked player in the world – ahead of the tournament, saying: “She's right up there with the greatest ever in what she does and the idea of challenging myself to not screw things up for her is daunting,” per Reuters. Once relatively niche, pickleball – a mashup of tennis, table tennis and badminton that can be played indoors or outdoors, by single players or in pairs – now claims to be the United States' fastest-growing sport. An estimated 48.3 million adults played it at least once between 2022 and 2023, according to the Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP), which is nearly 19% of the total US population. Related article Catherine O'Hara on pickleball, Super Bowl commercials and colorful fan encounters Agassi has been known to play the sport alongside his wife, 22-time grand slam singles title winner Steffi Graf. “He's so good,” she told CNN Sports earlier this year. His sense for this game, how quickly he picked it up, was absolutely phenomenal to watch. “Not that I didn't see it in the other sports that he's so good at, but he picked it up and he loved the analysis of it, from the beginning on watching videos and other clips. Since discovering his love for pickleball, Agassi has become a vocal advocate of the sport. “It's going to grow like you can't even imagine,” Agassi said, adding that he could “absolutely” see pickleball at the Olympics. However, regardless of his aptitude for the sport, Agassi is unlikely to be pursuing full-time pro status anytime soon. “If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. I'm in a different season now,” he said, per Reuters.</p>

Djokovic is already out of the Italian Open in Rome next week following a three-match losing streak, having crashed out of the Madrid Open following defeat by Matteo Arnaldi. He faces arriving at the French Open without having won a match on clay since his emotional victory over Carlos Alcaraz last summer in the Olympic final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Djokovic has played a fuller schedule than last season, when his bid for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title fell short, but it has not helped him find any consistent form, with the world No 5 losing his opening match in four of his last five tournaments. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player He wants to move above Margaret Court [24 Grand Slam titles]; he wants to become the greatest tennis player, but it's getting harder and harder, and actually, I always feel like he's just gone a bit flat on the court as well. He didn't win a major last year, which was extraordinary, but all four majors were split between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, and actually, when I look at his results, he's had some extraordinary losses to very low-ranked players - to Alejandro Tabilo [in Monte-Carlo] and Matteo Arnaldi here. "The last great match that I think he played was against Alcaraz in Australia [Djokovic won in four sets to reach the semi-finals]. "I think he's not in great shape, so I don't know if he can sort it out ahead of the French Open." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Serbian has said his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon. Djokovic began working with his long-time rival, who retired from playing in August, on a trial basis at January's Australian Open. Djokovic still has hopes of achieving his 100th tour-level title to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admits his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player With Djokovic turning 38 on May 22, he will be searching for a fourth title at Roland-Garros but won't be a top-four seed at the second Grand Slam of the year which could lead to a blockbuster quarter-final encounter. He's 37, I think nearly 38, not going to get any easier," said Croft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jana Novotna's Wimbledon victory in 1998 stands as one of the most emotional and memorable Grand Slam moments in tennis history. The Czech star enjoyed a decorated career, lifting 100 titles, 76 in doubles and 24 in singles, including 12 Grand Slam doubles crowns. But for many, she was long defined by a heartbreaking loss at the All England Club in 1993, and the emotional win that followed five years later. Novotna turned professional in February 1987 and quickly made her mark with an elegant serve-and-volley game that was rare and stood out in the women's game. By 1990, she had cracked the top 15, and in 1991, she reached her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, losing to Monica Seles after notching wins over Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. That was the first of four major singles finals she would reach. En route to the final, Novotna defeated both Monica Seles and Martina Navratilova. Novotna and the Duchess of Kent (Getty Images) “I know you will win it one day, don't worry,” the Duchess whispered to her. “It wouldn't sound great to say the 1993 final was the one I was most proud of because I lost the match when I was ahead,” she told Wimbledon, as cited in a 2018 article. “But it meant so much for me and maybe it made me a better player, a better person and maybe that match helped me to accomplish a lot more in my career.” By then, she had developed into a more complete player, but still couldn't convert the big moment into victory. Just weeks away from turning 30, she held her nerve, winning 6-4, 7-6 and clinching the tiebreak 7-2. While her singles journey is the most famous chapter, Novotna was also one of the greatest doubles players of her era. She won 12 major titles and completed a double career Grand Slam in doubles, partnering with some of the best players of the 1990s. She continued to be a regular presence at the tournament, playing in the Invitation Doubles and working as a BBC commentator. Martina Navratilova (R) and Jana Novotna celebrate winning the Ladies Invitational Doubles Final (Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) In 2005, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World number one men's tennis player Jannik Sinner will be making his return from a three-month doping ban in Rome on 4 May. Those thoughts came to Sinner's mind when he defended his Australian Open crown earlier this year. Sinner accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him. The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy. Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping,” Sinner said. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way. Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month. “Sometimes it goes very well, sometimes there is a drop and I don't know why, so I will certainly be very happy to return to the court. I am certainly very happy that this phase is now over and we are ready to start again.” Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion. “It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all also of what I went through and it was very difficult. “I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. Jakub Mensik extended his win streak in the Masters 1000 to 10 matches as he displayed a fantastic performance against Alexander Bublik in the fourth round. However, he will face his biggest test in the quarterfinals against Francisco Cerundolo, who is going through the best phase of his career. Cerundolo took out the top seed, Alexander Zverev, and will look to reach his first Masters semifinal of the season. Matteo Arnaldi played another solid match to defeat Frances Tiafoe in straight sets. Being seeded at Roland Garros would be his goal, and another win here would certainly get him closer to achieving that. However, beating Jack Draper is going to be a huge task. I expect him to continue his great form and win this in straight sets. Gabriel Diallo won the biggest match of his life after saving three match points in the second set tiebreak against Grigor Dimitrov. Dimitrov got a little tight, and Diallo took advantage by playing brave tennis. The Canadian player has had his fair share of luck this season, with multiple main draw appearances as a lucky loser. However, this time he has taken advantage of the second opportunity and is in his first Masters quarterfinal. Lorenzo Musetti continues his brilliant form on clay and got the better of Alex de Minaur again. Diallo is playing fearless tennis and has been brilliant behind his serve. I am going with the Italian in this one. Daniil Medvedev made a good comeback after losing the first set to defeat Brandon Nakashima in three sets. He makes it back-to-back quarterfinals in Madrid and would be pleased to have defended the points from last year. Medvedev has never lost a set to Casper Ruud, but this will be the first time that these two will face each other on a clay court. Medvedev will need to serve well to have a chance, as Ruud is a better player on clay from the baseline. Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff headline semifinal action at the WTA Mutua Madrid Open. The defending champion has a dominant 11-3 record against her American One of those is Coco Gauff vs Mirra Andreva, and we at LWOT predict that blockbuster encounter</p>
