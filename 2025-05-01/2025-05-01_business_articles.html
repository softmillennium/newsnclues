                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Thursday any country or person that buys oil or petrochemicals from Iran will not be allowed to do any business with the U.S. Iran is one of the biggest oil producers in OPEC. "Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. "They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form." Trump has implemented what he calls a "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran since taking office, which aims to completely shut down the Islamic Republic's oil exports. Trump also initiated negotiations with Iran last month over its nuclear program. His administration believes Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, an allegation that Tehran has denied. The president has said he would prefer to reach a deal with Iran. Trump's comments are clearly directed at China, which is importing more than 1 million barrels per day from Iran, said Scott Modell, CEO of consulting firm Rapidan Energy. Modell said U.S. sanctions are unlikely to have an impact on Iranian oil flowing to China unless the White House targets Beijing's state-owned enterprises and infrastructure. The president's statements "don't signify a change in the administration's drive to reach a new deal with Iran but rather underscore Trump's belief in negotiating through strength," Modell, a former CIA officer, told CNBC. Trump last month imposed what he calls "secondary tariffs" on any country that buys oil from Venezuela, another OPEC member. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will nominate Mike Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, confirming earlier reports that Waltz was being ousted as national security advisor. Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as interim national security advisor until that post is filled. The announcement came hours after multiple news reports that Walz would leave that role amid continued controversy over his creation of a Signal messaging app chat thread that was used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reveal U.S. military plans to other Trump administration officials. But Trump withdrew Stefanik's nomination in late March, citing the very slim majority that Republicans hold in the House of Representatives. "I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday. "From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role," Trump wrote. "In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" Waltz, 51, previously served in the House, representing a Florida district. Earlier, he served in the U.S. Army as a Special Forces officer. State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce was asked at a briefing Thursday how long Rubio would stay in the interim role as national security advisor. 'It is clear that I just heard this from you," Bruce told the reporter who asked that question. In February, Trump appointed Rubio as acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Henry Kissinger, who served as President Richard Nixon's national security advisor, retained that position after Nixon appointed him secretary of state in 1973. Kissinger retained both jobs under Nixon's successor, President Gerald Ford, until Ford installed Brent Scowcroft as national security advisor in November 1975.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National security advisor Mike Waltz is leaving his post in the Trump administration on the heels of controversy over his creation of a Signal messaging app group that was used to discuss U.S. military plans in March. President Donald Trump confirmed Waltz's departure in a social media post hours after media outlets reported that the advisor was being ousted. Trump said he would nominate Waltz as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would serve as interim national security advisor until the post could be filled. Deputy national security advisor Alex Wong is also expected to leave his job, according to three sources who spoke to NBC News about the two exits on Thursday. Waltz was conspicuously absent from a Rose Garden event at the White House marking the National Day of Prayer on Thursday. Many other senior Trump administration officials were in attendance. The Signal group that Waltz created inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of messages exchanged between high-level Trump administration officials. The group's other members were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Goldberg reported that the texts ended with Hegseth on March 15 detailing plans that "included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing" of attacks on Houthi forces in Yemen, which were launched within hours of those texts. Trump earlier this week told The Atlantic that Waltz's job was secure. In a discussion with Atlantic reporters, Trump was asked if he believed that Hegseth would remain as Pentagon chief. Hegseth has been criticized for his disclosure of the attack plans on the group that included Goldberg, and for his separate use of the app to send some information about the planned strikes on Houthi forces to his wife, his brother, his attorney and some aides. "Yeah, he's safe," Trump said of Hegseth. Asked if Hegseth would stay in the administration longer than Waltz, Trump replied, "Waltz is fine. The Pentagon's internal watchdog is investigating Hegseth for his use of Signal to discuss pending military strikes. The probe by the Office of Inspector General will determine if Hegseth and other Defense Department staff complied with rules over the "use of a commercial messaging application for official business," the office said last month. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday that he believed Waltz should be dismissed from his post. Trump's first national security advisor, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, resigned under fire in early 2017 after just 24 days for having misled then-Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. Trump pardoned Flynn in late 2020, months before leaving office. Correction: John Ratcliffe is director of the CIA. An earlier version misstated his name. We want to hear from you.

The AI Race:

The artificial intelligence boom is driving business to private credit firms, as tech companies seek funding to build data centers filled with computing chips to operate AI models.

Carlyle Group Inc. expects more than $1.8 trillion of capital will be deployed by 2030 to meet that demand, and a chunk of that can be taken up by the private markets, Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz recently wrote in a shareholder letter. </p>

Microsoft Corp. is raising prices on its Xbox games, consoles and accessories amid broader uncertainty about how the ongoing trade wars will impact supply chains in the gaming industry. 

“We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,” Xbox wrote in a blog post Thursday morning. “Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he exits his efforts to curtail wasteful government spending, Elon Musk is taking one last shot, calling into question the $2.5 billion Federal Reserve building renovation. "I mean, what do you get for $2.5 billion in redecorating? Must be incredible," the Tesla CEO said. Since then, multiple factors have converged to drive up costs, including rising costs of materials, construction delays, changes in the design and site problems. Among the goals for the renovation are dealing with a backlog of upgrades, meeting building codes and regulations, updating technology, and addressing energy efficiency. Fed officials say the changes ultimately will save money by consolidating staff into one space, which will reduce leasing costs, "and provide a modern, efficient workspace for employees to conduct their work on behalf of the American people." Musk, though, said the cost overruns should be part of the broader examination of government waste. DOGE claims to have saved taxpayers $160 billion during its short operating life looking through the government's books. "Since, at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, I think ... we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer," Musk said. They're like, can we see pictures of what you get for that?" The Fed is not actually funded by taxpayers but rather by the interest the central banks earns on its securities as well as fees from banks it supervises. Members of the Fed board of governors have their salaries set by Congress and also are paid through the same funding mechanism. However, the past two years the central bank has seen operating losses due to rising interest rates that it must pay on bank reserves. We want to hear from you.

A Charles Schwab location in San Antonio, Texas.

Charles Schwab Corp. telephoned thousands of its retail-investing customers who were close to margin calls last month as US President Donald Trump's trade war sent stocks sinking, Chief Executive Officer Rick Wurster said.

It's a “pre-margin-call call,” Wurster said Thursday at a Reuters event. Schwab reaches out to clients if they're nearing a margin call — triggered when money is needed in a margin account to meet minimum capital requirements — because some clients opt to add funds rather than being automatically pulled out of a position, he said. “We absolutely have had to do a lot more of those.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta's content-moderation mishaps used to be the talk of Madison Avenue, when advertisers would lambast the tech giant over its so-called brand safety concerns. The company's first-quarter revenue, which is almost entirely derived from advertising, reached $42 billion in the quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations and up 16% year over year. In January, Meta said it was replacing third-party fact-checkers with an X-inspired community notes system on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. The company said it also planned to bring back more political content to users' timelines and was easing content moderation rules around topics like gender identity and immigration. Advertisers and industry analysts told BI in January that while the changes made them feel uneasy, they'd likely continue to spend with Meta as long as it delivered the large audiences and ad performance they've come to expect from the platform. Susan Lee, Meta's chief financial officer, said there had been some spending reductions from Asia-based e-commerce advertisers targeting US users, likely in anticipation of President Donald Trump ending the de minimis tax loophole on May 2. Meta said its ad business would remain strong, pushing aside fears of a tariff-induced advertising slowdown. Nick Manning, a former ad agency exec and founder of the marketing consultancy Encyclomedia International, told BI that major advertisers still have deep concerns about user safety and the type of content that gets published on major tech platforms. "Meta, for certain kinds of advertisers, still delivers the goods — and those advertisers aren't really bothered about user safety and brand safety," Manning said. Meta said in January that it continued to be focused on ensuring brand safety and suitability by offering a range of tools for advertisers. While it faces the same macroeconomic uncertainty as many other businesses, Meta is doing so from a position of strength. "Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty," said Minda Smiley, a senior analyst at the research firm EMARKETER, a BI sister company. Just take a look at the contrasting fortunes of Snap. Its shares plummeted Tuesday after it reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that were in line with expectations but said it wouldn't share guidance for the second quarter, blaming the macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla's board chair has denied that the company ever considered replacing Elon Musk as CEO amid a stock price slump and global brand crisis sparked by his work at DOGE. The Journal reported that as Tesla's stock price plunged in March and April amid collapsing sales and public blowback over Musk's work at DOGE, unnamed Tesla board members reached out to recruitment firms to work on a process to select Tesla's next CEO. Board members had also told Musk he needed to spend more time at Tesla and reaffirm his commitment to the company publicly, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. In Tesla's first quarter earnings last week, Musk announced he would step back from his White House role in May and allocate more time to leading Tesla, with the company's stock price surging in response. "Now, we're getting more of a rhythm, and so the amount of time that it's necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies — which they need me," Musk said in an interview with reporters in the White House on Wednesday evening, before the Journal's story was published. Musk also denied the article in a post on X. It comes amid a rocky start to the year for Tesla. The automaker has been hit by a global wave of protests over Musk's role in cutting the federal workforce, which has also turned its vehicles into targets for vandalism and pushed some owners to sell up. In a Wednesday note, Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said Musk did the right thing in stepping back from his DOGE role and that Musk would likely stay on as CEO for at least another five years. "This situation with Musk at DOGE was reaching a breaking point, but we believe that cooler heads have now prevailed," said Ives, describing the reported search for possible replacements as a "game of high-stakes poker" between Tesla's board and Musk. Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment sent outside normal working hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High-profile tech titans like Mark Zuckerberg have largely embraced President Donald Trump since he won a second term, with many of them making large donations to the president's inaugural fund and socializing among MAGA world at Mar-a-Lago. Podcaster Dwarkesh Patel asked the Meta CEO to elaborate on his connection to Trump during a Tuesday interview. "Our default as an American company should be to try to have a productive relationship with whoever is running the government," Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago the day before Thanksgiving in 2024, and he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his fellow tech billionaires at Trump's inauguration in January. He told Patel that Meta's attempts to work with the Biden administration didn't pan out. "I've been pretty public with some of my frustrations with the previous administration — how they basically did not engage with us or the business community more broadly," he said. In August, Zuckerberg called out the Biden administration, saying Meta was pressured to remove Facebook posts related to COVID-19 by the government. Zuckerberg said at the time he regretted not pushing back on the White House. A strong relationship between Big Tech and the government is "necessary" for progress, Zuckerberg told Patel on Tuesday. "It's like we're trying to build great stuff," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Judging by Trump's own words on Wednesday, that's not the case. Following his 100th day in office, data showed the US economy contracted last quarter for the first time in three years. "This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th," Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Wednesday. "Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other," he added. For those following along since his first term, it was a familiar sight. The president has often taken credit for stock gains—even during times he was not in the White House — and blamed others for losses. In March, shortly after returning to the White House and as the market tumbled from all-time highs reached in February, he suggested that investors shouldn't be watching stocks, though he referred to the market's gains during his first term as an "amazing achievement." "You can't really watch the stock market," Trump said in an interview with Fox News in early March after tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China were first unveiled. "If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. You're the effect," Trump said at a rally in Washington. "Since the election, the stock market has surged, and small-business optimism has soared a record 41 points to a 39-year high. Bitcoin has shattered one record high after another." That's plausible, as markets had initially priced in a big boost to growth and economic activity. However, expectations were recalibrated once he took office, as it became clear that the trade war would be more aggressive than anyone predicted. However, Trump has even taken credit when he wasn't anywhere near the levers of power in Washington, DC. Perhaps the best example of the president's eagerness to take credit for the market's good fortune came in 2020, when Trump sent Fox News host Lou Dobbs an autographed chart of the Dow Jones Industrial average, which shot up 2,000 points in a single day after he declared COVID-19 an emergency. While Trump has historically highlighted the stock market to showcase his achievements as president, his team has suggested this time around that he's got his eye on a different scorecard: the 10-year US Treasury yield. That ties into the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs for Americans, which was a central point in his campaign for president last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term," the Treasury Department said in a press release. "President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides' commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine." The Treasury Department added that the economic partnership positions Ukraine and the US to "work collaboratively and invest together" to ensure that "our mutual assets, talents, and capabilities can accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery." On social media, Svyrydenko wrote: "Together with the United States we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment into our country." Bessent later said in a video statement that the deal would help "unlock Ukraine's growth assets." The agreement comes at a time of rising supply-chain uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare earth metals are sourced from. On April 4, China restricted exports of seven rare earth elements and related materials in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially affecting critical industries like defense, energy, and automobiles. High-purity neon gas and rare earth metals are critical for semiconductor manufacturing to power the growth of AI systems. The minerals deal was originally set to be signed on February 28, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington ended in acrimony. The agreement was signed just days after Trump and Zelenskyy met in person on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, as cease-fire talks between Moscow and Washington continue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta reported $4.2 billion in losses from its Reality Labs division this quarter on Wednesday. Its total metaverse burn has now pushed past $60 billion since 2020. Adding to the turmoil, Meta conducted layoffs in its Reality Labs division last week, primarily affecting teams that focused on VR gaming and the Supernatural VR fitness app, which Meta owns. At least one analyst thinks the end is near. "For now, Meta maintains two tales of one company," Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx told Business Insider. "Its Family of Apps continues to grow by the metrics that matter. Year-over-year, that division's revenue is down, and losses are up. I predict come end of this year, Meta will shutter its metaverse projects, like Horizon Worlds." Horizon Worlds, Meta's social VR app in which users interact as avatars in shared digital spaces, was once the company's poster child for the metaverse. Over the 2024 holidays, Meta's Horizon app briefly topped app store charts — not because of surging interest in the metaverse, but because it's required to set up a new Quest headset. It signaled that the devices were a popular gift. On this week's earnings call, Meta said Quest sales underperformed, dragging Reality Labs' revenue down 6% year-over-year. On the call, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked what might finally shrink those multibillion-dollar losses. In January, Meta quietly reshuffled the division, moving top sales and marketing leads under broader company leadership to align more tightly with its AI push. For now, Meta is still in the fight, though its momentum has clearly moved elsewhere: to its Llama AI models, Meta AI, and those Ray-Bans. The metaverse may not be dead yet, but it's no longer center stage.</p>
