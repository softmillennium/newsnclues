The Tarter Award recognizes individuals whose projects or ideas significantly advance humanity's search for extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Named in honor of Dr. Jill Tarter, SETI Institute co-founder and leader in the field of SETI research, the award celebrates contributions across science, technology, education, art, philosophy, law and ethics that support the SETI Institute's mission to search for life and intelligence beyond Earth. “The SETI Institute's Tarter Award recognizes innovators whose creativity produces a concept that helps improve the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, even though its original purpose was something entirely different,” said Tarter. We are looking for other creative individuals and their creations that we can use in unexpected ways to do our mission better.” The Tarter Award is open to any individual or individuals whose innovative work has demonstrably impacted the search for life beyond Earth. For serious consideration, a nominee's contributions should generally have been published, at least in part, in peer-reviewed journals or subjected to an equivalent expert review. The nomination period opens on January 15, 2026, with a deadline of March 31, 2026. All nominations should be submitted via email to tarteraward@seti.org. The 2026 Tarter Award recipient will be publicly honored at a SETI Institute event and will receive $100,000 in recognition of their achievement. "Jill Tarter's career, as significant as it was in developing and broadening the search for possible signals from extraterrestrial intelligence, always included more than just pure research,” said Andrew Fraknoi, SETI Institute Board Member. It thus made a lot of sense to name an award for her that recognizes innovative or interdisciplinary projects in the search for life in the universe."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), Illinois had 34 reported UFO sightings in 2025 through mid‑year, with observers describing everything from oddly-shaped objects to strange orbs and lights. Keep in mind that organizations like NUFORC compile reports as they come in, and many sightings from late 2025 may not be tallied publicly yet. The state's full year total for 2025 isn't finalized. Here are some examples from Northern Illinois in 2025, as cataloged on the NUFORC database: Jan. 23, 2025 (Chicago): Triangle‑shaped object that appeared to change shape and light patterns. Feb. 10, 2025 (Carol Stream): White oval‑shaped light seen at the front door and captured on Ring camera. 8, 2025 (Gurnee): Orb‑shaped craft seen about 300 feet away through a bedroom window. May 29, 2025 (Worth): Diamond‑shaped object too bright to be a star, with an image captured by the witness. But before you start prepping for close encounters, the fun reality is that while the term “UFO” technically means unidentified flying object, it doesn't automatically mean alien spacecraft. Many of these sightings end up being explained as drones, satellites, weather balloons, bright planets seen from unusual angles, or other perfectly ordinary objects that look strange at night. In fact, UFO organizations estimate only a small fraction of sightings merit deeper investigation, and most of those get credible explanations over time.</p>

For a project which has never been formally addressed by anyone at Marvel Studios, the rumored Midnight Sons film certainly has quite an archive of potential information. From rumored writers to directors and cast members, the big screen team-up flick has allegedly been in development since 2022 and its potential to be a hit is undeniable.

Werewolf By Night helmer Michael Giacchino‘s was originally floated as a potential before Fede Álvarez‘s name popped up on the radar in 2024. Alvarez's name seemed to be attached to a screenplay being drafted by Logan scribe Michael Green and it seemed as though the studio was hoping to fast track the project. While it's possible the studio had originally planned to get the supernatural squad together before the end of the Multiverse Saga, the deployment of the Time Ripper to accelerate the end of uneven Saga through the removal of scheduled films could have delayed its announcement and arrival.

The potential project found itself in the headlines again this week following a report that Marvel had finally moved on from its long-delayed Blade reboot  in favor of introducing Mahershala Ali‘s Daywalker in Midnight Sons. Now, an interesting rumor has followed that news down the pipeline.

An Ali and Oscar Isaac-led project would carry some cache and the supporting cast, should the rumor be accurate, would be among the studio's most impressive–and that's without knowing who they'd cast as whichever Ghost Rider is supposed to be on the squad.

For what it's worth, in the comics, the Children of Midnight have typically had 9 members, meaning there's room for one more surprise on the supernatural squad's lineup as they potentially take on Mia Goth's Lilith while also dealing with the machinations of Mephisto!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two decades of work involving radio telescopes stationed on opposite sides of the world, a supercomputer in Germany, and two million volunteer computers worldwide. A team of UC Berkeley scientists has painstakingly analyzed billions of radio signals received over fifteen years and have zeroed in on 100 that are most likely to be sent by extraterrestrial intelligence. The project -- called SETI@home after the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence -- sought to scan a third of the sky visible from Earth to isolate a certain type of radio signals: those belonging to a narrow bandwidth, with most of their power concentrated at a small range of frequencies. Scientists believe these characteristics could indicate that they are sent by an extraterrestrial life form. It took two decades for the project to arrive at its conclusion, but as a result, a dataset of 12 billion radio signals has been winnowed down to the 100 that are likeliest to have been sent by an extraterrestrial life form. SETI@home was conceived in 1995, when David Anderson, a computational scientist and computer science professor at UC Berkeley was researching "distributed computing." This technique entails distributing large computational tasks into smaller tasks across a large network of computers, significantly cutting down the costs for researchers. "1995 was a time when home computers were getting connected to the internet," said Anderson, "and it was also a time when home computers were getting pretty fast." Tonight -- a strange sight in the skies over Oregon--pilots report seeing several UFOs. Coming up -- hear how they describe those objects in calls to the control tower. Plus -- a California couple killed while on vacation in Mexico. What we're learning about the shooting -- as investigators search for a motive. When a graduate student suggested using distributed computing to analyze radio signals received by radio telescopes to scan for extraterrestrial intelligence, Anderson teamed up with UC Berkeley astronomers Erik Korpela and Dan Werthimer to work on the project. Then they developed the SETI@home software, which volunteers worldwide could download on their own computers. Like a screensaver, this software was designed to work in the background. Anderson said that they only started receiving good quality data in 2006, after an upgrade to the Arecibo telescope. Expecting this avalanche of data and the need to filter it further, in 2016, Anderson, Korpela, and Werthimer started working on specialized algorithms to eliminate the spurious signals generated by interference from Earth's radio, TV stations, and aircraft radar systems. "We had to do that hundreds of times, because... it was all very experimental," he said. "Nobody had ever done anything like this before, so we started off with some algorithms that did not work very well. Anderson said that so far, the sources of half of the 100 signals have been observed, and they haven't returned a hit. Above all, he sees the project as a successful demonstration of how distributed computing can democratize science. Volunteer computing makes it possible to do that kind of science for a lot less money," he said. "My personal hope is that... companies like OpenAI and Google that are able to spend a billion dollars to build new data centers will not have a monopoly on AI if we can figure out a way to use volunteer computing to train large language models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fawzia Mirza, the award-winning director of “The Queen of My Dreams,” has been tapped to helm “Bhoot,” an English-language South Asian paranormal thriller from Toronto-based Champ & Pepper and multi-hyphenate Dana Abraham. Champ & Pepper, a marketing agency known for handling global campaigns for major studio releases, is making its first major push into original film production with the project. Emilia Clarke Leaves Daenerys Behind With Peacock's Endearing Spy Caper 'Ponies': TV Review ‘Cause of Death: Unknown' Review: Iran's Surprisingly Daring Official Oscar Entry Sees an Ensemble Cast Conflicted by a Moral Conundrum “Bhoot” centers on Aru Saha, a young South Asian woman grappling with grief, guilt and generational pressure who arrives with her brother Das and their parents in an ostensibly perfect town concealing a supernatural secret drawn from South Asian folklore. The psychological horror aims to blend emotional family drama with genre elements. Abraham is producing under his Red Hill Creative banner alongside Champ & Pepper's Jeff Pestell and Glenn Karpel. Ella Wahlstedt of Quarterlife Pictures also serves as producer, having developed the screenplay with Abraham from its inception. “Having Fawzia join us elevates this film in ways I couldn't imagine. With their decades of global marketing experience and deep studio relationships, we're preparing for a strategic rollout long before the cameras roll.” Mirza's feature directorial debut, “The Queen of My Dreams,” world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and screened at SXSW among dozens of festivals before its theatrical release. The film recently earned a GLAAD Award nomination for outstanding feature and received two Canadian Screen Awards and the Directors Guild of Canada award for best feature, among other honors. The director most recently wrapped production on Tubi and Webtoon Productions feature “Kissing Is the Easy Part” and will return to direct Season 2 of Hulu comedy series “Deli Boys.” Having a director like Fawzia on board only makes this even more thrilling.” Abraham is currently entering production on sports-comedy series “Strikers,” set to begin filming this spring. Mirza is represented by IAG, Alexander Stegmaier and Granderson Des Rochers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Short's body was found mutilated and drained of blood on Jan. 15, 1947 It has been nearly eight decades since Elizabeth Short was found dead — but her case remains one of Hollywood's most notorious murder mysteries. Her body had been mutilated and cut in half with surgical precision. Despite the gruesome killing, not a drop of blood was left behind. It began an intense period of tabloid press coverage fueled by rumors and inaccurate reporting. The Black Dahlia remains an unsolved mystery and a case that detectives are still working on today. Short was born on July 29, 1924, and grew up outside Boston with her parents and four sisters, per The Black Dahlia: Shattered Dreams. After dealing with a respiratory condition and undergoing surgery, a 16-year-old Short began spending winters in Florida with family friends, per a doctor's recommendation who believed the milder climate would help improve her health. Eventually, Short dropped out of high school and regularly visited her loved ones. In 1942, Short's mother received an apology letter from her husband, who had been presumed deceased for over a decade, according to Shattered Dreams. Soon after, when Short was 18, she decided to join him, but it was short-lived, and she moved out in early 1943. Later that year, she relocated to Santa Barbara but ended up being arrested for underage drinking and was sent home to her mother. Less than six months later, she would be found dead. Over the last six months of her life in L.A., Short is said to have lived in multiple places across the city while working various jobs. She struggled financially but always seemed to come up with money for rent and other necessities. “Miss Short's life in Hollywood seemed to follow a pattern. She didn't have any visible signs of employment, she'd be broke, and then suddenly have some money," former police officer Vince Carter said in Shattered Dreams. In December 1946, just weeks before her murder, Short left L.A. for San Diego. When Short arrived in San Diego, she met another young woman named Dorothy French, who allowed her to stay with her family. During her time with them, Short admitted she was hiding from an ex-boyfriend out of fear, per Black Dahlia Avenger: A Genius Murder. French revealed that several weeks into Short's stay, two men and a woman came to the home looking for her. Upon hearing about the visitors, Short became “very frightened” and “panicky,” refusing to see them. They eventually left, and she decided to relocate. According to Shattered Dreams, Short departed on Jan. 8 with a traveling salesman she had been seeing. They drove back to L.A. together, and he dropped her off at the Biltmore Hotel, where she claimed to be meeting her sister. (Short's sibling, Virginia, later told authorities they hadn't arranged to see each other.) Hotel employees recounted seeing Short make several telephone calls in the lobby that evening, growing increasingly frantic. The next few days of Short's life leading up to her murder have been shrouded in some degree of mystery. Her exact whereabouts are unknown, aside from sporadic sightings and an alleged encounter with Officer Myrl McBride, who claimed to have seen Short on Jan. 14, just hours before she was found dead. By then, the man was gone, and McBride left Short's side. Later, McBride saw Short exiting the same bar with two men and a woman, and the officer checked in on her. Although she appeared to be fine at the time, Short was murdered hours later. On the morning of Jan. 15, 1947, Short's body was discovered by a young mother on a walk with her child through Leimert Park, an L.A. neighborhood that was largely undeveloped at the time. Short's naked body had been severed at the waist with surgical precision. Though internal organs were removed, the extensively mutilated corpse had been drained of blood, indicating that Short had been killed elsewhere. Police quickly mailed a copy of Short's fingerprints to the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., but, being cross-country, they knew it would be days before they received answers. Hours later, the FBI successfully identified Short, thanks to the fingerprints they had on record from when she applied for a job on an army base in California and when she was arrested for underage drinking. The origins of Short's Black Dahlia nickname date back long before her murder. Around the time that Short was murdered, it was common for newspapers to assign a nickname for murder cases, especially those involving women. After Short's body was discovered, the Los Angeles Police Department launched an investigation, which ran until 1950 when it was shut down, according to 48 Hours. Over three years, the LAPD received dozens of clues, leads and false confessions — but ultimately, it all yielded no substantial results. In 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss the inability of the LAPD's homicide unit to solve murders, during which Short's death was further investigated. Detective Harry Hansen, who was assigned to the case, said in a sworn testimony that he still believed a “medical man” was behind the crime because of how Short's body was severed, per the Los Angeles Times. The trial led to further investigative interviews with friends, family and suspects, but there were no additional leads on the case. To this day, no one has ever been officially charged for Short's murder. Several people remained suspects until their deaths, including nightclub owner Mark Hansen, who knew Short. Through the years, people have continued to investigate the case, including Detective Hansen, who searched for Short's killer for 23 years until his retirement. "My only regret is that I never solved the murder of Elizabeth Short," he said in 1968, per the United Press International. While there are numerous theories about Short's murder, one of the most highly suspected culprits is Dr. George Hodel, a gynecologist who had a clinic in L.A. He was known to throw parties for Hollywood's rich and famous and was rumored to be dating Short before her death, per 48 Hours. Although acquitted, his name was brought forth as a potential suspect in the Black Dahlia case. He was listed as one of the few remaining primary suspects when the case was discussed before a grand jury later that year. During that time, authorities wire-tapped Hodel's home and recorded him making jarring statements, seemingly confessing to the 1945 death of his former secretary Ruth Spaulding as well as suspicious comments about Short's murder. They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead,” Hodel said in the recordings. Much of the information about his status as a suspect was not publicly known until his son Steve, a former LAPD detective and private investigator, began looking into his father's involvement in the murder. In his years of research and investigation, Steve has come across other pieces of evidence tying his father to the murder, including “five witnesses in newspapers describing him as [Short's] boyfriend.” He also had formal training as a surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. Additionally, Steve and a handwriting expert discovered eerie similarities between his father's writing and letters sent to the Examiner in 1947. He also found receipts for bags of cement purchased by his father just days before Short's death — the same brand as an empty bag of cement found near her corpse. Although the LAPD looked into Steve's research, they chose not to pursue his leads. (He believes his father was friendly with officers and they were protecting him.) Still, some officials thought that he may have cracked the case. “I told Steve, if his father was still alive, I would have filed murder charges against him,” L.A. Deputy District Attorney Steve Kay told PEOPLE. More recently, new theories have emerged surrounding former pre-med student Marvin Margolis, who lived with Short for 12 days and was questioned by the police following her murder. According to the Los Angeles Times, an amateur codebreaker was looking into the Zodiac Killer by using artificial intelligence to generate a list of 71 million possible 13-letter names, after the notorious serial killer sent in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle with the words, "My name is —" followed by a 13-character string of letters and symbols. The coder then used known details about the Zodiac Killer based on witness descriptions and eventually narrowed it down to one name: Marvin Merrill, which turned out to be the alias Margolis adopted following Short's murder. That said, no investigation or charges have followed.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Did you ever wonder what time it is on the moon? A software package developed by researchers in China can finally tell you. The new lunar timekeeping method promises to remain accurate over a 1,000-year time span. But why create a distinct lunar clock in the first place? Because the moon has less gravity than Earth does, time passes slightly differently there. This effect was first predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. For every 24 hours that pass here on terra firma, the moon gains about 56 microseconds, according to NASA. While small, this discrepancy adds up over prolonged periods — a fact that could pose major issues for future crewed moon missions, like NASA's Artemis initiative or Russia and China's joint International Lunar Research Station. (Mars is an even bigger challenge, with clocks there ticking about 477 microseconds faster per Earth day.) "This is not just about telling time — it's about navigation, communication, and safety," Sergei Kopeikin, an astronomer at the University of Missouri and co-author of the TCL paper, told Live Science in an email.

It essentially calculates a version of the TCL equation very quickly while considering some additional factors, like Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), an International Astronomical Union standard. It shows that China is serious about moving forward with its ambitious moon program. —Scientists finally find explanation for lopsided cloud that follows Earth's moon through space —Scientists scan famous 'Earthrise' crater on mission to find alien life in our solar system Likewise, the European Space Agency is currently fielding applications for its own moon clock. These systems may use LTE440 as a benchmark to cross-check space agencies' calculations, but it remains to be seen whether the Chinese system will become the international standard. Ultimately, the moon's time standard needs to be coordinated across countries, or else we risk plunging lunar research into chaos.
