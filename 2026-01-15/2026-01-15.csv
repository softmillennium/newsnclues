            President Donald Trump unveiled a multipart proposal on Thursday aimed at lowering prescription drug prices and reducing health insurance premiums, as well as increasing pricing transparency. He also vowed to hold big insurance companies accountable.
    


            The plan, which the president is calling on Congress to pass, proposes sending money directly to consumers, not insurers, as he has advocated for in recent months amid the debate over whether to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, which expired at the end of last year.
    


            Many of the proposals have been pushed by Trump or Congress in recent years. Some also build on measures the president enacted in his first term or agreements he struck in the past year, including asking lawmakers to codify his “Most Favored Nation” drug pricing agreements with more than a dozen pharmaceutical manufacturers.

            A sprawling betting scheme to rig NCAA and Chinese Basketball Association games ensnared 26 people, including more than a dozen college basketball players who tried to fix games as recently as last season, federal prosecutors said Thursday.
    


            The scheme generally revolved around fixers recruiting players with the promise of a big payment in exchange for those players purposefully underperforming during a game, prosecutors said. Then the fixers placed big bets against those players' teams in those games, defrauding sportsbooks and other bettors, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday.
    


            Fixers started with two games in the Chinese Basketball Association in 2023 and, successful there, moved on to fixing NCAA games as recently as January 2025, authorities say. The “bribe payments” to players ranged from $10,000 to $30,000 per game, authorities said.
    


College athletes still banned from betting on professional sports after NCAA Division I schools vote to rescind proposed rule



            Four of the players charged – Simeon Cottle, Carlos Hart, Oumar Koureissi and Camian Shell – played for their current teams in the last few days, although the allegations against them do not involve this season.
    


            Calling it an “international criminal conspiracy,” US Attorney David Metcalf told reporters in Philadelphia that this case represents a “significant corruption of the integrity of sports.”
    


            Concerns about gambling and college sports have grown since 2018, when the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice, leading some states to legalize it to varying degrees. The NCAA does not allow athletes or staff to bet on college games, but it briefly allowed student-athletes to bet on professional sports last year before rescinding that decision in November.
    


            Of the defendants, 15 played basketball for Division I NCAA schools during 2024-2025 season, prosecutors say. Several of them are playing this season.
    


            Five others last played in the NCAA in the 2023-2024 season while another, former NBA player Antonio Blakeney, played in the Chinese Basketball Association in the 2022-2023 season.

            The other five defendants were described by authorities as fixers.
    


            They include two men who prosecutors say worked in the training and development of basketball players. Another was a trainer and former coach, one was a former NCAA player and two were described as gamblers, influencers and sports handicappers.
    


            In many instances, the defendants' wagers on the fixed games were successful. The sportsbooks paid out the winnings, and took losses, authorities say.
    


            “The sportsbooks would not have paid out those wagers had they known that the defendants fixed those games,” the indictment said.
    


            Meanwhile, other bettors unaware of the scheme lost money on their bets and would not have placed those bets had they known about it, authorities say.
    


            The charges, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, include bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy.
    


            One betting scandal after another has rocked the sports world, where gambling revenue topped $11 billion for the first three-quarters of last year, according to the American Gaming Association. That's up more than 13% from the prior year, the group said.
    


            The indictment follows a series of NCAA investigations that led to at least 10 players receiving lifetime bans this year for bets that sometimes involved their own teams and their own performances. And the NCAA has said that at least 30 players have been investigated over gambling allegations. More than 30 people were also charged in last year's sprawling federal takedown of illegal gambling operations linked to professional basketball.

A daring nighttime raid, a foreign enemy captured and brought to justice, American excellence at its finest. That's how the American operation to capture and extradite President Maduro played out in the media. On the surface it seems like the operation was a success. But where does this leave Venezuela and its people? And how will this bold and daring move affect America's standing in the world and especially the Western Hemisphere in the long-term? On this episode of Perspective, Scottie Nell Hughes is joined by constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes and Editor at The Cradle Esteban Carrillo to examine all of the latest coming out of Venezuela.

Ukraine's armed forces are struggling with major manpower and funding shortages, the country's new defense minister has said.

Mikhail Fedorov, who was appointed on Wednesday, told parliament at his confirmation hearing that the ministry faces a budget gap of 300 billion hryvnia ($7 billion), with around 2 million men placed on a wanted list for draft dodging and around 200,000 troops deserting.

“I don't want to be a populist, I want to be a realist,” Fedorov said while presenting the statistics. “We have to do our homework and deal with the problems that we have to move forward.”

Ukraine's mobilization drive has become a major source of social tension, with widespread complaints of corruption and claims that it falls hardest on poorer citizens. Kirill Budanov, the former military intelligence chief appointed this month as Vladimir Zelensky's chief of staff, said the government undermined the system through its own mistakes.

Fedorov provided online marketing services to Zelensky's comedy studio before helping him launch a surprise political career. He is best known for serving as minister of digital transformation since 2019.

Zelensky nominated Fedorov to lead the Defense Ministry after a major corruption scandal forced the resignation of two ministers.

The crisis was triggered when Western-backed investigators charged businessman Timur Mindich, an associate of Zelensky, with running a multi-million-dollar kickback scheme at a state-owned nuclear energy company. Budanov's predecessor as chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, resigned amid speculation he masterminded the alleged ring.

The Defense Ministry has previously faced graft issues, including overpriced supply contracts under Aleksey Reznik, who resigned in 2023. His successor, Rustem Umerov, was named as an official Mindich allegedly tried to influence. Umerov was replaced last July by former Prime Minister Denis Shmigal, who has now been picked to lead the Energy Ministry.

MOSCOW, January 15. /TASS/. The nuclear potential of the entire West, including Great Britain and France, must be considered when developing a more advantageous document on limiting strategic offensive arms, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing while commenting on the US desire to include China in a possible agreement.

The Kremlin spokesman reiterated that Russia respects the position of China, which does not see the need for its inclusion in the treaty. ""Beyond these words from representatives of the US administration about China, we must not forget the statements of President Putin that, further on, discussing issues of strategic stability and security without taking into account the arsenals of France and Great Britain also seems unfeasible,"" Peskov added.

Earlier this month, Trump told The New York Times that he was unbothered by the impending expiration of the New START treaty. ""If it expires, it expires. We'll just do a better agreement,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Russia's new Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Dmitry Polyansky, who previously served as First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, told TASS that Moscow hopes that the US administration will respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative on preserving the limitations imposed by the New START treaty in the format of voluntary self-restrictions after the document expires. Regarding the issue of China's participation, Moscow proceeds from the understanding that this is a matter for Beijing itself and respects any decision of the Chinese side.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Press review: Russia to respond to EU army plans while Ukraine's ex-PM charged for bribery","https://tass.com/pressreview/2071515","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:01:55 GMT","

MOSCOW, January 15 /TASS/. Russia will respond to EU plans to create its own army; US statements on Greenland are accelerating the Arctic's militarization; and Ukraine's former PM, who has already served one sentence, has been charged with bribing lawmakers. These stories topped Thursday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russia will take initiatives to create a European army into account in its military planning, Russian Foreign Ministry's European Affairs Department Director Vladislav Maslennikov said.

According to him, the EU is rapidly transforming from an economic integration association into a military-political bloc. Analysts believe that Russia will respond by bolstering its forces in the westward direction. Against this backdrop, the number of supporters of dialogue with Moscow is growing within the European camp.

""Given the current EU leadership's aggressive stance toward Russia and their attempts to intimidate Europeans by portraying an inevitable war with us, we take such processes very seriously. In turn, we will take this new reality into account in our military planning, including programs to modernize all types of weapons and military equipment,"" the diplomat told Izvestia.

Maslennikov noted that the EU's economic integration association is speeding up its transformation into a military-political bloc, which threatens to destabilize the entire Eurasian region. This is confirmed by an unprecedented flow of funds into the military-industrial complex, a policy of ""strengthening the eastern flank,"" the launch of new defense projects, the preparation of transport infrastructure for high-intensity combat operations, and expanded ammunition production. Calls for the creation of a ""European army"" are part of this policy, the diplomat pointed out.

At the same time, the direct military threat to Russia from the creation of such a contingent is extremely low. The new EU body is not intended to become an independent offensive army against Moscow but is designed primarily for collective defense and deterrence in the European space. The creation of joint forces aims to increase operational readiness for high-intensity scenarios but not for offensive operations on Russian territory, World Military Economy and Strategy Institute's Deputy Director Nikolay Novik told Izvestia.

""In response, Russia may strengthen its military battlegroup in the western regions, adjust its troop deployment strategy, and develop weapons systems that can counter the collective forces of the EU and NATO,"" he said.

 

A meeting was held in Washington between the US Vice President and Secretary of State and the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, with the status of the island against the backdrop of Donald Trump's claims being the key topic. Ultimately, the Greenlanders were unable to convince the Americans to shift their position, despite having a ""frank and constructive discussion.""

Nevertheless, Copenhagen and Nuuk are willing to consider the US' security requests. The Russian embassy in Belgium stated that the rhetoric surrounding the island is being used to accelerate the militarization of the North and promote an anti-Russian agenda within NATO. Against this backdrop, Europe is discussing strengthening its presence in Greenland and launching possible alliance operations in the Arctic, thus stepping up diplomatic activity. Experts believe that Washington has not ruled out the use of force, and Trump may attempt to do so under the pretext of ""ensuring security.""

""We see that NATO is using high-profile statements from Washington on the Greenland issue solely to promote an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese agenda. For example, Europeans are already calling for the island to be surrounded and for a large-scale collective landing to be carried out there. There has been talk of a new operation, ‘Arctic Sentry,' modeled on the Baltic and Eastern ‘Sentinels' already in place, which openly aim to contain Russia,"" the embassy told Izvestia.

""It must be noted that NATO members are not inclined to resolve issues constructively. The militaristic spirit within the alliance is intensifying. Given the disagreements that have arisen within the bloc regarding Greenland, the alliance's ability to reach agreements, including those concerning Arctic affairs, is becoming increasingly unpredictable. We consider the alliance's policy of escalating confrontation in the Arctic to be counterproductive and extremely dangerous,"" the Russian embassy added. For his part, EU defense commissioner Andrius Kubilius emphasized that a military takeover of Greenland by the US would mean the end of NATO.

""And within the US, there is the Democratic Party, which will also protest annexation and Trump's ruining of NATO relations, but let's face it: American society loves winners, and in the case of Greenland, Trump will be the winner if everything goes his way,"" political scientist Gevorg Mirzayan told Izvestia.

Despite obvious legal obstacles, Donald Trump is capable of annexing Greenland, the expert stressed. The US could land troops in the Danish autonomous territory, justifying this as necessary for the island's defense and encountering minimal resistance.

 

In Ukraine, searches were conducted at the home of Yulia Timoshenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the Batkovshchina party faction in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). They were carried out by Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies, namely the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). A statement said Timoshenko was suspected of offering unlawful benefits to lawmakers from other parties in exchange for voting for or against specific bills.

The politician acknowledged that her office had been searched but rejected all allegations of corruption, calling them absurd. On social media, Timoshenko called the search a ""grand PR stunt"" and linked it to the upcoming elections in Ukraine. Under Ukrainian law, she faces up to 10 years in prison.

However, the pressure on Timoshenko is not an anti-corruption case, nor is it related to the Verkhovna Rada's vote on ministers. In fact, it is about a broader restructuring of the Ukrainian parliament's management, political scientist Daria Borovik told Vedomosti. She explained that work in this direction has been ongoing for a long time, systematically and at the initiative of the US. This has been done by bypassing Zelensky through factions, deputy groups, informal associations, and oligarchic centers of influence.

""But there is one key point. A controlled parliament is impossible without Poroshenko's EU faction and Tymoshenko's Batkovshchina faction,"" Borovik pointed out. According to her, Zelensky's actions are not so much an act of revenge as they are a US ""cleanup"" ahead of future elections, the goal of which is to secure a legitimate signatory for peace agreements in the armed conflict with Russia. At the same time, it is important for the US to prepare a loyal and predictable Ukrainian political class for this moment, Borovik noted.

Despite Zelensky's initial attempts to resist NABU and SAPO, they are now largely working with him, Ivan Skorikov, head of the Ukraine department at the CIS Countries Institute, stressed. He said Zelensky understands that the likelihood of new elections is increasing, which is why he has begun large-scale reshuffles and unleashed control bodies on potential opponents. The pressure on Timoshenko is the same story, Skorikov emphasized.

 

US attempts to interfere in Iran's internal affairs heighten the risk that Tehran will play its trump card and close the Strait of Hormuz. A large share of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) maritime trade passes through this strait. The threat is not new — the possibility of blocking the strait was last discussed during the conflict between Iran and Israel. However, the current situation is far more critical. Iran is facing intense domestic unrest amid an economic crisis, which is being actively fueled from outside.

For the global energy market, the risk of a blocked Strait of Hormuz is a significant cause for concern, and several other factors could drive up hydrocarbon prices and lead to the collapse of the global oil and gas trade. Contrary to numerous forecasts, if they act simultaneously, barrel and LNG prices will not continue to decline this year but will soar.

Andrey Ryabov, a senior expert at the Analytical Center for the Fuel and Energy Complex under the Russian Energy Agency, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the main suppliers of oil and petroleum products through the Strait of Hormuz are Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In 2025, more than 14 million barrels of oil per day were delivered through the strait, accounting for about a third of global maritime exports. More than 12 million barrels, or 80% of these volumes, went to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the strait's role in transporting oil products is less pronounced. Last year, it accounted for only three million barrels per day, or 14% of global maritime exports.

However, the strait is no less important for LNG supplies: it transports more than 80 million tons of products from Qatar and the UAE per year, or about 20% of the world's LNG supply, Ivan Timonin, senior manager at the consulting company Implementa, noted. Moreover, by 2030, the strait's share of the LNG trade could grow to nearly 30%, considering new capacities. Asia is the region most dependent on the Strait of Hormuz operating smoothly. From a practical point of view, even a short-term blockade of the strait or the persistent risk of one could cause oil and gas prices to spike. For Russia, this means increased global volatility and a potential strengthening of its competitive position as an oil and gas supplier outside this route, primarily in Asian markets.

 

Starting from January 21, Russian applicants may be denied the chance to apply for US immigration visas allowing long-term stays in the country. In 2024, more than 5,000 such permits were issued to citizens. The ban is unlikely to affect tourists, but the requirement introduced in September 2025 that they apply for a US visa only in Warsaw or Astana has already created problems.

On January 21, the US authorities will suspend the issuance of immigration visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Russia, for an indefinite period, Fox News and Bloomberg reported. In addition to Russia, the list of countries subject to restrictions includes Somalia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, and Thailand.

Daniil Sergeyev, Vizahod's development director, told Kommersant that immigration visas typically allow for long-term residence and employment in the US. These documents are issued for work, marriage, or asylum and include green cards. According to the expert, tourists and business travelers mainly request short-term B1 and B2 visas, which are valid for three years.

Overall, Russians' interest in US visas continued to grow last year. Yulia Lipatova, Aeroclub's managing director, said that demand from business travelers has increased by 35%. The US entered the top 20 most popular destinations.

In turn, Arthur Muradyan, CEO of Space Travel, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta how tourist traffic to the US will be affected. ""I don't think it will affect tourist traffic in any way. Firstly, because we are talking about immigration visas, which allow for work and the possibility of obtaining a green card. This does not apply to tourist visas. Secondly, tourist traffic to the US remains insignificant. There are practically no organized tourists. This is due to the difficulties in obtaining visas and making payments. The visa ‘quest' has become financially costly, unreasonably long, and unpredictable,"" he noted.

However, according to the expert, this ban is unlikely to remain in place for long. ""I do not think that this ban will last long. At least, the list of countries is very long. I think it will be revised. Right now, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are conducting mass checks of the migration regime. Let me remind you that the situation with neighboring countries is currently escalating. All of this has led them to decide to partially ease the burden,"" Muradyan said.

MOSCOW, January 15. /TASS/. Even as Ukraine's command has been seeking to stop Russian troops from advancing, those plans have been thwarted, said Army General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, as he inspected the Battlegroup Center.

Russian forces are expanding the buffer zone in the bordering Sumy and Kharkov regions, the senior general said.

TASS has gathered key takeaways from statements by the Russian General Staff chief.

As Ukrainian commanders are seeking to make every effort to stop Russian troops from advancing, ""without taking losses into account,"" those plans have been thwarted.

Ukrainian troops have made attempts to demonstrate their alleged presence in Kupyansk, including by hoisting Ukrainian flags, but ""that activity has been repelled.""

The Battlegroup North ""continues to accomplish tasks to expand the buffer zone"" in the bordering Ukrainian regions of Sumy and Kharkov.

Russian troops have been advancing ""in practically all directions"" of the zone of the special military operation.

Russian forces liberated around eight localities and took more than 300 square km of land under control in the first two weeks of January.

Servicemen from the Battlegroup Dnepr have been advancing toward Zaporozhye. ""The localities of Belogorye and Novobaikovskoye have been liberated.""

The Battlegroup South ""has been actively advancing"" toward Slavyansk after liberating Seversk.

""The most intense battles"" have been reported in the zone of responsibility of the Battlegroup Center.

The Battlegroup West operating in the Kupyansk sector of the line of engagement continues to eliminate Ukrainian arms units trapped on the eastern bank of the Oskol River.

Russian forces continue to clear Konstantinovka in the Donetsk People's Republic of Ukrainian troops.

The Battlegroup East has been on an offensive in the Zaporozhye Region and has also been expanding the buffer zone in the Dnepropetrovsk Region.

Russian forces are conducting street fighting against Ukrainian troops in Kupyansk-Uzlovoy in order to complete its liberation.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump threatens to use Insurrection Act in Minnesota

People affected by the US visa freeze: share your experience

Minnesota governor Tim Walz called on Donald Trump to “turn the temperature down” as protests escalate in Minneapolis after the shooting of an immigrant by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

In a statement he asked the president to “stop this campaign of retribution” and thousands of federal immigration agents remain in the city after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

Walz also urged demonstrating Minnesotans to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully,”. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that those gathering at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday were “engaging in unlawful behavior”.

“We cannot fan the flames of chaos,” Walz added. “That's what he [Trump] wants.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is due to brief reporters shortly. I'll bring you all the key lines here, so stay tuned.

Speaking to Reuters yesterday, Donald Trump expressed frustration that his party could lose control of the House or the Senate in this year's midterm elections, citing historical trends that have seen the Republican party in power lose seats in the second year of a presidency.

“It's some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don't win the midterms,” Trump said. He boasted that he had accomplished so much that “when you think of it, we shouldn't even have an election”.

The Trump administration has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, freezing applications from 21 January as part of a sweeping crackdown on legal immigration pathways.

We would like to hear from people from countries on the visa ban list who are currently in the immigrant visa application process, particularly those who are at an advanced or final stage.

How has the freeze affected you and your plans? How long have you been in the process, and what stage were you at when you heard the news? How is the uncertainty affecting your work, studies, family life or future plans?

“We cannot fan the flames of chaos,” Walz added. “That's what he [Trump] wants.”

The Department of Homeland Security has identified the undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, who was shot in the leg by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, as Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis. 

Officials said that Sosa-Celis is in the US illegally, and that he and two other undocumented immigrants assaulted the ICE agent with a “snow shovel and broom handle” and “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”.

DHS said that all three immigrants were successfully arrested, and Sosa-Celis and the law enforcement officer are both in hospital.

Kristi Noem also defended the use of federal immigration officers demanding Americans “on the street” to provide proof of citizenship.

“If we are on a target doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” the homeland security secretary told reporters outside the White House today. “That's what we've always done in asking people who they are, so that we know who's in those surroundings, and if they are breaking our federal laws.”

When asked by reporters about the use of force by federal immigration agents, Noem remained resolute that they were abiding by the law.

“Every single action that our ICE officers take is according to the law and following protocols that we have used for years, that this administration has used, that the previous administration used,” she said. “They are doing everything correctly, and over and over again in litigation, in the courts, we've proven that they've done the right thing.”

Speaking to reporters outside the White House today, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem declined to comment on how many the oil-carrying ships the administration is tracking, and their routes.

This comes after the US seized a sixth tanker amid the crackdown on Venezuelan oil following the capture of Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.

“I can't speak to the specifics of the operation, although we are watching the entire shadow fleet,” she said today. “I'm very proud of our Coast Guard and how they partnered with the Department of War to do unprecedented actions in bringing these flags under jurisdiction.”

An appeals court on Thursday dismissed Mahmoud Khalil's lawsuit challenging his initial detention, and opened up the path for his re-arrest.

Last year, Khalil – a green card holder and Columbia graduate – was released from an immigration detention facility, after he was initially arrested for his role in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza.

However, a 2-1 decision by a panel of the third US circuit court of appeals today ruled that a lower court judge did not have the authority to grant Khalil's release. His lawyers are set to appeal the ruling, meaning any re-arrest would not happen immediately.

A reminder that Khalil became an early symbol for the Trump administration's crackdown on free speech on university campuses – an effort that targeted immigrant students and those studying on visas.

The homeland security secretary added that Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, “needs to start working with our law enforcement officers”, as tensions in the city rise, following the shooting of an immigrant during an enforcement operation on Wednesday. The city remains on edge after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good last week.

“We could go get these criminals off the streets with their partnership, and do it in a safe manner with less agents, if he [Frey] told everybody to go home and said it was no longer acceptable,” Noem said in an interview with Fox News today. “The violent rioters that we're seeing on the streets today are there because of the mayor and how he's spoken. He needs to make sure that he's working with us, with his law enforcement officers, to make sure we're arresting the dangerous ones and sending the rest of them home.”

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said that she spoke to Donald Trump this morning about his threats to invoke the Insurrection Act as protests continued in Minneapolis against federal immigration agents.

“That certainly is within the president's constitutional authority to use that if he thinks he needs to keep people safe,” she said. “What I love about this president is the very first question that he asks me is ‘how are you doing, and how are our people doing in this country? How are the people doing and our law enforcement officers?'”

The US military has seized another oil tanker at sea in support of Donald Trump's sanctions against Venezuela, military officials announced Thursday.

Veronica, a crude oil tanker that marine records suggest is sailing under a Guyanese flag, was boarded in a pre-dawn action by US marines and sailors, the US Southern Command said in a post on social media.

The operation was conducted in cooperation with the Coast Guard, homeland security department and justice department, the post said. It included blurry, black-and-white aerial footage appearing to show service members descending on to the tanker's deck from a helicopter.

It is the sixth known boarding and seizure by the US military of a foreign-flagged oil tanker in support of Trump's clamping down on the Venezuelan oil industry since the capture of the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, in Caracas and subsequent removal to the US earlier this month.

As tensions rise in Minneapolis and protests over the use of force by federal immigration agents continue, my colleague, Maanvi Singh, is on the ground.

She reports that at a news conference at Minneapolis City Hall on Wednesday night, police chief Brian O'Hara said protesters were “engaging in unlawful behavior” and urged everyone who had gathered at the shooting scene in north Minneapolis to leave.

The Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, said: “I've seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and intolerable.” But he urged protesters out Wednesday night to go home. “We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos … Anyone who is taking the bait tonight, stop,” he said. “You are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city.”

Trump has routinely threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, most recently in Portland, Oregon last October.

The president also threatened to invoke the act in June when California governor Gavin Newsom sued Trump to block the use of military forces to accompany federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, calling it an “illegal deployment”.

In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their national guard troops to Washington DC to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.

At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the act for protests following Floyd's death but never actually did so.

While campaigning in 2024, the president also promised to deploy the national guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals.

A reminder that the most recent use of the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when George HW Bush used the law to respond to the deadly riots in Los Angeles, after the four white police officers filmed beating the Black motorist Rodney King were acquitted.

Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as protests against federal immigration agents continue in Minneapolis.

In a post on Truth Social today, Trump said he would institute the centuries-old, seldom used law – that allows the president to use the military domestically to suppress an invasion or rebellion – if “the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job”.

On Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg during an enforcement operation in north Minneapolis, sparking further protests in the city, just a week after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

Trump said that by implementing the act he would “quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State”.

Mayor urges calm as city continues to reel in aftermath of Renee Good's killing. Plus, how Adam Tooze makes sense of our bewildering age

Good morning.

A federal officer shot a man in the leg during an enforcement operation in north Minneapolis, sparking protests in a city still on edge after the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent last week.

The shooting occurred at about 7pm local time, according to witnesses. Several hundred protesters gathered at the scene on Wednesday night facing off with agents, who blocked off the area and used smoke and other crowd control weapons.

In a news conference at Minneapolis city hall on Wednesday night, the police chief Brian O'Hara said protesters were “engaging in unlawful behavior” and urged everyone who had gathered at the scene to leave.

What did the Minneapolis mayor say? “I've seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and intolerable,” Jacob Frey said. But he urged protesters to go home. “We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with more chaos … Anyone who is taking the bait tonight, stop. You are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city.”

Donald Trump has at least temporarily pulled back from threats to strike Iran, saying he has been assured that the killing of protesters has been halted and no executions were being planned.

Speaking to reporters in the White House on Wednesday night, the US president said: “We've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping – it's stopped – it's stopping. And there's no plan for executions, or an execution, or execution – so I've been told that on good authority.” He offered no details and said the US had yet to verify the claims.

What had Trump say he was going to do? Trump had repeatedly talked in recent days about coming to the help of the Iranian people, saying the US was “locked and loaded” if Iran started to shoot at the protesters.

The Trump administration has indefinitely suspended migrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, in one of its most expansive efforts yet to restrict legal pathways to the US.

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants whom officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – described as people who may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

The state department wrote on social media that it “will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates”.

Which countries are affected? The Guardian obtained a state department cable with the full list of countries affected, which can be viewed here.

Donald Trump reiterated yesterday that the US needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island. He said “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish overseas territory.

Tens of thousands of dollars have been raised for an autoworker at a Ford plant in Michigan who was suspended without pay after heckling Donald Trump. TJ Sabula is said to have called the president a “pedophile protector”; Trump responded by holding up his middle finger.

Whether it's the financial crash, the climate emergency or the breakdown of the international order, the historian Adam Tooze has become the go-to guide to the radical new world we've entered. Since he published Crashed in 2018, his “contemporary history” of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, Tooze has become, in the words of Jonathan Derbyshire, his editor at the Financial Times, “a sort of platonic ideal of the universal intellectual”.

Every Breath You Take, which Sting once called “a nasty little song, really rather evil”, is the subject of a lawsuit filed by Copeland and Summers against Sting, alleging that he owes them royalties.

Last year was the third hottest on record, scientists have said, with mounting fossil fuel pollution behind “exceptional” temperatures. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said 2025 continued a three-year streak of “extraordinary global temperatures”, during which surface air temperatures averaged 1.48C above preindustrial levels.

Four crewmembers yesterday splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after a health issue prompted their mission to the International Space Station (ISS) to be cut a month short — the first such medical evacuation in the orbital lab's history.

Space Technologies Corp (SpaceX) guided the capsule to a middle-of-the-night splashdown off San Diego, less than 11 hours after the astronauts exited the ISS.

A video feed from NASA showed US astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui landing off San Diego at about 12:41am, after five months in space.

“It's so good to be home,” said Cardman, the capsule commander.

The US space agency has declined to disclose which crewmember has the health problem or give details about the issue, but it has stressed the return is not an emergency situation.

The affected crewmember “was and continues to be in stable condition,” NASA Public Affairs Office Rob Navias said on Wednesday.

“First and foremost, we are all OK. Everyone on board is stable, safe and well cared for,” Fincke, the pilot of SpaceX Crew-11, said previously on a social media.

“This was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists. It's the right call, even if it's a bit bittersweet,” he added in a post this week.

The Crew-11 quartet arrived at the ISS in early August and had been scheduled to stay onboard the space station until they were rotated out in the middle of next month with the arrival of the next crew.

NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer James Polk said that “lingering risk” and a “lingering question as to what that diagnosis is” led to the decision to bring back the crew earlier than originally scheduled.

American astronaut Chris Williams and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev, who arrived at the station in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, remained on the ISS.

Iran yesterday closed its airspace to commercial flights for hours without explanation as tensions remained high with the US over Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.

The closure ran for more than four hours, according to pilot guidance issued by Iran, which lies on a key East-West flight route. International carriers diverted north and south around Iran, but after one extension, the closure appeared to have expired and several domestic flights were in the air just after 7am.

Although there were no signs of hostilities, the closure immediately rippled through global aviation.

“Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said the Web site SafeAirspace, which provides information on conflict areas and air travel. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defense, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”

The airspace closure came as some personnel at a key US military base in Qatar were advised to evacuate. The US embassy in Kuwait also ordered its personnel to “temporary halt” going to the multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country.

The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Iran at the request of the US for yesterday afternoon.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran's crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after earlier threatening intervention.

Iranian state media yesterday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during the protests in Karaj would not be given the death sentence, after a rights group reported earlier this week that he was due to be executed on Wednesday.

Trump's remarks at the White House came after fears grew in the Middle East that Washington could launch strikes, following his repeated threats to intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters. Trump did not rule out possible US military action.

In separate comments, Trump said in an interview that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi “seems very nice,” but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.

Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent voice during the unrest. The US-based Pahlavi, 65, has lived outside Iran since before his father, the last shah of Iran, was toppled.

“He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,” Trump said. “And we really aren't up to that point yet. I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.”

It is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests, but that in truth “any regime can fail,” Trump said.

“Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time,” he said.

The clerical establishment has cracked down hard on one of the biggest challenges to its rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

Rights groups have said that at least 3,428 people have been killed in the protests in the unrest that spiraled out of protests over soaring prices.

A federal officer shot a man in the leg in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle, further heightening the sense of fear and anger radiating across the city a week after an immigration agent fatally shot a woman in the head.

Smoke filled the street on Wednesday night near the site of the latest shooting as federal officers wearing gas masks and helmets fired tear gas into a small crowd while protesters threw rocks and shot fireworks.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told a news conference that the gathering was an unlawful assembly and “people need to leave.”

Things later began to quiet down at the scene, and by early yesterday fewer demonstrators and law enforcement officers were there.

Such protest scenes have become common on the streets of Minneapolis since a federal agent fatally shot Renee Good on Wednesday last week amid a massive immigration crackdown that has seen thousands of officers sent into the Twin Cities. Agents have yanked people from cars and homes and been confronted by angry bystanders who are demanding that officers pack up and leave.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey described the situation as not “sustainable.”

“This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in and at the same time we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to maintain order,” he said.

Frey said that a federal force that is five times as big as the city's 600-officer police force has “invaded” the city, scaring and angering residents, some of whom want the officers to “fight ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents.”

At the same time, the police force is still responsible for their day-to-day work.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early last month and is vowing to not back down.

In a statement describing the events that led to Wednesday's shooting, DHS said federal law enforcement officers stopped a person from Venezuela who was in the US illegally.

The person drove away and crashed into a parked car before taking off on foot, it said.

After officers reached the person, two other people arrived from a nearby apartment and all three started attacking the officer, the agency said.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” DHS said.

O'Hara said that the man shot was in the hospital with a non-life-threatening injury.

Earlier on Wednesday, a judge gave US President Donald Trump's administration time to respond to a request to suspend its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, while the Pentagon looked for military lawyers to join what has become a chaotic law enforcement effort in the state.

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia struck a playground in the city center of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Governor Maksym Kozytskyi reported on Jan. 15.

No casualties were reported as a result of the Russian drone attack, according to preliminary information, he said in a post to Telegram.

""The blast wave shattered windows in nearby buildings — including (a nearby) Polytechnic Institute and residential buildings,"" Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi reported.

Sadovyi said that the targeted playground was near a monument to early 20th-century Ukrainian right-wing militant Stepan Bandera and noted that Russia struck a ""symbolic place"" that ""the aggressor fears the most.""

An air raid alert was first issued for Lviv Oblast at 6:09 a.m. local time and ended at 6:51 a.m. local time.

Meanwhile, in Kyiv's Solomianskyi district, debris fell onto the roof of a residential building as a result of a Russian attack, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said.

Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

Overnight on Jan. 8-9, Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones, killing at least four people and injuring 25 others in Kyiv, knocking out electricity for hundreds of thousands while disrupting heat supplies as temperatures fell.

On the same night, Russia fired its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile at Lviv, the Russian Defense Ministry said, calling the attack ""retaliation"" for an attempted Ukrainian drone strike on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's residences, a claim Kyiv has denied.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed that Ukraine did not target the residence, U.S. officials told CNN on Jan. 1.

Russia is ""going all in"" to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure after the second mass attack in less than a week, Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Kolisnyk said on Jan. 13.

The Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin were reportedly left without power and running water following Russian strikes. Emergency power outages were also implemented in Kyiv and parts of Kyiv Oblast, Ukrenergo reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to reach a deal to end Russia's full-scale war but Ukraine is not, U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Jan. 14.

""I think (Putin's) ready to make a deal. I think Ukraine is less ready to make a ‍deal,"" Trump claimed, saying that President Volodymyr Zelensky is holding up the effort.

""We have to get President Zelensky to go along ‌with it,"" he said.

Ukraine has agreed to several U.S.-backed peace proposals. Russia has agreed to none and continues to wage the war it launched nearly four years ago.

When asked if the U.S. is open to providing security guarantees to Ukraine, Trump did not rule out the assurance.

""If we can get something done, we'd help. They're losing 30,000 soldiers a month between them and Russia. Now, Europe is going to help us with that,"" he said.

Trump and Zelensky met in Florida on Dec. 28, where the two leaders described the talks as productive.

Before meeting Trump, Zelensky, on Dec. 26, said that a 20-point peace plan is 90% complete, and he views the meeting with the U.S. leader as an opportunity to ensure that everything is 100% ready.

On Jan. 12, Zelensky said that he instructed Ukraine's negotiating team to finalize a security guarantees document with the U.S. and submit it for review ""at the highest level.""

""We have formulated our vision, and there must be clear feedback from Russia as to whether they are ready to end the war on realistic terms,"" he said.

Amid the efforts, a White House official told the Kyiv Independent that ""over the past few weeks, (Trump's) team has made tremendous progress with respect to ending the war between Russia and Ukraine.""

Ukraine has been open to major concessions, including holding off on NATO membership if strong security guarantees are in place and withdrawing troops from potential ""free economic zones"" amid the Kremlin's demand that Kyiv withdraw from eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast.

""They are looking for a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides. We consider a free economic zone a potential option,"" Zelensky told journalists on Dec. 23.

Meanwhile, Russia has continued to issue maximalist demands, and following Zelensky's Dec. 28 visit to the U.S., claimed that Ukraine attempted to attack Putin's residence with 91 drones. Following the allegation, the Kremlin said that it would toughen its negotiating position.

Trump initially reacted to the allegation, saying he was ""very angry"" after Putin personally told him over the phone. Trump later expressed skepticism after reviewing additional information.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed that Ukraine did not target the residence, confirming Kyiv's immediate denial and undercutting Moscow's claim, U.S. officials told CNN on Jan. 1.

Russia has repeatedly refused to agree to a ceasefire despite international efforts to end hostilities and has instead intensified drone and missile attacks.

Moscow rejected a Christmas truce because it would give Ukraine a temporary respite, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Dec. 16, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Oct. 21 that Russia would not end hostilities without a ""comprehensive peace agreement,"" arguing it would mean ""forgetting the root causes of this conflict.""

Overnight on Jan. 8-9, Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones, killing at least four people and injuring 25 others in Kyiv, knocking out electricity for hundreds of thousands while disrupting heat supplies as temperatures fell.

Russia is ""going all in"" to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure after the second mass attack in less than a week, Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Kolisnyk said on Jan. 13.

The Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin were reportedly left without power and running water following Russian strikes. Emergency power outages were also implemented in Kyiv and parts of Kyiv Oblast, Ukrenergo reported.

The year 2025 was the most fatal year for civilians in Ukraine since 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported on Jan. 12.

This is Chris York reporting from Kyiv on day 1,422 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

A large group of Russian soldiers crossing snowy ground north of Kharkiv was obliterated by drones, artillery and infantry, Ukraine's Khartiia Brigade said on Jan. 15, killing around 70 of them.

The Khartiia Brigade repelled an attempted assault by the Russian Federation and destroyed about 70 Russian occupiers,"" the unit said in a post on YouTube.

""For a week, Russian occupation forces attempted to storm the area of ​​responsibility of the 13th Brigade of the NGU Khartiia north of Kharkiv. Thanks to the coordinated interaction of the Khartiia members — infantrymen, UAV operators, artillerymen and other units — the attempt was unsuccessful,"" it added.

A video accompanying the post shows numerous Russian soldiers being targeted by drones and artillery.

Last updated 18:40 p.m. Kyiv time.

The gray zone has significantly expanded near the village of Komarivka in Sumy Oblast, close to the State Border of Ukraine, the Ukrainian open-source intelligence project DeepState reported in its latest update on Jan. 15.

""The enemy has recently increased its activity along the State Border of Ukraine, taking advantage of opportunities to infiltrate border villages, attempting to entrench themselves and destabilize the situation,"" DeepState wrote on Telegram.

According to the report, Russian forces are probing for weaknesses with the intent to establish a foothold and spread instability in the region.

""The enemy is testing the ground and attempting to entrench themselves in locations like Komarivka and Hrabovske. These incursions are aimed at expanding zones of influence and operational control,"" DeepState said. 

Ukraine's Defense Forces are actively responding to these movements by targeting Russian infantry as they attempt to consolidate positions. However, full neutralization is reportedly not always possible.

The situation along the State Border of Ukraine remains dynamic,  and DeepState emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring.

""There are more such zones emerging. In many cases, the enemy is eliminated at the very start of their attempt to advance, which often makes mapping unnecessary. But when these incursions become repeated, and the enemy manages to hold territory, we mark these developments on the map accordingly,"" DeepState noted.

A Russian ballistic missile struck port infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Chornomorsk, targeting civilian cargo under the flag of Malta, Oleksii Kuleba, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, wrote on Facebook on Jan. 15.

Kuleba stated that one crew member was injured and is currently receiving necessary medical assistance following the attack.

""The ship was getting ready for a container shipment,"" he wrote.

The strike caused damage to three containers and resulted in an oil spill. Emergency teams have deployed a containment boom to localize the pollution and minimize environmental impact.

""This is yet another act of Russian terror against civilian port infrastructure, international trade, and maritime safety,"" Kuleba said.

The incident comes amid ongoing attacks on Ukraine's ports, which play a vital role in maintaining grain and goods exports under international agreements. 

Last updated 2:58 p.m. Kyiv time.

The ongoing energy crisis in Kyiv remains ""extremely serious,"" officials said on Jan. 15, as Ukraine's Security Service said Russia's ongoing strikes against energy infrastructure amount to ""crimes against humanity.""

Air raid sirens in the capital sounded regularly over the last 24 hours as Russia launched at least 82 Shahed-type drones across the country, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

Some of the drones — including more advanced rocket-powered versions — targeted a thermal power plant in Kyiv, local monitoring telegram channels said.

Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, wrote on X on Jan. 15 that Ukraine's energy sector is facing an ""extremely serious situation"" due to ""unprecedented attacks by Russia and extreme cold across the country.""

The temperature in Kyiv at 3p.m. local time was -11 degrees celsius (12 degrees Fahrenheit).

Russia has pounded Kyiv and the country with missiles and drones over the last few days, leaving around 70% of the capital without power on Jan. 13. While energy workers repair the damage, the icy temperatures are making it difficult, and replacement equipment is running out.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 14 declared a state of emergency in the energy sector, with particular attention on Kyiv, which is reeling from Russian attacks that have left residents without power, heating, or water in subzero temperatures.

At least two people died and 20 others were injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 15.

Russia launched 82 Shahed-type drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. Ukraine's air defenses said they shot down or suppressed 61 drones.

The Air Force added that 21 drones hit 13 locations.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured five people over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, one person was injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.

In Sumy Oblast, seven people including four children were injured by Russian drone strikes, regional authorities reported.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured six others over the past day, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

In Chernihiv Oblast, one person was injured in a Russian drone strike, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported.

Russia has lost around 1,223,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 14.

The number includes 1,150 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,557 tanks, 23,904 armored fighting vehicles, 74,306 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,182 artillery systems, 1,611 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,277 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 107,357 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he believes it would be better for Venezuela to remain in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, but added he ‍was unsure ​if that would be a better situation for the United States.

“Well, I think it's better for them if they do it,” Trump said in a Reuters interview when asked if the administration supports Venezuela remaining in the oil cartel.

“I don't know that it's better for us … but they are a member ⁠of OPEC, and we haven't discussed that with them at all,” Trump added.

Venezuela, a founding member of the oil cartel, sits atop some of the world's largest crude reserves but has seen output collapse in recent years amid economic turmoil and sanctions. Trump has sought to assert control over Venezuela's oil ‌supply after the U.S. ousted ‍President Nicolás Maduro in an operation earlier this month.

Trump's administration has said it would ‍need to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks ‌to rebuild the country's oil industry and exert pressure on the Caracas government.

Pressed ⁠on whether Venezuela, under a U.S.-influenced oil policy, would be expected to abide by OPEC production limits, Trump ​said the question was premature and outside his remit.

“I don't have to worry about it right now, because, you know, I have nothing to do with OPEC,” he said.

U.S. control of the Venezuelan oil industry and future investment to boost capacity could put Caracas at odds with other OPEC members. ​OPEC is a group of oil-producing countries that work together on supply policy to stabilize oil markets – cutting output when prices fall and increasing output when demand warrants.

While members make decisions collectively, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is widely regarded as the producer group's de facto leader due to its dominant production capacity and ability to raise or cut supply.

In recent interviews, White House ⁠aides and outside advisers told Reuters that the subject of Venezuela remaining in OPEC has not been ⁠a topic of conversation. They note it could emerge as a flashpoint if Trump seeks to ramp up oil ‌production while OPEC looks to implement cuts to support prices, potentially putting U.S. objectives at odds with the cartel's strategy.

Some OPEC members that aim to expand oil production often find themselves constrained by the cartel's quota system, which sets output limits to stabilize global prices. Countries like Iraq, Nigeria and Angola have in the past expressed ‌frustration that the quotas prevent them from fully exploiting their reserves or responding to domestic fiscal needs.

The United States has seized another ‍Venezuela-linked tanker, ​U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday, ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. 

The seizure marks the sixth vessel targeted since mid-December that was either carrying Venezuelan oil or had done so in the past. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the seizure took place in the ⁠Caribbean. 

The U.S. military's Southern Command confirmed the pre-dawn operation, saying U.S. forces apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica “without incident.” 

It said the Veronica was “operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.” “The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is co-ordinated properly and lawfully,” Southern Command said in a statement.

Guyana-flagged Aframax tanker Veronica departed ‌empty from Venezuelan waters in early ‍January, according to shipping documents from state company PDVSA and monitoring service TankerTrackers.com. The vessel had not ‍returned to Venezuela as other ships have done in recent ‌days. 

The seizures began as part of Trump's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas ⁠Maduro out of power, which culminated in U.S. forces swooping into the country to grab him and his wife on ​January 3. Since then, Trump has said the U.S. plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a US$100-billion plan.

U.S. seizes another tanker as it exerts control over Venezuelan oil distribution

The U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, four sources told Reuters on ​Wednesday, as Washington consolidates control of oil shipments in and out of the South American country.

The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a “shadow fleet” of ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers – Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

Most of the Venezuela-linked vessels seized so far were flying fake flags or their flag registrations had been cancelled before the interceptions, the maritime authorities of Panama, Cook Islands ⁠and Guyana have told Reuters. Last week, the U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that was being shadowed ⁠by a Russian submarine after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic.

The move was condemned by Moscow. The latest ‌seizure came ahead of Thursday's meeting between Trump and Machado, in their first face-to-face meeting since the U.S. ousted her long-time foe, Maduro.

Trump has previously called her a “freedom fighter” but dismissed the idea of installing her to lead Venezuela after ousting Maduro, saying she did not have enough domestic support. A classified CIA assessment presented to Trump concluded that Maduro loyalists, including Rodriguez, ‌were best positioned to maintain stability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why Iran's fate means more to oil markets than Venezuela's","https://www.dw.com/en/iran-venezuela-oil-china-united-states-protests/a-75507250","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:53:50 GMT","

While markets appeared barely fazed by the fate of Venezuela's oil industry, they are considerably more nervous about the potential impact of internal unrest and foreign escalation when it comes to Iran. Rightly so?

Energy and resources experts agree — if the situation in Iran gets out of control, it will have a massive impact on global oil and financial markets. That was not the case after the removal of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. Then again, Iran produces four times as much oil.

""Iran is the third-largest producer in OPEC. Its output covers roughly 4% of global demand. Venezuela only produces about 1%,"" says Andreas Goldthau, director of the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy at Germany's University of Erfurt. ""Iran is estimated to export about 2 million barrels a day, in Venezuela it's only 350,000,"" the energy expert continues. ""Global markets would feel it far more intensely if Iranian production stopped.""

Moreover, fear of regional conflict in the Gulf weighs heavily in Iran's case. ""Roughly half of the world's oil reserves and a third of global oil production is in the Middle East. Political developments in Iran impact markets far more significantly than those in Venezuela,"" says Goldthau.

OPEC statistics calculate Venezuela's estimated 303-billion-barrel reserves as the world's largest (1 barrel = 159 liters, 55 gallons). But those reserves are full of heavy crude that can only be pumped and refined with specialized technology. A large percentage of that oil is also located in the remote Orinoco Belt. 

Iran, like Venezuela, suffers from international sanctions on its oil industry. It doesn't have access to modern drilling and extraction technology, and maintenance is costly due to a lack of replacement parts and inadequate structural investment. Furthermore, the state controls the industry, making foreign investment more difficult, says Andreas Goldthau. The same goes for processing. ""Their refineries are not producing petroleum products of the quality that Western buyers expect. That, beyond sanctions, is the result of Israeli and US attacks on Iran's 'midstream' sector.""  

In the oil and gas sector that means transport, storage and initial processing of crude and natural gas after extraction. The US-based GPA Midstream Association defines the work of midstream companies as providing logistics efficiency and dependable delivery regardless of production swings in countries like Iran or Venezuela. 

Despite its problems, Iran's oil sector has proven astonishingly resilient, says Goldthau — at least in terms of the volume being pumped out of the ground, though it has never matched the 6 million barrel mark the country was producing before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. ""Production ultimately recovered and stabilized at around 4 million barrels a day after falling to 2 million a day in the 1980s. Still, state coffers are taking a beating because Iran has for years been forced to sell its oil at a discount to secure buyers. And that has kept much-needed investments from being made.""

As is the case with Russia, Iran's shadow fleet of oil tankers plays a key role in sanctions evasion. ""The Western sanctions regime has forced Iran to store part of its production. Increasingly, tankers have been employed to compensate for limited capacity on land,"" explains Andreas Goldthau.

These floating storage sites are mostly anchored in Southeast Asia, close to buyers like China, which purchases more than 90% of all Iranian oil production. ""There are significant amounts of Iranian oil on the high seas off the coast of Malaysia,"" says Goldthau. Tehran ""is using its National Iranian Tanker Company for the operation. It has one of the biggest tanker fleets in the world.""

In order to evade sanctions, Iranian ships operate much as Russia's do, transferring sanctioned Iranian oil onto non-Iranian-flagged vessels at sea to facilitate delivery.

The social situation in Iran is also similar to that of Venezuela, in that poorly maintained oil infrastructure has led to growing problems as energy subsidies devour the national budget, and it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to provide affordable energy to the people. The result? Financial crisis, currency devaluation, hyperinflation and nationwide protests.

One scenario in particular could pose a grave threat to Tehran's ruling mullahs — if workers in the oil sector join the protest movement, it could spell the end for Iran's theocrats. It remains unclear whether unrest has hit Khuzestan province, Iran's most important oil region. US-based Fortune Magazine has reported that it has seen no indication that oil exports have gone down.   

Still, it is impossible to predict what could happen if oil workers were to heed the call of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, and strike. It was oil strikes that ultimately toppled the shah in 1978. Pressure on him became so intense that within a few months, the monarchy had collapsed and he had been replaced by hardline Shiite cleric Ayatollah Khomeini.

Should the Islamic Republic of Iran collapse, it would fundamentally change the balance of power in the region. ""The best result would be total regime change. The worst would be ongoing internal conflict and a continuation of the current regime,"" warns Mark Mobius, an investment pioneer in developing countries in Asia.

If Iranian production stalls, oil prices would shoot up in the short term. But eventually, other producers would fill the gaps left by Iran. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) strategic petroleum reserves could also be tapped to calm markets, says energy expert Goldthau.

But he adds that the bigger problem could be if ""Iranian actors drag the conflict into the region."" An Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz — a narrow waterway through which roughly 25% of the world's oil passes — could catapult oil prices to as much as $120 (€103) a barrel, according to estimates from investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase.   

Lastly, oil rigs and refineries in neighboring states could become the target of an attack, which would also impact oil markets. And, warns expert Goldthau, with some 20% of global LNG production transported through the strait, too, such a situation could lead to higher gas prices in Europe.

US President Donald Trump says Iran has halted killings and executions, citing assurances he received. Tehran denies plans for hangings as tensions remain high and airspace closures disrupt flights. Follow DW for more.

US President Donald Trump says he is told Iran has stopped killing protesters and will not carry out executions

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says there are no plans to execute protesters, while repeating claims that foreign elements are behind the unrest

Tensions remain high after Iran briefly closes its airspace, forcing international flights to divert before traffic begins to resume

Here are the latest headlines, analyses and background on the Iran protests Thursday January 15, 2025:

The United Nations Security Council has called an emergency meeting Thursday to address Iran's deadly protests, following a request from the United States.

President Donald Trump says he's been told that killings in Iran's crackdown on protests are easing. He added there's no current plan for mass executions, signaling a wait-and-see approach after earlier threats of intervention.

Iran's foreign minister said Tehran has “no plan” to hang protesters. State media reported Thursday that a 26-year-old man arrested in Karaj will not face the death penalty.

Rights group Hengaw had warned Erfan Soltani could be executed this week, but his family says the order was postponed.

Trump reacted on social media, calling the news “good” and hoping it continues.

The United States imposed sanctions on Iranian security officials for allegedly orchestrating a violent crackdown on peaceful protests.

The Treasury Department sanctioned the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security, accused of being among the first to call for violence against protesters, as well as commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and law enforcement forces.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US ""stands firmly behind the Iranian people in their call for freedom and justice"" and that Treasury ""will use every tool to target those behind the regime's tyrannical oppression of human rights.""

The US also sanctioned 18 individuals and entities involved in a shadow banking network linked to Iranian financial institutions.

""US Treasury knows that, like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you,"" Bessent warned.

The sanctions block access to US assets and businesses, but they are largely symbolic because many of those affected hold no US assets.

A Canadian citizen has died in Iran at the hands ⁠of ‍the Iranian authorities, Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand ⁠wrote on X, though she did not provide details on how or when it happened.

""Peaceful protests by the Iranian people — asking that their voices be heard in the face of the Iranian regime's repression and ongoing human rights violations — has led the regime to flagrantly disregard human life,"" she said.

She added that Canada condemns the Iranian regime's violence and calls for it to end immediately.

The northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein has suspended deportations to Iran, according to an order issued by the state's Social Affairs Minister, Aminata Touré.

The decision cites recent unrest in Iran and the government's crackdown on its population.

""The human rights situation in Iran is catastrophic. Every day, Iranian security forces crack down on demonstrators with extreme harshness,"" said Touré. Her ministry stated that the deportation ban will initially apply for three months.

The move follows a similar decision on Wednesday by Rhineland-Palatinate, which ordered an immediate halt to deportations of Iranian nationals.

Meanwhile, Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is rejecting a nationwide halt to deportations to Iran, despite the brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces on protesters.

One Red Crescent staff member died, and five other colleagues were hurt while working last week in northwestern Iran, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a statement.

The aid group's parent organization, however, did not say how the staff member died.

""The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is deeply saddened by the killing of Amir Ali Latifi, an Iranian Red Crescent Society staff member, and the wounding of five other IRCS colleagues, who were all in the line of duty in Gilan province, on January 10,"" the IFRC said.

The IFRC expressed its sincere condolences to his family, loved ones, and all IRCS colleagues. 

It also said it was ""deeply concerned about the consequences of the ongoing unrest on the people of Iran,"" and stressed the ""safety and protection of humanitarian personnel,"" were essential to ensure the, ""delivery of impartial, life-saving assistance to people in need.""

Turkey opposes military intervention against neighboring Iran and believes that Tehran must resolve its internal problems independently, according to Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

""We are against military intervention in Iran. Iran needs to resolve its own internal, authentic problems itself,"" Fidan told reporters.

At a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said Turkey would continue its diplomatic initiatives to help solve the issue. He added that Ankara hopes Iran and the United States can find a solution to the conflict.

In recent days, Fidan held two calls with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, to stress the need for talks to resolve regional tensions.  

China's foreign minister has told his Iranian counterpart that Beijing opposes ""the use or threat of force in international relations,"" as tensions rise over protests in Iran.

The remarks came during a phone call between Wang Yi and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to China's foreign ministry.

The call followed comments by US President Donald Trump, who had said the United States was considering military intervention against Iran, which has been shaken for weeks by protests openly challenging the authorities.

""The use or threat of force in international relations is opposed, as is imposing one country's will on another,"" Wang said during the call, according to the ministry.

He added that China was ""willing to play a constructive role"" in helping find a way forward.

Foreign ministers from the G7 group of major industrialized democracies and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas have voiced alarm over developments in Iran and rejected what they called a deepening, brutal repression of the population.

In a joint statement, they said Iranians have been courageously expressing legitimate demands for a better life, dignity, and freedom since late December.

The eight officials, including German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, said they were concerned by the high number of reported deaths and injuries.

They urged Iranian authorities to show restraint, refrain from violence, and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, and access to information.

""We condemn the deliberate use of violence and the killing of demonstrators, arbitrary arrests and intimidation tactics by security forces against protesters,"" the statement said.

The officials said they were ""deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries"" and condemned “the deliberate use of violence” by Iranian security forces against protesters.

The G7 members ""remain prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues to crack down on protests and dissent in violation of international human rights obligations,"" the statement said.

The G7 and the EU said they were prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues its crackdown. The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The UN Security Council is set to meet Thursday afternoon for ""a briefing on the situation in Iran,"" according to a spokesperson for the council's Somali presidency.

The scheduling note said the briefing was requested by the United States.

US President Donald Trump has cast doubt on whether Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi could rally enough support inside Iran to take power, despite calling him personable.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency in the Oval Office, Trump spoke favorably of Pahlavi but questioned his prospects at home.

""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump said. ""And we really aren't up to that point yet.""

Trump added: ""I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.""

The comments come as Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where rights groups say thousands have been killed in a crackdown.

But he stopped short of backing Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah, who was overthrown in 1979, and said last week he had no plans to meet him.

The US President says he has it on ""good authority"" that ""the killing in Iran is stopping."" Middle East expert Rene Wildangel dissects whether it's possible to verify this claim, which comes amid a partial evacuation of US staff in the Middle East.

Germany'sair traffic control authority has advised airlines to avoid Iranian airspace after recent US warnings of possible military intervention in Iran.

A spokesman for Germany's Flight Safety Office said on Thursday the authority had issued a recommendation ""that Iranian airspace not be flown over... until February 10.""

The spokesman told the AFP news agency the advice was issued ""on the instruction of the Transport Ministry.""

Oil prices have slipped as worries about an imminent US attack on Iran have eased.

Prices dropped more than $2 a barrel after US President Donald Trump said he was told that plans for executions in Iran had stopped ""on good authority.""

Brent crude fell as much as 3.5% to $64.23 (€51.43) a barrel, while US benchmark WTI dropped to $59.84.

The pullback followed a sharp rally over the previous three sessions, when prices jumped more than 5% on fears a military strike could disrupt supplies.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he saw a decline in violent action by Iran's leadership against protesters after previous threats toward Tehran. Trump had said he was willing to conduct military operations in the country if the government continued to retaliate against the protesters.

Iran has reopened its airspace after a near five-hour shutdown amid fears of possible military action between the United States and Iran that disrupted flights.

The closure forced airlines to cancel, reroute, or delay services.

Iran shut its airspace at 1:45 a.m. local time (2215 GMT/UTC), allowing only international flights with official permission, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.

The notice was lifted shortly before 0300 GMT/UTC, data from Flightradar24 showed.

Iran's judiciary has said Erfan Soltani, who was arrested during nationwide protests, has not been sentenced to death, according to state media, contradicting earlier reports.

A rights group separately said the execution of the 26-year-old would not take place as scheduled on Wednesday, citing information from his relatives.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

The Louvre museum and several other French cultural sites are increasing the price of entry for visitors from outside Europe. So-called ""dual pricing"" is quite common in less wealthy countries but rare in richer regions.

France began charging non-EU visitors to the Louvre Museum 45% more than people with either European citizenship or residency on Wednesday. 

Louvre tickets for individual visitors who are not either citizens or residents of EU member states — or of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway — now cost €32 (roughly $37.50), rather than the former flat fare of €22. 

Other state-owned cultural sites hiking prices for non-European visitors include the Versailles Palace and national opera house in Paris, and the Chambord Palace in the Loire region.

The move is one of Europe's most severe implementations of what's known as ""dual pricing,"" when visitors are charged differing rates depending on their origins. 

The practice is common in many developing countries, where often less affluent locals can visit cultural sites at lower prices than tourists.

But until now it has been a rarity in wealthier regions like Europe. The move has attracted criticism inside France for being discriminatory and potentially making it harder for low-income foreign visitors to go to the home of the Mona Lisa and other cultural treasures.

The French AFP news agency spoke to several visitors to the Paris museum on Wednesday, with some voicing no objections and others questioning the new price. 

""If I go to India, people from India pay less than people from abroad — it's fair because they have less money,"" Marcia Branco from Brazil told AFP. ""But because I'm in Paris and it's supposed to be a rich country I think it's not fair.""

The French government has defended the two-tier pricing system, saying it would help raise an extra €20-30 million annually for the museum, which is in need of renovation and suffered a major break-in last October targeting the crown jewels. 

The speed and efficacy of the heist, perpetrated in broad daylight, has prompted severe scrutiny of potential security shortfalls at the institution. 

Of the 8.7 million visitors the Louvre welcomed in 2024, according to museum data, 23% were French and 13% locals from the Paris area and its environs. Almost two-thirds of French visitors were granted free admission.

Admission is free for minors from anywhere in the world, and for any French national under the age of 26. Groups of up to 20 booking guided tours in bulk also get a modest per-head discount.

US citizens were the largest foreign national group in 2024, at 13%, while large European countries like the UK, Germany, Italy accounted for 5% each, and China was a fast-growing contingent at 6%. 

The museum's renowned collection hails from all over the world, including many exhibits from Egypt, the Middle East or Africa, and opponents to the new prices argue that the collection holds universal cultural value.

Trade unions at the Louvre have denounced the policy, calling it ""shocking philosophically, socially and on a human level."" They have cited it as one reason for repeated recent strike action, with the most recent walkout taking place earlier this week. 

Although the unions claim that their objection is purely a point of principle, they also complain that the ""differentiated pricing"" means staff will have to check people's identity papers to decide on ticket types. 

One French academic, Patrick Poncet, drew parallels to the Trump administration's move to increase the cost for foreign tourists visiting US National Parks by $100 as of January 1. 

Poncet wrote in the Le Monde daily last month that the policy was ""symptomatic of the return, as elsewhere in the world, of unabashed nationalism.""

Less than a week after Delta Force's audacious capture of Nicolas Maduro, Colombia's most wanted guerrilla leader made an unusual plea to his rival insurgents.

After decades of waging a bloody conflict over territories, drug trafficking routes and illegal economies, it was time to unite against a common enemy: Donald Trump.

“The shadow of the interventionist eagle looms over everyone equally. We urge you to put aside these differences,” Ivan Mordisco, the leader of the largest offshoot of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), said.

Standing in fatigues flanked by two rebel fighters holding machine guns in a video shared last week, he added: “Destiny is calling us to unite. We are not scattered forces, we are heirs to the same cause. Let us weave unity through action and forge the great insurgent bloc that will push back the enemies of the greater homeland.”

Among the rebel groups singled out by Mordisco, whose real name is Nestor Gregorio Vera, was the Left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's largest and most powerful criminal guerrilla, which controls large swathes of the 1,400-mile border between Venezuela and Colombia.

“The war between Mordisco, or Farc dissidents and the ELN has been very, very bloody with a huge humanitarian impact, so it calls my attention that despite that, Mordisco is still saying ‘hey, stop this, let's unite against our enemy, which is the US and its intervention',” Jorge Mantilla, security analyst and expert on Colombian guerrilla groups, said.

“So the cards are on the table,” he added.

Gustavo Petro, the Colombian president and former guerrilla fighter, used the threat of such an alliance to call for a concerted effort to “remove” drug trafficking guerrillas. He said he had invited Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's new leader, to cooperate in rooting out these insurgent forces.

Reports of a potential joint military operation against the groups from the US, Colombia and Venezuela could see the guerrilla group wiped out after more than 60 years.

Founded in the 1960s by students and union leaders inspired by the Cuban revolution, for more than half a century, the ELN has extorted, kidnapped and murdered Colombians in the name of the “revolution”.

In recent years, the ELN has used a symbiotic relationship with the Maduro regime to consolidate strength and power. Mr Maduro gave sanctuary to the rebel fighters in Venezuela's borders, seeing their presence on the border with Colombia as a first line of defence against potential US attacks.

It allowed the ELN's commanders to evade capture in Colombia and become a binational guerrilla force, capturing states in both countries. They soon realised controlling the border was a lucrative business, allowing them to profit from drug trafficking and people smuggling routes at a time when millions of Venezuelans were fleeing the regime.

The ELN, which is thought to have around 6,000 members, controls large chunks of Catatumbo, a major cocaine producing region in Colombia, which is also home to cocaine labs and clandestine airstrips.

The groups tax farmers and coca growers and profit from illegal mining in Venezuela's Orinoco Mining Arc.

Known to wear fatigues and black and red armbands, the ELN uses forced child labour in the mines, steals Colombian oil and bombs pipelines.

They are also understood to have guerrilla camps in Venezuela, which are used for specialised training in the use of drones and snipers, according to InSight Crime.

“2019 for me was the point where the ELN kind of figures out that it can expand in Venezuela to become a binational army,” Mr Mantilla told The Telegraph from his home in Bogota.

“Today, the main goal of the ELN is not the takeover of power in Colombia or to rebuild a Colombian state, but more so to defend the Bolivarian Revolution, because they consider themselves a continental guerrilla [group] because their ideological inspiration is Latin Americanist, so they feel the struggle of Venezuela is their struggle,” he said.

Following the capture of Mr Maduro, the group put out a statement pledging to spend their “last drop of blood fighting the US empire”.

When he took office in 2022, Mr Petro had promised to achieve “total peace”, bringing an end to the decades-long internal conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of Colombians.

But he suspended peace talks with the ELN last year after the group committed “war crimes” which saw more than 50,000 people flee their homes in the Catatumbo region after the group launched an attack on Farc dissidents.

Between January and May 2025, ELN offensives, which included mobilising fighters who attacked from Venezuela, left 117 people dead, including civilians, according to InsightCrime.

Despite the mounting pressure of a potential joint military attack, Carlos Arturo Velandia, a former ELN commander turned peace advocate, said he believed the ELN would ignore Mordisco's proposal.

“The ELN has characterised the armed group led by Mordisco as a narco-paramilitary organisation serving the state,” he said, noting that it is in armed conflict with some of the armed groups mentioned by Mordisco.

But he said that, should the US put boots on the ground, the ELN could call for a “continental army” to face the imperialist threat.

“If they made that call, they would be successful, and all the countries would produce guerrilla fighters that would fight imperialism,” Mr Velandia said, although he said he expected these blocs to stay within their own countries.

Elizabeth Dickinson, International Crisis Group's deputy programme director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said she believed Mordisco's proposal was “more tactical than strategic”.

“I think it's all about sort of positioning in the actual battlefield between armed and criminal groups in Colombia, rather than sort of a strategic shift of guerrilla or insurgent movements in reaction to the US,” she said.

Ms Dickinson said it would not be the first time the EMC and the ELN would have joined together to serve their own interests, noting that both groups have ambitions to move further into and consolidate control in the Amazon region.

On Monday, reports of a potential military operation against the ELN spearheaded by Venezuela, Colombia and the US appeared to make the guerrilla group blink.

The ELN put out a statement calling on the Colombian government to build a “national accord” to overcome political conflicts in the country.

There have also been reports of the group crossing the border back in Colombia and closing down camps in Venezuela.

Mr Petro responded, claiming the ELN had destroyed an agreement with “blood and fire” and said such discussions could not move forward if the ELN did not give up illicit activities and return to Colombia.

While Mr Mantilla notes that a joint attack from the US, Venezuela and Colombia would be the “worst scenario” for the ELN, he does not believe it would be “easy” to defeat insurgent groups.

“At least in the short term because when you see the statistics... there's about 25,000 people in arms, counting not only the ELN, but all the armed groups in Colombia,” he said.

“25,000 people is just not something that you can erase on a map with a bombing or special operation. I think it would be a great long-term effort to gain territorial control in those places where the ELN has cultivated criminal governance and has achieved the capacity to corrupt and capture local states.”

For years, the commanders of the Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group influenced by the Cuban Revolution have waxed lyrical about fighting their imperialist enemies, and now their time to take up arms against the US may have finally arrived.

“This is a huge challenge for the ELN, but it is not an unexpected challenge,” Mr Mantilla said, noting that commanders had been talking about fighting a proxy war with the US over Venezuelan resources for months.

Ms Dickinson said the US intervention could work as a “boon” for recruiting for some of these armed groups, especially the ELN, which espouses anti-imperialist ideology. She also warned that the ELN is not a group that can easily be bombed as it has few camps, moves in small commissions of around five to 15 people and is focused on integrating into the population.

If there were US boots on the ground and the ELN put out the call, Mr Mantilla expects some international rebel fighters could travel to Colombia to take up arms.

Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor with the US Army War College, said he thinks the ELN will be hoping to “lie low” and remain embedded in Venezuela until this blows over.

“It would be so completely against their interest to actually stand up and fight right now,” he said.

He was also sceptical of the idea that the guerrilla forces could join together, as it would make them an easy target for Ms Rodriguez to sell out in an effort to get along with Mr Trump.

Should their interests be threatened, he could see a broader Leftist fight from guerrilla groups against the “gringo occupiers and the Chavista sell-outs”, which could involve joint terrorist attacks.

The incentive for Venezuela to hand over the ELN to the US is not minimal. The regime could bill the ELN as one of the main drug trafficking organisations and hand them over as a peace offering to Mr Trump. It could also serve as an opportunity for Colombia, which has come under pressure from Mr Trump, to say they are cooperating with the US and trying to tackle drug trafficking.

“I think ELN is, right now, in a very vulnerable position,” said Angelika Rettberg, political science professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia.

“I also don't think that even if they are able to build this unified organisation, that that would make them less likely to be hit by an eventual US attack,” Ms Rettberg said.

In an interview with The Telegraph in 2019, Israel Ramírez Pineda, the ELN commander otherwise known as Pablo Beltran, spoke about the possibility of a US intervention to topple Mr Maduro.

“If they come for us, we will respond. We won't run away and hide,” he said.

Now, seven years later, the group's promise to rise up against their imperialist enemies may finally be tested.

			Incident comes just one week after immigration agents killed Renee Good in the same city

A US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) officer shot a migrant in Minneapolis on Wednesday night, as tensions built in the city where last week a federal agent shot dead mother-of-three Renee Good.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security, claimed that an officer fired three shots after being “ambushed” with a shovel while trying to arrest a Venezuelan man they suspected of living illegally in the Minnesota city.

“The officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,” Ms McLaughlin said in a statement on X.

“The attacked officer and subject are both in the hospital.”

ICE agents had been conducting a “targeted” traffic stop at about 6.50pm local time (12.50am GMT) when the man they accused of being an “illegal alien” sped away in his car, according to the department.

Sources told local media that the man was being chased in his car by officers before he crashed outside his home in north Minneapolis.

Two people, who the sources said were believed to be members of the man's family, started fighting the officers before the trio barricaded themselves in the house, local media reported.

“The law enforcement officer caught up to the subject on foot and attempted to apprehend him when the subject began to resist and violently assault the officer,” Ms McLaughlin said.

“While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.

“As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broomstick.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg.”

Witnesses at the scene described seeing police surrounding the man's property, smashing a door and shooting at the house.

Police dressed in “tactical gear” shot through a second-floor window of the man's house, witness Sam Warburton told the Star Tribune.

He said police made announcements on a loudspeaker before “flash bang” devices were deployed inside.

At least 200 protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting on Wednesday night, facing off with agents who deployed tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, the Star Tribune reported.

Anger has been growing in the community in the past three weeks amid the deployment of about 3,000 ICE agents to the Minneapolis area as part of a Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration.

Volunteer groups have been walking the streets to film the agents and document their behaviour amid accusations ICE is acting beyond its legal powers and using violent tactics.

Good, 37, was shot dead last Wednesday by an agent who argued that she was blocking the street with her car while ICE carried out an operation in Minneapolis.

The Trump administration claimed the agent was defending himself against a “domestic terrorist”.

Jacob Frey, the city's mayor, rejected those claims – pointing to bystander footage which captured the shooting.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly – that is bulls---,” he said.

He added: “They [ICE] are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. I have a message for ICE: get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”

On Wednesday, Tim Walz, the state governor, called on Minnesotans to continue to “take out that phone and hit record” if they saw an ICE agent.

“This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Mr Walz said.

“Instead, it is a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

Witnesses to ICE raids have been sharing videos of the officers' dealings with the public, including moments when people identified as US citizens have been detained.

One video showed a woman being dragged from her car and had her windows smashed by ICE agents who told her she was blocking the street.

Footage was shared online showing the moment she was pulled from her car, screaming and attempting to hang on to the driver's door.

The unidentified woman was asked to move by ICE agents but refused, telling them she was disabled and needed to get to a medical appointment.

Around 60 people have been charged with impeding or assaulting immigration authorities in Minnesota in the past five days, according to ICE.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

			Protests erupt in Midwestern state over the presence of immigration officers and the shooting of a man by ICE agent

Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to Minneapolis following protests over the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent.

The US president's threat, issued on Truth Social, followed a separate incident on Wednesday in which another immigration officer shot and wounded a man who attacked another agent with a shovel.

Protests over the presence of Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in the Midwestern state had begun before Renee Good, a married mother of three, was shot three times in the face by Jon Ross during a raid.

The Trump administration said that Good was trying to run over Mr Ross with her car, and that he suffered internal bleeding as a result of the incident.

Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to invoke the scarcely-used law to deploy the military or federalise the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, over the objections of state governors.

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great state,” Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in, and at the same time we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbours, to maintain order,” Jacob Frey, the mayor, said.

Mr Frey said the federal force — five times the size of the city's 600-officer police force — had “invaded” Minneapolis, scaring and angering residents.

The last time the act was invoked was in 1992 by George HW Bush, the former president, to end unrest in Los Angeles following the beating of Rodney King by white police officers.

In that instance, the local government had asked for the assistance.

The department of homeland security (DHS) says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in Minnesota since early December and is pledging not to back down. ICE is a DHS agency.

Following the Wednesday incident, protesters threw rocks and let off fireworks. Police chief Brian O'Hara said the gathering was an unlawful assembly and “people need to leave”.

A spokesman for homeland security said federal officers had stopped a driver from Venezuela who is in the US illegally. The person then drove away and crashed into a parked car before taking off on foot, the spokesman said.

After officers reached the person, two other people arrived from a nearby apartment, and all three started attacking the officer, according to DHS.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” a DHS spokesman said.

The two other people involved in the alleged attack on the officer are in custody.

Mr O'Hara said the man shot was in the hospital with a non-life-threatening injury.

The shooting took place about 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometres) north of where Good was fatally shot. She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.

Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, Mr Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.

Good's family has hired the same law firm that represented George Floyd's family in a $27m (£20m) settlement with Minneapolis. Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.

During a speech before the latest shooting, Tim Walz, the state's governor, described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what is happening in the state “defies belief”.

“Let's be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” he said. “Instead, it's a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

Chris Madel, an attorney for Mr Ross, declined to comment.

Americans view Renee Nicole Good's killing by an ICE agent as an inappropriate use of force by a 2-to-1 margin.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

New polling indicates that a majority of Americans believe the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent was not justified, and do not trust the federal government to conduct its own investigation into the matter.

A CNN/SSRS poll published on Wednesday shows that 52 percent of Americans believe that the Trump administration's efforts to deport “immigrants living in the United States illegally” have gone too far. In a separate question, 58 percent of Americans said they disapprove of President Donald Trump's performance on the issue of immigration, while only 42 percent said they approve — a -16-point net approval rating, which is a 19-point swing from his +3-point net approval from the start of the year.

Asked whether ICE is making American cities safer, only 31 percent believed the agency was achieving that goal, while 51 percent said they were making cities less safe. 

A plurality of Americans, 47 percent, also worry that the feds will “go too far in cracking down” on demonstrations against Trump's deportation policies, while only 37 percent worry that protests will “get out of control.”

The polling comes just a week after an ICE agent shot and killed Good while she was attempting to drive away from agents in her neighborhood. The administration, which has falsely characterized Good as a “domestic terrorist,” is now conducting a questionable inquiry into her killing in a seeming attempt to blame her for her own death, blocking state investigators from taking part in the investigation.

By a two-to-one margin, the poll found that most respondents, 56 percent, view Good's killing by an ICE agent as an inappropriate use of force, with just a quarter of Americans, 26 percent, saying it was appropriate. 

Only 17 percent of Americans say they will trust the federal government's inquiry into her killing “a great deal,” while another 21 percent say they will only have “moderate” trust in the inquiry. Meanwhile, 62 percent said they would trust an inquiry conducted solely by the feds “some” amount or “not at all.”

Several polls since Good's death have revealed a deep skepticism of ICE among the American public. A YouGov survey from last week, for example, shows a net -13-point approval rating for the agency — a drastic shift from the +16-point approval rating the agency had at the start of 2025. 

An Economist/YouGov poll published on Tuesday also found plurality support for abolishing the agency altogether, with 46 percent backing that idea and 43 percent opposed.

Despite the waning popularity of ICE — including among independent voters, who want to see the agency abolished by a net rate of +12 points — Democratic lawmakers and potential midterm candidates are not campaigning on abolishing the agency, which was only established in 2003.

“House Democrats want accountability and oversight of ICE,” Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-California), the number-three Democrat in the House, recently said.

Even the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is taking a milquetoast approach to the matter, issuing a statement indicating only that its members will oppose “any appropriations bill that provides any funding to immigration enforcement agencies within the Department of Homeland Security unless there are meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices.”

Several critics decried Democratic leaders for discounting the American public's increasing support for ending ICE for good as the agency conducts violent raids and terrorizes immigrant communities across the country.

“It's hard to be an opposition party when you refuse to oppose the blatantly illegal and immoral things being done by the opposition,” said Melanie D'Arrigo, executive director of the Campaign for New York Health.

“There is no ‘good' version of ICE. There is no lawful version of ICE,” Cameron Kasky, anti-gun violence advocate, said in a post on X. “Abolish ICE, reveal their identities, and start prosecuting their crimes to the fullest extent of the law.”

“Defund. Abolish. Prosecute. ICE is lawless and destructive,” constitutional law professor Anthony Michael Kreis said.

The US State Department announced one of the Trump administration's most far-reaching efforts to restrict immigration to the country on Wednesday, saying on social media that it will pause processing of all immigrant visas from 75 countries and claiming people from those nations often receive public benefits after arriving in the US.

“The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,” reads the statement.

The countries represent more than one-third of the 193 countries on the planet and include Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Laos, Somalia, and Sudan.

The announcement comes as the administration is seeking to expand the definition of what constitutes a “public charge”—people who are likely to utilize public benefits.

President Donald Trump and his top advisers have long been fixated on the claim that immigrants and refugees overuse social services, and the White House has particularly been focused on the use of public programs by Somali immigrants following a fraud scandal in Minnesota.

Last year, the libertarian Cato Institute published a study showing that despite Trump's claims, native-born Americans consume more public benefits than immigrants on average per capita.

Immigrants used 21% fewer welfare and public benefits than Americans born in the US, the study found.

“Trump is once again using lies, racism, and xenophobia to block entire groups of people from coming and contributing to this country,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).

Late last year, the administration proposed a rule that would direct immigration officers to consider whether an immigrant would use programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and free and reduced-cost school lunches when deciding whether to grant them entry to the US.

A number of observers noted Wednesday that the State Department announced the visa processing freeze months before the US is set to host the World Cup — and 15 of the 42 teams that have already qualified for the soccer tournament are reportedly from countries impacted by the new policy.

A State Department official told Politico that the pause is not expected to directly affect tourist visa processing, but the outlet reported that “individuals could still face difficulties if their countries are subject to other Trump travel bans and restrictions.”

The US embassies in Haiti and Iran both posted warnings about visa restrictions on their websites.

“The US should lose hosting rights,” said Etan Nechin of Haaretz. “This is a travesty.”

 From Syria to Venezuela, Putin Has Overpromised and Underdelivered

 Alexander Gabuev and Sergey Vakulenko

“This morning, the United States carried out an act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” Russia's Foreign Ministry wrote on January 3, as news emerged of the U.S. operation targeting various Venezuelan military facilities. “This development is extremely concerning and deserving of condemnation.” When the White House confirmed that U.S. special forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them to New York to stand trial for drug trafficking and other crimes, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that “we strongly urge the U.S. leadership to reconsider their position and release the legitimately elected president of a sovereign country and his spouse.”

Beyond this statement, Moscow did nothing material to help the regime that it has previously called a key strategic partner in Latin America. It was only seven months ago, in May, that Maduro and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at the Kremlin to sign a treaty on strategic partnership and cooperation that stated that Russia and Venezuela would strengthen military ties and reinforce their ability to defend themselves against hostile external forces. Yet the Russians failed to warn Maduro of the U.S. operation or to protect him during the raid; instead, they watched from the sidelines.

The Kremlin's impotence in Venezuela follows a familiar pattern that has been on display since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago. Absorbed in its protracted war against Kyiv, Moscow has few resources to support its authoritarian partners. In 2024, the Russians stood by as the regime of their long-standing ally Bashar al-Assad collapsed in Syria. Last summer, in response to the U.S.-Israeli strikes against Iran, another strategic partner, the Russians offered to mediate between the belligerents but weren't able to supply useful intelligence or air defense equipment that could have made a difference. In the case of Venezuela, Moscow was able to do even less than it did for Damascus and Tehran.

For Putin, the blow from Maduro's downfall has been especially humiliating. Although Venezuela has long been a drain on Russia's state coffers because of unrecoverable loans and money-losing oil projects, the country at least offered a certain point of pride: Moscow could claim to have secured a foothold in the United States' backyard. To authoritarian regimes from Myanmar to Nicaragua, the Kremlin pushed the narrative that Russia is a potent hedge against an overbearing United States. Maduro's ousting not only makes this rhetoric ring hollow; it also underscores the fact that Venezuela was never Moscow's to lose.

Russia and Venezuela have maintained friendly ties for a quarter century. In 2000, Putin and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, both newly elected, met for the first time during a UN General Assembly session in New York. The relationship between Caracas and Moscow, however, remained mostly transactional and pragmatic—not ideological—for nearly a decade. When Chávez embarked on a populist, anti-American course, he was flush with oil profits amid elevated global energy prices and bought up Russian weapons to replace the aging U.S. equipment purchased by his predecessors. The Kremlin, although not yet ideologically committed to confronting the West, exploited Chávez's anti-Americanism to cultivate a new arms market.

The relationship deepened after Russia's five-day war against Georgia, in August 2008, and started to take an ideological turn with shared animosity toward U.S. hegemony. Moscow wanted its partners around the world to recognize the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and dispatched senior officials to persuade them. The efforts initially fell flat; the only state to side with Moscow in the immediate aftermath of the war was Nicaragua, under President Daniel Ortega. But then, in September 2009, on a state visit to Moscow, Chávez announced that Venezuela would also recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

This was largely a transactional arrangement, but it started to shift the Kremlin's approach toward Venezuela away from pure pragmatism. Within days, Russia opened a $2.2 billion credit line for Caracas to purchase Russian military equipment, despite the fact that the Venezuelan regime had enough oil revenue to pay in cash. The Kremlin also announced large investments in Venezuelan oil by a consortium of the five largest Russian oil companies. Chávez had recently nationalized the assets of two U.S. energy companies, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, and was desperate for new technical and investment partners to develop challenging projects.

Moscow also signaled that it would invest in various industrial, infrastructure, and social projects in Venezuela that would help Chávez boost his popularity and cement his grip on power, which had become more authoritarian over the years. Despite anti-Americanism being an increasingly visible driving force behind the partnership, Moscow was still pursuing its rational self-interest; after a brief dip following the 2008 Great Recession, oil prices were on the rise again, and Russia's investments and loans appeared to be recoverable.



It wasn't until Chávez's death from cancer, in 2013, that the remaining pragmatic pillars of cooperation started to unravel. Under Maduro, the regime grew ever more repressive, and economic populism—namely, cheap housing projects and nationalizations of foreign businesses—strained the economy. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and launched a war in eastern Ukraine, setting the Kremlin on a path of confrontation with the United States. That same year, oil prices crashed, decimating Venezuela's export revenue, severely reducing government cash flow, and compelling Russian oil companies to cut costs and pare down their programs.

By 2015, the relationship between Russia and Venezuela had devolved into little more than an ideologically driven project fed by Putin's geopolitical ambitions. If nothing else, Maduro's Venezuela showcased the Kremlin's ability to project power globally, especially in the United States' backyard. Yet Putin ended up making the same mistake that the Soviet leadership did when, despite mounting costs, the Kremlin sought to keep its ideological partners afloat. The Russian state energy giant Rosneft, for instance, has provided billions of dollars in advanced payments to PDVSA, Venezuela's state oil and gas company, that are unlikely to ever be recovered.

Moscow also helped Caracas circumvent U.S. sanctions and invested in the Maduro regime's ability to withstand pressure from Washington. Russian military personnel staged joint military exercises and conducted training programs in Venezuela, sent military ships to its coasts, and flew Tu-160 nuclear-capable bombers over the Caribbean Sea. In 2019 and 2024, Moscow even dispatched military planes carrying mercenaries from the state-backed Wagner paramilitary company to Caracas to signal direct support for Maduro during protests against his regime after rigged presidential elections. Moscow provided intelligence support as well as air defenses and other weapons every time the regime faced difficulties, including during the most recent U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean.

Still, through it all, the depth of Russia's commitment to Venezuela has been an open question. In 2019, for instance, the Russian leadership cynically signaled to Washington that it was ready to abandon Venezuela if the United States disengaged from Ukraine, according to congressional testimony by Fiona Hill, who served as senior National Security Council director on Russia and Europe during the first Trump administration. When push came to shove, however, the United States didn't need Russia's help. What's more, all the tools deployed by Moscow proved incapable of protecting its key Latin American ally. Russia was not able to provide timely and accurate intelligence to warn Maduro about the upcoming U.S. operations, and the S-300 and Buk-M2 missile systems Moscow supplied had not been properly maintained or plugged into an integrated air defense system, something that the Russian military would be expected to help with for a strategic partner and buyer of Russian military hardware.

For the last 20 years, Moscow has demonstrated an ability to inject itself as a player in regions with strong anti-American sentiment. But the Kremlin's costly adventures have yet to show any practical benefits for enhancing Russia's genuine security interests or boosting its economic prosperity. Involvement in places such as Venezuela serves only Putin's vanity, a few votes of solidarity with Moscow at the UN General Assembly, and money-making opportunities for corrupt Russian officials.

Moreover, the Kremlin's opportunistic approach does not translate into a durable ability to shape outcomes. The Kremlin may be able to prop up or, failing that, provide a gilded exile to authoritarian strongmen. But it is unable to help its partners address their regime's vulnerabilities through capacity building. In Syria, for example, Russia lent Damascus its airpower and other military tools, but it couldn't fix the excessive brutality, incompetence, corruption, and economic mismanagement that contributed to the Assad regime's downfall. In Venezuela, Russia wasn't able to provide the Maduro regime with timely intelligence, adequate training, or functioning equipment. The Kremlin's failure stands in sharp contrast to the United States' success in helping Ukraine foil Putin's plan for regime change in Kyiv.

Over the last four years, Moscow's ability to influence global events has been further eroded, as the country's resources have been consumed by the bottomless hole of the war in Ukraine. The war has made the Putin regime more resilient internally, since the authorities have stomped out virtually all dissent, but it has also diverted all the military equipment, personnel, money, and attention that in theory could have been used to prop up the likes of Maduro.

Moscow may still be able to exercise influence in settings that are not strategically important to Washington, such as the Central African Republic or Tajikistan. But as the unfolding events in Venezuela plainly demonstrate, Russia is not prepared to challenge a resolved United States in faraway theaters. For U.S. policymakers, the lesson should be clear: the Kremlin is not a giant that must be countered in every corner of the planet.

And yet Washington must remain vigilant. Moscow has shown its staying power in situations in which Western interventions go unfinished and create new vacuums to exploit. A year after Assad's ousting, for instance, the former dictator lives in Moscow; the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, has visited Putin in the Kremlin; and the Russian military maintains a presence in the country, from which it projects power in the eastern Mediterranean and Africa. Likewise, Russia has not abandoned Venezuela; its military personnel and equipment are still there. The Kremlin will be waiting for an opportunity to leverage its presence, especially if the United States' removal of Maduro leads only to a regrouping of his regime or more chaos on the ground. If conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate, the Kremlin will be all too happy to fuel regional instability and then point to Venezuela as yet another example of failed American overreach after Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Ultimately, Russia will compensate for its weakness as a partner by reverting to its familiar strength as a spoiler.

 What a U.S. Military Strike Would and Would Not Achieve

 Andrew P. Miller

Over two weeks into wide-scale protests against the Islamic Republic regime in Iran, the death toll and number of arrests are rapidly mounting. Iranian human rights organizations place the number of dead at 2,500, while other sources suggest it may exceed 10,000. Needless to say, the Iranian people have displayed remarkable bravery in challenging an authoritarian government that still retains immense repressive power. And by emboldening Iranians to turn out by repeatedly raising the prospect of U.S. military intervention to defend Iranian demonstrators, U.S. President Donald Trump is implicated as well in the outcome of the protests.

There are, however, major question marks regarding the potential efficacy of U.S. military action in protecting demonstrators. Unfortunately, one of the few judgments that can be made with some confidence is that foreign military intervention is unlikely to produce a consolidated democracy of any kind, let alone one favorable to the interests of the intervening power. If, as should be the case, the U.S. objective is to support the Iranian people in transitioning to democratic governance, success may hinge on what Trump chooses not to do. Although the United States can and should help, how it does so will determine whether its influence proves beneficial or detrimental to the Iranian people—in whose hands Iran's fate ultimately must lie.

As the regime's violence against Iranian demonstrators has increased, Iranians and international observers have turned their eyes to the White House for any sign that Trump will follow through on threats to intervene. Trump sharply criticized the regime the day after protests began in Tehran's Grand Bazaar on December 28 over primarily economic issues. The demonstrations quickly expanded and turned political, leading Trump to declare on January 2 that the United States was “locked and loaded.” He later dismissed the deaths of Iranians on January 8 as the result of “three stampedes,” suggesting he would not “hold anyone responsible for that.” But since then, he has largely stuck to a more hawkish tone, confirming that his administration was examining military options, pronouncing on January 9 that the Iranian regime had crossed a redline and on January 13 that “help is on its way.”

It is conceivable that Trump is telegraphing a U.S. attack, that he has yet to make a decision, or that he is deliberately trying to sow confusion. Even if his thinking falls into one of these categories, the president could always change his mind. That said, it seems clear that Trump has recently become more comfortable taking military risks, which increases the likelihood of U.S. military involvement. Never a true isolationist, he views his second term military actions as successful, culminating in the tactically impressive though strategically puzzling capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Evocative news stories, the use of raw power, and minimal casualties all appeal to Trump—and a strike on Iran could supply all three. Since the target of these operations would not necessarily be the nuclear facilities he claims to have “obliterated” last June, Trump could direct a resumption of U.S. military activity in Iran without taking on undue risk or undermining his narrative of success.

Another factor in Trump's decision will be his perception of whether the government or the protesters are likely to triumph in the end. The president is loath to associate himself with a losing cause (he once defamed fallen American soldiers as “suckers”). If it appears that the regime is on the verge of quelling the protests, he is more likely to distance himself from the Iranian people's cause than to intervene to preempt a massacre. Alternatively, Trump may be eager to deliver the coup de grâce against a regime that is already coming apart at the seams. The president's refusal to meet with the former crown prince of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, in Mar-a-Lago, has been attributed to a perception in the White House that he does not have the mettle to lead Iran even if the regime is toppled.

The United States cannot, unfortunately, directly protect Iranian protesters from the air. U.S. planes cannot lower a protective shield over demonstrations or maintain persistent overwatch to neutralize regime aggressors approaching the protesters. In theory, the deployment of U.S. soldiers on the ground, which Trump has ruled out, could provide better protection, but given the proximity of demonstrators and regime elements, “friendly fire” incidents would be likely. Unlike in Libya in 2011, where a “no-drive” zone afforded some Libyans protection, the Trump administration can only protect Iranians through indirect means.

Within the broad parameters Trump has established, U.S. options can be grouped into two categories: those intended to deter further Iranian escalation against protesters and the United States, and those aimed at disrupting the ability of Iranian security forces to attack Iranian demonstrators. Although some options serve both purposes, most tend to skew more toward one category than the other. Strikes against ballistic missile manufacturing and storage sites or senior Islamic Republic officials, for instance, would fall into the deterrence category. Further degrading Iranian ballistic missiles would undermine Iran's ability to retaliate or initiate hostile action against external adversaries, leaving it vulnerable, but would have scant direct impact on the regime's repressive capabilities. Depending on the leader or leaders targeted, a “personae operation” could temporarily impair the Islamic Republic's internal operations. The primary effect of such strikes, however, would be deterrent in nature; other senior Iranian leaders would be compelled to contemplate their own mortality before supporting additional violence against protesters.

Disruption, on the other hand, would involve strikes against communications infrastructure, manufacturers of equipment deployed against protests, command-and-control facilities, and key internal security bases. Some of these targets could be hit through cyber means, while others would require traditional kinetic action. The primary purpose of these operations would be inflicting concrete damage—slowing down or, ideally, preventing coherent regime responses to protests, and thereby creating some space for demonstrators to operate. If it were harder to communicate, organize, and concentrate forces, the regime would be less effective in repressing internal dissent. As in the deterrence category, personae targets can be relevant for disruption, but since the 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force, no single Iranian leader has been especially important to the regime. The killing or incapacitation of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would cause the most prolonged disruption, but the IRGC and other security bodies are sufficiently cohesive and dedicated to the Islamic Republic that they could be expected to resume operations quickly.

If Trump chooses to intervene, he would be likely to authorize either a one-off strike or a short series of strikes, refraining from deploying boots on the ground. (Operation Midnight Hammer during the June war would be the logical template for strikes on nuclear facilities or other major infrastructure.) But he would have a variety of operations within those broad parameters, in terms of means of attack (cyber-intrusions, ship-launched missiles, stand-off and direct-fire plane-launched missiles), targets, and objectives. The U.S. military is more than capable of conducting special operations on Iranian soil similar if not identical to the one to seize Maduro in Caracas, but the risk of a failure of the magnitude of President Jimmy Carter's hostage recovery attempt in Iran in 1980 is probably too great for Trump to consider. What role, if any, Israel would play in support of a U.S. mission is another unknown. Iran would likely feel compelled to retaliate for any of these options, but the regime can be expected to calibrate its response unless it views the strikes as an existential threat.

What all these options have in common is that they are unlikely to afford the protesters more than temporary protection. Disruptions to command and control and the elimination of key leaders can create passing confusion, but unless that chaos coincides with a concerted push by the opposition to advance on the most important public institutions, it would not have a strategic effect. Similarly, U.S. strikes aimed at deterrence could induce short-term restraint toward protesters by the Iranian regime. If, however, the regime deemed that the demonstrations are close to bringing down the Islamic Republic, even the threat of U.S. intervention would be insufficient to temper the repression of this brutal government. This survival instinct is likely to prove more powerful than other considerations, such as whether U.S. intervention on balance emboldens demonstrators or unifies other parts of the public behind the regime.

Ultimately, military strikes would succeed or not depending on their effect on Iran and the aspirations of the protesters. Although it is impossible to generalize a single motivation driving the demonstrations, the widespread calls of “freedom, freedom, freedom” suggest that democracy is at the forefront of Iranian demands—and the track record of foreign intervention to promote democratization is disappointing, to say the least. For every Germany or Japan, the historical record is littered with several other failed examples. Critically, this is not a statistical aberration or anomaly but a direct cause and effect.

Whatever the intentions of the intervening country, the introduction of a foreign power distorts politics in the country it enters. Instead of seeking to build consensus among their fellow citizens and developing enduring policy solutions, local leaders appeal to the foreign power for both protection and resources. This externalization of focus and ultimate authority interrupts pathways to democratic consolidation. In other words, foreign powers can topple regimes and even preside over the installation of democratic governments, but in so doing they all but guarantee their long-term failure. The risks are particularly acute when the military is involved.

With Trump at the helm, there is even more cause for skepticism that intervention would be designed to support democratization. One need only look at Venezuela, where it took Trump literally just hours after capturing Maduro to throw the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, under the bus. Indeed, it is more accurate to label that U.S. intervention a regime face-lift, placing Maduro's unelected vice president in charge, than regime change.

On balance, the potential ephemeral benefits of airstrikes (or even a special operations mission) do not offset the risk that Iran would escalate against both the United States and the demonstrators or precipitate the need for sustained military involvement. Even if the U.S. military is successful in protecting demonstrators and tipping the balance of power toward the opposition, it would likely prove a Pyrrhic victory that makes the genuine liberation of the Iranian people all but impossible. Increasing the intensity of cyberattacks, on the other hand, may be worth trying because it would probably not provoke kinetic Iranian retaliation or have counterproductive unintended consequences for Iranian internal dynamics.

The United States does have an interest in the outcome of Iran's protests, and past U.S. action, and inaction, are part of the explanation of why the Islamic Republic is facing an existential crisis now. Going forward, the U.S. government should neither seek to dictate events in Iran nor pretend to be a bystander. If the Trump administration is serious about helping Iranians, it should seek to balance the limits of U.S. influence with the imperative to support a beleaguered people whose fate will have important ramifications for regional and international security.

To start, Trump should cease threatening or implying the threat of U.S. military involvement in Iran unless he in fact intends to intervene. His prior statements have encouraged some of the demonstrators to turn out and expose themselves to potentially fatal risks. Protesters have renamed streets after Trump, planted stickers with his name on them, and pleaded for him to send the U.S. military. It is not just unpresidential but inhumane to bluff when lives are on the line.

At the same, the Trump administration should be doing everything possible to flood Iran with free Starlink terminals to circumvent Iran's Internet blackout. Although the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made Starlink services free, that is of little value unless more Iranians have access to the equipment. The regime has been able to disrupt Starlink services with GPS and other jamming equipment, potentially acquired from its allies abroad. Yet Musk is famous (or infamous) for pushing his employees to achieve seemingly impossible feats; this is an occasion when such an effort would be a force for good. Unlike direct military intervention, the provision of communications and information equipment would furnish Iranians with the ability to forge connections with each other in a more organic fashion.

The administration should also encourage its allies to establish an international tribunal with the authority to investigate and try violations of international law, gross violations of human rights, and other flagrant abuses by the Iranian government. This new body must be authorized to investigate lower-ranking Iranian security personnel, whose decision-making and actions are more likely to be swayed than senior regime officials already implicated in severe abuses. If Iranian officers and rank-and-file security agents and police must consider their personal fates in a post–Islamic Republic Iran, it is possible they will think twice before giving or executing repressive orders. It is precisely these types of breaks in the security establishment that could change the balance of power on the ground. Given U.S. efforts to insulate its own officials and that of its allies from international justice in recent years, no U.S. administration will have the credibility to lead on such an initiative. Fortunately, some U.S. allies are better positioned.

Trump should also refrain from seeking to negotiate a new nuclear arms control agreement if the price is sanctions relief. Although the regime is clearly trying to distract from the protests with its offer to negotiate, it is unlikely that Tehran would agree to a meaningful new accord as long as Khamenei is in power. Even if there is definitive evidence that Khamenei would negotiate, it would be unwise to parley with a government that has a dubious lifespan. Indeed, there is a risk that in cutting a deal that empowers the regime, the Iranian opposition could turn against the United States. That would make future cooperation on Iran's nuclear program challenging, regardless of who rules the country.

Short of a full agreement, however, the administration could consider abstaining from military intervention in Iran in exchange for the return of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. If the opposition overthrows the regime, it may be difficult to track down the remains of Iran's nuclear program. Giving the IAEA a head start and some continuity in monitoring nuclear facilities would establish the best possible foundation for a future agreement. The regime is unlikely to agree to this arrangement, but trading military action (rather than sanctions relief) for access would clearly be in U.S. interests.

The United States is a superpower, but that does not make it omnipotent. There are many situations in which, no matter the effort invested, success will be elusive. There are also situations in which the United States might have a chance of success, but where unilateral action is still not warranted given the risks and who is most likely to suffer should something go wrong. Both cautions apply to any conceivable U.S. military operation in Iran, creating a prohibitively high risk-to-reward ratio. Trump has no credible option to directly defend Iranian protesters, while indirect means to protect the Iranian people through deterrence or disruption of regime forces are unlikely to buy much time. The costs of failure (Iranian retaliation against protesters or the United States) are real; the costs of success (another failed democratic transition produced by military intervention) would be tragic.

In this case, a successful policy is one that empowers the Iranian people to retake control of their own future. The United States has an important supporting, not starring, role to play in this endeavor.

            Early on in her tenure as President Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi scrapped a Biden-era policy that banned the Justice Department from pursuing reporters' phone records and notes while investigating leakers.
    


            The message was unmistakable: Trump-era investigators would welcome a confrontation. And now they have one.
    


            This week, the Justice Department took the extraordinary step of obtaining a search warrant for Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson's home. FBI agents arrived early on Wednesday and seized Natanson's phone, two computers and her Garmin watch.
    


            Inside the Washington Post newsroom, the impact was immediate.
    


            Reporters called the search “incredibly disturbing” and unprecedented. Natanson met with Post lawyers and security experts, scrambled to line up her own outside legal counsel, and urged her colleagues to keep reporting.
    


            Until now, Gabe Rottman of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said, the Justice Department had “never executed a search warrant at the home of a reporter in a national security leak case.”
    


            But now that the line has been crossed, some journalists and media lawyers expect it will happen again.
    


            Trump allies at the Justice Department have been “itching to do this,” a law enforcement reporter told CNN.
    


            Bondi's revised policy, which went into effect last May, weakened her predecessor Merrick Garland's protections for the press and reflected Trump's personal frustration with leaks.
    


            On Wednesday night, Bondi alleged on Fox News that Natanson's devices “contain classified material regarding our foreign adversaries, and that's what we're looking into now.”
    


            The search warrant said the raid was connected to the case of a Maryland contractor who was charged last week with illegally retaining classified records. The Justice Department alleged that the contractor accessed a top-secret intelligence report related to an unnamed foreign country.
    


            Courts have repeatedly upheld the rights of journalists to obtain and report on leaked documents, even highly classified ones.
    


            But “in modern times, everything about the Espionage Act when it comes to treatment of the press has been based on norms and policy, not law,” national security attorney Mark Zaid told CNN.
    


            Since the Trump administration has “discarded policy norms previously set in place by prior administrations,” he said, “there is every reason to believe that what was just experienced by a Washington Post reporter was just the tip of the iceberg of things to come.”
    


            Natanson was one of six Post reporters who published an exclusive story last week about Venezuela, citing secret government documents obtained by the Post.
    


            Natanson also reported extensively on Trump's overhaul of the federal government, drawing on tips from sources inside federal agencies. She encouraged people to message her on Signal, the encrypted messaging app.
    


            A Post spokesperson declined to comment on whether the Post is taking legal action to try to limit the government's ability to access Natanson's work materials.
    


            But the Post's top editor, Matt Murray, told staffers on Thursday that “the whole company is working in a myriad of ways” to support Natanson and defend the publication's work.
    


            And an influential First Amendment advocacy group, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, has asked a federal judge to unseal the DOJ's applications to search Natanson's home.
    


            Because the records are currently sealed, the public has no way “to understand the government's basis for seeking (and a federal court's basis for approving) a search with dramatic implications for a free press and the constitutional rights of journalists,” the Reporters Committee's lawyers wrote in their filing late Wednesday.
    


            Under more ordinary circumstances, federal investigators investigating a leak of government secrets might seek a subpoena for reporters' records. Past subpoenas have triggered lengthy legal fights.
    


            Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aggressively pursued leakers and, at times, journalists, secretly seizing phone records from Associated Press reporters and labeling Fox News correspondent James Rosen a potential “co-conspirator” in a leak case. The backlash later led Obama attorney general Eric Holder to tighten Justice Department protections for reporters.
    


            Then, during Trump's first term, prosecutors covertly pursued internal communications from several major news outlets, including CNN, while hunting for sources.
    


            The outcry over this secret probe led Garland to put new protections in place in 2021.
    


            Xochitl Hinojosa, who ran the Justice Department's public affairs department back then, wrote on X, “I, personally, had to sign off on any investigative step involving a reporter when I was at DOJ. But there were very strict guidelines: we would not subpoena reporters for their sources. Period.”
    


            Hinojosa, who is now a CNN political commentator, also wrote that the search of Natanson's home was “a clear effort to intimidate reporters.”
    


            Bondi cast it as a necessary step to protect classified information.
    


            Last year's revisions to the DOJ policy about seeking reporter records still contained some safeguards for the press.
    


            Bondi wrote in a memo that “investigative techniques relating to newsgathering are an extraordinary measure to be deployed as a last resort when essential to a successful investigation or prosecution.”
    


            On Wednesday, Post colleagues gathered around Natanson's desk in the Washington newsroom, expressing support for her and asking what they could do to help.
    


            Natanson exhorted her colleagues to get back to work, especially because she can't right now — her devices are in the government's hands.
    


            “The best thing you can for me,” she told a group of colleagues, is “keep reporting.”
    


            Murray echoed that sentiment during Thursday morning's editorial meeting. “The best thing to do when people are trying to intimidate you is to not be intimidated — and that's what we did yesterday,” he said, according to a source who attended.
    


            The Post editorial board has also weighed in, observing that “leaks frustrate every president, but efforts to intimidate or neutralize reporters always fail in the end.”
    


            “Whatever happens,” the editorial board added, “The Post's important work will continue unabated.”

Live Updates


            • Insurrection Act: President Donald Trump warned he might invoke the centuries-old law to deploy US troops to Minnesota as state and federal officials clash over tactics used by immigration agents.
    


            • Another Minneapolis shooting: Law enforcement and demonstrators clashed last night near where a federal agent shot and injured a man after he allegedly assaulted the agent. During the struggle, DHS said two people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle. After the suspect got loose and joined the attack, the officer fired “defensive shots,” DHS said, striking the man in the leg.
    


• High tensions: Minneapolis leaders are asking residents to remain calm following last night's shooting, which happened a week after Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent. The shooting sparked nationwide protests and prompted the Trump administration to send in hundreds more agents as part of its coast-to-coast immigration enforcement crackdown.
    


            • Court fights: A judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order after Minnesota and the Twin Cities sued federal officials, claiming the immigration enforcement operation involves warrantless arrests and excessive force. The decision “should not be considered a prejudgment,” the judge said.
    


            In the North Minneapolis neighborhood where the shooting took place last night, residents woke up to what appeared to be a relatively normal morning – a stark contrast to the heated scenes on the ground the night before.
    


            Children boarded school buses at the intersections where citizens clashed with law enforcement less than 12 hours earlier, and much of the debris that littered the street had already been cleaned up, leaving only a few remnants behind.
    


            There's a chill in the air, though much of the snow on the ground melted earlier this week, revealing brown soil peeking through on the neighborhood's favorite sledding hill at Farview Park – just north of the area where ICE agents shot a man while trying to arrest him Wednesday.
    


            Cut off from much of Minneapolis by highways, the neighborhood feels more like a small, rust-belt town in northern Minnesota than the affluent, quirky neighborhoods on the south side of town.
    


            Community members here are eager to protect one another.
    


            As ICE agents pulled in and out of the parking lot of the local Taco Bell last night, neighbors mobilized to protect the staff, where employees include immigrants and Spanish speakers. Residents took turns standing guard in the cold outside the store until 2 a.m., clutching mylar blankets and hand warmers.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune downplayed President Donald Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota over ICE protests and said he hoped federal, state and local officials will restore calm soon.
    


                    “I think he's threatened that other places, other states too. So, I mean, we'll see what happens there,” the Republican leader told reporters. “Hopefully the local officials, working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials will be able to settle things down.”
                





            He was asked about plans to fund DHS in a yet-to-be passed appropriations bill as some Democrats are demanding language be added to the bill to rein in ICE – something most Republicans oppose.
    


            “That will be the hardest one for sure,” he said of the DHS bill, adding that they might need to pass a continuing resolution for DHS that would keep its current spending levels. “I would say if there were a candidate for a CR, that's probably the most likely.”
    


            Congress has a deadline at the end of month to pass the remaining spending bills to avert another government shutdown.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, appeared to support Trump's threat to send US troops to Minnesota and said the threat would not put the Department of Defense funding bill in jeopardy.
    


            “I can tell you that Minnesota is out of control. You have local and state leaders who seem to be encouraging violence,” Johnson told CNN, adding, “The president's frustrated about it, and so are we.”
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters today that people “surrounding” someone alleged to have committed a crime may be asked to “validate their identity.”
    


            One reporter asked Noem why Americans are “being asked on the street to provide proof of citizenship in Minnesota,” whether it's “targeted enforcement” and if she's “advising Americans to carry proof of citizenship.”
    


            In response, Noem said, “We're doing targeted enforcement.”
    


                    “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That's what we've always done.”
                





            Thousands of federal agents are in the Minneapolis area carrying out the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has led to days of tense protests.
    


            CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told anchors Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room” that it is “unconstitutional” to ask people to show proof of citizenship “without some other basis to make a stop.”
    


            “In order to stop somebody, detain them, question them for immigration purposes, an officer has to have reasonable suspicion,” Honig said. “Now, that's a fairly low bar. It's lower than the bar that a law enforcement agent would need to make a stop or questioning for criminal purposes, but it's still a bar.”
    


            The liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school said its research shows that more than 21 million American citizens — over 9% of citizens — “don't have proof of citizenship readily available.”
    


            President Donald Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell anti-ICE protests in Minnesota is dangerous and extreme, said Teresa Nelson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.
    


            “Those threats to essentially deploy the military against the people of Minnesota, against protesters and immigrants, is authoritarian. It's unnecessary, dangerous and wrong,” she told Ana Cabrera on MS Now this morning.
    


            Trump's threat came after a federal agent shot a man in the leg on Wednesday in Minneapolis, with officials saying the agent was attacked and fired in self-defense. Trump had previously threatened to use the Insurrection Act, a law last modified in 1871 that allows military deployment to states under limited conditions, in Portland, Oregon, in October.
    


            The ACLU's Minnesota chapter sued the Trump administration in December, claiming agents were violating the constitutional rights of protesters through violent and indiscriminate actions.
    


            “However, the law enforcement, when there are protests, they have a responsibility to facilitate that lawful protest, and what we're seeing time and time again is a quick escalation of violence against indiscriminate violence against everybody,” Nelson said.
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday that she has discussed the Insurrection Act with President Donald Trump, after he threatened invoking it in Minnesota, but she said the decision on whether to move forward with it rests with him.
    


                    “I discussed with the President this morning several things that we are dealing with under the department and different operations. We did discuss the Insurrection Act; he certainly has the constitutional authority to utilize that,” Noem told reporters at the White House. “My hope is that this leadership team in Minnesota will start to work with us to get criminals off the streets.”
                





            While Noem did not describe the situation in Minneapolis as an “insurrection,” she said, “I describe it as violent and violation of law in many places.”
    


            Noem told CNN's Alayna Treene that she didn't specifically recommend the Insurrection Act to Trump, but it was discussed as “one of the options he had constitutionally.”
    


            Pressed on whether she believes its necessary in Minnesota, Noem deferred to Trump.
    


            “Oh, I think that that president has that opportunity in the future. It's his constitutional right, and it's up to him if he wants to utilize it,” Noem said.
    


            Noem put the onus on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for improving the situation on the ground by working with federal authorities.
    


            “If things don't get better with Governor Walz, I don't anticipate that the streets will get any safer. Governor Walz and his leadership team need to come to us and find out how we can work together like we have in many other states,” Noem said.
    


            As for the administration's ICE operations, Noem said that there are “no plans to pull out of Minnesota.”
    


            Local leaders have not done enough to protect residents during the federal law enforcement surge in Minneapolis, City Council member Robin Wonsley told CNN's Sara Sidner on Thursday. Wonsley called on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to “demonstrate an ounce of courage” and declare an eviction moratorium.
    


            “Elected officials, like myself, need to be doing everything we can to get ICE out of Minneapolis, ICE out of Minnesota,” Wonsley said. “Strongly worded statements or strongly worded letters to the administration is just simply not sufficient.”
    


            The governor needs to “demonstrate an ounce of courage in this moment and make sure people can shelter in place as a protective measure” while ICE is in the community, she said.
    


            “Residents are demonstrating a huge amount of courage right now, and it's not being matched by our elected officials,” the city council member said, adding that residents should not stop protesting. “If elected leaders are not going to show up in this moment to protect and care for our neighbors — we will.”
    


            The incident that led to intense clashes between federal officials and protesters began around 6:50 p.m. local last night when a federal law enforcement officer in Minneapolis tried to conduct a ﻿“targeted traffic stop” of  a Venezuelan national who fled the scene in his car, the Department of Homeland Security said.
    


            The man crashed into a parked car and then took off running. When the officer caught up with him, he resisted arrest and began to “violently assault the officer,” the agency said.
    


            During the struggle, two people in a nearby apartment came out and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, DHS said.
    


            The suspect wrangled loose and joined the other two in attacking the officer, according to DHS who said the officer fired “a defensive shot.” The Venezuelan man was shot in the leg.
    


            The three individuals who attacked the officer barricaded themselves in an apartment before being taken into custody, the agency said. The officer and the injured man were taken to the hospital.
    


            Demonstrators began gathering near the scene in the hours after the incident to face off with law enforcement officers who deployed multiple tear gas canisters and what sounded like flash bangs before officials told people to “go home.”
    


            Video from a CNN crew at the scene showed two vehicles that appeared ransacked and vandalized, with the words “F*ck ICE” plastered on one, while another had “America land of the obey or die” written on it. The trunks of both vehicles were open with debris scattered on the ground.
    


            A crowd could be seen following federal agents through the neighborhood, with a line of officers forming a wall behind yellow police tape to block off the road.
    


            US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino was among those spotted at the scene.
    


            City and state leaders called for calm. “For those who have peacefully protested, I applaud you. For those who are taking the bait, you are not helping, and you are not helping the undocumented immigrants of our city. You are not helping the people who call this place home,” Mayor Jacob Frey said during a news conference late Wednesday night.
    


            President Donald Trump warned he might invoke a centuries-old law to deploy US troops to Minnesota as state and federal officials clash over tactics used by immigration agents.
    


            “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social. “Thank you for you [sic] attention to this matter!”
    


            The Insurrection Act – first passed in 1792 and tweaked in 1871 – allows the deployment of troops within the US in certain situations. The law works in tandem with the Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, which generally prohibits the use of the military inside the US.
    


            Trump previously threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send US troops in response to anti-ICE protests in Portland last fall. The last time a president invoked the law was in 1992, when California's governor asked President George H.W. Bush for help handling riots in Los Angeles.

            Anytime a federal officer or agent fears for their life or the lives of others, they can escalate to the use of deadly force, and discharging their weapon “would be appropriate,” CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow told CNN's John Berman while discussing last night's shooting in Minneapolis.
    


            With more federal law enforcement surging into Minneapolis, Wackrow says, more incidents like these are also likely to happen. “More officer activity means more enforcement contacts,” he explained. “What we're seeing is intensification, not de-escalation — across the board.”
    


            When clashes between the public and federal law enforcement escalate to the level they did in Minneapolis last night, he said, it “transcends away from this peaceful protest narrative or nonviolent direct action into things that law enforcement has to react to maintain civil order.”
    


            Law enforcement works best when federal, state, and local entities operate in parallel, Wackrow said. The Minneapolis Police Department embedding with ICE agents would not be an endorsement, but would help ensure greater public safety for everyone, he said.
    


            US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino was spotted among other federal agents in Minneapolis, at the scene where a federal agent shot a man who allegedly assaulted him.
    


            Video captured by CNN shows a heavy presence of federal agents and local law enforcement at the scene.
    


            Bovino arrived after the shooting and can be seen walking among other officers without a face mask, wearing a green coat and black shoes. He walked with the group into a taped-off area.
    


            Clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement erupted Wednesday night after the shooting of a man who allegedly assaulted a federal officer.
    


            Flash bangs and gas canisters were deployed as tensions rose. Demonstrators yelled at law enforcement on the scene.
    


            Here's a glimpse at what it looked like in Minneapolis last night:
    


            A CNN crew on the scene captured the moment federal agents deployed gas canisters to disperse demonstrators.
    


            As clashes continued in Minneapolis on Wednesday night and into the overnight hours, some vehicles were ransacked and vandalized.
    


            CNN's Whitney Wild was on the scene as the incident unfolded.
    


            Spray paint covers the sides of two vehicles, with phrases reading “F**k ICE” and “America land of the obey or die.”
    


            It is not immediately clear who owns the vehicles. CNN has reached out to both the FBI and DHS for more information.
    


            “It's not pleasant. It hangs in your mouth, it's hard to talk, it's hard to breathe,” Wild said, describing the tear gas deployed in the area. “It can make you kinda nauseous.”
    


            A judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order after Minnesota and the Twin Cities sued federal officials, claiming their immigration enforcement operation involves warrantless arrests and excessive force.
    


            The lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and its reporting agencies says federal agents are violating the 10th Amendment. Minneapolis, St. Paul and the state asked for a TRO to stop the federal operation while the case proceeds.
    


            The decision Wednesday not to issue a TRO “should not be considered a prejudgment,” US District Judge Katherine Menendez said at a status conference Wednesday morning.

            President Donald Trump seems to be running out of ways to assure everyone that he's dead-serious about taking over Greenland.
    


            “We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,” he said Friday.
    


            “One way or the other, we're gonna have Greenland,” Trump said Sunday.
    


            “Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he added Wednesday on social media.
    


            It's to the point now where, if Trump doesn't actually get Greenland, it will look a whole lot like a major second-term failure.
    


            Yet the prospect – which Trump has floated dating back to 2019 – still seems unthinkable enough that many appear to be struggling to grasp it or figure out what to do with it.
    


            Even in recent days, prominent Republicans who have warned Trump against the unpopular idea have layered their comments with apparent wishful thinking that Trump doesn't really mean it.
    


            So what's going on? Is Trump serious? Let's game out a few possibilities.
    


            One of the most popular theories when Trump says something outlandish is that he's just doing it for effect.
    


            To Trump's critics, they're deliberate “distractions” from the really important things we should be paying attention to.
    


            To Trump's allies, they're wily bits of “trolling” that prove Trump's psychological edge over his foes – four-dimensional chess, and all that.
    


            “I mean I know that y'all — they've trolled y'all into taking the bait,” Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said last week about Trump using the military in Greenland.
    


            And that's certainly possible here. Maybe Trump thinks it's better to talk about this than persistent inflation or the ICE shooting in Minneapolis last week.
    


            Maybe he just likes to needle everyone.
    


            Maybe he's trying to stretch the Overton window – that is, he's talking about something as drastic as taking Greenland so that his other expansionist goals in the Western Hemisphere sound a little more realistic.
    


Trump says ‘anything less' than US control of Greenland is ‘unacceptable'



            Or maybe …
    


            But we've also seen Trump lodge this idea for a very long time now. He often talks about it even when there's not something that he's obviously trying to shift attention away from.
    


            He's now set it up so that failing to get Greenland would be a pretty significant broken promise. He hasn't just said this is a goal; he's said it will happen, somehow.
    


            This also happens to fit very neatly with what appears to be Trump's big foreign policy initiative right now: the domination of the Western Hemisphere. His administration previewed this goal in a national security strategy document last month, and the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and efforts to commandeer control of that country's oil in recent weeks suggest it's a serious endeavor.
    


            Trump certainly loves a big piece of real estate. Greenland also makes sense as a target for many of the reasons Venezuela does – strategically and natural resource-wise.
    


            Of course, ousting Maduro with an hourslong operation – and otherwise leaving the government in place – is not the same as taking over a semiautonomous territory, which just so happens to be under the control of NATO ally Denmark.
    


            The president has so far kept the option of military force on the table, which would be an extremely drastic option. It would apparently necessitate other NATO countries coming to Greenland's defense under the charter's Article 5 mutual defense provisions – against the United States.
    


            All of which points to perhaps the most likely option: Trump is attempting to coerce Denmark and Greenland.
    


            Threatening military force could just be a means to getting Greenland and Denmark to come to the table on handing over the massive island. After all, Trump and his White House have spoken repeatedly in recent days about how much leverage they have – and about their intention to use it in the Western Hemisphere.
    


            The problem with that approach is Denmark and Greenland aren't playing ball. They've shown approximately zero willingness to negotiate.
    


            “Greenland has never been for sale and never will be for sale,” Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament from Greenland, said last week.
    


            That could be a negotiating posture, sure. But the prospect of selling such a massive piece of land feels like an idea out of a different century – like, the 19th century.
    


            Greenland's citizens are also overwhelmingly opposed to being under US control, according to polls, and Denmark's leaders probably don't love the idea of giving in to Trump's extortion.
    


            So, what if Denmark's and Greenland's posture doesn't change? What does Trump do? Does he actually pursue a military option?
    


            Failing to do so, at that point, would be a capitulation. And Trump has certainly proven he's increasingly willing to dispatch the military for the things he wants – both overseas and domestically. He also appears to have either fewer and fewer qualms about drastic measures in his second term, or fewer and fewer people around him who might thwart them – or both.
    


            He might also reason that NATO won't actually defend Greenland and that it would be pretty easy pickings to invade a place that's home to fewer than 60,000 people.
    


            “Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” White House adviser Stephen Miller declared earlier this month.
    


            But there is no question this would be a huge provocation. It would almost surely lead to a breakdown between the United States and its European allies.
    


            Trump certainly has less regard for the Western alliance than pretty much any recent president. But does he really think that would be worth it?
    


            The problem with this whole effort is that almost nobody besides Trump is asking for it.
    


            A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on Thursday showed just 25% of Americans approve of Trump's efforts to take Greenland.
    


            Many congressional Republicans have also signaled they're not on board – with either a military option or coercion. It even seems possible that Congress could vote to prevent an invasion, given the NATO issue, and lawmakers' so far unsuccessful efforts to rein in his powers to strike Venezuela again.
    


            (GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska this week introduced a bipartisan bill that would block Trump from taking Greenland by force.)
    


            Trump has lots of power as commander in chief, but that lack of support also matters.
    


            The most likely outcome, if past is predicate, is that this results in some kind of agreement over not the ownership of Greenland, but defense capabilities. That's the big reason Trump has cited for taking the island, after all, and it could save some face to at least walk away with something.
    


            The problem is that there's very little reason to believe Trump couldn't have that now – today – if that's all he wanted.
    


            The United States has a longstanding defense agreement with Denmark and Greenland, dating back decades, and it has used the island for a number of different purposes. The United States actually has a historically small presence there right now, compared to previous decades.
    


            “I have yet to hear from this administration a single thing we need from Greenland that this sovereign people is not already willing to grant us,” Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Wednesday on the Senate floor.
    


            But Trump has said defense agreements wouldn't be good enough. He's argued that ownership is necessary because, he claims, otherwise Russia or China will take it over. He's repeatedly alluded to Russian and Chinese ships in the area that don't actually appear to exist.
    


            Trump told the New York Times last week that owning Greenland is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”
    


            “I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can't do, whether you're talking about a lease or a treaty,” Trump said. “Ownership gives you things and elements that you can't get from just signing a document.”
    


            He's taken a maximalist approach here. And it seems we're about to find out just how serious he is – and how much he can and will commit to that approach.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Machado and Rodriguez: The two leaders fighting for Venezuela's future and Trump's favor","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/americas/venezuela-machado-rodriguez-trump-intl-hnk","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:59:27 GMT","


            As millions of Venezuelans wait to see what will become of their economically and politically ravaged country, a battle has emerged between two female leaders for control over the nation's future – and for the American president's favor.
    


            On one side is opposition leader and Nobel Prize laureate María Corina Machado, who rose to prominence in recent years for her dogged fight for democracy in Venezuela, facing down now-ousted former dictator Nicolás Maduro.
    


            She has mostly stayed in hiding after Venezuela's disputed 2024 presidential election, after which government-controlled electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner – allowing him to cling to power until his capture by US special forces in a remarkable raid two weeks ago.
    


            Her rival is Delcy Rodriguez – Maduro's vice president, now settling into her new role as acting president. Rodriguez is seen as a staunch member of the old guard and a strong Maduro defender; but she's walking a precarious tightrope in trying to appease both Washington and Maduro regime loyalists back home.
    


Trump scored a win with his raid on Venezuela. But the US is now responsible for the country's future



            At the center of their struggle is a figure who sits more than 2,000 miles away: President Donald Trump, who ordered the deadly raid in Caracas and declared that the United States would “run” Venezuela in the meantime.
    


            Though Trump has so far held off on a second attack on Venezuela, the threat of military intervention remains. He recently said his administration would begin targeting drug cartels on land, after months of strikes on alleged drug boats at sea. And he has kept a massive US military armada in the Caribbean to continue strong-arming Caracas.
    


            Perhaps more importantly, Trump's choices could influence the future of Venezuela's leadership and who takes the helm.
    


            On the surface, it looks straightforward – Trump has praised Rodriguez but declined to endorse Machado, despite her having high-powered supporters within his administration.
    


            But Trump's discussions with other world leaders have shown his opinions can flip quickly. Praise can turn to threats, or vice versa – and a one-on-one meeting, which Machado is about to have on Thursday at the White House, could change everything.
    


            Both Machado and Rodriguez have been communicating directly with the US president. On Wednesday, Trump said he had spoken with Rodriguez on the phone, calling her a “terrific person” and saying they were “getting along very well.”
    


            Machado is going a step further with direct face time; she's expected to have lunch with Trump on Thursday during her visit to DC, according to the White House schedule. But the opposition leader may face a more uphill battle thanks to a certain coveted peace prize.
    


            She has some powerful allies within the White House – Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among those who praised her work and nominated her for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Even Trump himself, before his inauguration last year, called Machado a freedom fighter who “MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!”
    


            But that support appeared to sour when Machado won the Nobel – which Trump has made no secret of wanting for himself. “I can't think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel Prize more than me. And I don't want to be bragging, but nobody else settled wars,” Trump said last week.
    


Why Venezuela's opposition leader Machado is betting her political future on Trump



            After ousting Maduro, Trump claimed Machado “does not have the support or the respect within the country” to be leader.
    


            Machado has tried to appease the president, dedicating the award partly to him when she won it last October. In recent weeks, she suggested she would offer her award to Trump even though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said it cannot be transferred. Trump said it would be an honor to receive her prize, but didn't directly answer whether that could make him reconsider her role in Venezuela.
    


            Thursday's lunch might be Machado's best chance at swaying the president; despite being on the back foot right now, a lot can change in one encounter. Just look at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous White House meeting with Trump last February, which left Ukraine scrambling to regain US support and European allies jumping in to play mediator.
    


            Or take New York's newly-inaugurated mayor Zohran Mamdani – who, despite receiving scathing criticism from Trump during the mayoral election, appeared to charm the president during their first meeting at the White House.
    


            Meanwhile, Trump has also voiced his willingness to meet “at some point” with Rodriguez, who now faces a tricky balancing act.
    


            On the one hand, Rodriguez has outwardly denounced the US operation, condemning Maduro's capture as a “barbarity” and a blatant violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.
    


            But under pressure from the US to comply, Rodriguez has since struck a more conciliatory tone, offering an “agenda of cooperation” with the US. Her government has begun releasing high-profile prisoners as a peace gesture, including several Americans.



            Rodriguez has long had a complicated relationship with the US. As her rival Machado has pointed out, the acting president is under US sanctions for human rights violations – which she has repeatedly denied.
    


            At the same time, she has worked for years to bolster the bilateral relationship – especially through oil, with Venezuela home to the world's largest reported oil reserves.



Who is Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's leader after Maduro's capture?



            In 2017, when she was foreign minister, Venezuela donated half a million dollars to Trump's inauguration committee through its oil subsidiary. Since becoming acting president, she has offered to ship millions of barrels of oil to the US and authorized a visit by US chargé d'affaires Joe McNamara to explore the possibility of reopening the US embassy in Caracas, which was closed in 2019.
    


            So far, her efforts to woo the White House appear to be paying off. Trump and other key administration officials have indicated that they view Rodriguez as a stable, pragmatic choice that the US can work with, and who is open to valuable business opportunities – with the first US sales of Venezuelan oil reported on Wednesday.
    


            But she's playing “a very difficult double game” with no guarantee of coming out on top, said Will Freeman, Fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
    


            Rodriguez “has to convince the Trump administration that she is working with them, to their ends, cooperatively,” he told CNN last week. “But she also has to convince hardliners in the Maduro regime… the military as well, that she's not going to sell them out,” he added.
    


            “We're going to see how long she can walk that tightrope.”

            The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country's authoritarian regime.
    


            The Iranian government is at its weakest point in years, destabilizing yet another OPEC nation less than two weeks after the United States toppled the government of Venezuela.
    


Protests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government's deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran.
    


            Iran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world's most important oil shipping lanes. Those factors will shape the country's future, regardless of whether the US intervenes.
    


            Iran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world's sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers. To skirt sanctions, Iran operates a shadow fleet of vessels to export oil at a steep discount.
    


            But Iran's potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 billion barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And its daily production is less than half the 6.5 million barrels per day Iran produced in the mid-1970s before revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.
    


            Like Venezuela, China is by far Iran's biggest customer: It bought 97% of Iran's oil in 2024, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don't end there: Iran also nationalized the country's energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies' assets in past decades.
    


            But Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela.
    


            “Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.”
    


            The price of oil has already risen sharply because of the threat of disruption to Iran's oil. Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela. Oil fell 4%, back below $60, Thursday morning after Trump suggested an attack wasn't imminent.
    


            Oil could rise significantly higher if the United States strikes Iran – but that probably depends on the extent of the possible attack and Iran's response.
    


            For example, crude prices surged 7% and rose above $74 a barrel in early June as tensions escalated between Israel and Iran. But prices actually fell sharply after the United States' historic attack on three Iranian nuclear facilities later that month because the United States avoided attacking the country's oil infrastructure – and Iran's missile attacks on US bases were intercepted and widely viewed as symbolic.
    


            Iran has the power to inflict serious damage on the oil market, however, if it wants: The country controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, a pinch point for other oil-producing countries through which 20 million barrels of crude – about one-fifth of daily global production – flow. The strait is the only way to ship crude from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world.
    


            “Iran's ability to cause chaos in the oil markets is significant if they choose to lash out,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.
    


            That's why the oil market is getting jittery.
    


            “Oil traders are effectively placing bets on chaos,” said Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory giant deVere Group. “Traders appear to be positioning for a scenario where the Strait of Hormuz shifts from being a shipping route to a strategic pressure point capable of choking global supply.”
    


            Iran has a surprisingly diversified economy for a sanctioned nation, with oil making up only about 10% to 15% of the country's overall gross domestic product. But Iran's government relies heavily on the oil industry for its finances, bringing in half of its revenue from crude exports.
    


            “Oil plays a critical role in the current regime and would continue to do so if the regime changes,” said Pickering.
    


            Iran also has a leg up on Venezuela, whose authoritarian regime allowed the country's oil infrastructure to crumble over the past couple decades. By contrast, Iran's infrastructure is in decent shape.
    


            “A future government would not be starting from zero,” Green said. “It would be starting from constrained capacity that can be, in most likely scenarios, unlocked.”
    


            Of course, that's if a new government in Iran is friendly to the West, persuading countries around the globe to drop their sanctions, noted Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
    


            “It all depends on what comes next and what regime emerges post Khamenei,” Croft said.
    


            In the near term, regime change could send oil prices higher, as the uncertainty of a political transition – including determining who would control the state-run oil industry – would add risk to the global crude market. But a new government in Iran could help stabilize and reduce oil prices in the long run, especially if it adds the transparency that the current authoritarian Iranian government has prevented for decades.
    


            That could put a significant amount of oil into the global market, according to Matt McManus, a former State Department official and a visiting fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics.
    


            Like Venezuela, however, US oil companies' interest in moving into Iran could be limited, at least at first.
    


            Political stability and guarantees of security would need to precede any major American oil company's involvement in Iran. And with crude prices still quite low, oil companies aren't exactly rushing into new opportunities with questionable profits.
    


            “As for Iran, it has significant resources,” said Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's trade group. “But any discussion of investment would depend on political stability.”

Troops from NATO countries, including France and Germany, are arriving in Greenland to boost security. This follows talks in Washington on Wednesday between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. that highlighted disagreements over Greenland's future.

U.S., Danish and Greenlandic officials have met face to face to discuss President Donald Trump's ambitions to take control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. At the same time, Denmark and several European allies are sending troops to Greenland in a pointed signal of intent to boost the vast Arctic island's security.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said after a meeting in Washington on Wednesday with his Greenlandic counterpart, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that a “fundamental disagreement” remained. He acknowledged that “we didn't manage to change the American position” but said he hadn't expected to. 

However, Wednesday's events did point to ways ahead.

Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. agreed to form a high-level working group “to explore if we can find a common way forward,” Løkke Rasmussen said. He added that he expects the group to hold its first meeting “within a matter of weeks.”

Danish and Greenlandic officials didn't specify who would be part of the group or give other details. Løkke Rasmussen said the group should focus on how to address U.S. security concerns while respecting Denmark's “red lines.” The two countries are NATO allies.

“Whether that is doable, I don't know,” he added, holding out hope that the exercise could “take down the temperature.”

He wouldn't elaborate on what a compromise might look like, and expectations are low. As Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen put it Thursday, having the group is better than having no working group and “it's a step in the right direction.” It will at least allow the two sides to talk with each other rather than about each other.

Trump has argued repeatedly that the U.S. needs control of Greenland for its national security. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals.

Just as the talks were taking place in Washington on Wednesday, the Danish Defense Ministry announced that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland, along with NATO allies. France, Germany, Norway and Sweden announced that they were each sending very small numbers of troops in a symbolic but pointed move signaling solidarity with Copenhagen. 

The U.K. said one British officer was part of what it called a reconnaissance group for an Arctic endurance exercise. The German Defense Ministry, which dispatched 13 troops, said the aim is to sound out “possibilities to ensure security with a view to Russian and Chinese threats in the Arctic.” It said it was sending them on a joint flight from Denmark as “a strong signal of our unity.”

Poulsen said that “the Danish Armed Forces, together with a number of Arctic and European allies, will explore in the coming weeks how an increased presence and exercise activity in the Arctic can be implemented in practice,” he said.

On Thursday, he said the intention was “to establish a more permanent military presence with a larger Danish contribution,” and to invite allies to take part in exercises and training on a rotating basis, according to Danish broadcaster DR. 

While the European troops are largely symbolic at this point, the timing was no accident.

The deployment “serves both to send a political signal and military signal to America, but also indeed to recognize that Arctic security should be reinforced more,” said Maria Martisiute, an analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels. “And first and foremost, this should be done through allied effort, not by the U.S. coming and wanting to take it over.

The European efforts are Danish-led and not coordinated through NATO, which is dominated by the United States. But the European allies are keen to keep NATO in play, and Germany said that “the aim is to obtain a well-founded picture on the ground for further talks and planning within NATO.”

Poulsen has said he and Greenland's foreign minister plan to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Monday to discuss security in and around the Arctic. NATO has been studying ways to bolster security in the Arctic region.

“I'm really looking forward for an announcement of some kind of military activity or deployment under NATO's framework,” Martisiute said. “Otherwise there is indeed a risk that ... NATO is paralyzed and that would not be good.”

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cast the U.S. announcement that the fragile ceasefire in Gaza would advance to its second phase as largely symbolic, raising questions about how its more challenging elements will be carried out.

Speaking late Wednesday with the parents of the last Israeli hostage whose remains are still in Gaza, Netanyahu said the governing committee of Palestinians announced as part of the second phase was merely a “declarative move,” rather than the sign of progress described by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.

Israeli police officer Ran Gvili's parents had earlier pressed Netanyahu not to advance the ceasefire until their son's remains were returned, which Israel's Hostage and Missing Families Forum said Wednesday.

Netanyahu told Gvili's parents that his return remained a top priority.

The announcement of the ceasefire's second phase marked a significant step forward but left many questions unanswered. 

Those include the makeup of a proposed, apolitical governing committee of Palestinian experts and an international “Board of Peace.” 

The committee's composition was coordinated with Israel, said an Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Questions also include the timing of deployment of international forces and the reopening of Gaza's southern Rafah border crossing, as well as concrete details about disarming Hamas and rebuilding Gaza.




In an interview on Wednesday with the West Bank-based Radio Basma, Ali Shaath, the engineer and former Palestinian Authority official slated to head the committee, said he anticipated reconstruction and recovery to take roughly three years. He said it would start with immediate needs like shelter.

“If I bring bulldozers, and push the rubble into the sea, and make new islands (in the sea), new land, it is a win for Gaza and (we) get rid of the rubble,” Shaath, a Gaza native, said.

Palestinians in Gaza who spoke to The Associated Press questioned what moving into phase two would actually change on the ground, pointing to ongoing bloodshed and challenges securing basic necessities.

More than 450 people have been killed since Israel and Hamas agreed to halt fighting in October, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Thursday.

Those casualties, which UNICEF said include more than 100 children, are among the 71,441 Palestinians killed since the start of Israel's offensive, according to the ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.

“We see on the ground that the war has not stopped, the bloodshed has not stopped, and our suffering in the tents has not ended. Every day there is suffering in the tents, in the rain and the sun, from sun to rain to death,” said Samed Abu Rawagh, a man displaced to southern Gaza from Jabaliya.

Hamza Abu Shahab, a man from eastern Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said he was waiting for tangible changes, such as easier access to food, fuel and medical care, rather than promises.

“We were happy with this news, but we ask God that it is not just empty words,” he told the AP in Khan Younis. “We need this news to be real, because in the second phase we will be able to return to our homes and our areas … God willing, it won't just be empty promises.”

Gaza's population of more than 2 million people has struggled to keep cold weather and storms at bay while facing shortages of humanitarian aid and a lack of more substantial temporary housing, which is badly needed during the winter months. 

This is the third winter since the war between Israel and Hamas started on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.

The second phase of the ceasefire will confront thornier issues than the first, including disarming Hamas and transitioning to a new governance structure after nearly two decades of the group's rule in the strip

The United Nations has estimated reconstruction will cost over $50 billion. This process is expected to take years and little money has been pledged so far.

Hamas has said it will dissolve its existing government to make way for the committee announced as part of the ceasefire's second phase. But it has not made clear what will happen to its military arm or the scores of Hamas-affiliated civil servants and the civilian police.

Bassem Naim, a member of the group's political bureau, said Thursday that Hamas welcomed the announcement of the committee as a step toward establishing an independent Palestinian state, but did not elaborate on the issues in question. He said on X that “the ball is now in the court” of the United States and international mediators to allow it to operate.

Israel has insisted Hamas must lay down its weapons, while the groups' leaders have rejected calls to surrender despite two years of war, saying Palestinians have “the right to resist.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Liberian man arrested over the weekend after heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of his Minneapolis home had been checking in regularly with federal authorities for years, his attorney said Tuesday.

The arrest of Garrison Gibson, 37 during a Minnesota immigration crackdown that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation ever, was a “blatant constitutional violation,” since the agents did not have a proper warrant, said attorney Marc Prokosch.

The arrest Sunday came in a city increasingly on edge after an immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good last week, setting off waves of angry protests and clashes between authorities and activists.

“This was an illegal search, absolutely,” said Prokosch, because agents had brought only an administrative warrant, which authorizes someone's arrest but does not allow officers to forcibly enter private homes. Forced entry requires a criminal warrant signed by a judge.

Gibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. But he had remained in the country legally under what's known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.

Only days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“He would have had another check-in in a couple of months,” Prokosch said. “So if he's this dangerous person, then, why are they letting him walk around?




Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said earlier this week that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.

McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agents' use of force was justified.

But court records indicate Gibson's legal history — dominated by a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare — shows only one felony, the 2008 conviction for third-degree narcotics sales that was later dismissed. 

Prokosch said Gibson had been flown to Texas by immigration authorities in the hours after his arrest, then quickly flown back to Minnesota on a judge's order after the lawyer filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal. The courts have not yet ruled on the petition. 

Gibson is currently being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea, Minnesota, after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas. according to ICE's detainee locator.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email from The Associated Press with follow-up questions about Gibson's case. 

Gibson's wife, Teyana Gibson Brown, a nurse who was inside the home with the couple's 9-year-old child during the raid, was deeply shaken by the arrest, Prokosch said.

During their conversations, she “was having a hard time just completing sentences because she's just been so distraught,” he said.

Activists who had been keeping watch on the immigration agents before Gibson's arrest banged on drums, blew whistles and honked car horns in attempts to disrupt the operation and warn neighbors, some of whom poured into the streets.

Video taken at the scene by the AP shows agents pushing and pepper-spraying demonstrators.

The Twin Cities — the latest target  in President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement campaign — has been convulsed by the killing of Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. 

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

City and state officials have dismissed those explanations based on videos of the confrontation.

State and local authorities are urging the public to share video and any other evidence as they seek to investigate Good's death after federal authorities insisted they would work on their own and not share information.

More than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News over the weekend that the administration would send additional federal agents to the state to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal officer shot a man in the leg in Minneapolis after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle while trying to make an arrest Wednesday, officials said.

Smoke filled the street near the site of the shooting as federal officers and protesters squared off. A group of officers wearing gas masks and helmets fired tear gas and grenades into a small crowd while protesters threw snowballs and chanted, “Our streets.” 

Such scenes have become common on the streets of Minneapolis since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good on Jan. 7. Agents have yanked people from cars and homes and been confronted by angry bystanders who bare demanding that officers pack up and leave.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on the social media platform X that federal law enforcement officers stopped a person from Venezuela who was in the U.S. illegally. The person drove away and crashed into a parked car before taking off on foot, DHS said.

After officers reached the person, two other people arrived from a nearby apartment and all three started attacking the officer, according to DHS.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” DHS said. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The two people who came out of the apartment are in custody, it said.

The city of Minneapolis said on X that the man shot was in the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.




“We understand there is anger,” it said. “We ask the public to remain calm.”

The shooting took place about 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) north of where Good was killed.

Earlier Wednesday, a judge gave the Trump administration time to respond to a request to suspend its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, while the Pentagon looked for military lawyers to join what has become a chaotic law enforcement effort in the state.

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the latest developments in President Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case “on the front burner” and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to a request for a restraining order.

The judge said these are “grave and important matters,” and that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

During a televised speech Wednesday evening, Gov. Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what's happening in the state “defies belief.”

“Let's be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” he said. “Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.” 

Walz added that “accountability” will be coming through the courts.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.

CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in Minneapolis.

Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military “is proud to support” the Justice Department.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.

It's the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place. The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.

Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there's concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.

“There are not many JAGs but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,” he said.

Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.

The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross' medical condition. The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.

There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss. Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.

She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home. 

Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defense claim that has been deeply criticized by Minnesota officials.

Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.

Good's family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd's family in a $27 million settlement with Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.

The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.

“They do not want her used as a political pawn,” the firm said, referring to Good and her family, “but rather as an agent of peace for all.”

Waving signs reading “Love Melts ICE” and “DE-ICE MN,” hundreds of teenagers left school in St. Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.

The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week. President Rebecca Cunningham noted that “violence and protests have come to our doorstep.” The campus sits next to the main Somali neighborhood in Minneapolis.

NEW YORK (AP) — A top Democrat slammed the Trump administration late Wednesday for creating “uncertainty and confusion” in cutting thousands of substance abuse and mental health grants and then abruptly reversing course.

House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rep. Rosa DeLauro described Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision-making as dangerous and haphazard after grant recipients began laying off employees based on the original plans.

“He must be cautious when making decisions that will impact Americans' health,” DeLauro, D-Conn., said in a statement. “I hope this reversal serves as a lesson learned.”

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on Tuesday night had canceled some 2,000 grants representing nearly $2 billion in funding, according to an administration official with knowledge of the cuts who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.

But by Wednesday evening, those cuts were being reversed, according to reports in The New York Times, NPR, The Washington Post and others. 

Grant recipients who had their funding canceled on Tuesday told The Associated Press they hadn't yet received word of the reinstatements. Some had already made difficult decisions in response to the cuts, including laying off employees and canceling scheduled trainings.

The reason for the reversal wasn't immediately clear, and spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.

The grant cancellations had pulled back funding for a wide swath of discretionary grants and represented about a quarter of SAMHSA's overall budget. They built on other, wide-ranging cuts that have been made at HHS, including the elimination of thousands of jobs and the freezing or canceling of billions of dollars for scientific research.

The cuts had thrown into jeopardy programs that give direct mental health services, opioid treatment, drug prevention resources, peer support and more to communities affected by addiction, mental illness and homelessness.

“Without that funding, people are going to lose access to lifesaving services,” Yngvild Olsen, former director of SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and a national adviser at Manatt Health, said earlier Wednesday. 

SAMHSA, a sub-agency of HHS, notified grant recipients that their funding would be canceled effective immediately in emailed letters on Tuesday evening, according to several copies received by organizations and reviewed by The Associated Press.

The letters, signed by SAMHSA Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Carroll, justified the terminations using a regulation that says the agency may terminate any federal award that “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

Grant recipients who were notified of the cancellations said they were confused by that explanation and didn't get any further detail about why the agency felt their work didn't match up with SAMHSA's priorities.

“The goal of our grants is entirely in line with the priorities listed in that letter,” said Jamie Ross, CEO of the Las Vegas-based PACT Coalition, a community organization focused on substance use issues that lost funding from three grants totaling $560,000. 

Organizations reeling from the news on Wednesday told the AP they had already been forced to cut staff and cancel trainings. In the long term, many had been considering whether they could keep programs alive by shuffling them to different funding sources or whether they'd need to stop the services altogether.

Robert Franks, CEO of the Boston-based mental health provider the Baker Center for Children and Families, which was told Tuesday it was losing two federal grants totaling $1 million, said Wednesday afternoon that the loss of funding would force his organization to lay off staff and put care in jeopardy for some 600 families receiving it. 

One of his organization's canceled grants had been awarded through the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, a more than 20-year-old program supporting specialized care for children who have been through traumatic events ranging from sexual abuse to school violence.

Franks said his organization's work directly advances SAMHSA's goals to address mental illness. He said trauma care provided to children through his organization helps people from all walks of life and reduces burdens on other parts of society. He could not be reached late Wednesday to respond to the news of the grant reinstatements.

Both Ross and Ryan Hampton, founder of the advocacy nonprofit Mobilize Recovery, told the AP they hadn't yet been notified of any reversal to the grant cuts they'd been notified of Tuesday night. 

The National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, a group that represents local organizations that deliver safety net services, sent a letter to its members on Wednesday noting that multiple of its partners estimated the slashed grants totaled around 2,000 and likely amounted to some $2 billion. The group said the funding pullbacks appeared to focus on grants classified as Programs of Regional and National Significance. 

The group said it believed certain block grants, 988 suicide and crisis lifeline funding and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics were spared from the cuts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans voted to dismiss a war powers resolution Wednesday that would have limited President Donald Trump's ability to conduct further attacks on Venezuela after two GOP senators reversed course on supporting the legislation.

Trump put intense pressure on five Republican senators who joined with Democrats to advance the resolution last week and ultimately prevailed in heading off passage of the legislation. Two of the Republicans — Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana — flipped under the pressure.

Vice President JD Vance had to break the 50-50 deadlock in the Senate on a Republican motion to dismiss the bill.

The outcome of the high-profile vote demonstrated how Trump still has command over much of the Republican conference, yet the razor-thin vote tally also showed the growing concern on Capitol Hill over the president's aggressive foreign policy ambitions.

Democrats forced the debate after U.S. troops captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month

“Here we have one of the most successful attacks ever and they find a way to be against it. It's pretty amazing. And it's a shame,” Trump said at a speech in Michigan Tuesday. He also hurled insults at several of the Republicans who advanced the legislation, calling Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky a “stone cold loser” and Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine “disasters.” Those three Republicans stuck to their support for the legislation.

Trump's latest comments followed earlier phone calls with the senators, which they described as terse. The president's fury underscored how the war powers vote had taken on new political significance as Trump also threatens military action to accomplish his goal of possessing Greenland.




The legislation, even if it had cleared the Senate, had virtually no chance of becoming law because it would eventually need to be signed by Trump himself. But it represented both a test of GOP loyalty to the president and a marker for how much leeway the Republican-controlled Senate is willing to give Trump to use the military abroad. Republican angst over his recent foreign policy moves — especially threats of using military force to seize Greenland from a NATO ally — is still running high in Congress.

Hawley, who helped advance the war powers resolution last week, said Trump's message during a phone call was that the legislation “really ties my hands.” The senator said he had a follow-up phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio Monday and was told “point blank, we're not going to do ground troops.” 

The senator added that he also received assurances that the Trump administration will follow constitutional requirements if it becomes necessary to deploy troops again to the South American country.

“We're getting along very well with Venezuela,” Trump told reporters at a ceremony for the signing of an unrelated bill Wednesday.

As senators went to the floor for the vote Wednesday evening, Young also told reporters he was no longer in support. He said that he had extensive conversations with Rubio and received assurances that the secretary of state will appear at a public hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Young also shared a letter from Rubio that stated the president will “seek congressional authorization in advance (circumstances permitting)” if he engaged in “major military operations” in Venezuela.

The senators also said his efforts were also instrumental in pushing the administration to release Wednesday a 22-page Justice Department memo laying out the legal justification for the snatch-and-grab operation against Maduro.

That memo, which was heavily redacted, indicates that the administration, for now, has no plans to ramp up military operations in Venezuela.

“We were assured that there is no contingency plan to engage in any substantial and sustained operation that would amount to a constitutional war,” according to the memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Elliot Gaiser.

Trump has used a series of legal arguments for his campaign against Maduro. 

As he built up a naval force in the Caribbean and destroyed vessels that were allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, the Trump administration tapped wartime powers under the global war on terror by designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations. 

The administration has claimed the capture of Maduro himself was actually a law enforcement operation, essentially to extradite the Venezuelan president to stand trial for charges in the U.S. that were filed in 2020.

Paul criticized the administration for first describing its military build-up in Caribbean as a counternarcotics operation but now floating Venezuela's vast oil reserves as a reason for maintaining pressure.

“The bait and switch has already happened,” he said.

Lawmakers, including a significant number of Republicans, have been alarmed by Trump's recent foreign policy talk. In recent weeks, he has pledged that the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for years to come, threatened military action to take possession of Greenland and told Iranians protesting their government that “ help is on its way.”

Senior Republicans have tried to massage the relationship between Trump and Denmark, a NATO ally that holds Greenland as a semi-autonomous territory. But Danish officials emerged from a meeting with Vance and Rubio Wednesday saying a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland remains.

“What happened tonight is a roadmap to another endless war,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference following the vote.

More than half of U.S. adults believe President Donald Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries, according to a new AP-NORC poll.

Last week's procedural vote on the war powers resolution was supposed to set up hours of debate and a vote on final passage. But Republican leaders began searching for a way to defuse the conflict between their members and Trump as well as move on quickly to other business. 

Once Hawley and Young changed their support for the bill, Republicans were able to successfully challenge whether it was appropriate when the Trump administration has said U.S. troops are not currently deployed in Venezuela.

“We're not currently conducting military operations there,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune in a floor speech. “But Democrats are taking up this bill because their anti-Trump hysteria knows no bounds.”

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has brought a series of war powers resolutions this year, accused Republicans of burying a debate about the merits of an ongoing campaign of attacks and threats against Venezuela.

“If this cause and if this legal basis were so righteous, the administration and its supporters would not be afraid to have this debate before the public and the United States Senate,” he said in a floor speech.

Kaine vowed to force votes on war powers resolutions that would apply to a number of potential military conflicts, including Greenland. House Democrats have also filed a similar war powers resolution and can force a vote on it as soon as next week.

The driver of a U-Haul truck that drove through protesters demonstrating against the Iranian regime in Los Angeles on Sunday claims that police waved him onto the street full of protesters, and that he had never meant to hurt anyone.

Calor Madanescht, 48, was taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department on suspicion of reckless driving following the incident.

""I had no intention to hit anybody,"" Madanescht told FOX11 Los Angeles.

Madanescht said an LAPD officer waved him onto the avenue, where he intended to join the protest. However, he claims a pro-Shah group began to attack him.

""I was really afraid for my life,"" he said, adding that some protesters helped clear a path so he could drive away. ""They were telling me, ‘Go, go,' and they opened the path, as you see in the video.""

Video online appears to show the U-Haul truck moving quickly through a dense crowd as people screamed along Veteran Avenue near the Federal Building in the Westwood neighborhood. A banner on the side of the truck read, in all capital letters, ""NO SHAH. NO REGIME. USA: DON'T REPEAT 1953. NO MULLAH.""

""All I want is peace and human rights for everyone in Iran and for minorities,"" Madanescht said.

Madanescht said that the was at the protest in support of the Iranian people. He said he suffered bruised eyes from the attack. (FOX11 Los Angeles KTTV)

Madanescht said that once he pulled over, other demonstrators began to attack him. He showed the outlet a bandaged hand, a cut on his ear, bruises and black eyes.

Another video shows the crowd of people running toward the truck and surrounding it as people can be heard chanting at the driver behind the wheel. One member of the crowd climbed onto the truck and stomped on its windshield. Others stuck flagpoles through an open passenger-side window, appearing to jab the suspect.

During Madanescht's interview with the outlet, two men who were at the protest gave their accounts of what happened.

""They kept punching him, hitting him,"" said one of the men, identified as Mehdi. ""They broke the window, kicked the truck, assaulted him, and he has a right to free speech.""

Police said the adult male driver has been detained pending further investigation. His identity has yet to be released. (Alaleh Kamran via Storyful)

The other man questioned Madanescht's claim that LAPD had waved him onto a street that was occupied by demonstrators.

But Madanescht maintained that his intentions for being at the protest were only peaceful.

""The reality is I peacefully came, cooperated with LAPD, and I'm deeply grateful for them,"" he said. ""They deserve the highest praise for putting their lives on the line to save mine.""

The protest comes amid ongoing unrest in Iran, where demonstrations that began over economic grievances have spread nationwide, evolving into a direct challenge to Iran's clerical leadership.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said at least 18,470 people have been arrested and confirmed the deaths of 2,615 individuals. HRANA said 2,435 of those killed were protesters, including 13 children under the age of 18.

The U.S. military has seized another fugitive oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the Caribbean, U.S. Southern Command announced Thursday.

The U.S. military has seized another fugitive oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the Caribbean, U.S. Southern Command announced Thursday.

The U.S. has now seized six oil tankers since ramping up a campaign against illicit oil trade by Venezuela.

""In another pre-dawn action, Marines and Sailors from Joint Task Force Southern Spear, in support of the Department of Homeland Security, launched from USS Gerald R. Ford and apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica without incident. The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean, proving the effectiveness of Operation Southern Spear yet again,"" U.S. Southern Command said in a statement.

""These operations are backed by the full power of the U.S. Navy's Amphibious Ready Group, including the ready and lethal platforms of USS Iwo Jima, USS San Antonio, and USS Fort Lauderdale. The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully. The Department of War, in coordination with interagency partners, will defend our homeland by ending illicit activity and restoring security in the Western Hemisphere,"" the statement continued.

The operation comes as President Donald Trump is set to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House on Thursday.

The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a ""shadow fleet"" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela.

Trump has said the U.S. will ""run"" Venezuela after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.

Trump told The New York Times in an interview that was published Wednesday that ""only time will tell"" how long the U.S. will be running the country, but said it would be ""much longer"" than a year. 

Additionally, Trump announced recently that Venezuela would hand over up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S. and that the oil would be sold ""immediately.""

""We will rebuild it in a very profitable way,"" Trump told the Times. ""We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.""

""Our nation is in crisis,"" a statement from her X account read. ""We continued to watch the assault on our democracy with ICE terrorizing our cities, kidnapping, assaulting and killing our citizens. The police are powerless and the FBI is complicit. In the past, we would have called on the National Guard but they have been weaponized as well. We can take some solace in seeing the huge number of people who are unafraid to take to the streets in protest but our outrage can't be selective. We can't just protest when White people get killed. We the people means all of us. We need accountability for the crimes ICE is committing and we need it now, but we also need something much more important.

""Something that we are desperate to find and that's HOPE. We need hope that Congress will rise to the challenge and fulfill their oath of office. We need hope that Republicans will grow a spine and impeach this megalomaniac and restore the values that we believed in before this administration took over. We need our democracy back. But until that day comes I will do what I can and stay in the fight – I hope you will too.""

Three more Democratic lawmakers who participated in a video message encouraging service members to ""refuse illegal orders"" said they are being investigated by federal prosecutors.  

Reps. Jason Crow, of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan, of Pennsylvania, and Maggie Goodlander, of New Hampshire, all indicated Wednesday that they received inquiries from U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro asking for an interview with them or their attorneys, according to The New York Times. 

""Trump's political cronies at the Justice Department are trying to threaten and intimidate us,"" Crow said in a post on X. ""Well, he's picked a fight with the wrong people. I will always uphold my oath to the Constitution."" 

""We are not going to back away,"" he added in a video message. ""Our job, our duty is to make sure that the law is followed. We will not be threatened, we will not be intimidated, and we will not be silenced. I am more emboldened than ever to make sure that I am upholding my duty and I will not back down.""

DEM SENATOR SAYS SHE'S UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OVER 'UNLAWFUL ORDERS' VIDEO

The controversial video, which was posted in November, featured Crow, Houlahan, Goodlander, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa.  

All the Democrats who participated in the video, which was slammed as a call to defy President Donald Trump and his Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, had military and intelligence backgrounds. 

The video was released amid a nationwide debate about Trump's deployment of the National Guard to various cities across the country.

Trump criticized the video and said in multiple Truth Social posts that the lawmakers who participated in it had engaged in ""seditious behavior."" 

""It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,"" the president wrote on Nov. 20. 

The same day, Trump wrote in a separate Truth Social post, ""SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!""

The Times reported earlier this week that Pirro's office sent an email to the Senate's sergeant-at-arms requesting an interview with Slotkin or her private counsel.  

""Facts matter little, but the threat matters quite a bit,"" Slotkin told the Times. ""The threat of legal action; the threat to your family; the threat to your staff; the threat to you."" 

Pirro's office would not confirm or deny the existence of the probe. 

""No matter the threats, I'm not backing down,"" Goodlander said in a video posted to X on Wednesday. ""It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the President, our Commander in Chief, to threaten violence against me and to weaponize the Department of Justice against me.""

""Like my colleagues, I was contacted by federal prosecutors who are investigating me for making a video reminding servicemembers not to follow illegal orders,"" Houlahan said in another X post. ""The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn't want anyone to hear.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accuses Israeli Mossad agents of provoking violence in Iran while insisting the country's widespread protests support the Islamic Republic on 'Special Report.'

Iran appeared to reopen its airspace on Thursday after a sudden overnight closure disrupted flights across the region, even as airlines largely continued to avoid the country amid heightened security warnings and ongoing regional tensions. 

The overnight closure lasted around five hours after a Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, was issued, according to the aviation risk-monitoring site Safe Airspace. 

Safe Airspace warns that the main danger for civil aircraft in Iranian airspace is misidentification by air defense systems during heightened tensions, rating the overall risk level currently as ""One — Do Not Fly.""

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he was informed the killing of protesters in Iran was ""stopping.""

""We have been notified and really strongly, but we'll find out what that all means. But, we've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping,"" he said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., disagreed with Trump, writing on X that every indication he's seen shows that the Iranian regime's killing of anti-government protesters is ""still very much in full swing.""

""The death toll is mounting by the hour. Hoping that help is on the way,"" he wrote.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said on Wednesday that nationwide protests continued into the 18th day as authorities maintained a near-total internet shutdown.

The group's aggregated figures showed 617 protest gatherings in 187 cities across the country, the arrest of at least 18,470 people and the confirmed deaths of 2,615 individuals.

HRANA said 2,435 of those killed were protesters, including 13 children under the age of 18.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump threatens Minnesota with Insurrection Act after second federal shooting reignites protesters","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4419819/trump-threatens-minnesota-insurrection-act-second-federal-shooting-reignites-protesters/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:01:40 GMT","

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke a law allowing him to send the military or federalized National Guard troops into Minnesota on Thursday, arguing that “insurrectionists” are causing chaos in the streets. 

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump wrote Thursday morning. 

The president's statement about possibly invoking the rarely used Insurrection Act of 1807 “to stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” comes after protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers intensified over the past few hours. Tensions have heightened in Minneapolis, as state lawmakers continue to criticize federal operations in the state.

The act, signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson, codifies the use of U.S. land and naval military forces in the event of an insurrection. The word “insurrection” isn't defined in the act but is typically understood as an act of revolting against civil authority or government, according to Merriam-Webster dictionary.

It's been used previously by presidents to quell labor disputes and rebellions in the early days of America.

Protests in Minneapolis have been ongoing since an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a Minnesota woman accused of trying to kill federal officers. On Wednesday evening and overnight, demonstrators responded to a second shooting in the city, in which the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said a federal officer shot an illegal immigrant in the leg after being attacked by multiple suspects with a snow shovel and broomstick.

What is the Insurrection Act, the law at the center of the debate over Trump deploying the National Guard?

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said some protesters were throwing fireworks and rocks at federal agents. He characterized it as an “unlawful assembly,” as law enforcement used tear gas and flash bangs on rioters launching fireworks and snowballs at officers. Officials said 600 Minneapolis Police Department officers are working to “keep our streets safe.  

Both sides continue to blame the other for escalating tensions. 

The Trump administration has vigorously defended all ICE tactics as justified amid sweeping questions about how federal agents handled the incident leading up to Good's death. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche suggested late Wednesday evening that an “insurrection” is occurring in the state, and accused Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging violence.” ICE agents are merely trying to protect citizens from “criminal aliens,” he said.

Trump also made a highly charged statement that day. He suggested Democrats in the state are using “anarchists and professional agitators” to prevent ICE agents from trying to detain thousands of rapists and other criminals. 

“FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” the president said. 

Walz has urged residents to protest. But, like Frey, while he has urged them to remain “peaceful,” the governor's rhetoric has also been heated, accusing ICE on Wednesday evening of conducting “a campaign of organized brutality” and “kidnapping innocent people with no warning.” Walz is urging protesters to make their way to ICE operation scenes and record their actions to create a “database of the atrocities against Minnesotans.”

“They're breaking windows, dragging pregnant women down the street, just plain grabbing Minnesotans and shoving them into unmarked vans,” he alleged. 

Frey has repeatedly called on ICE to leave the city immediately, telling them to “get the f*** out of Minneapolis.” On Wednesday, he continued to accuse them of “intolerable” conduct, while telling protesters to refrain from “chaos.” 

The situation in Minnesota comes after Minneapolis survived extensive violence and riotous acts sparked by the death of George Floyd in the city over five years ago. The widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 resulted in at least 1,000 businesses being damaged, including dozens of places marked “destroyed.” Good's family has retained the services of the law firm that represented Floyd's family. 

Officials are warning “the temperature needs to be lowered,” as the state could be heading in that direction once again. 

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said this week as she appeared in court for a lawsuit in which Minnesota and Minneapolis are seeking to block ICE operations in the state. 

“The situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable,” Frey said.

BESSENT CALLS MINNESOTA ‘GENESIS' OF NATIONWIDE ROLLOUT FOR ANTI-FRAUD PROTOCOLS

The Trump administration appears unlikely to reduce ICE's presence in the city at this point. The president, during an interview on Wednesday, continued to stand by the ICE officer who shot Good dead, while sending a message “of love” to her father-in-law. 

“I want to say to the father that I love all of our people,” Trump told CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil. “I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person, but her actions were pretty tough.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

As it finds itself in the most uncertain position in its modern history, Venezuela's destiny may well be decided by the maneuvering of two powerful women.

After former Venezuelan ruler Nicolas Maduro was snatched from Caracas in the dead of night by U.S. Army Delta Force commandos, most observers were certain the U.S. would push for Maria Corina Machado, Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader, as the next president of Venezuela. Many were shocked, then, when the same morning as Maduro's capture, President Donald Trump indicated that Machado couldn't be the leader of Venezuela, and the U.S. would instead support Vice President Delcy Rodriguez for the time being.

Trump's choice reflected Washington's newfound realpolitik approach to geopolitics, but also a long-running behind-the-scenes effort from the two to win the president's favor. Both women are known for their competence and strong-willed nature, but have very different visions for Venezuela in mind.

Machado was born into an elite family and began her career studying to be an industrial engineer, then got a master's degree in finance. Her passion quickly turned to politics after the socialist Hugo Chavez took power, however, spurring a rivalry that would come to define her political life. She defined herself as the co-founder of Súmate, a political group that dedicated itself to promoting a referendum to remove Chavez from power in 2004. While the effort was unsuccessful, she continued to speak out against the authoritarian Chavez, despite criminal conspiracy charges against her.

Another prominent theme of Machado's political life began just as early — appeals for U.S. and world support to help oust Chavez. She met with then-President George W. Bush in 2005 in the Oval Office, a move that enraged the anti-U.S. Chavez.

Machado proved her popularity in 2010 when she won a seat in the National Assembly in a landslide, using her seat to boldly heckle Chavez and his allies. She slowly rose through the ranks after first running for president in 2012. She would form an even more prevalent rivalry with Chavez's successor, Maduro. She was accused of trying to assassinate the president, charges she denied, which caused her to lie low for much of the next decade, allowing the less politically savvy Juan Guaido to position himself as the head of Venezuela's opposition, an adventure that ended in failure when he overestimated his own position.

Machado's finest hour began during the 2023 election, when she took up the mantle of the opposition. She quickly became the most popular politician in Venezuela as voters discontented with the economic collapse caused by Maduro's regime rallied behind her, delivering her 90% of the vote in the opposition primary. Maduro's government banned her from running on spurious grounds, triggering widespread outrage. 

In her stead, she endorsed former diplomat Edmundo González, a man virtually unknown before her endorsement. He easily crushed Maduro at the polls by a two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records obtained by the opposition and validated by international observers. Nevertheless, the National Electoral Council, a government agency filled with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the winner, and Caracas cracked down on the widespread protests triggered in response. Machado went into hiding, and Gonzalez went into exile.

Machado gambled on throwing her full support behind Trump, even going so far as to avoid harming his ego by dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to him.

Some uncorroborated reports suggested that Trump passed over Machado after capturing Maduro over his jealousy regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, but further reporting has revealed missteps that cost the opposition leader dearly. Machado fumbled several planned meetings with Trump officials, failing to deliver a list of political prisoners, declining to meet in person with Trump's special envoy Richard Grenell, and drawing frustration after failing to concretely lay out how a democratic government could take power in Venezuela, the New York Times reported.

This culminated in an embarrassment at Trump's Mar-a-Lago news conference on Jan. 3, during which Trump suggested she wasn't respected by Venezuelans.

“I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,” Trump told reporters. “She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.”

Machado's allies insisted to the Financial Times that she isn't dejected and still has hope of taking power.

Ideologically, Machado would get along well with Trump. She's been broadly described as a Christian liberal democrat, stressing free market capitalism, individualism, transparent elections, and liberalism. She's long been heavily pro-U.S., and if installed, would likely sign even more favorable agreements with the U.S. She's even gone so far as to plead for direct U.S. military intervention multiple times throughout her political career, going as far back as 2014.

Machado is now banking everything on charming Trump at a Thursday White House meeting. After showing U.S. dominance over Venezuela with Operation Absolute Resolve, Trump's decision regarding the country is likely to prove decisive if she ever wants to take power. The meeting will be the first time the two have directly spoken since Oct. 10, when she won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Aside from being strong-willed and a politician, Rodriguez holds almost nothing in common with Machado.

While Machado hails from an elite business family, Rodriguez was born the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla leader who was arrested over his involvement in the kidnapping of an American businessman. Her father died in police custody, allegedly from torture, something that embittered her against the country's establishment.

“The revolution is our revenge for the death of our father,” Rodriguez said in a past interview, referring to Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution.

Her brother also shared the family's leftist views — Jorge Rodriguez would also enter politics and serve as one of the most influential Chavista politicians.

Delcy Rodriguez studied in several Western countries during her college years, including a period spent in Santa Monica, California. She first entered politics in 2002 during the military coup attempt against Chavez, rallying support for Chavez from abroad, going so far as to symbolically take over the Venezuelan embassy in London with her mother.

Delcy Rodriguez steadily rose through the ranks after entering national politics, becoming foreign minister in 2014-2017, President of the National Constituent Assembly 2017-2018, vice president beginning in 2018, minister of economy, finance, and foreign trade from 2020-2024, Minister of Petroleum in 2024, and finally acting president in 2026. She was inaugurated into her current position on Jan. 5.

In a widely despised government known for its corruption and inefficiency, Rodriguez won rare respect as an effective and pragmatic operator. She implemented pragmatic economic reforms as minister of economy, finance, and foreign trade, including reductions in price controls, partial dollarization, and establishing relationships with the private sector. Among her most impressive accomplishments was her handling of the country's lucrative but struggling oil industry, which she wielded significant control over after being appointed vice president.

Under her management, Venezuela's oil industry saw modest growth despite crippling U.S. sanctions and a lack of international expertise, the primary move that earned her attention from the Trump administration.

Lesser known at the time, but perhaps influential later, was her attempted courting of Trump during his first term. Federal Election Commission records showed that she directed Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, to contribute $500,000 to Trump's inaugural committee, according to USA Today. This effort is largely viewed as a failure, given Trump's first administration's hard-line stance toward Venezuela, but it could have planted the seed of the second administration's cautious trust placed in her.

Despite her accomplishments, Rodriguez was largely unknown to much of the world when she was suddenly thrust into power following Maduro's capture. Trump's statement on Jan. 3 expressing confidence that she would work with the U.S. took many by complete surprise.

“She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice,” Trump said of the new president. “She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple.”

Some analysts doubted Trump's sentiment, given her hostile rhetoric immediately following Maduro's capture. At her swearing-in ceremony, she denounced Operation Absolute Resolve as an “illegitimate military aggression.”

“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said. “I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”

She repeated this rhetoric as recently as Monday, once again denouncing “the illegal, illicit aggression of the United States government against the Venezuelan people.” Her most recent remarks came over anger towards Trump after he posted an edited image listing himself as “President of Venezuela” on Wikipedia.

“I've seen some caricatures on Wikipedia about who runs Venezuela,” she said, an apparent reference to the meme posted by Trump.

“Well, there is a government here that runs Venezuela, there is an acting president here, and there is a president held hostage in the United States,” Rodriguez said.

Despite this, she has openly expressed a conciliatory approach to the U.S. elsewhere, particularly when not addressing a domestic audience. She has followed through by adopting policies favoring the U.S., including an oil deal giving the U.S. exclusive discretion over who Venezuela sells its oil to. She has loosened repression and released scores of political prisoners, and renewed ties with the U.S.

She spoke with Trump by phone on Wednesday, a phone call the U.S. president related in gushing terms on Truth Social.

He described the call as “very good,” saying, “We are making tremendous progress, as we help Venezuela stabilize and recover. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security.”

“This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump said.

DELCY RODRIGUEZ RIPS TRUMP POST CALLING HIMSELF VENEZUELA'S ‘ACTING PRESIDENT'

Rodriguez's skill in winning over Trump puts Machado in an increasingly difficult position. For her part, the liberal leader has warned that Rodriguez is little different than Maduro.

“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Machado said in a recent interview with Fox News. “She's the main ally and liaison with Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual that could be trusted by international investors. And she's really rejected, repudiated by the Venezuelan people.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says President Donald Trump has the “most unhinged eating habits” out of all the Cabinet members, revealing his diet often consists of candy, Diet Coke, and McDonald's.

Still, Kennedy said, Trump manages to have the “constitution of a deity” and the most energy out of anyone he's ever met.

TRUMP THREATENS MINNESOTA WITH INSURRECTION ACT AFTER SECOND FEDERAL SHOOTING REIGNITES PROTESTERS

“I don't know how he's alive, but he is,” the 71-year-old secretary told former Trump aide Katie Miller in a new episode of her podcast released on Tuesday.

Kennedy went on to reveal that Trump only eats “junk food” while traveling and that “he wants to eat food from big corporations,” such as McDonald's, “because he trusts it” and “doesn't want to get sick when he's on the road.”

But whenever he's at his Mar-a-Lago resort or the White House, Trump tends to eat “really good food” made by his chefs, according to Kennedy.

WHAT IS THE INSURRECTION ACT?

Trump is widely known for his love of McDonald's and Diet Coke, so much so that he reinstalled a button used to call White House staff to bring Diet Coke cans to the Oval Office. Additionally, Trump once offered McDonald's on his private plane in November 2024 after winning the presidential election.

Seen as the public head of the Make America Healthy Again initiative, Kennedy was among the high-profile figures seen in the viral photo with his McDonald's meal. While Kennedy appeared less than enthused in the moment, others in attendance confirmed he ate the meal despite his past criticism of fast food as “poison.” He invoked the term again in the recent interview.

“If you travel with him, you get this idea that he's just pumping himself full of poison all day long and you don't know how he's walking around, much less being the most energetic person any of us have ever met,” Kennedy said of Trump. “I think he actually does eat pretty good food usually.”

Trump's health has been called into question by the New York Times and other news outlets after he underwent numerous health assessments during his first year back in office. The 79-year-old president took an annual physical last April, followed by a routine yearly checkup and multiple cognitive tests several months later. The White House says he passed all of the tests.

Without addressing those health assessments specifically, Kennedy said Trump has “got incredible health” for someone of his age — and revealed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz concurs based on his own assessment.

“Dr. Oz looked at his medical records and said he's got the highest testosterone level that he's ever seen for an individual over 70 years old,” Kennedy added, drawing laughter from the podcast host. “I know the president will be happy that I repeat that.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In a victory for the Trump administration, Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read announced last week that the state will resume “routine cleanup” of outdated voter registration records, a process dormant since 2017. The effort could ultimately cancel up to 800,000 inactive registrations, roughly 20% of the Beaver State's total voter rolls. This long-overdue cleanup comes only after the Department of Justice sued Oregon and other states to enforce basic voter-roll maintenance standards.

For years, Oregon's political class treated voter roll maintenance as a nuisance at best and a moral failing at worst. The state paused its cleanup mechanisms in 2017 and allowed a backlog of inactive registrations to pile up. This wasn't an administrative oversight but a policy choice. It is telling that Oregon didn't reverse course until the DOJ, under President Donald Trump, applied sustained and necessary pressure.

In September 2025, the Department of Justice sued Oregon and Maine for refusing to provide statewide voter registration records and list-maintenance data needed to enforce the National Voter Registration Act. It has since filed similar lawsuits against a growing roster of states that refused to cooperate and administer their rolls as the law requires, including Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Arizona, and Connecticut.

That pressure is necessary because the problem is national. The Electronic Registration Information Center, an interstate data-matching consortium that many states use to flag outdated registrations, shows how quickly voter rolls go stale. As of Dec. 31, 2025, it identified 13.9 million cross-state movers, nearly 30 million voters needing in-state address updates, 1.38 million duplicate registrations, and roughly 660,000 registrations tied to deceased people. 

Predictably, critics claim the DOJ is overreaching and that “election integrity” is code for voter suppression. It is equally arguable, and perhaps more plausible, that those who want to stop maintenance of voter rolls would like to use all the names that should not be on the lists for nefarious election practices. Anyway, voter roll maintenance is optional. The law requires states not only to make registration accessible, but also to keep lists accurate by removing voters who have moved, died, or become ineligible through uniform, nondiscriminatory procedures. That's not partisan. It's basic governance.

The dangers of bloated and inaccurate rolls are practical, immediate, and measurable. First, bad lists create administrative chaos. Election officials use registration databases to assign precincts, mail ballots or election materials, manage pollbooks, and process provisional ballots. When rolls are stuffed with outdated addresses, duplicates, or long-departed residents, election offices waste time and money chasing ghosts, including returned mail, undeliverable ballots, duplicated records, and mismatched precinct data. Every error increases the odds of Election Day confusion, longer lines, and more disputes.

Second, inaccurate rolls erode public trust, and trust is the true currency of democratic legitimacy. You don't need widespread fraud for elections to become politically unstable. You just need a system that looks sloppy. When registered voters outnumber the eligible population in a county, or when a state admits it has hundreds of thousands of inactive registrations it hasn't processed in nearly a decade, reasonable people conclude that something is broken. And they are right to conclude that it was deliberately broken, because the states failing to abide by the law have done so intentionally, not accidentally. Conspiracy theorists on both sides rush into the vacuum. Institutions lose credibility. The result is a downward spiral: less trust, more suspicion, more conflict, and ultimately less consent from the governed.

That is why election integrity should not be a partisan priority. It is a democratic necessity. The right to vote is sacred, and so is the public's right to know that elections are being run carefully, competently, and honestly. The foundation of trustworthy elections is not flashy technology or high-minded rhetoric — it is accurate records. A clean voter roll is the first line of defense against confusion, error, and cynicism.

EDITORIAL: THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S ENDGAME IS STILL AMNESTY

Oregon's announcement should be welcomed, but not romanticized. This wasn't a voluntary awakening. It was a response to pressure. And the lesson is obvious: pressure works.

The Department of Justice should keep it up. If states want the public to accept election outcomes peacefully and confidently, they must do the boring, essential work of maintaining accurate voter rolls. That is not suppression. That is stewardship. And the federal government should continue pushing every state, Oregon included, to do the right thing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

NASA astronauts landed safely back on Earth after a medical emergency forced them to head back early during a mission at the International Space Station.

NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke landed off the coast of San Diego at 3:41 a.m., alongside Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The landing marks the only time in the ISS's 25 years that a mission has been cut short due to a medical emergency.

“On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew-11,” mission controllers told the four-member crew of the SpaceX Dragon capsule as it splashed down.

George Alderman, NASA's deputy press secretary, said in a press conference after the landing that the four were in “good spirits,” and that the “crew member of concern is doing fine.”

“The crew spent more than 850 hours on scientific studies, including research about loss in microgravity and the long-term storage of cryogenic fluids in space with direct applications in medical and industrial fields. This work advanced our understanding of long-duration space flight and contributed valuable research that benefits life here on Earth and further human exploration,” he added. 

“To be overwhelmingly clear, crew 11 was a very successful mission,” Alderman continued, arguing that the emergency landing showcased NASA's readiness for all contingencies.

“Space Flight will always carry some degree of uncertainty, as is the nature of exploration. Fundamentally, it's why we're in space to learn. It's why NASA prepares for the unexpected, so we are ready to respond decisively and safely,” he said.

NASA, IN A RARE MOVE, CUTS SPACE STATION MISSION SHORT AFTER AN ASTRONAUT'S MEDICAL ISSUE

NASA maintained its secrecy regarding who had the medical emergency and what the medical emergency was, citing privacy concerns. Previously, NASA officials stressed that the issue wasn't an onboard emergency — Dr. James Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, said the agency was “erring on the side of caution for the crew member.”

Crew 11 arrived at the ISS in August for at least a six-month stay.

The nascent effort to contain the spread of anti-Semitism is years overdue.

At a Turning Point USA conference in December, the podcaster Ben Shapiro delivered a speech that was hailed as the sort of moral stand one rarely encounters in the age of polarization. Confronting the right's surging anti-Semitism, he denounced two of its most popular peddlers—Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens—by name. Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event the day before, Shapiro had called for “ideological border control,” a purge of the haters from the movement.

It was a brave foray into intramural politics, but also a damning self-indictment. Not so many years ago, Shapiro was guilty of the very thing he now decries. The Daily Wire, of which he is a co-founder and part owner, hired Owens in 2020. Even before she arrived, there were signs of where she was headed: “If Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine,” she had told a crowd in London in 2018. Shapiro's company ignored that and subsequent warnings. When Kanye West went on an anti-Semitic tear in 2022, Owens rushed to his defense: “It's like you cannot even say the word ‘Jewish' without people getting upset.”

That incident was the moment for border control. Shapiro refused. “We allow disagreement at The Daily Wire,” he said, “even when I think that some of my colleagues are wrong.” No wonder anti-Semitism crept toward the movement's mainstream.

For a time, it was possible for the Jewish intellectuals of MAGA—a small but influential set of podcasters, columnists, and theorists—to minimize anti-Semitism in the movement. But it's now so ubiquitous and so noxious that even they can't ignore it. Joel Pollak, the former editor in chief of Breitbart News, wrote on X in December that, until a few months before, he would have happily sent his children to a Turning Point USA event. Not anymore. “Now: why would I send them to one more place where Jewish kids have to defend who they are and what they believe?”

From the April 2024 issue: The Golden Age of American Jews is ending

But Pollak, Shapiro, and others were delusional in denying the problem for so long. They built careers inside a movement animated by fantasies about “globalists,” suspicions of hidden hands, and a yearning for national purity—an ideological combination that has never been particularly healthy for Jews. They lent their prestige to it anyway, certain that the hateful rhetoric was meant for someone else. Now that it has landed directly on them, they want credit for noticing the stench.

No case is sadder than the Israeli American political theorist Yoram Hazony—a Princeton and Rutgers graduate who ran a conservative think tank in Jerusalem, but saw Trump and the American right's bubbling hostility toward classical liberalism as his chance to break out on a larger stage. In 2018, he published The Virtue of Nationalism, not a flame-throwing manifesto so much as a homely defense of nationalism as the natural way to organize a polity—an argument he traced back to biblical times.

Hazony didn't just write about the revolt against liberalism; he became one of its leading impresarios. He convened regular gatherings of what he called the “National Conservatives,” a melange of theocrats and populists, and grasped for a new coalition that might provide the bedrock ideology of right-wing political parties throughout the Western world. Rising Republican politicians including J. D. Vance and Josh Hawley headlined these conferences, which, for several years, were the hottest tickets on the right.

Under the National Conservative banner, the right was swerving from classical liberalism to nationalism, away from the most American of American ideas: that the United States is held together by a creed rather than a bloodline. Hazony's movement didn't merely sneer at “wokeness”; it sneered at the pluralist project, articulated movingly by George Washington himself, that enabled Jews to flourish in the U.S. in the first place. Say what you will about the Enlightenment; at least it emancipated Jews.

While Hazony projected a mild image, his conferences were bombastic. When my colleague David Brooks attended one in 2021, he walked away gobsmacked by the “callousness, invocations of combat, and whiffs of brutality.” His dispatch from the conference was titled “The Terrifying Future of the American Right.”

Jewish history supplied a pretty good preview of what that terrifying future might look like. Four years after Brooks attended Hazony's conference, it has unmistakably arrived. Each week brings a new instance of anti-Semitism moving from the internet's febrile periphery into the conservative movement's mainstream. A leaked text chain from the New York Young Republicans included the line “Great. I love Hitler.” Tucker Carlson, arguably the movement's most popular personality, hosted Holocaust deniers on his show. Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation, rose to Carlson's defense by dismissing the host's critics as a “venomous coalition”—language that echoed old insinuations about a Jewish cabal pulling the strings. (Roberts eventually apologized.)

When Hazony convened the National Conservatives in September, he felt obliged to address the matter of surging anti-Semitism. He told the crowd that he'd been “pretty amazed by the depth of the slander of Jews as a people” online. Then he made what would surely count as one of the most naive statements ever offered at a political conference, at least if it could be judged sincere. “I didn't think it would happen on the right,” he said. “I was mistaken.”

But contained in his speech were clues that perhaps he wasn't as surprised as he claimed to be. For years, he said, he had defended his comrades against accusations of anti-Semitism. “It makes you really popular,” he said. “Everybody is really grateful: I'm the guy who defended them against absolutely false, ridiculous accusations of anti-Semitism.”

What did this long history of loyalty buy MAGA's Jewish intellectuals? Several days after Shapiro addressed the Turning Point USA conference, Vance took the same stage. Because of all the attention Shapiro's speech had received, Vance was compelled to address his concerns. But when the time came to evict Holocaust deniers and conspiracists from the movement, Vance chose a different path. He rejected “purity tests,” telling the crowd, “I didn't bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to deplatform.” Vance spectacularly failed Shapiro's moral test. And yet, Shapiro said nothing critical in response. He stayed silent, and evidently chose to preserve his relationship with the Republican Party's heir apparent. In other words, Shapiro failed the moral test he himself wrote.

Yair Rosenberg: J. D. Vance's bad answer to an anti-Semitic question

Despite all their bellyaching, the Jewish intellectuals of MAGA still hesitate to wage civil war or break ranks. After wringing his hands about anti-Semitism on the right, Hazony turned around and defended Roberts as he was besieged by accusations of anti-Semitism: “I'll never forget how the jackals circled, sniveling for blood,” Hazony said. Sniveling is an interesting choice of words, given all the feeble excuses that Hazony has made for his allies.

Hot spots around the globe mean a heightened risk that any retaliation succeeds.

Even with a nearly $1 trillion budget, the U.S. military can only do so much. Pentagon officials are privately warning that the United States may not be able to threaten Venezuela's regime, support protesters seeking to topple Iran's government, and protect its interests in the Asia-Pacific without being overstretched. The competing demands could heighten the risk to ground forces in the Middle East, who would be in the line of fire of any retaliation from Iran should President Trump decide to strike.

U.S. military commanders are used to having most of the assets they need to wage war. The cost of two decades in Afghanistan topped $2 trillion, to say nothing of Iraq and, more recently, Yemen, Iran, and Somalia. But the military faces an unusual problem: how to get the ships, munitions, and planes that were protecting U.S. forces in the Middle East—but are now in the Caribbean—back to the Middle East. The answer is probably that they can't have everything they want everywhere they would like.

In the weekslong run-up to the U.S. capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, the U.S. sent roughly 11 ships and submarines stationed near Venezuela, marking the biggest U.S. military footprint in the region since the Cuban missile crisis. Initially, the forces struck suspected drug boats, later stopped sanctioned oil tankers, and ultimately took custody of Maduro after Delta Forces snatched him while he was sleeping in Caracas. Many military assets came from the Middle East and have yet to leave the Western Hemisphere.

Until last fall, commanders in the Middle East could count on having an aircraft-carrier strike group nearby that was either in the Persian Gulf or could reach it quickly. Fighter jets can take off from a carrier and conduct strikes in defense of U.S. ground forces. Destroyers accompanying the carrier can shoot down enemy missiles bound for U.S. bases. Not this time. The USS Gerald R. Ford, which had been closest to the Middle East, left the shores of Europe last fall for the U.S. pressure campaign on Venezuela. It would take at least two weeks for the Ford to move back within range of the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, now the nearest carrier, is operating in the western Pacific and would likely take just a little less time to arrive. Based on Trump's latest statements, U.S. strikes in Iran no longer appear imminent. But he hasn't ruled them out.

Drones, tankers, and other flight assets also moved out of the Middle East for operations near Venezuela, defense officials told me. The capture of Maduro involved more than 150 planes and drones, according to the Pentagon. And although the administration is dangling economic carrots in front of Venezuela's transitional government, it also plans to keep its military sticks nearby, defense officials told me.

Enough U.S military power remains in the Middle East to launch a strike on Iran's security forces or even its nuclear program. But there may not be enough to defend U.S. troops from a regime that has repeatedly vowed to strike back at nearby U.S. assets and regional allies if it's attacked. Iran's theocratic regime may be all the more inclined if it feels that it is on its last legs. This morning, the U.S. military advised some personnel to leave their base in Qatar, describing the move as a precaution. Iran fired toward that base in June after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Other nearby bases are expected to make similar precautionary moves, U.S. defense officials told me. America's ability to protect its own troops is where the heavy demands on military assets could come into play.

“It's not carrying out the strike that we have to worry about. It's the Iranian response,” one former military commander who operated in the Middle East told me.

During the June strikes on Iran, the military sent bombers and other aircraft from the United States on a round-trip mission, roughly 37 hours in all. The USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group was operating nearby, and the USS Nimitz, another aircraft carrier, and its accompanying ships also arrived that month. Both are now at their home ports in the United States.

Trump began threatening a new U.S. military response on January 2, as Iran cracked down on protesters who'd first flooded the streets five days earlier. But the Pentagon has yet to execute a surge of fighter jets, bombers, tankers, and drones toward the Middle East.

Should the U.S. quickly fly planes toward the region, they could be there in as little as 16 hours. Trump wrote on Truth Social on January 2 that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.” He added, “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.” Since that post, reports have emerged that at least 2,400 protesters have been killed and as many as 18,000 detained. Trump raised the ante last night during an interview with CBS News, threatening to “take very strong action” if Iranian authorities begin hanging anti-government protesters this week. By midday today, he said that he had it on “good authority” that Iran would not conduct executions.

As soon as any president begins discussing the use of military force, Pentagon planners start coming up with options should the president ask for them. Under this administration, such threats, usually made via social media, come so frequently that nearly every combatant commander has had to draft such a plan. The Trump administration has also discussed attacking Greenland, possibly helping Ukraine in the face of Russia's unwillingness to strike a deal, and preparing to defend Taiwan in the event of Chinese aggression. The U.S. National Defense Strategy, which helps the Pentagon set its priorities, was supposed to be published by now but has not been. So the military has no specific doctrine to follow.

“That's a lot of theaters at the same time, and we are not built to do that,” a U.S. defense official explained to me.

Read: Is the Iranian regime about to collapse?

U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East, presented options roughly a week after the president's initial statements about using U.S. military force in Iran. Those options included military strikes and nonmilitary options, including cyberattacks. But the Pentagon also asked for the administration to outline U.S. objectives for any military strikes. Many U.S. military officials believe that Iranians most need restoration of their internet, which military strikes would not achieve. Centcom revised its options earlier this week as the president called for Iran to cancel any planned executions, defense officials told me.

Several types of protections are in place for U.S. forces in the region, just not as many as the U.S. military may want. They include ground-based interceptors, which can shoot down missiles aimed at U.S. military bases in the region, as well as at least three destroyers that could deploy, defense officials told me.

The administration is facing pressure from its allies to not strike for different reasons. Turkey has publicly called for negotiations. And according to a Wall Street Journal report, Iran's Arab rivals—Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar—are urging restraint out of fear that attempts to overthrow the regime could rattle oil markets and disrupt the global economy.

Regardless of whether the United States conducts strikes in Iran, the Trump administration's push to intervene militarily in multiple parts of the world could lead to another kind of financial pressure, in this case on the American taxpayer. Last week, the president announced that he would ask Congress for a $1.5 trillion Pentagon budget.

States don't often prosecute federal officers, but they can.

As often happens, Stephen Miller gave the locker-room talk, which was, more or less: No one can stop us. Back in October, when Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker objected to having more federal immigration officers in his state, the deputy chief of staff and dominant West Wing voice had a message in response.

“ To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties, and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony,” he said on Fox News.

After the ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed the protester Renee Good, the administration stuck to that message. It declined to open an investigation into the shooting, and said it would be sending hundreds more ICE officers into the state; then it pushed to instead initiate an investigation into Renee Good's widow. The we-have-your-back attitude, says our staff writer Nick Miroff, who covers immigration, undoubtedly emboldens ICE. It sends “a signal to continue to do what they're doing, to not give any ground to protesters or to public officials in Minnesota,” Nick says.

But is Miller correct? Are ICE agents in fact immune? Can anyone hold them accountable? The federal government may have the officers' backs, but state laws have jurisdiction too, and Minnesota is so far not ceding to the administration's wishes.

This week, six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned reportedly because of the Justice Department's push to investigate Good's widow, but not Ross. States and the federal government have historically fought over holding each other's agents accountable, and states have not always lost.

In this week's episode, we talk to Bryna Godar, an attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. She studies the power that states have to hold federal officers such as Ross accountable. And we ask Miroff whether ICE is expanding beyond immigration enforcement, turning Homeland Security into an openly political entity that welcomes clashes with American citizens.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Minneapolis remains tense this week. People are out on the streets clashing with ICE agents. Social media is full of a new kind of video: federal agents not out arresting undocumented immigrants, but getting into physical confrontations with American citizens, sometimes on otherwise quiet suburban streets.

[Music]

Rosin: One video circulating this week showed a masked ICE agent shoving a Minneapolis city councilman into the street.

(Whistles blare.)

Protester 1: Yo! Yo! What the fuck are you doing?

Protester 2: Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

Rosin: The protests come, of course, after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed an unarmed protester, Renee Good, in her car. And they've grown dramatically with the Trump administration's response to the shooting, which has been no Department of Justice investigation, no sense of accountability or even discussion of accountability.

In fact, the administration has reflexively defended the shooter and dismissed Good as “highly disrespectful” and committing an “act of domestic terrorism.” And then the administration is sending hundreds more officers into the city to double down on their mission, which leaves citizens everywhere asking, Have we reached the point where a federal agent can shoot an unarmed American citizen and we just continue on with the program?

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Today: Will there be justice, or will things only get worse?

Back in October, as Illinois leaders pushed back on the immigration deployment in their state, [President Donald] Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, had this message on Fox News.

Stephen Miller (on Fox News):  To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties, and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one—no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator, or domestic insurrectionist—can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.

[Music]

Rosin: Miller's message—that you can operate with impunity, even against Americans—suggests that maybe the role of ICE is evolving. Could Homeland Security be turning into an openly political entity that welcomes clashes with American citizens? We'll talk about that in the second half of the show.

But first, there is another important authority in the mix: the state of Minnesota, which seems not to be falling in line with the administration's program.

This week, six federal prosecutors in Minnesota reportedly resigned because the Justice Department pushed to investigate Good's widow, but not the ICE agent who shot Good.

Bryna Godar: I think this does mark a significant shift for the country and is potentially setting up an escalating conflict between states and the federal government in a way that we haven't seen in a long time.

Rosin: That is Bryna Godar, an attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Godar studies the power that states have to hold federal officers, like ICE agent Ross, accountable.

I started by asking her about Stepehen Miller's claim: that they were immune.

Rosin (in interview): Is that a real thing? Do federal officers have this kind of immunity that he's describing?

Godar: They do not have immunity that is that broad. Federal officers do have some immunity, but it is not absolute immunity for things that they do on the job. They still have to comply with federal laws. They still have to act in a reasonable way in carrying out their duties and not violate people's rights.

Rosin: If Minnesota decides they wanna charge this specific shooter with a crime, and the federal government has already decided he didn't do anything wrong, what happens? How does that unfold?

[Music]

Godar: So the state—or in this case, it would likely be Hennepin County prosecutors—could file criminal charges against the officer involved if they think they have enough evidence there. And then that officer would likely claim federal immunity and try to get the case moved to federal court and try to get the charges thrown out based on claims of federal immunity.

And from there, it would just depend on what the federal court decided, of whether the case could proceed. And if it did, then state and local prosecutors would go ahead and take that case to trial in federal court for a state-law crime.

Rosin: So this is a gray area. It's like, there's a lot of details to be hashed out—

Godar: Yes.

Rosin: —in a situation like this. Right. And is it the kind of thing that would get adjudicated for years, or is it fairly clear—they put out a warrant for the shooter's arrest? How does it unfold, in general?

Godar: We have seen some cases take years to resolve on this immunity issue. For example, the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident, where a federal sniper shot and killed an unarmed woman. That took place in 1992, and it wasn't until 2001 that the Ninth Circuit ultimately ruled that that case could go ahead and that that officer didn't necessarily have immunity from the state criminal prosecution in that.

So these are not easy cases, and I don't wanna overstate the ability of states to win these cases. We have seen repeatedly that federal courts will throw out charges if the federal courts think that the officer is acting reasonably and carrying out their federal duties in a reasonable way.

But states have succeeded in getting these cases to trial in cases where the facts were sufficiently disputed, and the federal court agreed that it wasn't clear that the officer was acting with lawful force. So that's really the big hurdle here, is if the state can show that there is enough question around the reasonableness of this officer's actions in order to get over that immunity hurdle.

Rosin: Right, and as you've watched the administration respond to this particular case, have you seen them kind of preempt some of these arguments? 'Cause they're speaking in very specific language about force, the correct use of force, all this kind of stuff.

Godar: This administration is, first of all, trying to say that states don't even have the power to bring these types of cases, which is just flatly wrong based on this long history of states bringing this exact type of case. And the federal government is definitely trying to spin the narrative in a certain way so that the officer would be able to more easily claim immunity.

But it's important to note that this would ultimately be a decision in federal court, and it wouldn't be the federal-administration officials who have been speaking about this being the ones who are making that determination.

Rosin: Right. So they can spin a public narrative, but it doesn't necessarily affect or determine what happens in the actual courts.

Godar: Exactly.

Rosin: I guess I have a fundamental question, which is: Why is the law designed this way? Why is it important for states to be able to hold the federal government accountable in certain cases?

Godar: Yeah, so this idea of dual sovereignty and the checks and balances that come with that is baked into how our country is designed. So at the founding, there was this idea that, if the federal government overstepped on people's rights, the states would be there to check the federal government and vice versa. And that was really seen as foundational to protecting people's rights and guarding against tyranny and abuse from the federal government or state governments.

Throughout history, these cases have come up most frequently during periods of more friction between the states and the federal government.

[Music]

Godar: Some of the times where we've seen this come up include the Prohibition era, where there was pretty intense and violent federal enforcement of prohibition laws, and states were charging federal officers with violating various state criminal laws, like manslaughter, murder, assault, in carrying out those actions.

Other times, we've seen states more actively pushing back on the enforcement of federal laws, such as when the Fugitive Slave Act was in existence. We saw a number of states, including Wisconsin, charging U.S. marshals with kidnapping for capturing previously enslaved people. And in some of those cases, the federal courts were quite quick to throw out those charges because the federal officers were acting lawfully under federal law, but the states were nevertheless using that as a tool to push back on those federal actions.

And then, conversely, we saw during periods of desegregation some states pushing back on federal government efforts to integrate schools and enforce desegregation policies.

Rosin: So I have heard the administration put out statements to state officials sort of warning them against taking state action.

Godar: Yes, there have been multiple statements from federal officials threatening to charge state and local officials who are considering charges against federal officers, to charge them with federal crimes like obstruction, harboring aliens, conspiring to impede federal officers, or seditious conspiracy. We've seen these from U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as Stephen Miller and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

These statements really upend the traditional dynamic in these cases, where it's typically up to the federal courts to decide whether a state is overstepping in its prosecution, and that's the check and balance that we have in this system.

I think the goal of these threats is to stop state and local officials from pursuing these types of cases, and I think it's possible that federal officials could follow up on those threats. I think it's highly unlikely that they would ultimately succeed in court if state and local officials are really just carrying out their jobs, but that doesn't mean that federal officials couldn't try to bring those cases.

Rosin: It's interesting because, with law-enforcement actions, at least most recently, it's been the opposite: It's been federal government putting pressure on states to hold local police departments accountable, like in George Floyd's death, for example. And now we have this inversion: The state's trying to put a check on federal officers. How does that inversion change the power dynamic here?

Godar: I think one difficult aspect of it is that it's not something that we are super familiar with in recent decades. And so I think it's just unfamiliar to people that states actually have this power and have this role and that that is a proper role for states to play.

And then I think the other way it impacts it is that there are dynamics about the investigation process that are flipped, where instead of concerns about a state withholding information from federal investigators, that is now flipped as well, where there's concerns about federal investigators withholding information from state investigators.

Rosin: Looking back at the history, is there a case, a moment, an instance, which gives you hope about this situation, where something or someone or some state has risen to the occasion in a way that we can look to now and think, Oh, that's the model?

Godar: There are several cases where federal courts have recognized that federal officers do not have absolute immunity and that, even where the facts are sufficiently disputed, the case can go ahead, so I would specifically point to the U.S. Supreme Court deciding in a 1906 case where two federal soldiers shot and killed a man who they believed was stealing from federal property.

And we've seen this in other cases too, where if the facts are sufficiently in dispute and there's a version of them that seems to suggest that the officer was just not acting reasonably, those cases can go ahead. Even if the officer ultimately wins at trial, that immunity step, I think, is really important for getting the case over that hurdle and to a trial, and recognizing that it doesn't have to be that the facts are all predetermined. It can be enough that there is this debate over what the officer did was reasonable.

Rosin: I think what's challenging about this particular moment is that the federal government didn't just forego investigating whether the shooting was justified; now they seem to be opening an investigation into Becca Good, the widow of Renee Good. So what do you make of all that—the federal government's just absolute, definitive stance?

Godar: It is really unprecedented to see that type of extreme defense of an officer before watching the whole process play out and gathering all the facts.

[Music]

Godar: And I think it is a point that really underscores how important it is to have states protecting their residents as well, because if you have one level of government failing at that and violating people's rights, you really would not have an option if you didn't have the state there. And so I think this really highlights the importance of that role, and I think seeing if that actually is going to be an effective method of accountability is really important for the future of the country.

Rosin: Well, Bryna, thank you so much for explaining this all to us and its implications.

Godar: Thank you for having me.

Rosin: So in short, no, federal agents, such as ICE officers, do not have absolute immunity—despite what the Trump administration says. States can prosecute federal officers, although we're not used to seeing that lately, and it sounds like it's a long road.

So does the average ICE officer on the streets of Minneapolis think they're immune? And how does that affect their behavior?

After the break, we go inside the Department of Homeland Security. We talk to Nick Miroff, Atlantic staff writer who covers immigration. That's in a minute.

[Break]

Rosin: Nick, welcome back to the show.

Nick Miroff: Good to be back with you.

Rosin: So it's already been an eventful year for ICE and DHS, and then came last week.

Hours after Renee Good was killed, we all saw those videos circulating about the shooting, and instead of the usual pledges to investigate that we would expect, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the shooting, called Good's actions an “act of domestic terrorism.”

For someone who's followed these agencies for years, what did you make of the administration's response to what happened?

Miroff: I think it's a sign of the knee-jerk defensive posture that they are in. It goes hand in hand with the aggressive deployment of these officers and agents in these cities, with marching orders to—let's think about the “F around and find out” ethos of our foreign-policy adventures in the current moment.

[Music]

Miroff: I think it's also being applied in a domestic context, and there is a diminishing patience with public pushback, with protest tactics—

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem: —and when a mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began—

Miroff: —with the idea that officers and agents are gonna be restrained and are gonna try to avoid engaging directly with the protests.

Noem: —this appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents.

Miroff: And so when she immediately leapt to defend Officer Ross's decisions—

Noem: An act of domestic terrorism.

Miroff: —I saw that as an eagerness to both send a kind of political signal to the president's base, but also a signal to the broader DHS workforce, which includes ICE, that this White House and this administration is basically gonna defend you no matter what you do.

Rosin: So that's the administration's position. What are you hearing from people at ICE and DHS? Are they leaning into this fight? Are they with the administration, either at the leadership level or rank and file? Can you tell?

Miroff: Well, these videos were like a Rorschach test for the country and our politics, and it's not surprising that that's also true within the ICE workforce, though it's not like I've done a broad poll, but I have tried to ask almost everybody I can think of what they saw.

And it ranges from—I've had very senior ICE officials, who are not softies by any means, tell me that this was just straight-up murder, and that Officer Ross was way out of line and needs to be held accountable in a way that sends a real signal to the rest of the workforce.

But I think that—I would say that, to generalize, most of the ICE officials that I heard from had a kind of a more nuanced view and felt like, once that vehicle was coming at Officer Ross, that he could be found to have made a reasonable decision to fire in self-defense, and that most of the people I spoke to said that he made a very risky decision and putting himself in front of that vehicle with its engine on was inherently dangerous.

And some of the folks I spoke to have heard that he, within the Minneapolis field office, had had a reputation for being really, like, gung ho—one person put it euphemistically: that he was very “enthusiastic” about his job. But he was a guy who was clearly highly trained and was really doing his job aggressively. The incident in June, in which he was very seriously injured, similarly involved taking some risks, some tactics that are generally discouraged. In this case, he was stopping this individual, and he shattered the window, and then he reached into the vehicle, and he ends up getting dragged and all cut up on his arm.

It's not hard to think that that incident must have played into his mindset when he was approaching Good, but it's like, if you've had that happen to you recently, to go and stand in front of a vehicle like that again is a very dangerous posture to take.

Rosin: Before you knew anything about the shooter, before we even knew his name, would you have guessed it was one of the new recruits? 'Cause you've written a lot about how ICE has tried to staff up quickly. Were you surprised to learn that this was actually a veteran officer?

Miroff: I was surprised. My first thought was, like, Oh, wow. Is this one of the new hires that they just rushed through the academy? And so to see that Officer Ross is not only, like, a 10-year veteran of ICE, he's a member of the Special Response Team, which is their tactical unit that's the most highly trained, so they are trained to be in more confrontational and riskier situations—he's not, like, some case officer who's been pushed out onto the street with a gun and is out of their element. He is used to being in tense, confrontational situations like this. He would've practiced these kinds of scenarios many times.

And before that, he was a Border Patrol agent. He was an Iraq War veteran. This is a guy who's been in military or law-enforcement services his entire career and has had to go through any number of training exercises in which use-of-force policies would be addressed.

Rosin: So how do you make sense of that? The Minneapolis chief of police, recently, when he was criticizing ICE's actions, referred to that June injury to Officer Ross and whether the agency was making sure he wouldn't behave unsafely in similar situations. So that's maybe one theory out there about what happened. Do you have another theory? You just described him as kind of prepared.

Miroff: The interpretation that makes sense to me, that I've discussed with some sources—who are just, again, don't have actual information about the investigation, but are observing, trying to formulate a version of what could have happened based on the videos—is that they were preparing to maybe arrest Renee Good and her partner for obstruction.

[Music, followed by siren blaring]

Miroff: And so you see that he pulls out his phone, and he's going around the vehicle recording her license plate.

Becca Good (in video of her encounter with Jonathan Ross): It's okay. We don't change our plates every morning, just so you know.

Miroff: And then, at the moment when he seems to sort of complete the circumnavigation of the vehicle, that's when she's simultaneously hearing from her partner to drive—

Good: Drive, baby! Drive! Drive!

Miroff: —grabbing the passenger-side handle, while you have another ICE officer approaching, telling her to get the F out of the car.

ICE officer: Out of the car. Get out of the fucking car.

Miroff: And then she starts turning the wheel and hits the gas, and it's impossible to know, was he looking at his phone? What was he looking at, right? And all of that is gonna come out in the investigation.

But I think these things are entirely split-second decisions, and he, based on what we've seen from the video, seemed like he was pretty antagonized and was in a pretty aggressive mindset, based on just his conduct in the 40-odd seconds.

So it's really gonna come down to: Was it a reasonable decision to start to open fire once that vehicle was rolling? And so, again, a lot of the ICE officers I've talked to about this think it probably was. And we could end up where—

Rosin: Was or wasn't?

Miroff: It was.

Rosin: Uh-huh.

Miroff: You could end up with a kind of situation where he will be faulted for putting himself in a dangerous situation, but he wouldn't be held criminally liable for killing Renee Good, because the vehicle was coming at him and he had a reasonable fear that he could be killed or injured.

Rosin: So there's the details of this case, and then there's the administration's response, which is a reflexive defense of this officer. And then there's this week, in which things seem to be amping up in Minneapolis. We've seen videos of ICE agents breaking a car window, shoving a city councilman. How do you think the administration response is affecting how ICE officers are behaving on the streets? Does it embolden them? Are they worried? What's your sense of that?

Miroff: I think it emboldens them. I think when they see other administration officials with this kind of unqualified defense of whatever they're doing, and an investigation that is trying to criminalize Renee Good and her partner, turning the focus of the attention to them, I think that that undoubtedly sends a signal to continue to do what they're doing, to not give any ground to protesters or to public officials in Minnesota.

And what we saw in Chicago in the late summer and fall was not dissimilar.

[Music]

Miroff: They shot and killed a guy who wouldn't comply with their orders in his car.

News anchor (from NBC Chicago): It happened during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the man resisted arrest and dragged the officer—

Miroff: They shot a protester, Marimar Martinez, who was in her vehicle, five times—

News anchor (from ABC 7 Chicago): The Department of Homeland Security says the woman was one of several people using their vehicles to box in agents—

Miroff: —and then tried to charge her with a federal crime, ultimately dropping the charges.

But, again, we saw protesters and agents and officers in these intense confrontations in the street. We saw them pulling their guns. We saw them shooting people. But once the evidence made its way into courtrooms, and it started to go badly for the administration, the administration kind of pulled back.

And we're at the stage right now where it's too early to say what their response will be once evidence involving this shooting and other incidents is introduced into court. But it doesn't seem like this administration is gonna back down from street-level protests or from public officials in Minneapolis dropping F-bombs at press conferences.

Rosin: Okay, so we spoke to an attorney, who told us that, despite the federal government saying, We have your back, it's not actually true; states can prosecute ICE officers, or they have some tools to do that. What do you think the rank-and-file ICE officers believe? Do you think they believe they're immune? Do they know this?

Miroff: I don't know. I've heard that, but what is an example of a state successfully prosecuting a federal law-enforcement officer in recent years based on a use-of-force incident of this kind? Everybody I asked about this told me that these cases are transferred into federal court and that it's extremely rare for state or local jurisdictions to successfully bring charges against a federal law-enforcement officer accused of wrongdoing while in the course of their duties.

Rosin: So I guess there's two things here. It's definitely possible, but maybe it hasn't happened in recent history, so it's not prime in their minds. The bigger thing, though, is the things that you're describing—me, as an average citizen, I look at ICE; I think, Oh, ICE had a mandate to find undocumented immigrants. What you and I are talking about here is: ICE shot an American citizen, or ICE going after an American citizen. That is very, very, very different. Do you see it as different? Do you see ICE as evolving into a very different role than what it initially started as or what one would think ICE is?

Miroff: Absolutely. Just to be clear, there is no precedent for what we're seeing right now, where the Border Patrol and ICE officers are in the streets of American cities, in neighborhoods, pulling cars over, confronting protesters, zooming around in unmarked cars with masks on. This is just not what these agencies were created to do.

And so at the root of all of this is the Trump administration's quest for a million deportations a year, a mass-deportation campaign that is going to happen in this episodic, rolling basis in blue, Democratic-run cities, and a desire to have imagery of confrontation in which they can have this political fight over immigration, the future of this country, left-wing protesters, have all of these things play out on social media, on television. I think that they think it is winning politics for them, and I think that they think that this is winning policy for them. This is what Stephen Miller has been building up to his entire political career.

We didn't see it on this kind of level in the first Trump administration, because there were checks, there were safeguards, the border was still the focus. But now that the border is basically closed, and all of the energy and the resources and attention are on this deportation campaign, these confrontations are what they've been building up to for a long time.

Rosin: So where this goes—Trump is not gonna be president forever. It does feel right now like the Department of Homeland Security has become much more openly political than we're used to a federal department being. So do the DHS people worry about what happens when Trump is not in office?

Miroff: So this is something that I'm writing about this week. And I think that the main takeaway is that the Department of Homeland Security has gotten way off of its foundational mission.

[Music]

Miroff: But at the core of it is this unresolved conflict in our politics and our country about immigration enforcement, and the role of immigration and immigrants in American society. And there are two completely divergent visions right now that are clashing in a way we've never seen.

Rosin: Thank you, Nick. Thanks for joining us.

Miroff: My pleasure. Always good to be with you.

Why Catholics could be the key to Trump's opposition.

Donald Trump's second administration has been a reckoning for America, and perhaps especially for America's Christians. From the deployment of masked paramilitary thugs to enforce immigration policy to the full-throated assault on transgender Americans to an unrelenting campaign against the rights of women and girls, reactionary Christianity is riding high. This agenda pursued by the administration has been made possible through 50 years of campaigning by the religious right, a coalition of white evangelical Protestants, conservative Catholics, and conservative Eastern Orthodox Christians and Jews that formed the core of the late 20th- and early 21st-century Republican Party.

But in this season of their triumph, a genuine faith-based opposition is finally beginning to break through.

The evidence of religious resistance first emerged on Inauguration Day. During the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral, Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, DC, stared down from the pulpit at the new president and told him in a sturdy voice:

Let me make one final plea, Mr. President. … In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.

These words, a public reminder that there is diversity within the Christian tradition with respect to political opinion, were only the beginning. The Episcopal Church has since ended its relationship with the US government's refugee resettlement services over the administration's controversial decision to admit Afrikaners as refugees.

There appeared to be some coalition-building when a dozen or so religious organizations sued the administration over new policies that gave immigration officials more latitude in making arrests in and around houses of worship. And, in July, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Sean Rowe, penned an op-ed at Religion News Service with the headline: “Once the church of presidents, the Episcopal Church must now be an engine of resistance.”

Yet all of this is happening within some of the most liberal denominations in the country. These are also denominations that have been in demographic decline for decades, and only 11 percent of the American public identifies with the mainline Protestant traditions. This is hardly encouraging for the possibility of a mainstream political movement or resistance.

Enter American Catholicism, a group that may redefine the role religion has played in politics and public life.

The political power of the religious right depended in large part on religious conservatives agreeing to adopt the GOP's positions on issues such as labor rights, immigration, environmental regulation, and even taxes. In exchange, the Republican Party embraced their reactionary consensus on certain social issues, largely related to gender and sexuality. First came opposition to abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment, later to marriage for same-sex couples, and today to transgender inclusion.

To understand why the compromise made sense for both sides, it is important to remember the seminal role that race, and particularly the civil rights movement, played in forming the religious right. The end of segregation in public schools galvanized white evangelical Southerners to reenter politics in the early 1970s. The first allies they found — allies that made them a national and not a regional force — were second-generation immigrants, whose parents had come to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century from southern and eastern Europe (and Ireland). These groups were, by a large margin, Catholic.

Upon their arrival, these immigrants had not been considered “white.” After growing up largely in ethnic neighborhoods in northern cities like New York and Chicago, the children of these early 20th-century immigrants found economic prosperity in the post-World War II boom and through government programs such as the GI Bill. The only thing they now lacked was admission into the top tier of America's racial hierarchy. The alliance with white evangelicals provided just that. For example, in the battles over school busing, white evangelicals — and the national media — publicly framed Catholics as fellow defenders of white neighborhood schools, treating them not as foreign outsiders but as part of a unified white Christian community.

These founding foot soldiers of the religious right sought to slow social progress and turn back the clock on integration, and they were willing to trade away the economic policies that had brought them affluence.

The shared concern of evangelicals and Catholic “ethnics,” once very antagonistic American groups, was what we now euphemistically call “cultural anxiety,” a reaction to a rapidly changing and racially integrating society. Anyone surprised that the children of not-quite-white immigrants would join with white Southerners against Black progress must remember that racial tensions between newly arrived immigrants and Black Americans in northern cities were among the most intense conflicts in early 20th century America. The idea of Black Americans being able to replicate the rapid rise of the “newly white” was just as unacceptable to many of the descendents of these immigrants as it was for white Southerners, even if for different reasons.

These founding foot soldiers of the religious right sought to slow social progress and turn back the clock on integration, and they were willing to trade away the economic policies that had brought them affluence. For a Republican Party that had long been shunned by these voters, the chance to win them was worth abandoning its once-enlightened, patrician stance on matters of personal conduct. The party that had once championed women's suffrage and abolition, and tolerated reproductive rights, turned its back on all of that for this new base.

It should go without saying that Christians are incredibly politically diverse. After all, there are over 2 billion Christians in the world, roughly a third of all human beings and 62 percent of Americans. If Christians all agreed on every public matter, politics as a competition of ideas would simply cease to exist in a number of countries. But the success of the religious right has been so complete that their particular brand of reactionary Christianity has come to dominate the “Christian” label itself. In a strange way, conservative Catholics, through their alliance with evangelicals, ended up with more influence over public perception of Catholic teaching than the pope himself. But it was always a marriage where the threat of divorce lingered over the dinner table.

For evangelicals, the gravitational center of the religious right, the grand compromise with the GOP was almost effortless. For Catholics, even the ones who eventually embraced it, the bargain was far messier, more conflicted, and never fully secure.

While the politics of evangelical Christians is by nature fluid and divided, Catholicism inherently demands greater ethical uniformity. And during the period in which the religious right was taking shape, Catholic social teaching was evolving in a direction that made this alliance particularly fraught.

Since the middle of the 20th century, Catholic ethics globally has been increasingly concerned with poor people, with migrants, and with the responsibility of governments to provide justice to those on the margins. As the decades wore on, the Vatican's teachings on social and economic justice were increasingly out of step with the GOP platform on almost every issue except abortion and marriage for same-sex couples. Catholic participation in the politics of the American religious right therefore relied on a certain level of inconsistency. The very people who demanded that Catholic, pro-abortion rights politicians such as Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi be denied communion often ignored Church teaching on the death penalty, the treatment of poor people, and immigration.

Importantly, the tension between the two traditions is not only one of abstract ideals. It also reflects the different demographics of their communities. Roman Catholicism in America is far more racially and ethnically diverse than evangelical Christianity, which might be why the strident xenophobia of some white evangelicals is harder for American Catholics to embrace.

The simple fact is that changing demographics mean Catholics are being disproportionately affected by Trump's draconian policies.

As a whole, Catholicism is increasingly concentrated in the Global South, with 72 percent of the world's Catholics living in Latin America, Asia, or Africa. In the United States, it is increasingly a religion of new arrivals. A hundred years ago, immigrants to America came mostly from southern and eastern Europe, but that is no longer so. As a result of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, over the past 60 years, the largest share of immigrants coming to the United States are now arriving from Latin America and Asia. Of course, Latin America remains overwhelmingly Catholic (even in the face of recent declines), and, coincidentally, the two largest East Asian countries sending immigrants to the United States after China are Vietnam and the Philippines, both of which have substantial Catholic populations.

These trends mean that, today, there are over 53 million adult Catholics in the United States, or approximately 20 percent of all Americans. While 70 percent of American evangelicals are white, just over half of American Catholics are. Notably, 40 percent of American Catholics are Latino. And while 12 percent of American evangelicals were born outside the United States, 29 percent of American Catholics were.

These Catholics, who are the present and future of the Catholic Church, are more likely to be someone, or know someone in their faith community, who is adversely affected by the MAGA paradigm. Plus, today's American Catholics are more likely to feel solidarity with those in the Global South, because they are more likely to have familial ties there. For them, issues like immigration and foreign aid are often matters of life and death.

The simple fact is that changing demographics mean Catholics are being disproportionately affected by Trump's draconian policies. Support and even silence are no longer a tenable position for the Catholic hierarchy and for an increasing number of Catholics, no matter how politically conservative they may be. Will they be loyal to their fellow Catholics or will they be auxiliary members of the new MAGA faith?

Remember that the original religious right offered their Catholic allies the promise of whiteness. Given the obvious historical parallel, one might think that a continuation of the alliance would allow newly arrived Latin American and Asian Catholics to benefit from the same deal that Italian and Polish Americans enjoyed.

But today's Catholics are not being made such an offer by politically ambitious evangelicals, who are much more concerned with immigration as an absolute evil than their forebearers were. Instead, anti-immigrant rhetoric occupies a more prominent place in America's nationalist discourse than at any time since the 1920s.

In the end, American evangelical Christianity is malleable to the cultural and political demands of the United States in any given historical moment. But Catholicism is different. The faith is ancient, its practice global, its people profoundly diverse, and its intellectual tradition one of growth and debate.

All this makes Catholicism a wild card in the shifting landscape of American alliances. And just as the alliance of evangelicals and conservative Catholics made the religious right, a new alliance of mainline Protestants and progressive and centrist Catholics could make a durable religious left. If this happens at the same time that enough conservative Catholics conclude that the compromises demanded by MAGA — especially on issues like immigration — are simply too much to accept, then American Catholicism may present a very different public face. And it will not be the ultra-conservative image promoted by the Catholic League and other auxiliaries of the religious right.

We may already be seeing the early outlines of such a transformation.

The pope from Chicago's South Side may be the greatest symbol of that new alliance. Perhaps never before has a Pope challenged a US president as directly as Pope Leo XIV has Donald Trump.

”Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked…how did you receive the foreigner?” Leo, the first American-born pontiff, said in November, directly addressing the Trump administration's immigration policies. “… And I think that there's a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what's happening.“ These remarks are part of escalating criticism from the pope, which has strongly condemned the ”vilification” of immigrants, a not-so-subtle nod to the terror unfolding on the streets of many American cities

For the first time in decades, there is space to imagine a genuine, nonpartisan, faith-based opposition to the religious right and its even more extreme successor in the MAGA faith. 

Leo's words have been followed by deeds. The first American bishop appointed by the new pope is Bishop Michael Pham, the child of Vietnamese refugees. Pham will head the Diocese of San Diego, which has been among those worst affected by Trump's war on immigrants. Pham has, in turn, been among the clergy who have attended immigration court hearings in support of those caught in the web of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And in December, Leo announced the replacement of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the head of the New York Archdiocese and one of the most powerful and vocal proponents of a political ultra-conservative Catholicism. The new bishop, Ronald A. Hicks, is in many ways Dolan's opposite and is widely known as a defender of immigrant communities.

This shift has broken part of the religious right's spell. The idea that holding certain GOP- or MAGA-approved political views is synonymous with taking the “Christian” position is no longer tenable. The rhetoric once used to shame pro-abortion rights Catholics like Biden and Pelosi can now be applied equally to anti-immigrant Catholics such as Vice President JD Vance and Steve Bannon. After all, the pope has declared that support for immigrants and opposition to the death penalty are essential parts of a truly “pro-life” ethic. The tolerance for the old hypocrisy that made the religious right possible may be at an end.

It's true that some of the most reactionary Catholics in America, including Bannon, have rejected the papal intervention. Vance, American Catholicism's most high-profile convert — who like many converts has a much more conservative political and theological outlook than many cradle Catholics — has tried to brush aside papal criticism.

But Leo is the pope. And his increasingly strong stance on the dignity of immigrants demands that some American Catholics choose between obedience to the Church and loyalty to the Republican Party. For the first time in decades, there is space to imagine a genuine, nonpartisan, faith-based opposition to the religious right and its even more extreme successor in the MAGA faith.

As in the movement's original formation, any new coalition will require compromise, perhaps especially on issues related to gender and sexuality. But hurdles do not put such a deal off the table. The Catholic Church, internationally, is undeniably moving more toward the American mainline Protestant position on such issues and away from an increasingly hardline American evangelical perspective. And American Catholics have always had more diverse political views on these issues than their evangelical counterparts. This is to say, for a new coalition to form, compromise would be necessary but not impossible.

The religious right has defined American Christianity for half a century, reshaping politics, theology, and culture in its own image. But as Trump's second administration pushes the coalition into increasingly extreme territory, new cracks are appearing. Mainline Protestants, though diminished, are asserting themselves, and Catholics are showing signs of resistance, a resistance that might even lead them into a new coalition. And if the history of the religious right teaches us anything, it is Catholics who are the key. A new faith-based opposition is still fragile, but if it can form, it could redefine both American Christianity and American politics.

One of Zohran Mamdani's most expensive ideas has surprising early momentum.﻿

It looked like one of Zohran Mamdani's most ambitious promises.

Between a $6 billion price tag and the complexity of hiring and training potentially thousands of educators, the mayoral candidate's proposal to offer universal child care in New York City drew widespread skepticism during last year's campaign. Though 71 percent of likely voters supported the proposal in one poll, only about 50 percent thought he could actually get it done. Annie Lowrey at The Atlantic wrote that it “would require a mammoth tax hike that Albany would need to approve, which it has shown no interest in doing.”

But barely a week into Mamdani's term, he appeared with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul at a Brooklyn YMCA to announce a plan to expand care for nearly 100,000 children, backed by a $4.5 billion commitment to fund the program.

“I've been working on the issues for a couple of decades, and I can count on one hand the times in which a room and announcement was filled with so much support, and, frankly, optimism,” Raysa Rodriguez, executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a Manhattan-based advocacy group, told me.

It's perhaps the clearest sign yet that the politics of child care have changed, with taxpayer-funded initiatives, once dismissed as socialist pipe dreams or even assaults on the American family, now finding support across the political spectrum.

“Mamdani caught child care as it is starting to have a real moment,” Elliot Haspel, a family policy expert and senior fellow at the think tank Capita, told me.

It's not just New York. New Mexico made headlines last year as the first state to announce free, universal child care. Red states from Montana to Kentucky have also expanded their offerings. Even President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill included increased funding for child care, though critics cautioned that the expanded tax credits would do little for lower-income families.

New York City is still years away from anything approaching universal child care. And initiatives around the country will face obstacles from a lack of infrastructure to political fallout from Minnesota's social-services fraud scandal.

Nonetheless, experts say it's no accident that Mamdani was able to notch an early win on child care, and that lawmakers around the country may finally be willing to tackle an issue that's plagued families for too long.

“It is something that is so broadly needed; it is so absurdly expensive, it is so difficult for people, not just who are lower-income, but even middle or upper-middle-income, to be able to afford, that it really resonates,” Haspel said.

Building on New York City's existing universal preschool program for 4-year-olds, Mamdani's plan would expand preschool for 3-year-olds to make it truly universal. It would also create a new city program offering free care for 2-year-olds, called 2-Care, beginning with 2,000 children and offering a seat to any family that wants one within four years.

Under the plan, which still needs to be approved by the state legislature, Hochul will also work to offer universal preschool to all 4-year-olds in the state.

One reason Mamdani's plan gained traction is that New York already has a long history of political organizing around child care. Its program for 4-year-olds, the signature achievement of Mayor Bill de Blasio, launched in 2014 and quickly became popular. A program for 3-year-olds followed, and though it was not yet truly universal, families began counting on it as a lifeline in a city where day care can cost as much as $4,000 a month.

“I knew people who were like, ‘I just have to get to 3-K or pre-K, and then I can stay in New York,'” Rebecca Bailin, executive director of the advocacy group New Yorkers United for Child Care, told me.

When Eric Adams became mayor in 2022, he canceled the efforts to make 3-K universal and began announcing cuts, citing concerns about program quality and unfilled seats in some neighborhoods. Parents revolted. Organizing thousands of families, New Yorkers United for Child Care launched a successful push to beat back the cuts, and in 2024 and 2025, every family who applied to 3-K eventually got a seat. Last year, the group announced a campaign focusing on 2-year-olds; Emmy Liss, who helped develop that campaign, now directs the city's child care office.

An early leader in universal preschool, New York has more to build on than many areas when it comes to expanding child care; some existing 3-K programs already offer care for 2-year-olds, for example, though they are not yet subsidized. The existence of an organized parent body that already sees the benefits of subsidized care for older children also provides momentum behind Mamdani's plan.

The early success of the proposal is an example of an approach that can work nationwide, experts and advocates say. As Vox's Rachel Cohen Booth has reported, voters overwhelmingly support making child care more accessible, but often don't put a very high priority on the issue. Mamdani, however, made care part of a larger promise to make city life more affordable, a promise that resonated with New Yorkers, whether they had young children or not.

“We are seeing more states take action that acknowledges the current system is not working. The market isn't capable of solving child care.”

“I think that messaging is generalizable,” Haspel said. “You're very much casting child care as essential to the good life, rather than just this instrumental thing that helps you attach a parent to the labor force.”

Since Mamdani's victory, other candidates have emerged with similar platforms. Jason Esteves, a former Georgia state senator, has made universal child care part of his campaign for governor. Francesca Hong, a Democratic socialist running for governor of Wisconsin, has proposed universal child care alongside investments in public schools and elder care. “These types of social insurance programs are designed to ensure that working class people can not only get by, but be able to take care of themselves and their families in the ways that they see fit,” Hong told the Wisconsin Examiner.

Republican candidates have been less supportive of subsidized care, often proposing direct payments to families instead, said Elizabeth Palley, a professor of social work at Adelphi University who has studied child care policy. But even some red states are setting aside more public money for care.

Last year, Montana created a trust fund to help pay for child care and other programs. And in Texas, lawmakers added $100 million to the state budget for child care scholarships.

“We are seeing more states take action that acknowledges the current system is not working,” Haspel said. “The market isn't capable of solving child care.”

Some of these efforts have already run into problems. In Montana, for example, Gov. Greg Gianforte last summer vetoed a bill to expand child care aid, arguing that the state trust fund should be enough — even though the fund only provides a fraction of the money necessary to care for the state's kids. In New Mexico, promises of universal care have yet to become reality, with a shortage of day care centers calling into question when and whether every child will really get a spot.

New York will face its own challenges. The money Hochul promised last week will only sustain the program for two years, after which it will need new sources of funding. Skeptics are absolutely right that care is expensive, especially for very young children who need low student-to-teacher ratios.

The city will also have to expand on a patchwork infrastructure that includes public schools (some of which house pre-K and 3-K programs), larger day care centers, and smaller in-home providers, as well as a workforce with different skill sets and levels of professionalization. Mamdani hopes to raise wages for child care workers to match those of public school teachers — around $85,000 per year — but some workers now make as little as $25,000. Raising labor costs will also raise the costs of the program.

“It's paying the workforce, training the workforce, and then finding spaces for that workforce,” said Grace Bonilla, president and CEO of United Way of New York City, a nonprofit that focuses on low-income New Yorkers. “All of those are incredibly complicated infrastructure challenges.”

National headwinds could also put the program at risk. New York is one of five states whose child care funding the Trump administration has frozen in the wake of a viral video making unsubstantiated claims of day care fraud in Minnesota (that freeze has been blocked in court for now). Nick Shirley, the creator of the video, has criticized Mamdani's child care plan, calling day care centers “a great place to launder money.”

It remains to be seen how much Shirley's video will influence public opinions on child care nationwide, Haspel said, but “I don't see it as something that's going to kneecap Mamdani or Hochul's efforts.”

And within New York, there's a new level of optimism and excitement around the potential to solve a problem that for decades seemed intractable. “There's an opportunity for New York to be a national model of what it looks like when local and state government work together to put children and families first,” Rodriguez said.

Blame AI.

The paper clip problem always seemed too absurd to me. Also known as the paper clip maximizer, this is the thought experiment by philosopher Nick Bostrom that imagines how a superintelligent AI with the goal of maximizing paper clip production could end up destroying the world by directing all available resources to making paper clips.

While it would be irresponsible to say this is happening, we are starting to run low on some resources. And it's about to affect your life.

You may have heard about the global memory shortage caused, in part, by the rapid buildout of AI data centers. Just as they need semiconductors for data processing and water for cooling, these facilities need memory, or RAM, for short- and long-term data storage. Pretty much all consumer electronics, from desktop computers to smartphones, also require memory to run. The problem is that just three companies — Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung Electronics — make almost all of the memory on the market. They can't make it fast enough right now, and it's unclear when they'll be able to catch up with demand.

Normally the shortage of a computer component wouldn't lead me to reference a thought experiment about the apocalypse, but here we are. Memory is a really important component, and as the AI data center boom sucks up more and more resources, not having enough of it means that virtually every gadget with a chip in it will either get more expensive or less innovative or both. You can think of it along the same lines as the dreaded combination of inflation and stagnation made famous by the 1970s and resurrected by the second Trump administration: stagflation. Things cost more, and they're basically worse.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Prices are already going up, and manufacturers are already pointing to the memory shortage to explain them. What you can expect in the months, and possibly years, to come is a slowdown in the type of specification bumps you're used to seeing in new models. (This year's iPhone Pro 17, for example, has 12GB of RAM versus the 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro.) You might even see manufacturers picking cheaper options for components like displays or batteries, in ways that may not be immediately obvious.

“They're looking for anywhere to cut corners just during this timeframe to offset memory costs,” said Ryan Reith, a group vice president at the market intelligence firm IDC. He added that some companies just won't build the higher-powered devices they'd planned to build in the near future. IDC, meanwhile, predicts smartphone sales will go down in 2026 due to the memory shortage.

There is also hoarding. There's a veritable alphabet soup of different types of storage, but one that is essential to AI is known as DRAM. You can find DRAM in gadgets big and small — laptops, gaming consoles, TVs, cars — and as the big three memory makers direct more of that supply to AI data centers, less is available to gadget makers. So some companies are stockpiling the memory, which has the tricky effect of both driving up prices and lowering supply.

The other acronym to know here is HBM, which stands for high-bandwidth memory. This is a type of DRAM that's specifically designed to work with the high-performance processors, like Nvidia's Blackwell chips, that are filling out AI data centers. The profit margins on this type of memory is roughly double that of the kind of DRAM that goes into consumer gadgets, so naturally memory makers are devoting extra resources to making it, contributing to the backlog of consumer-grade memory.

This situation is going to take a while to resolve. In order to build more memory chips, memory makers need to build more factories, known as fabs, and that process takes years. Micron, for example, will soon start construction on a fab in upstate New York that won't start producing memory until 2030. The company's business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC last week, “We're sold out for 2026.”

None of this means that, if you go to the smartphone store in six months, you're not going to be able to buy one — or that it will be twice as expensive. On the contrary, device manufacturers want to avoid sticker shock. What you'll probably see, however, is that the price of the base model stays the same, but the components inside of it aren't as good as they would have been. If you want the version with more memory, you'll pay an even higher premium for those specs than you would have last year.

“It's not over yet in terms of prices going up,” said Reith.

We don't yet know how this ends. On one hand, the data center boom that's gobbling up all the memory is very much tied to the AI industry, which may or may not be a bubble about to pop. On the other, the trend of rising prices spans all industries. While the rate of inflation has held steady, things cost more than they did a year ago, and they're not getting any cheaper. If smartphone makers or laptop manufacturers realize they can sell a worse product at the same price as the better one, they might want to do that, regardless of any shortages.

When we talk about the affordability crisis, we're not exactly talking about an expensiveness crisis. Affordable means reasonable. It doesn't feel reasonable that the average consumer gets saddled with crappier products as the AI industry creates billionaires at a record pace. The world is not ending any time soon, but you're probably starting to feel the effects of the shift in one way or another.

Grok will no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on X, after widespread global backlash.

""We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,"" X's safety account said in a blog post on the platform on Wednesday. ""This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.""

The change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor, Rob Bonta, said he launched an investigation into sexualized AI deepfakes, including those of children, generated by Grok.

""xAI can and should put better safeguards in place to protect children and women from the harms of sexually explicit materials being generated without their consent,"" a representative of the California Attorney General's office said in a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday after Grok's changes.

xAI develops Grok and also owns the social media site X, where the chatbot is integrated to respond to users when tagged.

Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok because of the images, the first countries in the world to ban the AI tool. Lawmakers in the UK publicly considered suspending it, and the country's communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation.

Liz Kendall, the UK's technology secretary, said Thursday that she welcomes the change from X but expects ""the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom's ongoing investigation.""

In Wednesday's blog post, the social media company reiterated that image creation and the ability to edit any type of image via Grok on X will now only be available to paid users as an additional safety measure.

The company restricted non-paying users last week after complaints from officials globally, but it was criticized for being insufficient.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the time that it ""simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.""

Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, said that the UK government wanted ""any excuse for censorship"" in response to a post questioning why AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT were not being looked into.

On Wednesday, a few hours before X's official account posted about the ban on creating sexualized images, Musk asked users to try to get around the AI model's image restrictions.

Grok is also available as a stand-alone web and mobile application. It's unclear if it's still possible for users to make sexualized images on its webpage and app. xAI could not be reached for immediate comment.

X said in its blog post that its safety team was working to add additional safeguards.

""We now geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal,"" X said.

Dipal Dutta, CEO and founder of IT company Redoq UK, told Business Insider that xAI should implement several technical constraints to prevent the creation of non-consensual images ""at the point of origin.""

They include automatically denying user requests containing words on a blocklist, training future versions of Grok on datasets free from explicit content, and using ""secondary AI models"" to detect and block intimate content before it is generated.

Sarah Armstrong-Smith, a UK government cyber advisory board member and a former Microsoft chief security advisor, told Business Insider that Grok reflected a ""growing divide"" among AI companies.

""On one side are organizations prioritizing responsible AI and safety frameworks,"" she said. ""On the other, are organizations positioning themselves as protecting freedom of expression by resisting regulatory control.""

""Perhaps the real opportunity is whether this finally signals the end of unchecked AI experimentation,"" she added.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Slater, a 41-year-old real estate developer based in Boston. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I was born in South Florida, where my parents and uncle currently live, and I moved to Massachusetts when I was 10 years old.

I run our family office, which is based in both Boston and Palm Beach, Florida. We have business ventures across multiple industries, but my focus is on our real estate portfolio. From light industrial to agricultural to multifamily real estate, we're well-diversified across many states in the US, as well as Canada.

It's been interesting to see an increase in national interest in the Massachusetts millionaire's tax as some initiatives in other states come up. I have friends in other markets who have been asking about it. Since its implementation in 2023, the obvious question to me is, why wouldn't I move back to Florida?

The truth is, I often think about moving, but I feel strongly about why I'm staying. It's all for my kids.

In addition to my focus on real estate, I also work in the sports and entertainment industry. I hold a minority ownership stake in the Seattle Kraken, an NHL team, and last year, I joined the ownership group of the Memphis Grizzlies. I'm very active in the world of sport, and it's been a really enjoyable and successful venture. Over the past 15 years, I've also produced over 40 feature films.

With the progression of state taxes in the last few years, particularly the millionaire tax, I've seen many people, including friends in the hedge fund, private equity, and finance spaces, move or confirm their plans to do so. However, I'm in a slightly different situation.

I have two younger children, a 7 and 10-year-old, and I would prefer them to grow up here with all that Massachusetts has to offer.

We live in a town with a wonderful public school system, and I don't want to take that away from them. More broadly, eastern Massachusetts and Boston, in particular, are highly accessible areas and offer a lot. We've got everything from sports to culture, and all four seasons. I don't want to pull my kids from that for my desire to pay less in taxes.

If my children weren't young, maybe my answer would be different.

It's difficult to say if any changes I've seen in Massachusetts are a direct result of this particular tax. The broader market conditions in the economy are, in certain areas, quite strong, while in other areas, they are not.

If you take condominium sales in downtown Boston, we're at extraordinarily low points both for pricing and velocity, especially if we're looking back on a 10 or 15-year horizon. I think it would probably be a stretch to say it's solely because of this tax, but high earners leaving Massachusetts removes potential high-end condominium buyers from the market.

Fortunately, I haven't had to make any lifestyle changes because of the wealth tax, but I'm certainly aware of the taxes I pay in general, specifically as a result of this tax. My question is, what will come next after this?

What remains to be seen is how the additional revenue brought in to Massachusetts from this tax will trickle back to everyone in the Commonwealth.

If taxes continue to increase and no one can point to any substantial changes being made in the state, I think that's when we'll see a more meaningful exodus of people, even potentially myself, from Massachusetts.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, our public transit system, has struggled for a long time, and it needs huge investments in its infrastructure and operations. Will we see a boost there? I don't know.

There are two bridges that connect mainland Massachusetts to Cape Cod, and they're nearly 100 years old. They were going to be replaced at a multi-billion-dollar cost, but some of the funding was cut due to the Trump Administration. Will we see some help for those projects?

I'm wondering if there's anything that will be done to truly help move us forward, rather than just keep us afloat with the existing programs we have at the state budget level. I think more people who are paying the millionaire's tax would be on board if there were a more complete message about how the tax dollars would be used.

It's certainly something that people are watching and aware of, with good reason.

A Ford employee who was suspended after heckling President Donald Trump has sparked an outpouring of crowdfunding support.

The GoFundMe donations, totaling over $800,000 in less than 24 hours, come after the Ford line worker, TJ Sabula, told The Washington Post that he heckled Trump during the President's visit to his workplace.

Trump visited a Michigan plant on Tuesday where the automaker builds its best-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck. The brief visit was intended to highlight the White House's commitment to rebuilding the US workforce and Ford's focus on rebuilding a blue-collar workforce pipeline.

Video from the event obtained by TMZ shows Trump gesturing after someone shouted ""pedophile protector"" — which Sabula has since said was him — in an apparent reference to White House's delay in releasing the full Epstein files. The President can be seen raising his middle finger after the remark and mouthing an expletive.

The White House told several news outlets that Trump was appropriately responding to ""a lunatic"" who ""was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.""

A source at the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union that represents the Ford plant, confirmed to Business Insider that Sabula was suspended.

""The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union—the UAW,"" Laura Dickerson, the vice president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), told Business Insider in an email.

""He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.""

Dickerson said the UAW is reviewing Sabula's suspension.

""Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States,"" she added.

Sabula told the Post that he has ""no regrets whatsoever.""

""I don't feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,"" he added.

By Wednesday evening, two GoFundMe accounts campaigning for Sabula had raised more than $480,000 and $329,000 before donations were paused with a note from the organizers.

""TJ and his family greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time, we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support,"" read an update on both campaigns. ""We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!""

""TJ Sabula is a patriot,"" said one of the GoFundMe campaigns, which more than 21,000 people donated to.

""Let's rally and support TJ and help him pay some bills (and force DJT to release the Trump/Epstein Files),"" continues the post, which was published last night.

In November, Trump signed a bipartisan bill called the Epstein Files Transparency Act that required the release of all FBI materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein by December 19, 2025. While some files have been released, the Department of Justice said it's still scrambling to review around 5.2 million remaining documents weeks after the mandated release date.

""TJ Sabula, a worker at the Ford Rouge Plant, voiced concerns about President Donald J Trump during the president's visit to the plant. Ford responded by suspending TJ without pay,"" reads a second GoFundMe organized by Diandra Gourlay, which has raised money from over 13,000 people.

Gourlay described herself as ""a longtime personal friend of the Sabula family.""

Both GoFundMe campaigns list ""Thomas Sabula"" as the official beneficiary of the donations. Neither page owner immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Sabula, Ford, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Himal Mandalia, 45, who lives in London. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I had a difficult childhood, and I missed a lot of school. When I hit my 20s, I didn't know what I wanted to be, so I floated between jobs. By age 32, in 2012, I'd reached a low point and felt my life was going nowhere.

What I achieved in the following 10 years went beyond my wildest dreams.

In 2013, I landed a job as a software developer for a content marketing agency. I'd been coding as a hobby since I was young, and had relevant volunteer projects under my belt, but this formally kick-started my career in technology. By 2021, I was the head of technology for the UK government's official website.

In 2022, at age 42, I took a six-month break from work. It turned into 3½ years, and I traveled the world, but I found that I couldn't slow down. It unearthed hard truths about myself that I had to address.

At first, I was anxious about explaining my career break on my résumé, but I realized that people often take long career breaks to be parents, and I had reparented myself.

In the process, I learned to accept myself and be more present in the moment, which has been life-changing.

I hadn't planned to work for the government, but when I started doing contract work for a department in 2014, I fell in love with designing services to support people's needs. In 2021, I got the job as the head of technology for GOV.UK, which felt like a huge achievement.

After more than a year in the role, I reached a natural point where I needed a break from my career and could comfortably afford one, and left my job in April 2022. I didn't know what I wanted to do next in my role, and also had personal issues related to my difficult childhood to address.

During my time off, I wrote my memoir, but realized there was little continuity to the narrative. Plus, even ""successful"" chapters felt hollow. I decided I needed more time to find out why that was.

I hit the road on an open-ended trip to work on my book and myself. I flew to New Zealand and jumped to a new destination every week, including Bangkok, Singapore, and Ho Chi Minh City.

What struck me during this time was my need for control. Whenever I sat in a café to relax, I felt compelled to plan my next four weeks in a document. I was exhausted and wondered if I'd become the only person to burn out on their career break.

After six months, I made Melbourne my base and slowed down, traveling a little. In mid-2024, at age 44, I drew the line at 18 months of travel and returned to the UK indefinitely.

I'd always felt different from others, and met some neurodivergent people while travelling.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in October 2024 and autism in May 2025.

The diagnosis and tendencies associated with ADHD explained many of my lifelong patterns. I was often restless and always had to be on the go. I feel like it's why I pushed myself to travel to new places every week during my break.

I'd also shift from being hyperfocused to disengaged. I could apply extraordinary effort and long hours to something, but it wasn't sustainable. During my career, I developed a drill sergeant in my head that drove me to sometimes work 80 hours a week, even though no one asked me to. I'd eventually get bored and walk away from things.

ADHD prevented me from sitting still and having a life of continuity, but it also meant I was always learning new skills, and it helped me become successful. It's not something I can hate.

Medication has helped slow me down, and in early 2025, I started dealing with the emotional baggage that I'd taken around the world. It was like opening a warehouse full of boxes that I was scared to look inside. I had experienced a lot of shame about being different, so I had to forgive how unkind I'd been to myself and get more in touch with my emotions.

By recognizing patterns I'd carried with me, I learned to meet my needs instead of overriding them. I began replacing pressure with permission and built routines that supported me rather than drained me. It also meant accepting myself and allowing myself to simply be, without needing constant stimulation or achievement to justify my existence.

In June 2025, I founded a nonprofit called ADHD Pathfinding, focused on improving ADHD care in the UK.

My journey made me realize that the only thing we really have is the moments. There's a finite number of them, and when they're gone, that's it. There's only one way to make sure you don't miss them, which is to slow down and be present.

I've seen more of the world than most people, but I missed most of it, because I was going too fast. Whatever keeps someone living on fast-forward, whether that's ADHD, unhealed trauma, or something else, understanding it can make it possible to slow down and feel more connected.

In Silicon Valley, 2026 is shaping up to be a show-your-work year.

Across Big Tech, companies are tightening worker oversight amid layoffs, AI-driven job anxiety, and cuts to entry-level roles. If 2025 was about bosses calling on workers to be hardcore, 2026 is about making sure they actually do it.

A look inside two of the biggest players reveals what heightened accountability can look like: Business Insider exclusively reported this month that Amazon stepped up efforts to let managers track employee badge swipes and revised performance reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments.

Meanwhile, Business Insider also learned that Meta is using dashboards to track workers' AI usage and simplifying its review structure with a winner-take-more approach that better rewards the highest performers. It is also cutting about 10% of workers at its metaverse division.

Taken together, the moves signal that Big Tech is ratcheting up the stakes for workers who find themselves in a market that's sluggish for seemingly all but AI's shiniest superstars.

The ante-upping comes as companies are pumping massive sums into AI — and, in many cases, are still waiting for the returns to materialize. A desire to see more performance metrics may stem from a need to quantify how workers are using AI to boost productivity.

""I suspect in a lot of tech firms, there is kind of a mood of panic,"" Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told Business Insider, referring to executives' fear of falling behind in the AI race.

Bidwell added that the sense of urgency coming from the top around AI then leads to the question, ""How do we make sure we're squeezing the most out of people?""

Big Tech's answer? Go big on metrics.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter.

It's not just Amazon and Meta. Microsoft has worked to shed its ""country club"" reputation, while Google has also changed how it rates employees to incentivize outsize performance.

Productivity dashboards, tool-usage metrics, and increasingly granular performance evaluations are becoming central to how managers gauge value. The goal, executives say, is to ensure accountability and reward top performers. The shift is also philosophical: Productivity isn't assumed. It has to be proven.

At Amazon, managers have a dashboard to track how much time workers are spending at its corporate outposts — and to flag those who are brushing off the company's return-to-office mandate. The company, as part of its performance review process, is asking its corporate workers to provide three to five accomplishments that exemplify their work.

Meta is also adjusting how it keeps score of workers' performance — in part by giving more frequent feedback and tightening the focus on ""rewarding outstanding performance,"" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider earlier this month.

The demand for greater productivity isn't limited to tech. Citi CEO Jane Fraser sent a memo to the bank's staff on Wednesday, entitled ""The bar is raised,"" in which she made it clear to Citi's more than 200,000 workers that she expects them to raise their standards in 2026.

""We are not graded on effort. We are judged on our results,"" Fraser wrote in the memo.

The power moves from Big Tech likely reflect a mix of factors, industry observers said. There is the expectation that AI will supercharge workers; yet, there is also a view that something has to justify the massive outlays on the technology.

Spending on AI tools that help programmers write code, for example, can bring with it the expectation from management that workers become faster and more efficient.

At Incedo, an enterprise AI and data firm, coding assistants have helped boost workers' productivity between 25% and 40%, Nitin Seth, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.

""As that is happening, there is a squeeze on jobs,"" he said. Across tech, Seth said, that can mean an imperative to produce more or cut jobs — or both. Incedo has reduced workers because of AI's productivity windfall, he said, though the company continues to hire data engineers among other roles. The company didn't specify how many roles it has cut.

Even so, Seth said, AI's productivity bounce in the tech industry hasn't been as great so far as some bosses and boards would like.

He said that by the final months of 2025, many business leaders experienced the ""sobering realization"" that while the early gains from AI were impressive, carving out further wins had proven difficult.

Seth likens the AI environment to that of roads and cars — where AI infrastructure is the road and an AI use case is the car. Companies have been spending big on the roads, Seth said, but as yet, ""there aren't too many cars.""

There's also a sunnier take: Leaders feel compelled to ""better justify"" the people they employ in order to protect their jobs, said Christopher Myers, the faculty director of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.

The idea, he told Business Insider, is that dashboards make it clear what workers are doing. It's a way of competing with the readily available metrics on what AI is churning through.

One clear fallout is that employers will be able to save money by pushing out low performers, Myers said. RTO mandates, he said, can also be a way of letting go of workers unwilling to comply.

Whatever's behind it, he said, leaders' thinking appears to be, ""I'm really going to grade hard.""

It's likely that investors are worried about the number of workers at some companies, said Wharton's Bidwell. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter — and the company's ability to carry on even after deep staff cuts — some investors have concluded that tech firms' pandemic-era bloat could be eliminated, Bidwell said.

""He came in. He fired everybody. It didn't fall over,"" he said of Musk. That has led to what Bidwell sees as ""a big cultural shift"" in tech about the need to hire the best and the brightest — if only to keep them from going to competitors.

The shift means that leaders in Silicon Valley are asking tougher questions about who is pulling their weight. That pressure, Incedo's Seth said, then falls on managers and, ultimately, down to rank-and-file tech workers who are seeing increased performance expectations.

""There is greater pressure, greater anxiety, and it's kind of like a snowball effect,"" he said.

Maybe the Code Red worked?

OpenAI is crushing it with business users and is far ahead of rivals such as Anthropic and Google in the enterprise AI market, according to new data this week.

That's a contrast to some of the hand-ringing that's gone on since Google's Gemini chatbot began gaining on ChatGPT a few months ago.

The new data comes from Ramp, a startup that helps companies pay their bills. Ramp analyzes corporate card and bill-paying activity on its platform from more than 50,000 US businesses to track billions of dollars spent on AI services each month.

The latest numbers cover December 2025. The report shows that OpenAI regained momentum among US businesses, posting its strongest growth in months as overall corporate adoption of AI continued to accelerate.

The share of US businesses paying for AI products and services rose to 46.6% in December, up 1.6 percentage points from November. That was the largest month-over-month increase since mid-2025, Ramp data shows.

Much of that growth was driven by OpenAI. Business adoption of OpenAI products climbed two percentage points to 36.8%, reversing a short-lived slowdown in the fall and reaching a new record high. Ramp's line-item data shows gains in both enterprise chat subscriptions and API spending, suggesting broader OpenAI usage across office workers and technical teams.

It's unclear how many current paid users OpenAI has, but the company said in November 2025 that it had 1 million business customers. 

The rebound underscores OpenAI's continued dominance in the enterprise AI market at a time when companies are moving beyond experimentation. Rather than trial use, December's growth reflects recurring spend tied to everyday business functions, including software development, research, finance, sales, and customer support.

Competitors continued to gain ground, though at a slower pace. Anthropic's adoption rose to 16.7%, with growth concentrated among technology companies making heavy use of APIs.

Google's AI adoption increased to 4.3%, a figure Ramp notes likely understates usage because many businesses access Gemini for free through Google Workspace plans.

These Ramp numbers also exclude business use of free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, and when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks. This means the data likely underestimates actual AI adoption rates.

Business Insider Edition 

Caledonia Mining Corporation said it plans to spend about $132 million this year to kick-start development of what is expected to become Zimbabwe's largest gold mine.


        Caledonia Mining Corporation said it plans to spend about $132 million this year to kick-start development of what is expected to become Zimbabwe's largest gold mine, as producers capitalise on record bullion prices.
    


        The investment forms part of a broader $162.5 million capital expenditure programme for 2026, subject to board approval and funding availability, according to Reuters.
    


        Caledonia, which currently operates the 80,000-ounce-per-year Blanket mine, is advancing the Bilboes gold project, a development estimated to cost $584 million in total.

        The company expects first production in late 2028, ramping up to a steady-state output of around 200,000 ounces annually from 2029 for at least a decade.
    


        The project will be financed through a combination of non-recourse senior debt, cash flows from existing operations and alternative structures such as streaming agreements, under which investors provide upfront funding in exchange for future metal deliveries.
    


        The expansion has also been helped by a recent policy reversal by Zimbabwe's government, which scrapped plans to double gold royalty rates and alter the tax treatment of capital expenditure.
    


        Mining is Zimbabwe's biggest export earner, generating more than 60% of the country's foreign exchange from gold, platinum and lithium.
    


        But years of poor regulation have left a heavy environmental toll, with both artisanal and large-scale miners responsible for polluted waterways, abandoned pits and degraded land, especially across Manicaland, Midlands and Mashonaland West.

Business Insider Edition 

The Rwanda Defence Force has deployed a contingent of military engineers to Jamaica to support the Caribbean nation's post-hurricane reconstruction effort, marking one of the most visible African security-sector humanitarian missions in the Americas in recent years.


        The RDF said the engineers will focus on rehabilitating critical infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Melissa, which struck the Caribbean in late October 2025 and left large sections of Jamaica's road networks, drainage systems, public buildings, and utilities severely affected.
    


        The deployment is being carried out under a bilateral cooperation agreement between Rwanda and Jamaica that allows Kigali to provide technical and disaster-recovery support when major emergencies occur.
    


        Before departing for Kingston, the engineers received a briefing from Brigadier General Faustin Tinka, Commander of the Mechanized Division, speaking on behalf of the RDF Chief of Defence Staff.
    


        He urged the contingent to apply their full technical expertise and professionalism, stressing that the true measure of success would be the impact felt by Jamaican communities.
    


        He highlighted the values that define the RDF, particularly discipline, which form the foundation of the Force.
    


        “It is these values that earned you this responsibility,” he said, calling on the officers and other ranks to uphold and safeguard the RDF's core values at all times.
    


        The Jamaica deployment reflects a growing trend in which African militaries are increasingly used not only for peacekeeping and counterterrorism, but also for humanitarian engineering and disaster-recovery missions abroad.
    


        African militaries increasingly operate abroad in roles that combine security with humanitarian protection, though dedicated disaster-relief deployments remain rare.
    


        South Africa is one of the few African states with a documented record of sending military aircraft, engineers, and logistics units to support disaster responses in neighbouring countries such as Mozambique after major cyclones.
    


        Most other African overseas deployments take place through UN, AU, and regional peacekeeping missions, where countries like Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda are tasked with protecting civilians and securing humanitarian access.



        In that context, Rwanda's engineering mission to Jamaica stands out as a rare example of an African military deploying specifically for post-disaster infrastructure recovery rather than conflict stabilisation.
    


        For Rwanda, which has built a reputation through UN and bilateral deployments across Africa and the Middle East, Jamaica represents a further expansion of its security diplomacy beyond the continent.
    


        By sending engineers rather than combat troops, Kigali is also projecting soft power through infrastructure rebuilding, technical expertise, and rapid disaster response, tools that are increasingly shaping how African states engage with partners in the Global South.

In this article

Amazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store ""burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year"" and failed to hold up their agreement. 

When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.

""That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,"" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ""Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.""

As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded ""Saks at Amazon"" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. 

In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. 

Amazon wrote that it ""hopes"" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may ""seek more drastic remedies"" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. 

During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. 

Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. 

The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.

The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.

Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan.

The media platform founded by Jimmy Donaldson, known as the popular YouTuber MrBeast, is drawing a $200 million investment from  Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the world's leading ethereum treasury company.

The Bitmine investment in Beast Industries is designed to back a digital outlet that has more than 450 million subscribers and attracts more than 5 billion monthly views. The deal closes on or about Jan. 19.

""It's our view that ethereum, which is a smart contract platform, is the future of finance, where digitalization of not only dollars but stocks and equities [are] going to take place,"" Bitmine Chairman Tom Lee said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""Over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money, and that's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.""

Alongside Lee, who also serves as head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, key investors in Bitmine include ARK's Cathie Wood, Bill Miller III and Galaxy Digital.

""I think it's part of the sort of evolution of digital platforms and money, and I think it's really uniting the No. 1 creator in the world with the biggest ethereum platform in the world,"" Lee added.

Shares of Bitmine were up more than 1% premarket Thursday after the announcement. The stock has already soared more than 20% since New Year's, far surpassing the 1% gain in the S&P 500.

Addressing the broader cryptocurrency universe, Lee is optimistic on both bitcoin and ethereum, anticipating the former will reach a new all-time high in 2026. He's even more bullish on ethereum,  expecting its performance to outpace bitcoin this year. 

Lee's bullishness comes as the Senate Agriculture and Banking committees are expected to hold hearings this month on a crypto market structure bill that offers guardrails for the industry.

""Crypto really got hurt [in] October last year, so it is our view that we're going to have a pretty big recovery as we put more time between that moment,"" Lee said.

More than 800,000 federal student loan holders remain stuck in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan or debt forgiveness, a new court filing shows. 

As of the end of December, 734,221 borrower requests to transfer into an income-driven repayment plan were still pending with the U.S. Department of Education, the agency reported. Another 83,370 borrowers continued to wait for a decision on their Public Service Loan Forgiveness Buyback application. 

IDR plans limit a borrower's monthly bill to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years. 

The buyback option allows borrowers pursuing PSLF to retroactively pay for any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment, accelerating their timeline to forgiveness. Signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush, PSLF offers debt cancellation to those who've spent a decade working for certain not-for-profits or the government.

Some borrowers have now been stuck in the backlog for more than a year. 

When CNBC spoke with librarian Katy Punch last summer, she had already been waiting for an answer on her PSLF buyback application for eight months. Punch, 38, said Thursday she is ""at month 14.""

""I check pretty regularly with the Federal Student Aid chat, and my buyback request is still open and 'escalated,'"" Punch said via email.

""I really worry that I will not receive the forgiveness that was part of my loan contract,"" she said.

Many student loan borrowers rely on IDR plans and the loan forgiveness program to be able to afford their monthly payments and to eventually emerge from their debt, consumer advocates say.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 

The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The Trump administration has made progress on the backlog of repayment plan applications, according to its report: Around 802,000 requests were pending in November, and nearly 1.4 million were in July. However, the PSLF buyback pileup is growing. It was at 80,210 in November and 72,730 in July. 

In December, the Education Department reported it received 258,465 new IDR plan requests and 5,090 buyback applications. 

Trump officials agreed to share status updates on their processing of borrowers' applications in an October settlement with the American Federation of Teachers, a teachers' union representing some 1.8 million members. The AFT sued the Trump administration last year, accusing officials of denying student loan borrowers their legally required rights. 

Many student loan borrowers were forced to apply for a new repayment plan after the Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan was blocked in court. Experts say the backlog of applications has only worsened with the Trump administration's move in March to terminate thousands of the Education Department's staffers, including many of the people who helped assist borrowers, consumer advocates say. 

""Perhaps the U.S. Department of Education shouldn't have laid off half their staff if they are incapable of performing their responsibilities,"" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. 

The challenges accessing income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness come amid an especially difficult time for federal student loan borrowers. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization. The Trump administration is beginning wage garnishments this month, and experts have warned of the risk of tax refund seizures this spring. 

Borrowers are reeling from a weakening labor market and promises of relief that never materialized, experts say. The Biden administration had announced sweeping debt forgiveness and a new repayment plan designed to dramatically reduce monthly payments, but Republican-led legal challenges blocked both of those programs.

""As millions of student loan borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments,"" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers.

The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his ""most-favored-nation"" policy.

More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. 

As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.

Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.

The health-care framework would ""make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,"" according to a White House fact sheet.

It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage ""directly to the American people"" instead of giving ""big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,"" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.

The plan would additionally ""fund a cost-sharing reduction program,"" which the administration says would ""reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.""

Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons ""in plain English"" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.

It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid ""to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.""

The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. 

The White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.

Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.

""We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters on Thursday. ""Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said on Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.

""Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,"" Shaheen told reporters. 

A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. 

""This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,"" the White House official said. ""It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.""

In this article

Morgan Stanley on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations on the back of strong revenue from wealth management. 

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:

Fourth-quarter net income rose to $4.40 billion, or $2.68 per share, from $3.71 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year ago. Revenue increased to $17.89 billion from $16.22 billion a year ago.

The bank stock jumped more than 4% on Thursday following the report. 

The wealth management unit posted $8.4 billion in net revenue in the most recent quarter, up from $7.5 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the division generated a record $31.8 billion in net revenue. 

Total client assets in the wealth and investment management business climbed to $9.3 trillion, fueled by more than $350 billion in net new assets.

""Morgan Stanley delivered outstanding performance in 2025,"" Ted Pick, the bank's CEO and chairman, said in a statement. ""Our performance reflects multi-year investments which have contributed to growth and momentum across the Integrated Firm.""

Investment banking was also a standout for the firm. Net revenue for the segment jumped 47% to $2.41 billion from $1.64 billion a year earlier, driven by stronger advisory fees as completed M&A activity increased across all regions.

The firm bought back $1.5 billion of its stock during the quarter and $4.6 billion over the full year under its share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley shares have gained more than 43% over the past 12 months.

Other banks have mostly posted solid results. JPMorgan Chase topped expectations for fourth-quarter results on strong equities and fixed income trading revenue. Wells Fargo posted weaker-than-expected revenue, while Bank of America and Citigroup beat consensus estimates.

Stanley Kroenke owns the world's most valuable sports empire, including the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. Now the sports tycoon is also America's largest private landowner, according to the newly released Land Report. 

At 2.7 million acres, Kroenke's holdings are larger than Yellowstone National Park — or the equivalent of roughly 2 million football fields. 

Kroenke bought nearly 1 million acres of New Mexico ranchland in December from the family behind industrial conglomerate Teledyne, per The Land Report. According to the trade publication, the Singleton Ranches transaction is the largest land purchase in the U.S. in more than a decade. Late Teledyne founder Henry Singleton started his namesake ranch in the 1980s, and it's grown into one of the nation's largest cattle- and horse-breeding operations. 

The acquisition vaulted Kroenke from fourth to first on The Land Report's annual ranking of the country's 100 largest private landowners, leapfrogging the Emmerson lumber family as well as billionaire media moguls John Malone and Ted Turner.

Most of the top 100 landowners aren't boldface names like Kroenke. The Emmerson family, which ranks second, owns an estimated 2.44 million acres through their forest-products company Sierra Pacific Industries. The Singleton family, which sold the New Mexico ranches to Kroenke, still made the cut at 98th place with 171,000 acres.

However, investing in U.S. farmland has become popular among the ultra wealthy as a hedge against inflation and stock market volatility. From 2019 to 2024, farmland values have grown at an average annual rate of 5.8%, or 2% after inflation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Billionaire entrepreneurs from Bill Gates to Philip Anschutz are increasingly buying up swaths of land for farming, ranching and forestry. Gates ranks 44th overall on The Land Report list with 275,000 acres but is still the largest private owner of U.S. farmland, specifically. Owned through his investment group, Cascade Investment, Gates' farmland grows soybeans, corn, cotton, rice and even potatoes used for McDonald's french fries.

Online brokerage billionaire Thomas Peterffy and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also made the cut, with 647,000 acres and 462,000 acres, respectively. 

Kroenke has been able to grow his land holdings relatively quickly by acquiring massive ranches that have been held in families for decades or even generations. He bought one of his largest ranches, Waggoner Ranch in north Texas, for $725 million in 2016, ending 160 years of family ownership. While these one-of-a-kind ranches are in short supply, more are hitting the market as heirs decide to sell rather than carry on the family business.

Several NATO members are deploying small numbers of troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise, in the wake of tense talks at the White House about the U.S. desire to annex it.

Denmark, which is responsible for Greenland's defense, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have all confirmed plans to send military personnel to the sparsely populated island this week.

U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed his sights on taking the island following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela to depose its president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.

The troop deployment comes shortly after the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland held talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House.

Speaking to reporters alongside Greenland's Vivian Motzfeldt, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said there had been a ""fundamental disagreement"" with the U.S., but said the hourlong meeting was ""frank but constructive.""

Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, however, told reporters in the Oval Office: ""We need Greenland for national security."" 

The U.S., Denmark and Greenland agreed to establish a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island, although, as had been widely expected, the three countries were unable to find a diplomatic resolution to defuse tensions.

Before the meeting, Denmark announced plans on Wednesday to beef up its military presence in and around Greenland, saying the exercise activities could include guarding national infrastructure, deploying fighter aircraft and conducting naval operations. 

Germany's Defense Ministry said it would deploy a ""reconnaissance team"" of 13 personnel to Nuuk, Greenland, at the invitation of Denmark.

The mission, which will take place Thursday through Saturday, is designed to explore the framework for possible military contributions to ensure security in the region, the German Defense Ministry said, including maritime surveillance capabilities.

French President Emmanuel Macron said in a social media post that France will also participate in the joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland, referring to it as ""Operation Arctic Endurance."" 

""The first French military elements are already on their way. Others will follow,"" Macron said Wednesday on X, according to a Google translation.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said several officers from Sweden's armed forces were scheduled to arrive in Greenland from Wednesday.

""They are part of a group from several allied countries. Together, they will prepare for upcoming elements within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,"" Kristersson said via X, according to a translation.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has previously warned that a U.S. attack on Greenland would mark the end of NATO, thanked Rasmussen and Greenland's Motzfeldt for countering the American claims at the talks. 

""It was not an easy meeting,"" Frederiksen said in a Facebook post Thursday, according to a translation. 

""A working group is now being established to discuss how security in the Arctic can be strengthened. However, that does not change the fact that there is a fundamental disagreement because the American ambition to take over Greenland is intact,"" Frederiksen said.

The Danish prime minister also mentioned that a number of NATO allies were currently contributing to joint exercise activities in and around Greenland. ""The defense and protection of Greenland is a common concern for the entire NATO alliance,"" she added.

Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.

Denmark has pledged to boost health-care spending and infrastructure investments in recent months, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.

""We have been stepping up. We have allocated almost $15 billion within just the last couple of years to capabilities in the High North. We have been pushing within the Arctic NATO states for bigger NATO engagement,"" Rasmussen said Wednesday.

""We didn't manage to change the American position. It's clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland,"" he continued. 

""We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the kingdom.""

In this article

Amazon's ""sovereign cloud"" offering in Europe is a ""big bet"" for the company, AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC as it launched on Thursday, in a move designed to keep it among the leading players in the region amid stringent regulations there for tech giant.

The term sovereign cloud broadly relates to cloud computing services where the data is stored, handled and not moved out of a specific jurisdiction. 

""We think it's a big potential here. We're making a big bet,"" AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in an exclusive interview.

The European Union (EU) has pushed for companies operating in the bloc to be compliant with its various data and privacy regulations, as concerns have risen about the dominance of U.S. tech giants in the cloud space and potential access to European citizens' data.

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) European Sovereign Cloud, based in Brandenburg, Germany, and first announced in 2023, is a new concept. Amazon said in a press release on Thursday that the cloud is ""physically and logically separate"" from other AWS regions. To do this, Amazon has created a new parent company for the sovereign cloud that will be locally controlled in the European Union (EU) and run by EU citizens. 

Garman said that customers wanted more controls around sovereignty before they moved data stored on-premise into the cloud. ""And now we're giving them a cloud that doesn't force them to make those trade offs. And we think that that unlocks a huge amount of business,"" he said. 

The European Sovereign Cloud includes customer-controlled encryption, for instance, where customers can control the keys to their encryption and so that ""that if anyone was even able to get access to [their data], they wouldn't be able to read it,"" Garman said.

""We think that those various levels of protection, both technology protections as well as policy protections, really layer that on and provide a really unique offering that's just different than anything out there today,"" he added.

Stéphane Israël will lead the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Stefan Hoechbauer, who is vice president of AWS global sales for Germany and Europe Central, has been appointed as a managing director. AWS also announced five new members of an advisory board for the sovereign cloud, three of which are Amazon employees.

AWS said the sovereign cloud has ""no critical dependencies on non-EU infrastructure"" and it can continue to operate in the event of a communications disruption with the rest of the world. Under ""extreme circumstances, authorised AWS employees of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, who are EU residents, will have independent access to a replica of the source code needed to maintain the AWS European Sovereign Cloud services,"" the company said.

For the past few years, European politicians and regulators have grown concerned about the dominance of U.S. tech firms over critical technology infrastructure.

Despite the EU pushing for regional companies to grow their businesses, AWS, Microsoft and Google account for 70% of the cloud computing market in the region, according to Synergy Research Group.

Even as AWS pushes its sovereign cloud, European regulators are currently investigating cloud computing services from Amazon and Microsoft under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the power of Big Tech. 

In 2024, Amazon said it would invest 7.8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud in Germany through 2040. On Thursday, Amazon said it would expand the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal.

Elsewhere, AWS expects AI demand to continue accelerating. ""We continue to be pleasantly surprised at how much demand is out there, really,"" Garman said.

""I do think that throughout 2026 we'll see more and more customers really starting to get positive ROI out of their AI investments,"" he added, adding that via its AI coding agent Kiro customers were building ""fantastic new experiences into everything from financial services to healthcare to retail, really kind of reimagining what's out there. So it's going from proof of concept to more implementation within the organization."" 

Garman is also excited about robots and ""world models,"" which refer to AI models that understand the physical, real world and are needed to make complex robots work, also referred to ""physical AI."" He said that AWS was not currently building its own world model, however. 

""Robotics is an enormous opportunity across many different industries, and so we're quite excited about it. And when [will] we really kind of hit that capabilities curve? You know, it's anybody's guess, but that technology is progressing really rapidly,"" he added.

Top officials from Greenland, Denmark and the U.S. met at the White House Wednesday to discuss Washington's controversial bid to assert ownership over Greenland.

The session ended without an agreement, reflecting what Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called a ""fundamental disagreement"" between U.S. President Donald Trump and Copenhagen.

That's hardly surprising.

Even before convening in the White House, Greenland has made it clear it will ""choose Denmark,"" while Trump emphasized anything less than U.S. control of the island is ""unacceptable.""

There could be worrying consequences. A potential armed clash over Greenland would trigger ""monumental consequences"" for the Western alliance and the global order, Iceland's former President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson told CNBC.

On a separate foreign policy front, the president signaled more flexibility on Iran. Trump indicated that he might refrain from attacking the country because ""we've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping"" — though there was a slight scare early Thursday stateside when Iran briefly closed its airspace for 5 hours.

Following Trump's comments, oil prices fell roughly 1.5% during Wednesday U.S. trading. However, global geopolitical turmoil, as well as Trump's apparent attack on the Federal Reserve's independence, is pushing up the prices of gold and silver. The latter has already popped 26.6% within the first two weeks of 2026.

Over in U.S. markets, major indexes fell on Wednesday, dragged down by chip stocks.

But they might get a speedy recovery. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, reported a better-than-expected 35% increase in fourth-quarter profit from a year earlier. 

In other words, demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors isn't abating yet. Still, investors now have to make the tricky balance between hedging against geopolitical risks and playing the AI theme.

U.S. freezes new immigrant visas for 75 countries. In a post on X, the U.S. government said immigrants from the list of countries ""take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates."" CNBC has the full list here.

Toyota Industries hit record high. Shares rose almost 6% to 19,080 yen ($120.41) following Toyota Motor raising its tender offer price for buying out the carmaker by more than 15%. The offer now stands at over $35 billion. 

China opens Trip.com antitrust probe. The investigation pertains to ""suspected abuse of its dominant market position,"" according to a CNBC translation of the competition authority's statement in Mandarin. Shares of the online travel provider plunged nearly 22% on the news.

Major U.S. indexes fell Wednesday. Chip stocks weighed on markets, with Broadcom, Nvidia and Micron sliding. Asia-Pacific markets mostly declined Thursday. South Korea's Kospi, however, climbed around 1.6% to close at a record high as the country's central bank kept rates unchanged.

[PRO] Gold and silver are smashing records. The precious metals had a massive rally in 2025, and have started this year without any sign of that momentum losing steam. Here's why their ascents are not slowing.

China's AI chip firms are going public fast. But its crown jewel is staying private

China's artificial intelligence chip sector has drawn heavy investor interest following a string of successful initial public offerings. But while those newly listed firms have led market gains, analysts say they are not leading China's effort to reduce reliance on Nvidia.

Instead, most analysts point to tech giant Huawei and its secretive chip unit, HiSilicon, as standing out among domestic competition, not only in technological advancement, but also in scale and its broader supply chain. Huawei, however, is not expected to go public.

A major exchange-traded fund manager suggests the oil trade won't provide much upside ahead.

VanEck CEO Jan van Eck isn't excited by traditional energy plays, which include the year's volatile crude trade.  

""The core 'Old Energy' world is just a sideways world right now,"" VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday.

Yet, it has been anything but sideways so far this year for the oil markets. On Wednesday, WTI closed at its highest level since Oct. 8 on jitters surrounding President Trump and Iran. Meanwhile, Brent also settled higher.

In a special statement to CNBC on Wednesday, van Eck indicated his view hasn't changed since Monday — citing a one-year time horizon for his outlook.

Instead, van Eck prefers stocks tied to electricity and nuclear power, citing demand from hyperscalers and the broader artificial intelligence trade.

He thinks investors are underestimating the alternative energy's reliability.

""I don't think that the 'R word' is really understood well enough,"" he said. ""Data centers can't be down. They can't take an hour off.""

His firm is behind the VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (NLR). The fund is up more than 16% since Jan. 1, as of Wednesday's close. Plus, it's up almost 73% over the past 52 weeks. 

VanEck's website lists Cameco, Constellation Energy and BWX Technologies as its top three positions, as of Tuesday. Cameco is up 21% so far this year. 

Jennifer Grancio, TCW's global head of distribution, also sees a shift from old to new energy — one that will play out over a long horizon.

""We need all energy sources in order to feed the beast,"" she said, pointing to rising power needs for data centers and manufacturing.

Grancio's firm manages the TCW Transform Systems ETF (PWRD), which she describes as a broad portfolio that includes some traditional-economy exposure, but leans into nuclear and efficiency-related companies tied to the power buildout. 

The fund is up about 29% over the past year.

Oil prices fell more than 4% on Thursday, after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump eased market speculation that an American strike on Iran could be imminent. 

Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, lost 4.13%, or $2.75, to $63.77 a barrel. Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.65, or 4.27%, to trade at $59.37 a barrel.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had been informed by ""very important sources"" in Iran that ""the killing has stopped.""

""There's no plans for executions, I've been told that on good authority,"" he said, adding that the White House would watch how the situation unfolds. 

Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed after mass unrest in Iran was met with a violent crackdown by the Islamic Republic's security forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if civilians are killed or executed by the state. 

Oil prices jumped on Tuesday after Trump canceled meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that ""help is on its way,"" and extended gains on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a U.S. strike on the country was looming. 

Those fears were fueled by a report from news agency Reuters that some personnel had been directed to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening. The BBC also reported that some British personnel were being moved out of the base. 

On Tuesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory to American citizens to leave Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey. 

""Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help,"" the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran said. ""If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items.""

In a note on Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said Trump's comments about the killing in Iran stopping had been taken by markets as ""a signal that the U.S. might hold off on a potential military response.""

""[But] there's clearly lingering caution, not least given the unexpected timing of U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025,"" he noted. ""Brent crude is still clearly above its lows below $60/bbl last week, but Trump's comments had a clear impact.""

""Bear in mind as well that Iran is a more significant oil producer than Venezuela, producing 4% of the world's total in 2023, so developments there have the potential for wider spillovers in the oil market,"" Reid added.

In this article

Goldman Sachs on Thursday topped expectations for fourth-quarter profit as equities trading and asset and wealth management produced nearly $900 million more in revenue than expected.  

Here's what the company reported:

The company said profit jumped 12% from a year earlier to $4.62 billion, or $14.01 per share, on gains across its capital markets businesses.

It's unclear whether the LSEG estimate for earnings per share includes a preannounced 46 cent per share gain from Goldman's sale of its Apple Card business. Either way, Goldman's profit handily topped analyst expectations.

The bank's revenue dipped 3% to $13.45 billion in the quarter, which the company said was the result of off-loading the Apple Card loan portfolio to JPMorgan Chase and the early termination of its contract with the tech giant.

Goldman Sachs' results show that, even despite the revenue hit from off-loading its credit card business, the firm's Wall Street-centric model is thriving in the current environment. High stock prices, falling interest rates, rising engagement from institutional investors, and continued global turmoil that has roiled markets for commodities and currencies have all proven to be a boost for investment banks. 

""We continue to see high levels of client engagement across our franchise and expect momentum to accelerate in 2026, activating a flywheel of activity across our entire firm,"" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an earnings presentation.

Goldman can, in the near term, exceed its firmwide targets of mid-teens returns and an approximate 60% efficiency ratio thanks to the capital markets rebound and industry deregulation, the bank said.

Like JPMorgan, Goldman's biggest source of outperformance in the quarter was from its equities franchise.

Equities trading revenue jumped 25% from a year earlier to $4.31 billion, about $610 million more than the StreetAccount estimate, as Goldman reaped more revenue from financing trades and selling derivatives to hedge funds and other institutional investors.

Fixed income trading revenue climbed 12% to $3.11 billion, about $180 million more than expected, on strength in wagers tied to interest rates and commodities. 

Investment banking fees surged 25% to $2.58 billion, matching the StreetAccount estimate, fueled by gains in mergers advisory and debt underwriting. In a positive sign for the business this year, Goldman said that its backlog of deals grew at year-end compared with the end of the third quarter.

The firm's asset and wealth management business saw revenue roughly unchanged from a year earlier at $4.72 billion, though that exceeded the StreetAccount estimate by about $270 million. Rising fees from its growing base of assets under management offset net losses from stakes in public equities and lower gains from private equities, the bank said.

In Goldman's smallest business, called platform solutions, the bank posted a $1.68 billion revenue loss for the quarter, compared with $592 million in gains from a year earlier. It cited the company's Apple Card exit for the hit to that unit's results.

Shares of the bank rose more than 1.5% in morning trading.

A solo Bitcoin miner beat the odds Thursday, taking home over $300,000 after processing a block on the leading crypto network. 

The term “solo” or “anonymous” miner refers to any mining operation not using one of the main mining pools. This could be a private company or one-man band. 

The miner solved block 932,373 of the Bitcoin blockchain, data from Mempool shows. 

Including fees, the lucky miner took home ‎3.157 Bitcoins. 

Bitcoin's price on Thursday stood at $96,199 per coin, according to CoinGecko, meaning the miner earned $304,814 at today's prices. 

Many solo miners, who are up against huge corporate Bitcoin miners, have beaten the odds as of late, with crypto enthusiasts constantly flagging the wins on social media. 

But while Thursday's miner was listed as “unknown” on Mempool, a website that shows transaction data, it's worth noting that the miner may have invested in a large setup to process the block.

Bitcoin miners are typically large operations — warehouses full of expensive computing equipment used to process transactions and mint new digital coins for the leading crypto network's economy. 

And while most blocks are processed by big companies that run mining pools, occasionally, independent miners can beat the big players. 

Anyone can begin mining Bitcoin — the process by which the network is secured. An anonymous miner can plug in and start working to process transactions on the blockchain, and whether or not they are a well-known company, one thing is for sure: They will likely be using a lot of money and resources to do so, as Bitcoin mining has become a tougher industry to make ends meet. 

Miners are rewarded with a flat fee of 3.125 Bitcoins per block they process, plus any transaction fees paid by those sending the cryptocurrency. 

With Bitcoin trading down, mining businesses have struggled to turn a profit, and many operations are now diverting resources to power the artificial intelligence and high-powered computing industries.

Oops, something went wrong

XRP gained 25% in early January while Bitcoin rose only 6%, and the XRP/BTC ratio improved 6.52%.

Reaching $18.40 per XRP requires a 794% gain and would create a $1.84T market cap.

Bird's prediction requires XRP to reclaim its 2017 high-water mark of 0.0002 BTC—a level last seen when XRP briefly challenged Ethereum for the #2 market cap position.

XRP's current market cap sits around $130 billion at $2.10. Reaching $1.84 trillion would require capital inflows that dwarf even the most aggressive ETF projections.

A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans' retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.

The XRP versus Bitcoin debate just went viral. Crypto influencer Bird claims that by year-end, 5,000 XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) could be worth 1 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC)—implying an XRP $18.40 target that would represent nearly 800% upside from current levels. The bold forecast has ignited fierce debate about whether XRP outperforms Bitcoin in the coming months.

With the altcoin season momentum building, the timing couldn't be more provocative. Here's a breakdown of the math behind the $18.40 XRP price target, and whether this bold forecast has any shot at becoming reality.

Bird is a well-known commentator within the XRP community who frequently shares market insights and bold forecasts on X/Twitter. In a recent post, Bird claimed that by the end of 2026, the XRP/BTC ratio would reach 1:5,000—meaning 5,000 XRP would be worth the same as 1 BTC.

This prediction taps into a long-standing belief among XRP supporters that the token is undervalued relative to its utility and adoption potential. Bird's forecast suggests a dramatic shift in market dynamics, where XRP significantly outpaces Bitcoin over the next twelve months.

The idea fits a familiar narrative. Altcoins, particularly XRP, often lag Bitcoin during the first leg of a bull run but later surge to outperform it. XRP holders have been waiting for this rotation for years, and Bird's prediction has given that hope fresh momentum as 2026 rolls on.

The math behind Bird's prediction is straightforward.. In early January 2026, the XRP/BTC ratio traded at approximately 0.00002235. For the target of 5,000 XRP per Bitcoin to be realized, the ratio must reach 0.0002 BTC per XRP token—a 794% gain at current XRP levels.

At Bitcoin's current price of $96,000, the ratio works out to exactly $18.40 per XRP.

With 100 billion XRP tokens in existence (including those held in Ripple's escrow), an $18.40 price implies a total valuation of $1.84 trillion. That would put XRP right alongside Ethereum and within striking distance of Bitcoin itself. That would place XRP firmly alongside Ethereum and within striking distance of Bitcoin's trillion-dollar valuation.

Bird's prediction isn't as crazy as it sounds when you look at how past bull markets have played out. Bitcoin typically leads, breaking new all-time highs first. But altcoins often catch fire in the second phase, when capital rotates out of Bitcoin and into higher-risk assets.

A few dynamics drive this rotation.

Profit Taking and Reinvestment: Investors who rode Bitcoin's initial rally often move profits into large-cap altcoins like Ethereum and XRP, betting they have more room to run.

Risk Appetite Expands: As confidence builds, fear of missing out shifts from Bitcoin to the tokens that haven't moved yet, and trading volumes and liquidity in altcoins spike.

Bitcoin Dominance Falls: Historically, the biggest altcoin rallies have coincided with Bitcoin's market share dropping—sometimes to as low as 38%. When dominance starts sliding, it's usually a sign that altcoin season has arrived.

Can Bird's prediction actually happen? Here's how the scenarios break down.

This scenario assumes everything goes right. Total annual ETF inflows could reach $10 billion—a  level Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick believes could push the XRP price to $8. The CLARITY Act passes, giving banks the green light to hold and settle with XRP directly.

For Bird's specific $18.40 target, XRP would need to outperform Bitcoin by over 700% and reclaim its 2017 ratio peak of 0.0002 BTC. It's a stretch, but not impossible if altcoin season fully ignites.

This scenario assumes XRP continues gaining institutional support but doesn't close the gap with Bitcoin's market cap. ETFs attract a few billion in assets, Bitcoin dominance falls to the 40–50% range, and XRP rides the altcoin rotation to modest gains. This lines up with consensus analyst estimates around $3.00 to $3.50.

Macro headwinds or ecosystem challenges could prevent an XRP price breakout. Geopolitical turmoil could send capital back into Bitcoin and gold. Banks could stick with private ledgers and established stablecoins instead of adopting XRP. Monthly escrow releases of 1 billion XRP, combined with fading ETF demand could cap any upside, leaving XRP to trade just above $2.

Bird's prediction that 5,000 XRP will equal 1 Bitcoin has captured the crypto community's attention for good reason. The math checks out—$18.40 is what you get if the ratio hits 0.0002. Whether XRP can actually get there is another question entirely.

The early signs in January 2026 are encouraging. XRP is outperforming Bitcoin, ETF inflows keep coming, and exchange reserves are at multi-year lows. That's the kind of setup that precedes big moves.

But 794% outperformance against Bitcoin in a single year would be historic. Even if XRP falls short of $18.40, the XRP/BTC ratio is worth watching closely. How it moves over the coming months will tell us a lot about whether this prediction was visionary or just viral

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don't.

And no, it's got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It's much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it's shocking more people don't adopt the habit given how easy it is.

Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.

Grab a coffee as Ethereum, crypto capital, and one of the world's biggest creators collide in a deal that has everyone talking.

YouTube star Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, may have claimed he has “negative money,” but his company, Beast Industries, just received a massive boost.

In a Thursday announcement, BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed a $200 million equity investment.

The deal was announced during BitMine's Annual Stockholder Meeting at the Wynn Las Vegas. The firm has positioned itself as a global leader in Ethereum liquidity, with a goal to acquire 5% of ETH. Data on StrategicETHreserve.xyz shows BitMine already holds 3.36% of ETH supply.

While the investment is made in USD-equivalent equity, BitMine's Ethereum treasury serves as the capital source, making the deal crypto-relevant.

It is increasingly deploying capital into high-profile ventures outside traditional blockchain projects.

“MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, are the leading content creators of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched by GenZ, GenAlpha, and Millennials,” read an excerpt in the announcement, citing Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine.

Lee acknowledged Beast Industries as the largest and most innovative creator-based platform in the world, noting that their corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.”

Beast Industries, valued at $5 billion, operates across multiple verticals. However, despite this valuation, Donaldson has previously admitted that his personal liquidity is extremely limited.

The $200 million investment is more than a celebrity headline. It reflects a broader trend of Ethereum liquidity flowing into the creator economy.

CEO Jeff Housenbold highlighted that the deal validates Beast Industries' growth trajectory and opens opportunities for future innovation, particularly in DeFi.

“We are excited to welcome Tom Lee and BitMine as new investors in Beast Industries, joining our current top-tier venture investors… We look forward to exploring ways to collaborate further and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform,” Housenbold said.

The deal is expected to close on or about January 19, 2026, giving Beast Industries additional runway.

The announcement offers a glimpse of a potential tokenized creator economy, where Ethereum-backed capital supports fractionalized fan ownership models.

With BitMine's involvement, the deal could serve as a blueprint for bridging Web2 content empires and DeFi-enabled finance. This demonstrates how Ethereum liquidity is extending far beyond traditional blockchain projects.

Meanwhile, Beast Industries has previously discussed the possibility of an IPO, aiming to give fans a chance to become owners.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies, the Ethereum treasury firm chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, unveiled a $200 million investment on Thursday in Beast Industries, a company founded by YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson, recognized worldwide as MrBeast.

In a press release shared with Decrypt, Lee described Donaldson, whose videos and social media posts generate millions of impressions and views daily, as a generational content creator “with a reach and engagement unmatched with GenZ, Gen Alpha, and Millennials.”

Lee also described Beast Industries as “largest and most innovative creator-based platform in the world,” which also oversees the creations and distribution of MrBeast-linked goods, including various merchandise and Feastables, a snacks and candy brand.

BitMine said the deal, among the most novel a crypto treasury firm has inked since the trend intensified on Wall Street last year, is expected to close within the next week.

In a statement, Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said the firm would explore ways to “incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform” moving forward. DeFi, or decentralized finance, entails the creation of blockchain-based financial services, such as trading or lending, that aren't reliant on traditional financial intermediaries like banks.

BitMine shares changed hands around $31.50 on Thursday, a more than 3% dip on the day, according to Yahoo Finance. Although the company is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, with a stockpile that's currently worth $13 billion, the company's stock has fallen 21% in the past six months amid broader signs of investor fatigue toward crypto-buying firms.

In October, Beast Financial applied for several U.S. trademarks, indicating that the company would provide crypto exchange, payment processing, banking, and insurance services. At the time, not all of the 52 trademarks owned by the company had led to actual products.

Alex Choi, Donaldson's key thumbnail strategist, warned on X in December that social media posts touting “MrBeast coin” were not legitimate. The crypto industry has a lengthy track record of scams, stemming from celebrity endorsements or social media hacks.

It was unclear how BitMine's investment would dovetail with its business, which includes the creation of a “Made in America Validator Network.” Validators serve an essential function on Ethereum's network by validating blocks of transactions, while also earning rewards.

Earlier this month, Rumble, which positions itself as a free-speech alternative to YouTube, integrated a crypto wallet into its platform for payments and tipping. The feature, backed by stablecoin issuer Tether, supports Bitcoin and tokenized gold.

Donaldson has been involved in crypto since at least 2021, purchasing NFTs from the storied CryptoPunks collection during the height of the pandemic-era crypto boom. He also promoted a gaming league in 2023 that generated controversy over its use of digital assets.

Months before, the company indicated in a shareholder presentation that it would make “select investments in bold ideas that enhance Ethereum Network Value.”

Ethereum has reached a new milestone with 30% of circulating tokens staked as analysts expect the second biggest cryptocurrency's price to surge. 

The staked Ether represents a $120 billion bet on the blockchain network, ValidatorQueue data shows. 

Bitmine has emerged as a top vote of confidence for the proof-of-stake mechanism by locking up $600 million in Ethereum on Wednesday. The digital asset treasury firm is now staking about $6 billion worth of the crypto, which is close to half of its total $13 billion in total holdings.

The fresh milestone comes as Ethereum's price rose 8% over the past week, trading at $3,359 at time of reporting. To be sure, it is still down 32% from its all-time high of $4,950 set back in August. 

Cryptocurrencies now trade at $3.3 trillion, around 25% below their October peak. Meanwhile, other assets like stocks and gold have pushed towards their all-time high in 2026.

But despite Ethereum's poor price performance relative to other assets, Wall Street is betting big on the blockchain network. 

JPMorgan chose it for the first-ever tokenised money market fund, an asset class valued at $9 trillion. Morgan Stanley also filed for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund product earlier this month.

British bank Standard Chartered told investors this month it expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin going forward and that the price will hit $40,000 per token by 2030.

Backed by top institutions including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, Bitmine is the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, now holding over 3% of the total supply.

Chair Tom Lee said on Monday that Bitmine “will be the largest staking provider” in the entire cryptocurrency industry and anticipates over $1 million daily in revenue from staking Ethereum.

Lee has urged all Bitmine shareholders to vote before a shareholder meeting on January 15 to support his proposal to increase the company's authorised shares to from 500 million to 50 billion in order to set the stage for a future stock split.

Bitmine's share price jumped 5% on Wednesday, Bloomberg data shows.

Lee argues that a stock split will be necessary because Bitmine's share price “follows Ethereum price,” and projects the company's stock trading at $5,000 per share when Ethereum reaches $250,000.

Publicly-traded companies perform stock splits to lower the price of a single share. That makes it seem more affordable for regular investors to buy in without changing the company's actual total value.

Lee, who is also head of research at Fundstrat, a Wall Street research firm, warned investors against fighting the White House in a video update to the firm's clients. 

“Washington is picking winners and losers,” Lee said, arguing that this dynamic matters more than macroeconomics or monetary policy. 

Lee said that losers include traditional credit card companies, the Federal Reserve, and institutional mortgage buyers amid President Donald Trump's push to cap credit card interest rates and political pressure on the Fed. 

Winners are firms in energy, materials, tech, crypto, industrials, financials, and other companies that benefit economic growth, he said.

After its recent price breakout, Ethereum (ETH) is facing its next big test and attempting to turn a crucial area into support. Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is ready to continue its bullish momentum, arguing that the biggest rotation in years is coming.

Ethereum Challenges Key Resistance Area

On Wednesday, Ethereum broke past a crucial area and retested the $3,400 level for the first time in over a month. The king of altcoins has seen a 6% increase in the daily timeframe, jumping from the $3,100 level to the current levels.

Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $3,000-$3,300 area since the start of the year rally, but failed to break the local range's upper boundary during last week's attempt. Now, the cryptocurrency has daily closed above this barrier and is testing this area as support.

Amid this performance, analyst Michaël van de Poppe affirmed that “it's ETH season” as the leading altcoin has held above the 21-day Moving Average (MA) since January 1. He explained that this level, officially lost during the early Q4 2025 corrections, is crucial for the price to hold onto to strengthen the momentum.

To the market observer, Ethereum is “ready to make new highs and continue the uptrend,” and based on this structure, his main scenario is that the cryptocurrency will likely retest the $3,800 area soon.

Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that ETH is currently facing a “big test.” The trader noted that the altcoin has been moving within its $2,600-$3,300 price range over the past two months, adding that a breakout from this range is necessary to define the direction of its next move.

Per the chart, Ethereum must reclaim the $3,350 level, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is located. This indicator has served as a key rejection area since November, and breaking above it “should lead to a move higher to catch the Daily 200MA next,” currently located around the $3,600 area.

ETH To Follow Its 2018 Playbook?

Crypto Jelle also shared an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency, asserting that Ethereum “looks better than it has looked in years” against both Bitcoin (BTC) and the US Dollar.

He argued that both charts are poised to move higher since ETH's downtrend against BTC is over, and its USD chart looks ready to push towards the $4,000 barrier again. He added that the ETH/BTC anticipated rally means “ETHUSD could see price move a lot higher over the coming months.”

Similarly, Alex Wacy recently explained that the “biggest ETH rotation in 8 years [is] forming right now.” The analyst highlighted that the king of altcoins is repeating the same playbook that led to its 2018 breakout against BTC, but with “bigger players” and “more capital entering.”

According to the chart, ETH saw a multi-year accumulation against Bitcoin between 2015 and 2017, leading to its massive expansion in 2018. After an initial breakout, the cryptocurrency re-accumulated for an extended period inside a falling wedge pattern, which resulted in a 50x pump from this structure.

This time, Ethereum's trading pair against BTC moved within a multi-year falling wedge pattern again, which was broken out of in Q4 2025. If history repeats itself, the altcoin could see a new massive surge against the flagship crypto over the coming months.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,375, a 5% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The next big move in crypto will not begin with Bitcoin. It will start with altcoins. Here are 6 altcoins that could move first.

In this video, I will walk you through six altcoins Altcoin Buzz is tracking before the next market move. Not hype picks. Not lottery tickets. These are projects with real demand, real users, and real catalysts. If the market turns, these are the coins that could move first. And that first move is where most of the gains are made.

Ripple (XRP) is the first on my list of today's altcoins that could do well with the next pump. It's a coin that I already covered a lot. Here's a playlist of all Altcoin Buzz-related Ripple videos.

In a surprising turn of events, XRP gained 20% during the first week of this year. It even surpassed BNB in its market cap. As a result, it lists now directly behind BTC and ETH. But the real stunning fact is that a project with such a big market cap can still move by 20%.

Ripple used to be under a lot of regulatory overhangs. That seems to have mostly gone away by now. Its long-running legal fight with the U.S. SEC has largely been resolved. Institutional interest in XRP is also thriving. There are currently six XRP spot ETFs. Together, they already attracted billions in inflows.

Just be aware that after 12 years, there's still 40% of XRP in the wallets of Ripple. Be aware of regular token dumps onto the market. The current XRP price is around $2.

Solana (SOL) is one of these altcoins that you can't miss out on for this list. It has also been regularly on my radar. Check out this playlist of my Solana-related videos. Solana is best known for its fast and low-cost transactions.

It also has gotten lots of institutional interest. There are currently at least seven SOL spot ETFs and two futures ETFs in the US. These also already have achieved billions in inflows.

However, it's also good to be aware of the current lawsuits against Solana and Pumpfun. Pumpfun is a launchpad, well-known for launching hundreds of thousands of memecoins. Allegations claim that token launches were manipulated. This gave insiders priority access via Solana's validator and tx infrastructure.

Pumpfun, the Solana Foundation, and the founders.

What was obvious has now reached the courtroom.
The 5.5 Billion USD RICO Case.

Here is everything summarized that is known so far:

This may be part of the current SOL price slumping around $140. However, it seems SOL is slowly recovering after having been down to the $120 region last month. Still, Solana's roadmap shows plenty of positive upgrades coming in soon.

Chainlink (LINK) is one of my all-time favorite altcoins. And yes, of course I have talked plenty of times about Chainlink. Take a look at this playlist of Chainlink videos. It's fair to say that it's the dominant decentralized oracle network. Chainlink feeds real-world data into smart contracts across blockchains. 

But that's not all. It has a lot more to offer. For instance, how about tokenization? RWA is one of the hottest crypto sectors around. Its growth can go 100-fold. Chainlink is in the midst of this developing sector. This goes hand in hand with a cross-chain approach. Say hi to Chainlink's CCIP protocol. This creates global connectivity between banks, DeFi apps, and public chains.

Understand why everyone is excited about @Chainlink & $LINK in 5 easy steps 🧵

1. What is the future of the crypto industry?

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

Basically, the tokenization of anything of value and the creation of services for those assets. It's the next… pic.twitter.com/eDDGNFGpfc

— ⬡ The_Crypto_Oracle ⬡ (@Crypto___Oracle) August 13, 2025



This makes LINK a utility token that sits in the center of attention. Eventually, all services are paid in LINK, even if users initially pay in fiat. Add to this the LINK reserve, and the current LINK price around $13 is undervalued. Part of this can be explained because Chainlink is a B2B platform. That's less interesting to your average investor.

The Sui Network (SUI) is one of the altcoins that had a fantastic 2025. For this year, I also see plenty of potential for Sui. Check out my playlist of Sui-related videos here. Whenever there's a rally, SUI is one of the leaders. That's a reason why I have Sui in today's list. 

Sui also offers fast and cheap transaction fees. However, one of the things that makes it stand out is its Move programming language. It offers various advantages over other languages. For instance, in security aspects. Sui also has its own stack. It offers everything from wallets to storage as an in-house package. 

We often talk about achieving mainstream user adoption in Web3.

Yet, hacks and scams have eroded trust in the industry.😔

Improving code security is critical to Web3's growth.

Sui also has a strong and clear roadmap for 2026. For example, it focuses strongly on stablecoins. Sui already has various native stablecoins available on its network. Private transactions are also in focus for this year. 

Sui unveils USDsui, a native stablecoin issued by @Stablecoin, a @Stripe company.

Fiat-backed, GENIUS-ready, and yield-sharing – USDsui anchors the Sui economy, powering payments, DeFi, and real-world use cases across the network. pic.twitter.com/ehI7txlODL

— Sui (@SuiNetwork) November 12, 2025



So, with a current SUI price between $1.80 and $2, there's potential for more upside in 2026.

Hedera (HBAR) is another altcoin to keep an eye on in 2026. I covered Hedera plenty of times. Here's a playlist of my videos. So, one of the things that sets Hedera apart is it's a hashgraph instead of a blockchain. In contrast to a blockchain, it offers,

Furthermore, Hedera is active in various sectors. For instance,

So, as you can see, Hedera offers plenty of use cases. This makes it versatile, and it's not a one-trick pony. Another fascinating part of Hedera is its governance council. This has some of the biggest global organizations in it. Think of names like Dell, Google, Hitachi, or IBM. This offers some high-level knowledge and influence in various fields. 

Hedera also launched the third ETF after BTC and ETH. This shows strong institutional interest. With the current HBAR price around 11 cents, you're looking at a good entry.

Today marks history as HBAR becomes the third ever crypto ETF to launch after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

To make this clear, out of the 19M+ cryptocurrency's that @CoinMarketCap tracks, it was the @CanaryFunds HBAR ETF that passed – citing @Hedera's institutional-grade network 🧵 pic.twitter.com/Rc5U6eX35M

Hyperliquid (HYPE) leads an entirely different field. It's the leading perps DEX. Its current daily volume is around $210 million. Perps DEXes took a real flight in 2025. For this year, I expect them to continue to be so popular. And, yes, I also covered Hyperliquid in this channel quite a bit. Here's a playlist for you.

Hyperliquid made a massive entrance with its HYPE TGE. That was in December 2024. It had a massive airdrop that gave some early users 6-digit airdrops. It set a wholly new standard for airdrops. And all that without a single VC in sight. That was quite impressive.

The biggest DeFi airdrop ever 👇

310M $HYPE dropped to the community on Nov 29, 2024.

When it hit its ATH of $59.37 on Sep 18, 2025, that airdrop was worth $18.39 BILLION 🤯

Even someone around rank 10,000 on the points leaderboard got over $150K+ in airdrop. Imagine what the… pic.twitter.com/iHRebZpCwh

HYPE is a token with plenty of utility as well. You can use it for governance or staking. The current HYPE price is around $24. Definitely something to keep an eye out for.

The new Digital Settlement House (LSEG DiSH) is an open-access platform which enables programmatic and instantaneous settlement between independent payment networks, both on and off chain. Through commercial bank deposits held on the DiSH ledger (DiSH Cash), the service will enable the 24/7 instantaneous movement of commercial bank money in multiple currencies and jurisdictions, PVP and DVP, providing a real cash leg for FX and digital asset transactions and settlements.  DiSH Cash will operate accounts at commercial banks, providing members with instant ownership of a commercial bank deposit at any bank within the network, and a mechanism for the 24/7 movement of commercial bank money. LSEG DiSH can facilitate settlement on its own ledger, or act as notary for settlement in other networks and assets. The launch follows a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) in collaboration with Digital Asset and a consortium of financial institutions, completing transactions on the Canton Network. Deposits were tokenised on the Canton Network for use as a true cash leg of the transactions.  Daniel Maguire, group head, LSEG Markets and CEO, LCH Group, says: “LSEG DiSH expands the tokenised cash and cash like solutions available to the market, and for the first time, offers a real cash solution tokenised on the blockchain utilising cash in multiple currencies held at commercial banks. This innovative service will enable users to reduce settlement risk, and integrate existing cash, securities and digital assets across new and existing market infrastructure.”

Home ➤ Banking & Finance ➤ NFT Trading Card Market

Quick Navigation

The Global  NFT Trading Card Market size is expected to be worth around USD 17.9 Billion By 2035, from USD 1.2 billion in 2025, growing at a CAGR of 31.6% during the forecast period from 2026 to 2035. North America held a dominan Market position, capturing more than a 68.4% share, holding USD 0.8 Billion  revenue.

The NFT trading card market refers to digital collectible cards created and owned as non-fungible tokens on blockchain networks. These cards represent unique digital assets linked to characters, sports figures, games, art, or entertainment franchises. NFT trading cards enable verified ownership, scarcity, and transferability through blockchain technology. Collectors can buy, sell, and trade these cards on digital marketplaces. Adoption includes collectors, gamers, brands, and entertainment platforms.

Demand for NFT trading cards is influenced by collector behavior and speculative interest. Some users collect cards for personal enjoyment and community status. Others view trading cards as digital assets with resale potential. Active marketplaces support liquidity and trading activity. This mix of motivations sustains demand. NFT trading cards are increasingly used as playable or utility-based assets. Cards may unlock features, characters, or rewards. Utility increases perceived value beyond collection.



In 2025, Sports cards account for 42.7%, making them the leading content type in the NFT trading card market. Sports-related NFTs attract strong fan interest and emotional attachment. Digital cards allow ownership, trading, and collection without physical limitations. Authenticity and scarcity improve perceived value. This segment benefits from regular sports seasons and events.

The dominance of sports cards is driven by established collector behavior. Fans are familiar with traditional trading cards and adapt easily to digital formats. NFTs enable instant transactions and global access. Digital ownership also supports long-term preservation. This sustains strong demand for sports card NFTs.

In 2025, Dedicated marketplaces represent 71.6%, highlighting their importance in NFT trading. These platforms are built specifically for NFT discovery and transactions. They offer tools for listing, bidding, and verification. User-friendly interfaces improve trading efficiency. Centralized access supports liquidity.

The preference for dedicated marketplaces is driven by trust and convenience. Buyers and sellers rely on specialized platforms for secure transactions. Marketplaces provide visibility for creators and collectors. Integrated wallets simplify asset management. This keeps dedicated platforms dominant.

In 2025, Ethereum accounts for 58.9%, making it the most widely used blockchain for NFT trading cards. The blockchain supports smart contracts and transparent ownership records. Its established ecosystem supports interoperability. Security and reliability remain key strengths. Many NFT platforms operate on this network.

The dominance of Ethereum is driven by early adoption and developer support. A large user base supports active trading. Standardization improves compatibility across platforms. Network familiarity builds confidence among users. This sustains Ethereum's leading position.

In 2025, Collectors and investors account for 76.5%, making them the primary end-user group. These users seek digital assets with long-term value. NFT trading cards appeal due to scarcity and uniqueness. Investors also track resale potential. Market activity remains strong.

Adoption among collectors and investors is driven by portfolio diversification. NFTs provide alternative digital assets. Trading cards combine nostalgia with technology. Transparent ownership improves confidence. This sustains strong participation from this group.



In 2025, North America accounts for 68.4%, reflecting strong adoption of digital collectibles. The region has a mature digital asset ecosystem. High awareness supports market growth. Platforms and communities are well established. The region remains dominant.



The United States reached USD 0.71 Billion with a CAGR of 29.15%, indicating rapid expansion. Growth is driven by collector interest and digital investment trends. NFT adoption continues to rise. Market activity remains strong. Momentum is expected to continue.



The NFT trading card market is being driven by a convergence of digital collectibles and blockchain-enabled ownership that appeals to both traditional collectors and digital enthusiasts. NFT trading cards embed unique identifiers on blockchain networks, enabling users to verify authenticity, trace provenance, and securely trade assets without intermediaries.

This transparency and security elevate confidence in transaction integrity and support broader engagement in digital asset communities. The rise of digital fandom cultures, combined with increased interest in gamified and scarce digital items, has amplified demand for NFT trading cards, as they offer novel avenues for ownership and social interaction across gaming, entertainment, and sports domains.

A significant restraint in the NFT trading card market stems from fluctuating market interest and value volatility, which can deter prospective collectors and traders seeking stable investment or long-term engagement. NFT asset prices are subject to rapid changes based on sentiment, hype cycles, and broader digital asset market dynamics, creating uncertainty for participants.

Additionally, the technical complexity of blockchain interactions, including wallet setup and transaction costs, may limit user adoption outside of technologically experienced communities. These factors can constrain participation among mainstream audiences who may view digital collectibles as niche or speculative.

Emerging opportunities in the NFT trading card market are linked to enhanced interoperability and utility within digital ecosystems. Projects are increasingly exploring integration of NFT cards with gaming platforms, virtual worlds, and loyalty programs, creating functional value beyond mere ownership.

NFT cards can serve as in-game assets, unlock exclusive experiences, or confer membership benefits, broadening their appeal to active digital consumers. As ecosystems evolve, linking NFT trading cards to tangible incentives or cross-platform utilities can elevate user engagement and create diversified value propositions for collectors and brands alike.

A central challenge confronting the NFT trading card market is balancing creative innovation with sustainability and accessibility. Blockchain networks that support NFT minting and trading consume energy and incur transaction costs, which raises concerns about environmental impact and user affordability.

Addressing these concerns requires adoption of more efficient blockchain protocols and fee-optimised networks to make participation more sustainable and inclusive. Moreover, ensuring that digital collectibles maintain long-term relevance and do not become ephemeral trends demands consistent developer investment in platform features, community management, and engaging use cases.

Emerging trends within the NFT trading card landscape include the rise of dynamic and programmable NFTs that evolve based on user interactions, achievements, or external data feeds. These advancements enable cards to change attributes, unlock new abilities, or adapt rarity levels, creating deeper engagement cycles for collectors and gamers.

Another trend is the collaboration between digital artists, brands, and franchises to produce limited-edition drops that blend cultural relevance with collectible scarcity. Integration of secondary-market analytics and rarity scoring tools also supports more informed trading and price discovery for users.

Growth in the NFT trading card market is supported by expanding digital collector communities and increased mainstream interest in blockchain-based entertainment formats. As awareness of and access to NFT platforms improve, more creators and brands are entering the space to offer distinctive digital assets.

Technological improvements that simplify wallet interaction, reduce transaction costs, and enhance user security further strengthen market participation. The broader shift toward digital ownership models and virtual asset economies reinforces interest in trading cards as engaging, verifiable, and tradable digital collectibles.

Dapper Labs, OpenSea, and Sorare lead the NFT trading card market by enabling large scale minting, trading, and ownership of digital sports and collectible cards. Their platforms support licensed content, blockchain based scarcity, and active secondary markets. These companies focus on user friendly interfaces, strong brand partnerships, and liquidity. Rising interest in digital collectibles among sports fans and gamers continues to reinforce their leadership.

NBA Top Shot, Topps, Candy Digital, and Sky Mavis strengthen the market through officially licensed trading cards and play to earn ecosystems. Their offerings combine real world franchises with interactive digital ownership. These providers emphasize authenticity, limited editions, and community engagement. Growing acceptance of blockchain collectibles in mainstream sports supports wider adoption.

Home ➤ Information and Communications Technology ➤ Artificial Intelligence ➤ AI-Powered NFT Generator Market

Quick Navigation

The Global AI-Powered NFT Generator Market size is expected to be worth around USD 46.38 billion by 2035, from USD 2.56 billion in 2025, growing at a CAGR of 33.6% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2035. North America held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 38.1% share, holding USD 0.97 billion in revenue.

The AI powered NFT generator market refers to platforms and tools that use artificial intelligence to create digital assets that can be minted as non-fungible tokens. These tools generate visual art, music, animations, and other digital content based on predefined inputs, styles, or datasets. AI powered NFT generators are used by artists, designers, game developers, brands, and content creators. Adoption supports faster creation of unique digital assets.

One major driving factor of the AI powered NFT generator market is the demand for scalable digital content creation. NFT platforms and marketplaces require large volumes of unique assets. AI generators enable rapid production without proportional increases in creative effort. This scalability supports wider participation. Another key driver is the growing interest in creator economy platforms. Independent creators seek tools that reduce technical and artistic barriers.



Demand for AI powered NFT generators is influenced by growth in blockchain-based digital marketplaces. As NFT platforms expand, content supply requirements increase. Creators and brands require tools that generate differentiated assets quickly. This fuels consistent demand. Demand is also shaped by the rise of virtual environments and digital experiences. Gaming, metaverse platforms, and virtual events rely on unique digital items.

For instance, in September 2025, SuperRare acquired an AI art verification startup, enhancing authenticity checks for generative works. Sales of AI-curated pieces jumped 35%, solidifying San Diego's role in premium AI-NFT spaces.

Investment opportunities in the AI powered NFT generator market exist in platforms that combine creation and minting workflows. Integrated solutions simplify asset production and blockchain interaction. These platforms attract both novice and professional users. End-to-end functionality improves adoption. Another opportunity lies in industry-specific NFT generators. Tools designed for gaming assets, music NFTs, or brand collectibles offer focused value.







Hardware accounts for 56.2%, indicating its important role in AI-powered NFT generation. High-performance processors and graphics units support intensive image and asset creation tasks. Hardware ensures stable performance during model execution and rendering. Reliable infrastructure is essential for consistent output quality. Professional users prioritize dependable systems.

The dominance of hardware is driven by compute-heavy workloads. NFT generation requires fast processing for design and validation. Dedicated hardware reduces latency and errors. On-premises setups benefit from controlled environments. This sustains steady demand for hardware components.

For Instance, in December 2025, OpenSea launched a hardware-optimized toolkit for AI NFT generation, using GPU clusters to speed up image rendering.

Early users report double the speed on dedicated setups.

Art represents 30.5%, making it the leading application segment. AI tools help artists generate unique digital assets. Automated creation supports rapid experimentation. Visual diversity improves creative output. Artists value efficiency and originality. Growth in this application is driven by digital art adoption. Creators seek new ways to express ideas.

AI tools reduce manual effort. Artistic NFTs attract collector interest. This keeps art as a central application. For instance, in October 2025, SuperRare rolled out an AI art generator feature, letting artists input prompts for unique digital canvases. It focuses on fine art styles, minting directly as NFTs with editable traits. This highlights art's dominance as users flood in for creative tools. Feedback shows quick adoption among digital painters.

On-premises deployment accounts for 57.4%, reflecting preference for local control. Users manage sensitive creative assets internally. Local systems provide predictable performance. On-premises setups reduce reliance on external networks. Security remains a key factor.

Adoption of on-premises deployment is driven by ownership concerns. Artists and enterprises protect intellectual property. Custom configurations improve workflow alignment. Offline capability supports uninterrupted creation. This sustains strong on-premises usage.

For Instance, in November 2025, Rarible introduced on-premises deployment kits for their AI NFT tools, allowing full local control over generation servers. Enterprises set up private hardware to handle sensitive designs without cloud risks. It matches the mode's top share by prioritizing security and customization for heavy users.

Large enterprises represent 70.2%, highlighting their dominant role. These organizations invest in digital asset creation at scale. AI tools support brand and content strategies. Centralized systems ensure consistency. Reliability is critical for enterprise operations.

Adoption among large enterprises is driven by commercialization goals. Enterprises use NFTs for marketing and engagement. AI automation improves production speed. Integration with existing systems supports efficiency. This sustains strong enterprise participation.

For Instance, in January 2026, Nifty Gateway partnered with big firms for enterprise-grade AI generators, deploying custom hardware for bulk NFT creation. Large teams use it for branded collectibles in campaigns. This reinforces their lead, as scale demands robust backends that only they can run smoothly.

Artists account for 39.3%, making them the largest end-user group. Independent creators use AI tools to expand creativity. NFT generators lower technical barriers. Artists gain control over production. Accessibility supports wider participation. Adoption among artists is driven by monetization opportunities. Digital marketplaces reward unique content.

AI tools help scale output. Reduced costs improve sustainability. This keeps artists at the forefront. For Instance, in September 2025, Zora updated its minting page with AI prompts for artists, simplifying custom font and color ties to generated art. Independent creators mint fragments and sketches easily now. It cements artists' top spot by lowering barriers to full creative control.



North America accounts for 38.1%, supported by strong digital creative ecosystems. The region shows high adoption of blockchain-based assets. Technology awareness supports market growth. Creative communities drive demand. The region remains influential.

For instance, in January 2026, Zora launched AI minting capabilities, allowing users to generate and mint NFTs instantly using text prompts powered by advanced AI models. This innovation, enabling model creators to earn passive income from AI outputs, solidifies North American leadership in AI-NFT integration.



The United States reached USD 0.84 Billion with a CAGR of 30.5%, reflecting rapid expansion. Growth is driven by creator economy development. AI adoption accelerates asset creation. Demand for digital ownership continues to rise. Market momentum remains strong.

For instance, in October 2025, OpenSea pivoted to a crypto trading aggregator with AI-driven minting tools, facilitating $1.6 billion in crypto trades and $230 million in NFT transactions in early October. This development reinforces U.S. dominance in AI-powered NFT generation by leveraging its massive user base for seamless AI-enhanced NFT creation and multi-chain trading.






OpenSea, Rarible, and Mintable lead the AI powered NFT generator market by enabling creators to generate, mint, and trade AI generated digital assets at scale.

Steve Aoki is facing a class action lawsuit related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that alleges significant financial losses for investors. The suit also names Matthew Kalish, a co-founder of DraftKings, for their roles in promoting the now-defunct Metazoo NFT series.
Details of the Lawsuit
The lawsuit claims that Aoki and Kalish leveraged their social media platforms to endorse Metazoo NFTs without disclosing they were compensated for these promotions. The lead plaintiff, Evan Berger, states that he has incurred losses amounting to tens of millions of dollars due to this promotion.
Background on Metazoo
Founded in 2000, Metazoo Games LLC initially specialized in tabletop collectible card games. The company branched out into various products, including skateboards and clothing, before venturing into NFTs.            



 



At its peak, a complete set of the Metazoo Coin NFT sold for 20 Ethereum, roughly valued at $80,000 at the time. However, Berger argues that after investing in 26 NFTs influenced by Aoki and Kalish's endorsements, their value has now plummeted to nothing.
Investor Insights

Investors' Rights: Berger emphasized the importance of regulations protecting consumers within the NFT market.
Influencer Accountability: He highlighted the need for influencers to adhere to specific legal requirements when promoting products.

Berger remarked, “There is a specific set of rules in place to protect consumers, and it's crucial that influencers know those rules.”
Aoki's NFT Journey
Aoki became an equity partner in Metazoo in 2021 and collaborated with the company to release a collectible card series for his album, HiROQUEST: Genesis.
Coincidentally, Aoki recently released HiROQUEST 3: Paragon Remixed, which features various tracks. He previously claimed to have earned more from NFTs than from a decade's worth of music advances.
Interestingly, this is not Aoki's first legal challenge; he has previously faced lawsuits related to his unique cake-throwing antics during performances.            



 



Conclusion
The ongoing lawsuit against Aoki and Kalish underscores the complexities and risks associated with investing in NFTs. As they navigate this legal matter, it raises questions around influencer marketing and consumer protections in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.

A new agreement governing the working relationship between the Information Commissioner's Office and the government could help restore damaged public trust in the state's use of their data, the regulator has claimed.

The two parties have unveiled a new memorandum of understanding which clarifies each's “respective roles to protect people's information [and] sets out an enduring framework and approach to co-operation and collaboration”.

The document details a range of underlying principles agreed upon by both government and the ICO, as well outlining actions that each will take – individually and jointly.



The two parties have committed to “work together to ensure the public can see real benefits in sharing their data and trust that it will be protected” and also to “work collaboratively and transparently, taking a ‘no surprises' approach”.

To ensure this cooperation takes place, the ICO and government – which will be represented by the Cabinet Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology – will meet at least once a year “to review the progress and relevance of the MOU”, and will also “jointly provide an update on our work together on a regular basis”.

For its part, government has pledged to “publish an annual assurance statement on how people's data is being kept safe and how new and proposed technologies and processes have been designed with trust and privacy in mind”.

Other clear actions enshrined in the new agreement include the establishment of “a clear process for responding to a personal data breach” – which all civil servants will be asked to follow. Government will also “seek the ICO's expert advice when it has identified that the use of personal data in the delivery of a policy or a system carries a significant risk” and take steps to “ensure that, at all times, there is an accountable and named individual responsible… for managing cross-government data protection risk and compliance” – a responsibility which is currently held by the government chief data officer, Aimee Smith.

Other, less measurable commitments include a promise to focus on “prioritising public trust and confidence in the government's handling of personal data” and to help cultivate “a cross-government culture of continuous learning around improving information security”.

“This includes gathering intelligence and learning lessons from personal data breaches and ‘near misses' and implementing actions that would prevent a future similar breach,” the MOU adds.

Government also plans to “raise awareness of civil servants on how to share data safely… and inform [them] of the real-world consequences of inadvertent personal data breaches”.

The commitments will be supported by efforts to “track key indicators that monitor civil service maturity and awareness of information management”.

In fulfilling its part of the deal, the ICO vows to “use its expertise and resources” to assist with government's efforts to train civil servants on issues of data security, as well as supporting the creation of the new blueprint for responding to a data breach.

The data watchdog also promises to “use its intelligence, including from breach reports and contact with the ICO advice services, to identify trends and potential risks and share their insights and trends with government to take action”.

Another pledge contained in the MOU is to “provide regulatory certainty by producing timely and relevant products including guidance, codes of practice, advice notes, opinions and audits that support government and the public sector to use people's data safely”.

When there is an incident to which the regulator needs to respond, the ICO says that it will “be transparent with the public when holding an organisation to account for a breach”.

Other commitments set out in the arrangement include a stipulation that the data regulator will “provide independent and expert advice in response to government raising a substantial risk” and, finally, that it “will recognise that senior responsible officers in DSIT and Cabinet Office are responsible for driving collaboration between departments and… will work with both officers to support that”.

Following the publication of the MOU – which was undersigned by security minister Dan Jarvis, digital government minister Ian Murray, and information commissioner John Edwards – the ICO issued a statement claiming that the new arrangement has come in light of “several serious, high-profile data breaches that undermined public trust in government, some of which also placed lives at risk”.

“We have been clear that government needs to do more and move faster to improve data security as part of wider data protection practices, and we welcomed the government's commitments to the chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee in 2025,” the ICO added.

“This MOU formalises that action, setting clear expectations and a pathway for government to address concerns about its approach to data protection, rebuild trust with the public and improve transparency and accountability in how government departments treat and handle people's personal information. This MOU is further strengthened by the leadership of the government chief data officer and expert network of departmental data protection officers who play a vital role in embedding good data practice and culture across government.”

In a written ministerial statement on the MoU, Jarvis said: “It is essential that we have strong public trust in the government's protection of sensitive personal information. This Memorandum of Understanding sets out a shared understanding of how government and the ICO will work towards better government data security and use.

""The Memorandum of Understanding will help ensure that the measures we have in place to protect sensitive data are robust and support this government's ambition to use new technologies to transform public services, create a modern digital government, and drive economic growth.”

KINGSTOWN, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a move shaking up the decentralized finance landscape, GeeFi unveiled a major update to its flagship product, the GeeFi Wallet. The latest release delivers a breaking development for the project's community and newcomers alike: the GEE token presale is now fully integrated into the non-custodial app, allowing users to participate directly from within their wallet. This strategic shift further cements GeeFi's commitment to accessibility, security, and user empowerment as the next generation of crypto adoption accelerates.

Presale Integration: Seamless Participation for Early Investors

This update comes at a vital moment for GeeFi, with Phase 3 of the GEE token presale quickly approaching capacity. Fewer than 3 million tokens remain available at $0.10 each, putting early participants in a favorable position to capitalize before the price advances. The built-in presale feature removes common barriers by eliminating the need to navigate third-party sites, ensuring that both newcomers and crypto-savvy users can acquire tokens with minimal friction. With a planned listing price of $0.40 per token, initial buyers could see an impressive 300% ROI at launch. If industry predictions of a $2 price point materialize, those who secure tokens during this round could expect a remarkable 1,900% potential return.


















GeeFi Wallet: Secure, Multi-Chain, and Feature-Rich

Beyond the presale, the GeeFi Wallet itself stands out with its robust, user-centric capabilities. As a non-custodial solution, it provides full ownership and control over private keys, prioritizing user sovereignty. Security is further reinforced with biometric authentication for instant, protected access. Support for more than 14 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Tron means users can manage a diverse portfolio in one place. The wallet also boasts built-in swap and bridge functionality for easy token movement across chains, as well as NFT management and an integrated Web3 browser to explore a wide universe of decentralized apps.

The Road Ahead: GeeFi DEX and Crypto Cards

The wallet update is part of a broader initiative to build a cohesive, feature-packed ecosystem. High on the GeeFi roadmap are the upcoming GeeFi DEX and GeeFi Crypto Cards. The GeeFi DEX will give users access to decentralized trading directly from their wallets, upholding the project's vision of true user autonomy and financial inclusion. Meanwhile, the forthcoming Crypto Cards will bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, enabling users to pay at merchants worldwide by seamlessly converting crypto to fiat at the point of sale.


















A New Era for GeeFi, Join Now

The integration of the presale into the GeeFi Wallet marks a pivotal milestone for the project and its community. By removing entry barriers and delivering advanced features, GeeFi is setting a benchmark for convenience and innovation in DeFi. Prospective investors and crypto enthusiasts are encouraged to download the GeeFi Wallet now to secure tokens before the presale concludes and to explore the evolving GeeFi ecosystem.

The Government and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at raising data protection standards across public sector organisations.

The agreement, announced on 8 January, follows a series of high-profile data breaches that eroded public trust and, in some cases, put lives at risk, such as the data breach at the Ministry of Defence in 2025. The MoU formalises the government's commitment to improving data security and transparency, building on pledges made to the chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology (SIT) Committee in 2025.

Under the agreement, the government will work to rebuild public confidence by enhancing accountability in how personal information is handled. The Government chief data officer and departmental data protection officers will play a key role in embedding best practices across government bodies.

The ICO, as the UK's data protection regulator, will provide advice, scrutiny, and challenge to ensure compliance. The MoU also reinforces the ICO's ability to hold government departments accountable if standards are not met.

As part of the commitment, the government will publish an annual assurance statement on GOV.UK, detailing progress on data protection improvements. This includes both ongoing work and future initiatives that use new technologies to innovate public services while safeguarding personal data.

The agreement marks a step toward greater transparency and accountability in government data practices.

As Ofcom is tasked with investigating the use of Grok, the AI platform from Elon Musk, for making and sharing harmful images of women and children, the ICO released a statement on the issue: ""People have a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect. We are aware of reports raising serious concerns about content produced by Grok. We have contacted X and xAI to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals' rights. Once we have reviewed their response, we will quickly assess whether further action may be required.""

As the calendar year begins, it's a good time for schools to take stock of recent guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This article highlights some key areas of recent focus, offering a practical overview of how schools can stay compliant. 

The ICO has issued new guidance to help the education sector feel confident about sharing personal data to safeguard children. The guidance emphasises that data protection law supports, rather than conflicts with, effective safeguarding.

The ICO aims to give schools greater confidence when sharing personal data for safeguarding reasons. The guidance uses practical case studies to illustrate how data protection law operates alongside safeguarding duties in different situations. It also reiterates the ICO's established view that, in many cases, children from the age of 12 years old can reasonably be presumed capable of exercising their own data protection rights.

Data protection training for staff should reassure them that it is possible to comply with data protection and safeguarding - the two are not in conflict.

Recent enforcement action by the ICO highlights the risk of staff using personal devices for work. In December, the ICO fined the password manager provider LastPass after attackers gained access to the personal data of millions of users partly due to a compromised employee device. If your school allows staff to use personal devices you must have robust security measures in place. The ICO and the National Cyber Security Centre have published guidance in this area.

All staff (and governors) must receive information security training and guidance. This should cover points such as how to recognise phishing emails, how to work from home securely, choosing strong passwords and who to speak to if they suspect a personal data breach.

We have developed an Information Security Policy for independent schools which forms part of our Data Protection Handbook, and also created information security e-learning. Please get in touch if you would like more information about these products.

Updates to the ICO's subject access request guidance take account of the Data (Use and Access) Act. Although many of the Act's provisions are not currently in force, the guidance provides early support to help organisations plan for future implementation.

The guidance covers the obligation to do a reasonable and proportionate search for personal data (now on a statutory footing), the changes under the Act around seeking clarification and the ICO's latest interpretation of the ability to refuse to respond to manifestly unfounded or excessive requests.

We have observed an increase in subject access requests submitted to schools, highlighting the importance of preparation to ensure requests can be handled efficiently. For example:

China continues to advance its digital yuan project, implementing new features and pushing forward on the cross-border payments platform Project mBridge. Here are the top lines to know:



For years, the prevailing assumption among policymakers and market observers was that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), especially China's digital yuan (e-CNY), would struggle to gain traction. Slow adoption, limited use cases, and public skepticism were expected to constrain their impact. New data from China, however, tell a different story.

Five years after its first pilot, the e-CNY remains the world's largest live central bank digital currency experiment. By the end of November 2025, it had processed more than 3.4 billion transactions worth roughly 16.7 trillion renminbi (about $2.3 trillion). That represents a more than 800% percent increase from 2023, according to new data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) at the end of December.

But this wasn't the only news out of Beijing around the turn of the year. On January 1, a new management and measurement framework for the e-CNY took effect. Officials framed the adoption of this framework as a shift from the pursuit of “digital cash” toward deeper integration with the regulated financial system. Combined with China's continued investment in wholesale CBDC infrastructure, most notably Project mBridge, these changes signal a more mature phase for the digital yuan. The question is no longer whether China wants a CBDC but what economic role Beijing expects the e-CNY to play at home and abroad—and how the e-CNY fits into a financial landscape increasingly shaped by stablecoins, cryptocurrency, a rise in gold holdings, and geopolitical tension.

The digital yuan is often mischaracterized as a state-run competitor to private payment platforms such as Alipay or WeChat Pay. In practice, it serves a different function. The e-CNY is sovereign digital money: legal tender issued by the central bank, distributed through commercial banks, and designed to operate both online and offline. After five years of piloting, the e-CNY has not displaced private payment platforms; instead, it has been integrated selectively into public-sector payments, into government disbursements, and in controlled commercial settings. In many ways, the objective is not superior convenience but the preservation of a public digital money option as cash usage declines and private platforms dominate daily payments.

Institutional changes have also reinforced this shift. In October last year, PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng announced the establishment of an E-CNY Operations and Management Center in Beijing to oversee the digital yuan's systems and domestic infrastructure, complementing the Shanghai-based International Operations Center, which officially launched in September 2025 and is focused on cross-border use cases. Both centers fall under the jurisdiction of the PBOC's Digital Currency Research Institute and are expected to operate in tandem—one focused on domestic system development and the other on international applications—to form what Pan described as a “two-winged” architecture supporting the digital yuan's growth. Staff working on the e-CNY project grew from around forty to approximately three hundred in 2022, reflecting Beijing's commitment to building robust operational capacity.

The proliferation of coordinating bodies signals a shift in priorities toward governance, supervision, and scale, but also toward a much broader geopolitical ambition. In his landmark June 2025 speech at the Lujiazui Forum, Pan placed the e-CNY within China's vision for a “multipolar international monetary system,” arguing that such a system “can prompt sovereign currency issuers to strengthen policy constraints, enhance the resilience of [the] international monetary system, and more effectively safeguard global economic and financial stability.” Without naming the dollar explicitly, Pan warned that in times of geopolitical tension, “the global dominant currency tends to be instrumentalized or weaponized.” The e-CNY plays a key role in China's ambitions on these fronts, especially for the internationalization of the renminbi and as a strategic counterweight to dollar hegemony.

In short, all these initiatives and messages show that China is getting the e-CNY ready for primetime.

At home, Beijing's priority is adoption. This has been pursued primarily through incentives and the gradual integration of the e-CNY into public-sector and platform-based payment ecosystems. The digital yuan has been used for tax rebates, subsidies, medical insurance payments, and other public disbursements.

These applications allow the government to send money directly to specific recipients, track how it is spent in real time, and set rules on where it can be used. The same e-CNY features that improve efficiency, however, allow the state to have more visibility into transactions, raising persistent concerns about privacy and financial autonomy.

The most consequential shift is the introduction of interest-bearing features to the e-CNY. This moves the e-CNY beyond a pure payment instrument and closer to a savings-adjacent asset. By making the digital yuan interest-bearing, the PBOC clearly aims to make the CBDC more attractive and increase domestic adoption.

The move could be a game-changer. Other central banks have explored similar concepts on paper (the European Central Bank has discussed tiered remuneration for a potential digital euro, and Israel's central bank has highlighted the importance of holding limits on user balances and of interest-rate tools). But China is the first major economy to operationalize such features at scale. An interest-bearing CBDC directly affects household saving behavior, bank funding, and monetary transmission, placing the digital yuan closer to the core of macro-financial policy.

The e-CNY may also serve as Beijing's answer to stablecoins. While cryptocurrency trading and mining remain banned in mainland China, dollar-denominated stablecoins have emerged as an important source of liquidity and a growing tool for cross-border payments. But from China's perspective, these instruments represent private digital monies operating outside direct state visibility. In many ways, the PBOC response has been to absorb the appealing functions of stablecoins, such as speed, programmability, real-time settlement within a sovereign, and a tightly regulated framework. Making the e-CNY interest-bearing may be a central part of this approach. It allows the digital yuan to compete not by mimicking crypto markets but by offering deposit-like features within the formal financial system. This is an interesting contrast to the debate currently playing out in Washington over whether stablecoins can be yield-bearing.

In 2025, China pursued an expansive strategy internationally, making the digital yuan one of the most prominent cross-border CBDC experiments to date. At the retail level, China is now testing the e-CNY in cross-border use in border regions and tourism-oriented economies such as Hong Kong, Macau, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore. Chinese tourists pay local merchants using e-CNY wallets issued by Chinese banks, with transactions executed through QR code. The PBOC has also experimented with limited foreign-user access, including pilot programs allowing foreign visitors to open capped e-CNY wallets in China and top them up using foreign bank cards.

At the wholesale level, China continues to develop Project mBridge, a cross-border payments platform designed to enable direct settlement between central bank digital currencies. Originally incubated under the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub, the project brings together the PBOC, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Central Bank of Saudi Arabia. Early pilots led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 2022 processed just 164 transactions totaling roughly $22 million. In October 2024, the BIS stepped back from direct involvement, transferring governance fully to participating central banks.

Since then, activity on the platform has accelerated sharply. Under the partner central banks' leadership, mBridge has processed more than four thousand cross-border transactions with a cumulative value of approximately $55.49 billion—representing a roughly 2,500-fold increase in transaction value since 2022. The digital yuan accounts for approximately 95.3 percent of total settlement volume. In November last year, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance executed the first government financial transaction using the wholesale digital dirham on the mBridge platform. The transaction tested operational readiness and direct integration between government payment systems, settling funds without intermediaries. The pilot marked the formal launch phase of the United Arab Emirates' wholesale CBDC and demonstrated mBridge's viability for real-world public-sector payments. Looking ahead, mBridge is increasingly oriented toward trade settlement, particularly in energy and commodity-linked transactions, where China already plays a central commercial role.

Taken together, these developments point to a gradual expansion of the yuan's internationalization through digital infrastructure. Rather than seeking to displace the dollar outright, China is building parallel settlement rails that reduce reliance on dollar-based systems. Project mBridge is unlikely to challenge dollar dominance directly, but it may incrementally erode it across specific corridors, sectors, and use cases.

The PBOC's priorities for the e-CNY in 2026 are likely to include deeper integration with the banking system, expanded use in trade settlement, and more direct competition with stablecoins by offering returns comparable to demand deposits. At the same time, Beijing is strengthening the institutional and technical foundations of the e-CNY as part of its broader goal of “steadily developing the digital [yuan]” under the country's fifteenth five-year plan.

The e-CNY raises many of the same policy questions confronting other CBDC pilots, from privacy and oversight to technology and infrastructure. China stands out not for redefining these debates but for the speed at which it executed the e-CNY: few jurisdictions have moved as quickly or as comprehensively from experimentation to deployment, and if the PBOC continues at this pace, it is possible to see a full-scale launch this or next year. Given its scale, sophistication, and integration into national strategy, the digital yuan is likely to remain a central feature of China's economy and of the global future of money debate for years to come.

Until a few weeks ago, Eric Adams was the mayor of New York City. Now that he's out of power, he isn't wasting any time figuring out what to do next. Earlier this week, Adams launched a meme coin, the proceeds of which he claimed would fight “anti-Americanism” and antisemitism as well as help teach children about meme coins. Adams announced the coin with a splashy Fox News interview. How the meme coin was supposed to provide money for any of its goals was unclear.

What was clear is that hours after the coin launched, somebody involved in its creation—we really don't know who, because everything is done with anonymous digital currency wallets—took out $2.5 million from the pool of cash that investors had put in to buy the coins. Then, for reasons that are equally mysterious, another $1.5 million was put in (maybe because the creators thought they'd given away the game too early).

The transactions had the hallmarks of what in the meme coin business is known as a “rug pull.” This is when a new coin launches, its backers sell millions of dollars worth, then take out the money and make the coin worthless. We've seen it before with Haliey Welch, or “Hawk Tuah girl,” who hawked her meme coin and closed up shop after collecting a marketing fee. There was Caitlyn Jenner, who was sued over the $JENNER, which Business Insider pegs as the first celebrity meme coin. There are many others.

After Adams' meme coin imploded, I tried to figure out precisely how it was supposed to work in the first place. How would his token provide money to fight “anti-Americanism”? How precisely was money transferred from the buyers to the creators? What exactly did Adams mean when he promised in a promotional video that his NYC Token was “about to take off like crazy?” After the whole fiasco, Adams released a statement on X saying that he did not move the funds, or profit from the launch. So if anyone made money from this, who was it?

A documentary on state television highlights how a senior central bank official was bribed with a digital currency

Beijing has revealed how its graft-busters are investigating bribes paid in hard-to-trace cryptocurrencies by tracking the ways in which corrupt officials have been spending the proceeds.

Investigators became suspicious when Yao bought a villa in Beijing for more than 20 million yuan (around US$2.9 million) under the name of a family member.

They later concluded that he had been given 2,000 ether coins by the director of an unnamed digital currency firm he had helped to list on an exchange and had cashed in 370 of these digital tokens for 10 million yuan in 2021 – when the currency's value peaked.

Investigators from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) also found that he had been given a cash bribe of 12 million yuan by an unnamed information services company.

Yao, 56, led the team that developed the digital renminbi and also headed technology supervision at China's securities regulator. The anti-corruption watchdog said he had used his influence within the crypto sector for his own gain.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- The unbridled optimism that permeated the crypto industry during Donald Trump's first year back in power is giving way to angst, after a much-awaited digital-asset bill was delayed in the Senate amid frenzied debate over the treatment of stablecoins.

The Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday delayed its discussion of the bill, hours after Coinbase Global Inc. pulled its support for the latest version. Among elements of the bill Coinbase and other firms are lashing out against are limits on their ability to offer yield or rewards on customers' stablecoin holdings.

Stablecoins are a key pillar of the cryptoasset universe, and usage is booming after the US passed legislation governing them in July. After their success helping get Trump elected and the stablecoin bill passed, crypto executives now fear the impasse over tokens pegged to the dollar could prevent the US regulatory framework from catching up with other markets. 

“This delay is concerning as it creates a probability for the US to be one of the only major digital assets hubs without a clear capital markets rulebook in 2026,” said Dea Markova, director of policy at Fireblocks, a crypto custody services provider.

Shares of Coinbase fell as much as 4%, while Circle Internet Group Inc. and Gemini Space Station Inc. each slipped around 5%.

The latest proposal suggests paying stablecoin yield will be banned, although some types of rewards may be allowed. But the language around exactly what kind of rewards would be permitted isn't straightforward, according to Nana Murugesan, a former senior executive at Coinbase.

Crypto companies have long enticed users with yield and rewards as a way to motivate them to hold their digital assets for longer, rather than converting them back into fiat currencies. Some tokens, like Ethena's dollar-pegged USDe, offers yield as a built-in part of their structure.

Coinbase offers rewards to users who hold Circle's USDC stablecoin in their accounts, akin to the returns traditional savings accounts feature.

“Stablecoin rewards sit at the intersection of payments, savings-like behavior, and market incentives,” said Ari Redford, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs. That explains why “a narrow technical issue has become a central policy question as the bill moves through markup.”

Limits on such rewards could put crypto firms regulated in the US at a disadvantage, some executives said.

“Whenever things are unclear, it is then again subject to interpretation,” said Murugesan. “If there are any restrictions, the theory is that's only going to disadvantage US companies as opposed to offshore companies who are going to continue to give rewards out.”

The banking industry has warned that yield-bearing stablecoins could siphon deposits away from traditional lenders. Legislation approved last year allows banks to issue their own stablecoins, and several crypto companies have since applied for a bank charter. That law, called the Genius Act, bans stablecoin issuers from offering interest.

The swift reaction from Coinbase — which is among donors for the ballroom Trump is building in the White House — also hints at how the industry is flexing its newfound clout in Washington. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's chief executive and a Trump supporter, said in an X post that he was pulling support for the latest text of the bill due to “too many issues.”

That drew a retort from Senator Cynthia Lummis, a committee member, who said on X that such responses from crypto outfits “proves they just are not ready.”

Prediction Markets:

Global markets were steadier on Thursday after a volatile prior session, with investors digesting easing geopolitical tensions, shifting equity leadership in the United States, and a series of policy and regulatory developments spanning currencies, crypto, and technology. 

Commodity prices pulled back from recent highs, while Asian equities were mixed. 

Meanwhile, Washington signaled further uncertainty regarding crypto regulation and the Federal Reserve's leadership.

Asian markets and global assets react to easing tensions

Oil prices retreated from multi-month highs and gold eased from a record peak after US President Donald Trump sought to calm market anxiety over the risk of US military action against Iran. 

Brent crude futures fell 3.3% to $64.32, while Nymex futures dropped 2.4% to $60.51, after having climbed as high as $66.82 and $62.36, respectively, in the previous session. 

Gold slipped 0.8% to around $4,585 per ounce, after touching a record $4,642.72 on Wednesday.

Equity markets in Asia were mixed, with tech shares facing renewed selling pressure after declines on Wall Street. 

In Japan, the tech-heavy Nikkei fell 0.8% after hitting an all-time high in the prior session, while the broader Topix rose 0.5% to a fresh record. 

Taiwan's TAIEX dropped 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.4%, weighed down by technology stocks. 

Mainland Chinese blue chips were flat, while South Korea's KOSPI added 1% to a record high after the Bank of Korea left interest rates unchanged and signaled an end to its current easing cycle.

Currency markets paused after sharp moves in the yen. 

The Japanese currency weakened overnight to its lowest level since July 2024 against the dollar before rebounding amid warnings of possible intervention. 

The dollar index was flat at 99.107, while the yen eased to 158.32 per dollar after surging to as high as 159.45.

Japanese bond yields pulled back slightly from record peaks. 

The 20-year yield eased two basis points to 3.14% after hitting an unprecedented 3.165% in the prior session. 

Recent volatility has been driven by expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament's lower house and call a snap election, a move investors see as potentially leading to larger fiscal stimulus.

Senate delays crypto market-structure markup

In Washington, the Senate Banking Committee delayed discussion of a closely watched crypto market-structure bill, hours after Coinbase Global withdrew its support for the latest draft. 

Committee Chairman Tim Scott said a markup of the legislation would be postponed as bipartisan negotiations continue, without setting a new date.

“I've spoken with leaders across the crypto industry, the financial sector, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, and everyone remains at the table working in good faith,” Scott said. 

The market-structure bill aimed at strengthening the legitimacy of digital assets had been scheduled for markup on Thursday, a stage that includes debate and proposed amendments. 

However, on Wednesday, Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong said on social media platform X that he was withdrawing support for the bill's latest draft, citing “too many issues.”

The delay could complicate the bill's path to passage ahead of midterm elections. 

Trump says no plans to remove Powell

President Trump said he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite a Justice Department probe into the central bank's renovation project. 

“I don't have any plan to do that,” Trump said in an interview with Reuters, adding it was “too early” to determine whether the probe could provide grounds to remove Powell. 

Federal law allows Federal Reserve governors to be removed only for cause, not over policy disagreements.

Trump also said he was unfazed by criticism from Republican lawmakers who have raised concerns that the investigation could be seen as an effort to influence interest-rate decisions.

Trump reiterated that he intends to nominate Powell's successor within the next few weeks and praised potential candidates Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh.

xAI blocks Grok from creating sexualized images

Separately, Elon Musk's xAI said it is disabling the ability of its Grok chatbot to create sexualized images of real people following widespread criticism. 

“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” the company said. 

Subscribers to X's premium service can continue to use Grok to edit images and generate other AI-created visuals that comply with the platform's terms of service, the company said. 

It added that Grok has been restricted from producing images of real people in bikinis, underwear, or similar attire in jurisdictions where such content is illegal.

The move comes amid investigations by regulators in the US, Europe, and Asia, as scrutiny intensifies over the misuse of generative AI tools.

Americans Overwhelmingly Support Science, but Some Think the U.S. Is Lagging Behind

A new report finds that a majority of Americans think the U.S. should be a world leader in science, but Democrats increasingly believe other countries are catching up

Americans are proud of their country's science prowess: a majority believe it is important for the U.S. to be a world leader in science, according to the Pew Research Center's latest report on trust in science.

The number of people who hold this view is five percentage points higher than it was in 2023, the last time Pew asked the same question, according to data from more than 5,000 people surveyed in October 2025.

But people who voted Democratic in the 2024 presidential election tended to hold a very different view than Republican voters on whether the country is living up to its promise. Between 2023 and 2025, the proportion of Democrats who believe that the U.S. is losing ground in science compared with other countries jumped by 28 percentage points. About two thirds of Democrats now hold this view.

Republicans are more positive about the country's standing in science—a complete switch in sentiment since the last time Pew asked this question, says Brian Kennedy, one of the authors of the new report and a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center. And the split between both groups is far wider than it was at previous times when Pew asked the same question in the past five years, he says.

In 2022 and 2023 the difference between Democratic and Republican opinion was “far more modest,” Kennedy says, with both groups responses' within 7 percentage points of each other. “Now we see this much bigger difference between Republicans and Democrats in our relative standing in science compared to other countries.”

Last year the Trump administration cut federal funding for science. The administration slashed millions of dollars in grants for science across myriad disciplines and walked back its own research and regulations based on science, particularly in the areas of climate change and health and medicine. Meanwhile experts have warned of a “brain drain,” partly motivated by the administration's strict immigration policies, with researchers choosing to study or live overseas instead of in the U.S.

Despite these cuts, the majority of Americans—84 percent—thought federal investments in science aimed at advancing knowledge were worthwhile. Republican voters, however, were more likely than their left-leaning peers to be open to private companies playing a key role in science, Kennedy says.

“One thing we've seen in our surveys over a number of years is that support for science funding is pretty widespread among both Republicans to Democrats,” he says. “This is a pretty consistent finding.”

Indeed, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have advanced several legislative efforts to claw back some of the targeted federal funding for science agencies.

Ultimately, the report shows that Americans' trust in science and scientists remains broadly strong—but not as strong as it was before the COVID pandemic. During 2020 and 2021, public trust cratered. And while it has recovered somewhat, it remains lower than it was before that period.

“There's a broader context of trust and confidence going on in society,” Kennedy says. Still, he points out that Pew survey participants have consistently ranked scientists among the most trustworthy groups in society for the past 10 years. “Scientists have consistently ranked toward the top with the military, while elected officials generally were ranked toward the bottom,” he says.

Astronauts Return to Earth in First ISS Medical Evacuation

On Thursday NASA chief Jared Isaacman said the experience of the returned Crew-11 will be used to prepare for future human spaceflight—including to the moon

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

One of the most notable chapters in the history of NASA is coming to something like a close: after calling for an unprecedented medical evacuation of four astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS), these space farers are safely home. The episode has left myriad unanswered questions about what exactly happened to prompt the stunning decision to end their mission early—a first in the history of the ISS.

When asked at a Thursday press conference if NASA planned to release further information about the medical situation that prompted the evacuation, agency chief Jared Isaacman said it is “very committed to being transparent.”

“There are some medical privacy considerations here. That said, to the extent that we are in a position to share more information publicly and have the necessary consent, we would do so,” he said.

“Obviously, we took this action because it was a serious medical condition,” Isaacman said. “The astronaut in question is fine right now, in good spirits and going through the proper medical checkouts.”

Crew-11 splashed down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule off the coast of California at approximately 3:41 A.M. EST. The evacuating Crew-11 includes NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. NASA has not identified which of these astronauts experienced the medical issue. “The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so,” Isaacman said on Thursday.

The crew is undergoing medical evaluation on a receiver ship and is headed to a hospital in San Diego, Calif., for further investigation and care, said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator of NASA's Space Operations Missions Directorate, at the same conference.

Whatever happened to Crew-11 could influence how the agency prepares for future human spaceflight missions, including the upcoming Artemis II moon flyby. NASA will conduct a full debrief and review of the Crew-11 mission, Isaacman said.

“When we go through the debrief on this, we're going to learn a lot about the things we got right and did it very well and make sure we apply that in other applications going forward,” Isaacman said.

The ISS is equipped with an array of medical equipment, drugs and diagnostic tools—all of which the station's crew know how to use. That means most minor ailments can be dealt with onboard: wounds can be sutured, blood can be taken and ultrasounds can be done. But NASA evidently decided that whatever occurred was serious enough that the ISS was not the place to keep the ailing astronaut. The agency plans for these contingencies on every mission, Isaacman said.

“There are early return options on Artemis II. There are options to bring astronauts back from the space station in hours, not days. So I think that the fact that we did take some extra time here does speak to the stability of the situation,” he said.

Dubbed a super ship, the Svaelget 2 is nearly 92 feet long and was likely built around 1410.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Tucked in the waters off the coast of Copenhagen, maritime archaeologists discovered the world's largest cog, a Viking-age medieval cargo ship with a scale so impressive for the time that experts wonder how much it can teach them about 15th -century trade. Some are also giddy about locating a timber castle on the stern.

“It is the largest cog we know of, and it gives us a unique opportunity to understand both the construction and life on board the biggest trading ships of the Middle Ages,” Otto Uldum, maritime archaeologist and excavation leader with Denmark's Viking Ship Museum, said in a statement.

The ship, built around 1410, sat buried for 600 years in the straight between Denmark and Sweden. Seabed work ahead of construction of a new Copenhagen district unearthed the find under sand and silt. Named the Svaelget 2 after the channel where it was found, it's the largest cog ever discovered at nearly 92 feet in length, 30 feet in width and 19 feet high, and can hold an estimated 300 tons of cargo.

“A ship with such a large cargo capacity is part of a structured system where merchants knew there was a market for the goods they carried,” Uldum said. “Svaelget 2 is a tangible example of how trade developed during the Middle Ages. It is clear evidence that everyday goods were traded. Shipbuilders went as big as possible to transport bulky cargo—salt, timber, bricks, or basic food items.” 

Dubbed a super ship of the Middle Ages, the North Sea region was responsible for the creation of the cog, which Uldum called an efficient ship that required a relatively small crew, even when full of goods. The ships were known to travel from present-day Netherlands through the Sound and into the trading towns of the Baltic, binding Northern Europe together in the 15th century. The size and scope of the cog transformed trade patterns that were once limited to luxury goods and made them accessible to commodities as well. 

Efficiency wasn't the only calling card, with the Svaelget 2 offering the first-ever archaeological evidence of cogs featuring timber-built castles on the stern, used by the crew to stay protected. Typically, researchers only locate the bottom of ships, so finding a castle is a first and was also a major design advancement for Viking-age ships. 

Analysis into the Svaelget 2 shows it features planks made from Pomeranian oak sourced from present-day Poland, and the ship's ribs required timber from the Netherlands. The combination suggests the heavy planking timber was imported, while the frames of the cog were cut locally. “It tells us that timber experts went from Pomerania to the Netherlands,” Uldum said, “and that the ship was built in the Netherlands where the expertise to construct these very large cogs was found.” 

Located over 42 feet deep in the water, the museum said the ship was preserved by the sand, so much that the team found pieces of the ship's rigging, a first for a cog, which broadens understanding how it was equipped for sailing. “The finds show how something as complex as the rigging was solved on the largest cogs,” Uldum said. “Rigging is absolutely central to a medieval ship, as it makes it possible to control the sail, secure the mast, and keep the cargo safe. Without ropes and rigging, the ship would be nothing.”

Along with wood, the team located a brick-built galley. With around 200 bricks and 15 tiles, the crew could cook over an open fire. Elsewhere in the galley, crews found bronze cooking pots, tableware, and ceramic bowls. 

Other finds on the Svaelget 2 include painted wooden dishes, shoes, combs, and rosary beads. Despite all the discoveries, there's no clue as to what the ship's cargo may have been. This is likely because the merchant ship's hold was uncovered, allowing any goods to float away, leaving behind only the remnants of the world's largest medieval super ship.

SAFARI is a biodegradable gelatin or cellulose pill casing with a radiofrequency chip that sends a signal confirming medication has been taken.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

With all the apps and gadgets we have to track our medications, which go beyond the plastic pill cases of the past, most of us have still forgotten to take at least one pill some time or another. What might just be a momentary brain glitch for some could be dangerous for those who have received organ transplants or are living with certain conditions. Now there is something much more effective than an app for that. 

For anyone who cannot remember if they took medication that could literally mean the difference between a normal day and being rushed to the hospital in critical condition, a team of MIT researchers led by mechanical engineer Giovanni Traverso have come up with an ingenious “smart pill” that does it for them with a radiofrequency signal. People being treated for chronic infections such as tuberculosis or HIV must take specific medications at certain times throughout the day. Organ transplant patients are put on immunosuppressive drugs so their immune system can accept the new organ, and just one miss could result in the body rejecting it. Survival after that would be unlikely.

Forgetting medication has proved to be a massive problem in the US, resulting in about 125,000 preventable deaths and $100 billion in additional costs each year. Traverso's bioresorbable smart pill, known as SAFARI (Smart Adherence via FARaday cage And Resorbable Ingestible) encases medications and is made completely of materials that biodegrade and factor out the need for replacing batteries or having to retrieve the device for repair. English scientist Michael Faraday was far ahead of his time when he designed the Faraday cage or shield in 1836. Such a device is used to shield objects from electromagnetic fields, and this structure prevents SAFARI from releasing any signals until it is ingested.

“SAFARI establishes a foundational framework for the development of next-generation, eco-conscious adherence monitoring solutions and associated interventions—ultimately aiming to bolster therapeutic outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures,” Traverso said in a study recently published in Nature Communications.

SAFARI is a gelatin carrier capsule with a radiofrequency chip and antenna, all of which are covered in an electromagnetic interference shielding coating made of molybdenum. The chip is pre-loaded with information on drug dosage and other important information. Even the metal chip is made mostly of ingestible zinc foil. Its radiofrequency antenna sends a signal shortly after medication has been taken. Healthcare professionals can use an external reader to track the dose. After the patient has been alerted, its electronic components safely break down in the gastric fluid of the stomach without causing buildup or blockage, and the tiny radiofrequency chip makes its way through the digestive tract until it leaves the body. Not only can the smart pill be used to encapsulate medications, but its system can be built into existing capsules.

While SAFARI has not been tested in humans yet, the device was tested in pigs, whose digestive tracts are most similar to ours, with promising results. It was also tested in natural and artificial gastric fluid to make sure that its components would dissolve properly. SAFARI is also relatively easy to manufacture, with some components being printable. The capsule can be printed from gelatin or HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose). This is not a device that will end up on drugstore shelves, since it is intended for patients whose lives hinge on taking their medication.

Traverso has ambitious plans for continued development of this technology.

“Ongoing work will expand these findings through chronic exposure modeling and pharmacokinetic analyses to confirm safety for lifelong use,” he said. “Future work includes development of battery assisted RFID systems to extend the detection range, further improving the application of the electronic medication adherence technology.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New research challenges the cold dark matter assumption","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260114084113.htm","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:43:46 GMT","

Scientists from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and Université Paris-Saclay are calling into question a long-standing idea about dark matter. Their latest findings suggest that this elusive substance may have been ""incredibly hot""-moving at nearly the speed of light-when it first formed, rather than cold and slow as researchers have long assumed.

The work was published in Physical Review Letters, the flagship journal of the American Physical Society. By reexamining how dark matter may have emerged in the early Universe, the study expands the range of possible explanations for where dark matter came from and how it may interact with other forms of matter.

Challenging the Cold Dark Matter Assumption

For decades, scientists believed dark matter had to be cold when it separated from the intense radiation filling the young Universe, a process known as freezing out. Cold dark matter moves slowly, a property thought to be essential for forming galaxies and large-scale cosmic structures. To revisit this assumption, the research team focused on a critical but less explored phase of cosmic history called post-inflationary reheating.

During reheating, the Universe was rapidly filling with particles following the end of cosmic inflation. The researchers examined how dark matter could have been produced during this energetic period and what that would mean for its later behavior.

Why Hot Dark Matter Was Once Rejected

""The simplest dark matter candidate (a low mass neutrino) was ruled out over 40 years ago since it would have wiped out galactic size structures instead of seeding it,"" said Keith Olive, professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy. ""The neutrino became the prime example of hot dark matter, where structure formation relies on cold dark matter. It is amazing that a similar candidate, if produced just as the hot big bang Universe was being created, could have cooled to the point where it would in fact act as cold dark matter.""

In the past, fast-moving particles like neutrinos were dismissed because their high speeds would have smoothed out matter in the early Universe, preventing galaxies from forming. This made cold dark matter the preferred explanation for decades.

Cooling Down in Time to Build Galaxies

The new study shows that dark matter does not necessarily need to start out cold. The researchers demonstrated that dark matter particles could separate from other matter while still ultrarelativistic-or extremely hot-and still slow down enough before galaxies began to form. The reason this works is tied directly to reheating, which provides enough time for the particles to cool as the Universe expands.

""Dark matter is famously enigmatic. One of the few things we know about it is that it needs to be cold,"" said Stephen Henrich, graduate student in the School of Physics and Astronomy and lead author of the paper. ""As a result, for the past four decades, most researchers have believed that dark matter must be cold when it is born in the primordial universe. Our recent results show that this is not the case; in fact, dark matter can be red hot when it is born but still have time to cool down before galaxies begin to form.""

Looking Ahead to Detection and the Early Universe

The team plans to build on these results by exploring how such dark matter particles might be detected. Possible approaches include direct searches using particle colliders or scattering experiments, as well as indirect detection through astronomical observations.

""With our new findings, we may be able to access a period in the history of the Universe very close to the Big Bang,"" said Yann Mambrini, professor from the Université Paris-Saclay in France and co-author on the paper.

The research was supported by funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement.

Foams appear in everyday life as soap suds, shaving cream, whipped toppings and food emulsions like mayonnaise. For many years, scientists believed foams behaved much like glass, with their tiny components locked into disordered but essentially fixed positions.

New research now challenges that long-standing view. Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania have found that while foams keep their overall shape, their interiors are in constant motion. Even more unexpectedly, the mathematics describing this motion closely resemble deep learning, the technique used to train modern artificial intelligence systems.

This finding suggests that learning, in a broad mathematical sense, may be a shared organizing principle across physical, biological and computational systems. The work could also guide future efforts to create materials that adapt and respond to their surroundings. It may even help scientists better understand living structures that must continually reorganize themselves, such as the internal scaffolding of cells.

In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers used computer simulations to follow the movement of bubbles within a wet foam. Instead of eventually becoming stationary, the bubbles kept wandering through many possible arrangements.

From a mathematical viewpoint, this behavior closely resembles how deep learning works. During training, an AI system repeatedly adjusts its parameters -- the information that defines what an AI ""knows"" -- rather than locking into a single final state.

""Foams constantly reorganize themselves,"" says John C. Crocker, Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) and the paper's co-senior author. ""It's striking that foams and modern AI systems appear to follow the same mathematical principles. Understanding why that happens is still an open question, but it could reshape how we think about adaptive materials and even living systems.""

Why Foams Defied Traditional Physics

Foams often behave like solids at the human scale. They generally keep their shape and can spring back after being squeezed. At much smaller scales, however, foams are considered ""two-phase"" materials, made of bubbles suspended in a liquid or solid background.

Because foams are easy to make and observe while still displaying complex mechanical behavior, scientists have long used them as model systems to study other dense and dynamic materials, including living cells.

Traditional theories treated foam bubbles like rocks rolling across an energy landscape. In this view, bubbles move downhill into positions that require less energy to maintain, then stay there. This idea helped explain why foams appear stable once formed, much like a boulder resting at the bottom of a valley.

A Mismatch Between Theory and Reality

When researchers examined real foam data, they found the behavior did not align with these predictions. According to Crocker, signs of this mismatch appeared nearly two decades ago, but there were no suitable mathematical tools to fully explain what was happening.

""When we actually looked at the data, the behavior of foams didn't match what the theory predicted,"" Crocker says. ""We started seeing these discrepancies nearly 20 years ago, but we didn't yet have the mathematical tools to describe what was really happening.""

Solving this puzzle required a new approach, one that could describe systems that continue changing without ever settling into a single, fixed arrangement.

Lessons From Artificial Intelligence

Modern AI systems learn by continuously adjusting numerical parameters during training. Early approaches tried to push these systems toward a single optimal solution that perfectly matched their training data.

Deep learning relies on optimization methods related to a mathematical technique called gradient descent. These methods repeatedly guide a system toward configurations that reduce error, step by step, much like moving downhill across a landscape.

Over time, researchers realized that pushing models too far into the deepest possible solutions caused problems. Systems that fit their training data too precisely became fragile and performed poorly on new information.

""The key insight was realizing that you don't actually want to push the system into the deepest possible valley,"" says Robert Riggleman, Professor in CBE and co-senior author of the paper. ""Keeping it in flatter parts of the landscape, where lots of solutions perform similarly well, turns out to be what allows these models to generalize.""

Foam and AI Follow the Same Rules

When the Penn team reexamined their foam data using this perspective, the similarity became clear. Foam bubbles do not settle into deep, stable positions. Instead, they continue moving within broad regions where many configurations are equally viable.

This ongoing motion closely parallels how modern AI systems operate during learning. The same mathematics that helps explain why deep learning works also captures what foams have been doing all along.

Implications for Materials and Living Systems

The findings raise new questions in a field many believed was already well understood. That alone may be one of the study's most important contributions.

By showing that foam bubbles are not frozen in glass-like states but instead move in ways similar to learning algorithms, the research encourages scientists to rethink how other complex systems behave.

Crocker's team is now revisiting the system that first sparked his interest in foams: the cytoskeleton, the microscopic framework inside cells that supports life. Like foam, the cytoskeleton must continually reorganize while preserving its overall structure.

""Why the mathematics of deep learning accurately characterizes foams is a fascinating question,"" says Crocker. ""It hints that these tools may be useful far outside of their original context, opening the door to entirely new lines of inquiry.""

A research team from the University of Liverpool has reported new evidence suggesting that sharp increases in blood sugar following meals may raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The findings point to after-meal glucose levels as a potential factor in long-term brain health.

For years, studies have shown that conditions such as hyperglycemia, diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance are linked to poorer brain health. These metabolic problems have been associated with higher chances of cognitive decline and various forms of dementia. However, exactly how blood sugar disruptions contribute to these brain changes has remained unclear.

Large Genetic Study Using UK Biobank Data

To explore this connection, researchers examined genetic and health information from more than 350,000 UK Biobank participants between the ages of 40 and 69. The analysis focused on key indicators of how the body manages sugar, including fasting glucose levels, insulin levels, and blood sugar measured two hours after eating.

The team used Mendelian randomization, a genetic method that helps researchers assess whether certain biological traits are likely to play a direct role in disease risk. This approach allowed them to test whether different measures of blood sugar regulation could be linked to the development of dementia.

Post-Meal Blood Sugar Linked to Alzheimer's Risk

The analysis showed that individuals with higher blood sugar levels after meals had a 69% higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This specific pattern of elevated glucose, known as (postprandial hyperglycemia), stood out as a key factor.

Importantly, the increased risk was not explained by overall brain shrinkage or damage to white matter. This suggests that elevated after-meal blood sugar may affect the brain through more subtle biological processes that are not yet fully understood.

Implications for Prevention and Future Research

Dr. Andrew Mason, lead author said: ""This finding could help shape future prevention strategies, highlighting the importance of managing blood sugar not just overall, but specifically after meals.""

Dr. Vicky Garfield, senior author commented: ""We first need to replicate these results in other populations and ancestries to confirm the link and better understand the underlying biology. If validated, the study could pave the way for new approaches to reduce dementia risk in people with diabetes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Statins may help almost everyone with type 2 diabetes live longer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260115022812.htm","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:18:37 GMT","

A large long-term study has found that statins, a widely used class of cholesterol-lowering medications, significantly reduce the risk of death and serious heart-related problems in adults with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, these benefits were seen even in people who were considered to have a low chance of developing heart disease within the next 10 years. This challenges a long-standing debate over whether preventive statin treatment is worthwhile for patients who appear to be at lower cardiovascular risk.

Statins are commonly prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol, what many people know as bad cholesterol. High LDL levels are linked to clogged arteries, heart attacks, and strokes. People with type 2 diabetes already face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but doctors have not always agreed on whether statins are necessary for those whose short-term heart risk appears minimal. The new findings suggest that statins may offer protective effects for a much wider group of diabetes patients than previously believed. The study was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The research team, led by scientists from the University of Hong Kong, examined health records from the IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK database. Their goal was to assess both the effectiveness and safety of starting statin therapy for primary prevention. Primary prevention refers to preventing a first heart attack or stroke before any such event has occurred.

The study focused on adults in the United Kingdom with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 25 and 84. Participants were followed for as long as 10 years. At the start of the study, none of the individuals had serious heart disease or significant liver problems, allowing researchers to more clearly assess the effects of statins without interference from existing severe conditions.

Statins Reduced Death and Heart Events at Every Risk Level

Researchers compared people who began taking statins with those who did not, grouping them based on their predicted 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This risk estimate is commonly used in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions.

Across all risk categories, statin use was linked to lower rates of death from any cause and fewer major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Even participants classified as low risk experienced measurable benefits, which directly challenges the assumption that statins only help people already at high risk of heart disease.

Safety Findings and What They Mean for Patients

In terms of safety, the researchers observed a very small increase in myopathy in one risk group. Myopathy refers to muscle-related side effects, which can include weakness or soreness and are a known but uncommon concern with statin use. No increase in liver-related problems was found, addressing another common worry among patients and clinicians.

Based on these results, the authors concluded that doctors should carefully consider the advantages of statin therapy for all adults with type 2 diabetes, even when a person's short-term predicted risk of cardiovascular disease is low. The findings suggest that relying solely on short-term risk estimates may cause some patients to miss out on treatments that could help them live longer and avoid serious heart complications.

Lesion network mapping (LNM) is a neuroimaging framework that uses normative functional connectivity (FC) data to link heterogeneous brain lesions and functional alterations to brain networks implicated in neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, many of the networks identified by LNM and related methods appear to be highly similar across diverse conditions such as addiction, depression, psychosis and epilepsy. To understand this similarity, we re-examined the data from multiple LNM studies and assessed the methodological roots of the method. Our findings reveal a foundational limitation: at its core, LNM involves a repetitive sampling of one and the same FC matrix. As a result, it systematically maps sets of local brain changes—whether they are patient lesions, magnetic resonance imaging-derived alterations, synthetic or random—onto the same nonspecific properties of the used FC data, producing highly similar networks across conditions. This central limitation cautions the use of LNM as a method for studying distinct biological networks underlying brain disorders. Our work may aid the development of a new generation of network-mapping methods from first principles.

Identifying brain regions and circuits that give rise to neurological and psychiatric symptoms is a central goal of fundamental and clinical neuroscience. Charting the relationship between brain alterations and behavior has long served as a cornerstone of this effort, from linking brain injury to behavioral outcomes1,2,3 to systematic studies leveraging modern neuroimaging techniques4. Progress has, however, been more elusive for complex neurological and psychiatric conditions, where patients can often exhibit highly spatially distributed and heterogeneous brain abnormalities5,6,7.

The method of ‘lesion network mapping' (LNM)8,9, also known in literature under alternative terms such as ‘causal brain mapping'10, ‘causal network localization'11, ‘lesion network-symptom mapping'12,13,14,15, ‘network localization'16,17, ‘atrophy network mapping'18, ‘remission network mapping'19, ‘coordinate network mapping' or ‘coordinate-based network mapping'20,21,22, ‘activation network mapping'23, ‘network-based meta-analytic' analysis24, among others (Supplementary Table 1), has rapidly gained traction as a framework to trace and unite topographically heterogenous lesions and other brain alterations to underlying brain circuits10,11,15. Collectively referred to as the LNM framework, this method maps the anatomical locations of brain alterations onto normative functional brain connectivity (FC) to examine whether, and if so how, these alterations converge onto a common underlying network. The framework posits that alterations in different brain regions can give rise to similar clinical symptoms when they disrupt the same functional brain network. Over the past years, LNM studies have reported such functional networks for a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)25, epilepsy26,27, autism spectrum disorder (ASD)28, schizophrenia29, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)30 and migraine20, among many others (see refs. 31,32,33 and a 2025 PubMed/ClinicalTrials.gov search for review; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1). Notable LNM findings include the ‘causal depression network'15,34,35,36, a ‘psychosis circuit'37 and brain circuits related to addiction38, all highlighted as promising for clinical application15,25,26,38,39,40.

However, many of these reported LNM networks—purportedly delineated as disease-specific—seem to converge on strikingly similar brain networks. As illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, the LNM networks reported for psychiatric conditions such as addiction38, migraine20, PTSD25 and schizophrenia29, but also for neurological conditions such as vertigo41, Capgras syndrome42, Parkinson's disease43 and disrupted volition16, appear to implicate one and the same system, a network involving bilateral insular cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and parts of the frontopolar cortex, thalamus and cerebellum. This observation is unexpected, considering the substantial heterogeneity in etiology and symptomatology of these conditions.

Extensive overlap is evident in the insula, ACC and frontal pole. l–n, LNM networks derived from random lesions also show highly similar LNM outcomes. For example, lesions that disrupted agency16 and spin-randomized versions of these lesions (middle row) across the brain, as well as completely randomized seed locations (bottom row), result in similar LNM outcomes (shown in n). o,q, Plot of the spatial correlation between the original LNM map (disrupted agency16) and a typical example from the randomized conditions. p,r, Randomization of lesions was repeated 1,000 times, with almost all occasions resulting in highly similar LNM maps between the original (disrupted agency) and random conditions (box plots show values of n = 1,000 permutations; (p) minima = 0.06, maxima = 0.92, center = (median) 0.75, bounds of box (Q1 25th percentile–Q3 75th percentile) = 0.66–0.81, whiskers = 0.43–0.92; (r) minima = 0.58, maxima = 0.96, center = (median) 0.84, bounds of box (Q1 25th percentile–Q3 75th percentile) = 0.81–0.87, whiskers = 0.72–0.96). s, The application of LNM (Lead-DBS) on lesions associated with addiction remission (top left, lesion masks taken from ref. 38). The panel also shows LNM outputs on the same lesion set but now spin-randomized across the cortex (top right, exemplary spin, r = 0.48), following a random selection of 100 lesions with mixed symptomatology (bottom left, ‘mixed lesions', r = 0.93), and based on 100 synthetic lesions (bottom right, r = 0.71). All approaches yield very similar LNM maps. t–v, Plots show data (ASD28) from an alternative null analysis, with the connections of the group connectome C binarized and randomized (t, left = original matrix, right = randomized matrix). Once again, LNM analyses resulted in very similar maps.

ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; BP, bipolar disorder; MDD, major depressive disorder; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; s subjects; SCZ, schizophrenia.

Examining this spatial overlap between published LNM networks in more detail substantiates the observed high spatial alignment. For example, published LNM networks for PTSD25 and cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease43 show high spatial correlation (r = 0.73; see Fig. 1b,c, Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 2 for data sources). Similar overlap is observed among networks for addiction38, migraine20, neurogenic stuttering44 and disrupted agency16 (r = 0.62–0.89; voxel-wise P < 0.001; Fig. 1d–g). This spatial alignment remains highly significant after correcting for spatial autocorrelation effects (spin test45 and BrainSMASH46; Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001; r and P values for all examined networks are listed in Supplementary Table 3). Similar overlap is evident for LNM networks linked to aphasia47 and epilepsy27 (r = 0.40), amnesia48 and psychosis37 (r = 0.80), as well as for networks further linked to individual symptom data like networks related to risk of depression in multiple sclerosis34 and remission for smoking addiction38 (r = 0.57; all P, Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001). LNM maps derived based on focal neurological lesions (for example, dyskinetic cerebral palsy49) or associated with deep brain stimulation (DBS)-related targets (for example, treatment for OCD50) also appear to show surprisingly high similarity (r = 0.64; P, Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001; Supplementary Table 3).

Remarkably, several of these LNM networks—for example, disruption of agency16 (Fig. 1l–n), ASD28, addiction38, but also epilepsy27 (Supplementary Fig. 8)—seem to be indistinguishable from networks derived when lesions are randomly shuffled across the brain (r = 0.73–0.95; Fig. 1l–r), derived from a mix of lesions not associated with one specific disorder (Fig. 1s), or even from completely random synthetic lesions (Fig. 1s and Supplementary Note 6). Also, randomizing the connections of the normative connectome dataset does not appear to markedly disrupt the LNM outcomes, resulting in rather similar networks (degree-preserving randomization51,52; for example, LNM for neglect syndrome53, r = 0.66, addiction38, r = 0.72, agency16, r = 0.75, and ASD28, r = 0.94, illustrated in Fig. 1t–v; Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

The breadth of this spatial similarity is indicated by a literature survey, identifying 201 studies that discussed and/or used the LNM framework in context of studying 101 neurological and psychiatric conditions (2015–2025; see details in Supplementary Notes 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Re-analyzing 102 LNM networks across 72 of these studies confirmed an overall high alignment of LNM maps (|r| = 0.40, s.d. = 0.25; Supplementary Notes 2 and 3), with regions such as the bilateral insula, ACC and frontal cortex appearing in up to 74% of reported LNM networks (Fig. 1k; see Supplementary Note 5 for details).

To explain this notable similarity among reported LNM networks, we examined the core principles of the method. Our systematic analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of LNM methods: LNM projects sets of lesions—regardless of their clinical association—onto only elementary properties of the standard connectivity matrix, primarily the row sum of that matrix (that is, node ‘degree'). Below, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the LNM pipeline, illustrating how its procedural stages can be expressed compactly in linear matrix notation. This formalization exposes the inherent constraint of the method that explains why the majority of published LNM networks converge to highly similar outcomes instead of identifying disorder-specific circuits.

LNM (for methodologically equivalent variants and approaches published under different nomenclature, see Supplementary Table 1, from now on collectively referred to as LNM) typically consists of three methodological steps. Figure 2a presents a schematic of these steps, as implemented in popular LNM toolboxes like Lead-DBS54 (Supplementary Notes 8 and 17). We can consider a group of patients, each with one or more brain lesions, and study them using a large standard resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset from normative healthy individuals (for example, 1,000 healthy participants from the GSP1000 (ref. 55) or Human Connectome Project56). In step 1 of the LNM procedure, each lesion is mapped to corresponding voxels in the standardized space (for example, MNI152) of the normative dataset. Next, in step 2, the FC of a lesion is computed by correlating the average resting-state time series of the lesion's matching voxels with all other voxels in the brain and standardizing the correlation values using a Fisher r-to-z transformation. This is repeated across all healthy datasets in the normative connectivity dataset, resulting in over 1,000 FC maps per lesion, which are then combined into a single map using a one-sample t test to assess voxel-wise deviation from zero FC. A threshold (for example, |t| > 7) can be applied to identify the strongest connections57. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for all studied lesions, producing a set of individual FC t maps, one for each lesion.

a, The procedure of LNM involves three major steps—first, the lesion(s) of a single patient s (step 1) is placed into standard space. Next, the FC profile of that lesion ms of patient s is computed by means of the fMRI resting-state data in a large normative dataset, with the FC maps combined in a one-sample t test (two-sided) to obtain a single FC map for each lesion of patient s. Optionally, the t map can be thresholded to select the strongest connections (step 2). Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for all lesions of the group of patients S. Afterwards, the individual FC lesion maps are combined in a group analysis (step 3) to define their underlying common network. b, Step 2 of the LNM procedure can be streamlined (left, middle row) using an atlas-based approach in which the cortex and subcortical areas are parcellated according to a high-resolution atlas—for example, the Yeo-Schaefer1000/Melbourne54 atlas107,108. Middle, an atlas-based approach allows for precomputation of all lesion-to-region FC for all datasets in the normative connectome dataset. Right, all individual matrices can be grouped into a single group connectome C, with the resulting group matrix containing the same information as the one-sample t test performed in step 2. c, Taken together, the entire LNM procedure is now compressed to selecting row i corresponding to lesion ms of patient s from the group matrix C (optionally, threshold the resulting vector), repeat this for all lesions of all patients s in S, and summing over the selected rows Cm to obtain the final LNM network map. C, group connectivity matrix; GSP1000, Brain Genomics Superstruct Project 1000; h, normative participants; r, correlation coefficient; S, all participants.

Next, in the group-analysis step 3 of the LNM procedure, the lesion FC t maps are combined to produce the group LNM network. This is typically done by averaging the lesion FC t maps, identifying regions consistently connected across lesions (for example, ≥75% (ref. 17)). The resulting map is referred to as the LNM network9 or LNM sensitivity map8. Alternatively, when individual symptom data are available, the group-analysis step 3 can involve correlating the lesion FC maps with symptom scores (~16% of reviewed studies; Supplementary Table 1) or contrast subgroups with differing symptom levels (~11%); variants of the method referred to as ‛lesion network-symptom mapping' or symptom-based LNM12,13,14,15. The sign of the resulting r values or t values in the symptom lesion network mapping (sLNM) depends on the behavioral scale that is used, and may indicate, for example, risk level11,25, symptom change15 or clinical state (for example, relapse versus remission)38.

We found that the LNM methodological steps can be considerably compressed, without losing information. This compression is illustrated in Fig. 2b,c, and a mathematical derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 18. First, precomputing the correlation among the time series of all brain voxels yields all possible lesion-to-voxel FC maps beforehand. These precomputed matrices, for all normative participants in the normative connectivity dataset (H), can replace step 2 in the LNM approach (Fig. 2b). To improve practical feasibility, a high-resolution brain atlas can be used to divide the brain into, for example, R = 1,000 equally sized regions58. Furthermore, inferring equal variance across the connections in H (which we empirically validated, r = 0.99; Supplementary Note 8), the one-sample t test in step 2 can be replaced by taking the mean of the precomputed individual matrices54. This allows replacing the entire set of 1,000 normative FC matrices with a single mean group connectivity matrix C (Fig. 2b). This approach eliminates the need for looping the procedure over all normative datasets for each lesion, repetitively, reducing the computation time for a standard dataset of 50 lesions from ~10–12 h using the Lead-DBS toolbox54 to under 10 s. We empirically validated this compressed approach, with both the full Lead-DBS implementation and the atlas-based accelerated version producing effectively identical LNM maps (examined across 100 patient and 100 synthetic lesions, mean r = 0.96; Supplementary Notes 8 and 20).

The compressed version (Fig. 2c) describes the LNM procedure now as: (step 1) matching lesion ms of participant s to the region(s) i in the used brain atlas; (step 2) selecting the matching row(s) i in the group connectivity matrix C; repeat steps 1–2 for all lesions; and (step 3 group analysis) taking the sum (or mean, which are equivalent) of all selected rows to obtain the final LNM map.

Formally, we can express LNM as

where S denotes the total set of patients, s one specific participant, ms the lesion of participant s, |ms| the size of lesion ms, i the row(s) in C matching the region(s) of lesion ms in participant s, C the group average functional matrix of size R × R, R all voxels or brain regions in the chosen brain mask or atlas and r a specific region in R (scaled with a fixed constant; for exact formal notation, see Supplementary Notes 8 and 18). We can also rewrite equation (1) in a vector notation:

where \({{\bf{m}}_{s}}\) is a row vector of size 1 × R, indicating the lesion region with entries of 1 or 1/\(\left|{m}_{s}\right|\) when a lesion covers multiple rows, and 0 otherwise.

We can now make one final compression—combining all lesion vectors \({{\bf{m}}}_{s}\) of all participants into a single lesion matrix M = (\({\vec{{\bf{m}}}}_{1}\), \({\vec{{\bf{m}}}}_{2}\), …,\({{\vec{\bf{m}}}}_{s}\)) (Fig. 2c). This summarizes the entire LNM procedure (steps 1, 2 and 3 combined) to a linear matrix multiplication:

where M denotes the lesion matrix, C the standard group connectivity matrix.

In the sLNM variant, the group-analysis step is slightly modified (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1). In step 3, at each voxel, the FC values across the individual lesion maps (size S × 1) are further correlated with the participants' symptom scores (size S × 1), instead of taking the mean over all maps without further weighting. With steps 1 and 2 the same (and given by M × C, equation (3)), it can be obtained that the calculation of the final sLNM r map of all voxels in step 3 scales with:

where M and C are again the lesion matrix and the normative group connectivity matrix, and \({{\bf{sv}}}\) now a standardized row vector describing the individual symptom scores (Supplementary Notes 9 and 19 provide a step-by-step and more formal derivation of sLNM).

We provide exemplary code for the voxel-wise Lead-DBS implementation of LNM and sLNM, along with the equivalent linear matrix form of equations (3) and (4) in Supplementary Note 20.

The above formal characterization brings to light a key limitation at the core of the LNM method, explaining the observed similarity between published networks (Fig. 1). Specifically, the approach involves a repetitive sampling of one and the same matrix C, with the lesions M (and additionally the symptom scores sv in the sLNM variant) involving only linear operations on the input matrix.

Let us consider two simple cases. First, for a single patient with exactly one unifocal lesion, applying LNM yields an intermediate tensor (equation (1)) of size S × M × R = 1 × 1 × 1,000. Averaging over lesions M of participants S (both equal to 1 here) results in an LNM brain map that mirrors row i of the input matrix C. Similarly, with five distinct lesions across five patients, LNM selects five rows from C, and the resulting LNM map corresponds to the sum or mean of those rows. Now consider a larger sample of S » 1 participants, each with a single lesion (Fig. 3). For S = 1,000 with minimal spatial overlap between lesions, each lesion approximately corresponds to a unique region in the set of R = 1,000 regions, and thus to a unique row of C. It now emerges that step 2 of the LNM procedure involves selecting all rows of C, effectively reproducing the entire matrix. In the group-analysis step 3, the resulting LNM map contains the same information as the row-summation vector of the original connectivity matrix C. This convergence to the row-summation vector of C is even clearer when viewed in matrix notation (equation (3)). In this example, the lesion matrix M is the identity matrix I, leaving steps 1 and 2 as I × C, and the final group-analysis map as the row-summation vector of C (Fig. 3).

Visual illustration of how the method of LNM represents a matrix multiplication M × C. M is the lesion matrix containing the full lesion information across all participants S. Each row defines a unique lesion vector ms describing the brain region(s) affected by the lesion(s) of participant s (1) and which are not (0). C is the normative functional connectivity matrix of size R × R. The LNM procedure samples the corresponding rows of the normative matrix C. In the case of the number of lesions to approximate all regions of the brain, M becomes the identity matrix I, leading to the entire LNM procedure to copy C. After (optional) thresholding and summing across rows, the resulting LNM map equals the summation vector, or degree, of the normative connectome C. It is readily obtained that this alignment to degree will also occur when sets are smaller in size than R, with a uniform sampling of C approximating the degree of the matrix.

Such convergence arises rapidly for any reasonably sized set of spatially heterogeneous lesions, which represent the typical input to LNM studies (Supplementary Table 1). When LNM (equation (3)) is applied to lesion sets of ≥10 spatially heterogeneous lesions, the resulting map already approximates the summation vector of C (Supplementary Fig. 2; r > 0.44, 10,000 runs, Pspin < 0.05). For sets of 20–25 heterogeneous lesions, a typical size for LNM studies (Supplementary Table 4), the correlation increases further quickly (r > 0.62; Supplementary Fig. 2), approaching the degree distribution of the input matrix for almost all spatially heterogeneous lesion sets.

This systematic alignment with the summation vector of C also occurs when lesions exhibit substantial spatial overlap. Although most LNM studies focus on spatially heterogeneous lesion sets (for example, refs. 8,22,24,28,38; Supplementary Table 1), some have examined localized, overlapping lesions—for example, localized stroke or other lesion data linked to peduncular hallucinosis8, coma59, psychosis37, as well as spatially proximal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or DBS stimulation sites43,50,60. In these cases (with empirical examples reported below), the lesion vectors in matrix M contain duplicates or mark rows of C corresponding to spatially adjacent regions, resulting in the repeated selection of identical or highly similar rows. Consequently, the resulting LNM map still converges to the sum of the selected rows, primarily reflecting the inherent FC pattern of the underlying seed region(s). Even in the extreme case where all lesions fall within a single region, the probability that the LNM map reflects the degree structure of C remains non-negligible (|r| > 0.3, 74% of all possible cases; Supplementary Note 10). More formally, in such scenarios, the LNM map converges toward the sum of the row-induced subgraph Cm of C, that is, the sum of rows corresponding to the lesion regions (i, j, …, k).

Variants like sLNM refine the LNM map using individual symptom scores, but they still fundamentally rely on information drawn from one and the same connectivity matrix C. The linear operation of a vector, such as the symptom/phenotype vector sv on a structured (formally, low-rank) matrix, will produce patterns of correlation r values that are shaped by the limited set of latent factors defining the matrix (we provide a more detailed explanation of this phenomenon together with examples in Supplementary Note 9). Consequently, sLNM maps based on a structured matrix, such as the FC matrix C, will align with the elementary properties of C. This leaves systematic traces in the sLNM map, most strongly aligned with the dominant latent factors of C (for example, PC1 of C, which overlaps with degree, |r| = 0.82), resulting in predictable sLNM outcomes regardless of whether the lesions or symptom scores are clinically informed or random (Supplementary Notes 9 and 20).

We empirically tested the predicted systematic alignment of published LNM and sLNM maps to degree and other basic elementary properties (see below) of the normative functional connectome. We computed the row-summation vector of the group-average connectivity matrix of the GSP1000 dataset as used in Lead-DBS55. Then we correlated the resulting voxel-wise and atlas-based degree map with a series of reported LNM networks. Results support the prediction that LNM network maps strongly represent the summation vector of the normative connectome (multiple examples shown in Fig. 4). For example, LNM networks presented for addiction38 (three conditions, r = 0.81/0.70/0.82), neglect syndrome53 (r = 0.70, Fig. 4m), disrupted agency16 (r = 0.59, Fig. 4n), symptoms related to concussion61 (r = 0.50), emotional processing in depression24 (r = 0.74), schizophrenia28 (r = 0.97, Fig. 4p), bipolar disorder28 (r = 0.97) and OCD28 (r = 0.96) all show a strong association with the summation vector of C (P, Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001; Supplementary Note 10; r and P values listed in Supplementary Table 4).

Red dots represent voxels, black dots denote brain regions (atlas-based LNM). r,s, Systematic relationship between the first principal component (PC1) of the normative connectome and LNM maps derived from sLNM12, a variant of LNM in which lesion functional maps are further tuned by correlating them to individual symptom scores, for TMS target sites for depression64 (r), and DBS-related networks for cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease43 (s). t,u, Association between LNM maps and row sum of the matching subset of rows of the normative connectome C corresponding to the voxels (or regions) affected by the set of lesions (Cm) for psychosis37 (t) and amnesia48 (u). In f–u, spatial spin permutation (Main and Methods) was used to assess statistical significance (Pspin < 0.001, two-sided, n = 10,000 permutations, P values shown in Supplementary Table 4).

Similarly, published network maps derived by means of sLNM and related variants, for example, networks reported from addiction38 (Fig. 4j, r = 0.63), risk for depression in multiple sclerosis34 (Fig. 4i, r = 0.44), or networks hypothesized to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms14 (r = 0.56) showed a significant trace of degree (P, Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001; Supplementary Table 4) and more specifically the first principal component of C (|r| = 0.77–0.89; see also Supplementary Note 9).

LNM networks derived from small, homogeneous and/or highly focal lesions can similarly exhibit strong traces of degree. Examples are found in the application of LNM derived on the basis of smaller lesion datasets (for example, aphasia62, n = 20, r = 0.74; migraine20, n = 11, r = 0.70; Fig. 4g,k; delusional misidentification63, n = 17, r = 0.65; Supplementary Table 4). The same holds for application of LNM and sLNM to DBS and TMS target sites43,64, where the stimulation sites are often highly localized within a radius of millimeters or centimeters (for example, TMS to DLPFC target sites to treat depression symptoms, r = 0.53, DBS related to cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, r = 0.64, P, Pspin, Pbrainsmash < 0.001; PC1 |r| = 0.84/0.92; Fig. 4r,s). Similarly, traces of degree are present when considering LNM maps derived from lesions with considerable spatial overlap (psychosis37, ~30% lesions in midbrain, |r| = 0.52; amnesia48, ~50% lesions in the thalamus, |r| = 0.12), but with these maps even more strongly reflecting the row-summation vector of their selected row graphs Cm (r = 0.95–0.98; Fig. 4t,u).

In total, of the 102 published LNM and sLNM networks we re-analyzed, 78 showed a significant trace of degree (Pspin < 0.05, 91 of 102 for Pbrainsmash < 0.05; Supplementary Table 4). Below, we will further discuss the (non)specificity of these LNM maps, showing that the spatial patterns of almost all LNM networks can be explained by means of the same elementary properties of the standard matrix C.

The fundamental properties of functional connectome organization—for example, modularity58,65,66, hubs67, anticorrelation68, gradient structure69—constrain LNM and sLNM maps to reflect the network membership of lesion sites. The linear nature of LNM (equations (3) and (4)) implies repeated sampling of one and the same fixed matrix C, leaving lesion projections M, and joint symptom projections sv in the case of sLNM, inherently constrained to the principal subspace defined by C (Supplementary Note 9). Distributed lesions yield LNM maps that approximate the global degree sequence (as in many reported LNM networks; Fig. 4). Conversely, clustered lesions cause the procedure to mirror the functional module or resting-state network(s) in which the lesions are located. Simulations confirm that >90% of generated FC lesion maps correlate with the canonical resting-state networks derived from modularity analysis of C (Methods), a pattern replicated in patient lesions and published circuits (r > 0.3; Supplementary Table 4). Moreover, the anticorrelated architecture of the connectome (that is, ~47% connections in the GSP1000 connectivity matrix are anticorrelated) ensures that LNM maps often show negative correlations with maps derived from lesions in opposing networks. Thus, patterns of anticorrelated LNM networks often interpreted as biologically meaningful in LNM studies14,70,71 are likely predictable consequences of the combined modular and anticorrelated structure of the standard connectome dataset.

We examined the level of disease-specificity of LNM networks. On average, each LNM network showed a strong spatial overlap of |r| > 0.6 with 24 of the other 102 networks (P, Pspin < 0.05). This supports the very low—if not negligible—disease-specificity of LNM maps. This lack of specificity reflects the intrinsic nature of the LNM procedure. As we have seen above (equations (3) and (4)), LNM and sLNM repeatedly use the same low-rank matrix C, which limits the outcomes of the procedure to main patterns already present in C. To further illustrate this, we constructed a linear regression model that reflects nine basic factors describing the elementary properties of C—that is, its subcortical and cortical degree and its modular (n = 4) and functional gradient (n = 3) architecture69, core aspects of functional brain connectivity documented extensively in the field (for example, refs. 58,65,66,69,72,73; Methods). Regressing LNM maps of which lesion data was available against this simple model showed that 93% (mean, s.d. = 5.0%) of the variance in LNM networks is explained by the basic properties of C (Supplementary Note 14). We found similar findings for published sLNM-derived networks (R2 = 79%, s.d. = 10.2%; Supplementary Table 4). Any remaining variance falls well within the expected noise level of fMRI and LNM data74,75. These findings suggest that published disease LNM networks include no substantive information, other than unspecific signal already captured by global properties of functional connectome organization.

LNM studies typically include statistical tests to support the sensitivity and specificity of presented networks16,32,76 (Supplementary Fig. 5). We briefly discuss the validity and meaning of these statistical tests in light of the above observations, with an extended discussion in Supplementary Note 15.

In the LNM approach, step 2 often involves the use of a one-sample t test to assess whether voxel-wise FC differs from zero. However, the large size of the normative dataset often leads to widespread significance77. For example, running 50 synthetic lesions in Lead-DBS shows that, on average, 64% voxels exceed the common |t| > 7 threshold. Moreover, this step contributes little additional statistical value. As shown above (Fig. 2c), the one-sample t test can be replaced altogether by simply taking the mean of the Fisher r-to-z-transformed correlations.

The specificity test evaluates the disease- or condition-specificity of the examined LNM map (Supplementary Fig. 5). This is typically conducted using a two-sample t test contrasting the derived map from a set of localized patient lesions with a set of random lesions drawn from other disorders32,76. Although this procedure appears to constitute an additional null test, it is largely redundant with the liberal sensitivity test. With LNM of random lesions to converge to the degree sequence of the normative matrix C (equation (3); Supplementary Fig. 2), the specificity test effectively re-assesses the same signal as the sensitivity test, but now relative to the matrix degree rather than zero. This highlights a lack of statistical independence between procedures intended to capture distinct information (for simulation analyses, see Supplementary Note 15).

A commonly performed final test involves generating a conjunction or convergence map22,37,76, identifying voxels that pass both the sensitivity and specificity tests (Supplementary Fig. 5). Given the relative ease of passing the sensitivity test and its interdependence with specificity, such conjunctions are easily obtained. We modeled ~500,000 lesions across all brain regions (Yeo-Schaefer1000/Melbourne54) with varying levels of overlap using standard LNM settings (sensitivity |t| > 7, G = 75%; specificity |t| > 10 (for example, ref. 57); Supplementary Note 15). Marginal overlap between lesions (Dice = 0.08) resulted already in significant group results (10% sets), with minimum levels of overlap (Dice = 0.16) yielding 64% significant sets, increasing to almost all sets to reveal significant regions (97% tested sets) as spatial overlap increased (Dice > 0.25; Supplementary Fig. 6).

LNM has emerged as a widely used approach for identifying brain circuits linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions, as well as their symptoms9,10,17. Our analysis reveals a foundational limitation of the LNM framework—it maps circumscribed brain changes mostly to one and the same outcome, reflecting only elementary properties of the normative connectome. Given that these challenges arise from the LNM method rather than from extensive circuit-level findings in clinical neuroscience, this knowledge may aid the development of new network-mapping techniques.

Our findings have broad implications for a wide range of existing work regarding disease networks and circuits derived by means of LNM, used here as an umbrella term that unifies various related terminologies and methods in literature ((for example, the method is also commonly applied under labels such as “atrophy network mapping,” “activation network mapping,” or “network-based meta-analytic” analysis; Main and see for an overview Supplementary Table 1). The current results suggest that a substantial proportion of the presented LNM networks are nonspecific and may not accurately reflect genuine biological brain networks. In practice, the LNM captures only a small set of factors that describe broad features of the input connectivity matrix and has limited ability to identify subtle disorder-specific properties.

The convergence of LNM networks onto elemental properties of the connectome could be interpreted as support for the biological plausibility of LNM networks and circuits, like reflecting a transdiagnostic network underlying multiple disorders78. High-degree brain hubs66,67,79,80,81, for example, have been extensively theorized to have a central role in the pathophysiology of a wide range of disorders82,83,84,85. However, this interpretation in the context of LNM is misleading. The convergence of LNM methods and variants to the row sum of the used connectivity matrix (equation (3)) or, in more general terms, to the latent factors of C (Supplementary Notes 9,10 and 14), is purely a mathematical consequence of the procedure, not evidence of correspondence with the brain's hub, resting-state modular network or otherwise complex wiring architecture. Accordingly, when the empirical connectivity matrix is replaced by a randomized counterpart C′, or by other structured nonbiological matrices, the LNM outcome remains the product of the latent properties that govern C′ (Supplementary Fig. 3).

LNM is increasingly proposed as a framework to guide therapeutic applications of TMS and DBS14,25,37,39,40,50, with case studies performed86,87 and protocols for larger randomized controlled trials based on LNM networks registered (see Supplementary Table 1 for review). However, many such proposed targets—for example, the anticorrelated frontopolar cortex for substance use disorder38, or peak voxels to refine DBS target sites for epilepsy26,27—seem to primarily reflect the mean signal of the standard connectivity data, rather than identifying disease-specific loci. Indeed, the same regions emerge when LNM is applied across unrelated conditions11,25,27,44,48,59 (Supplementary Fig. 7) or just summing FC across all voxels in the GSP1000 dataset (Supplementary Fig. 8). Given the clinical impact of these procedures, it appears essential to thoroughly reassess these targets before substituting traditional stimulation sites with demonstrated efficacy88,89,90.

LNM studies have often been motivated by the observation that brain alterations in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders are spatially diverse and heterogeneous—indeed, 55% studies describe them as such (Supplementary Table 1)22,23,24,27,28,29,91,92,93. This heterogeneity is frequently cited as a rationale for performing the LNM analysis, in search of an underlying common functional network that unites these brain alterations. Our findings propose a re-appreciation of disease heterogeneity, further studying how brain disorders may involve spatially distributed, heterogeneous alterations that converge on shared phenotypes6,94.

A remaining question is whether the methodological limitations of LNM can be alleviated through refinements of its statistical procedures, for example by using random(ized) lesions or seed locations as a null-model. We approach such a solution with caution. The observation that almost all meaningful variance in LNM maps is explained by basic properties of the connectivity matrix suggests that deviations from a reference model or baseline are likely minimal, if they exist. Indeed, 70 of 78 LNM maps where lesion data were available failed to reach even a liberal significance criterion set by a generative null-model based on random synthetic lesions (nominal two-sided α = 0.05, uncorrected for 78,000 tests; Supplementary Note 16). A similar outcome was observed from a permutation-based null model in which lesion locations were randomly shuffled while preserving modular prevalence (71/78, PFDR > 0.05; Supplementary Note 16). We are also hesitant to propose a null-model solution for the LNM framework from a conceptual standpoint. Permutation-based null models estimate effects under random conditions by randomizing the input data. In LNM, only two variables exist at its core—M and C. With C describing the connectivity and remaining fixed in LNM studies and approaches8,9,17,24, the set of lesions (M) is left to be permuted. As predicted from equation (3), LNM on random sets of lesions consistently produces similar solutions dominated by degree (Supplementary Fig. 2). This inherent limitation of the LNM framework hinders the construction of a null distribution that fulfils the essential criterion of spanning a meaningful range of alternative maps for a valid null test.

The framework of network mapping has profoundly contributed to modern concepts of psychiatric and neurological disorders as network-based conditions83,95,96,97,98. LNM8,9,23,99 is proposed as a powerful and promising method within this framework to gain deeper insight into the mechanistic role of brain circuits in disorders9,10,11. Regrettably, our findings indicate that a substantial proportion of networks and disease circuits derived from LNM may not accurately reflect genuine disease-specific biological brain networks. However, it is crucial to separate the ‘theory' from the ‘method'. While we, and experts in the field with whom we discussed our findings, were not able to find an enduring solution to the foundational methodological issues of LNM, a continuous community effort to study the role of brain circuits in neurological and psychiatric disorders is imperative for advancing our understanding and developing new, effective treatments for these conditions. Linking deviations in brain organization to behavioral outcomes has long served as a cornerstone of this effort—from early clinical observations1 to systematic studies leveraging modern neuroimaging techniques4. Embedded in efforts collectively referred to as disease connectomics82,83,100, proposed fruitful future directions for the field may lie in revisiting the original rationale of lesion and ‘voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping' in context of connectivity mapping techniques1,2,3,101,102,103 to systematically chart how lesions impact brain circuitry and behavior. In parallel, network neuroscience72,79,104 offers the framework to more broadly investigate the central role of core network nodes in brain function and dysfunction79,82,83,84. Future efforts could focus in combining real patient lesions with in silico simulations to identify brain areas that may serve as general targets for intervention105,106. Such community efforts in revising the field of LNM from first principles may help ongoing work to develop brain network methods to map, understand and ultimately translate network-level approaches into clinical applications.

A systematic literature search (December 2025) on LNM studies was performed. This identified 201 LNM studies, including 187 LNM data studies, 9 reviews and 5 commentaries with LNM, sLNM and/or other related variants the focus of the study, published between 2015 and 2025 (see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for details). From these articles, we extracted data on 102 published (s)LNM networks across 72 studies on 50 neurological, 18 psychiatric and 4 behavioral conditions (creativity, political, healthy, facial emotion), including 18 downloaded LNM maps, 11 datasets with reported lesion prevalence, 350 original lesion masks, 935 lesions manually segmented from original papers and 8 coordinate-based LNM (n = 1,442 brain coordinates). Details about the data extracted from these studies are presented in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 2.

Voxel-wise LNM was performed using the Lead-DBS toolbox54 (settings, FullSet of GSP1000 participants55; Supplementary Note 3 and Fig. 2a). Equivalently, atlas-based LNM involved mapping lesions to the 1,000 cortical regions of the Yeo-Schaefer1000 atlas107 and the Melbourne54 subcortical atlas108 and selecting the matching rows of the selected parcels from the group connectome matrix C (Fig. 2c).

Spatial overlap of LNM maps was computed using Pearson correlation coefficients, using voxel-wise correlation for available voxel-wise maps and atlas-space for atlas-based maps. Significance was further assessed using the spin-null model45 and the BrainSMASH generative null model46 (10,000 permutations) to account for spatial autocorrelation effects. For 102 downloaded and reconstructed LNM maps (see Supplementary Table 2 for sources), the top 10% correlated and anticorrelated voxels were binarized and averaged to generate an overlap map of LNM regions across published studies.

A group functional connectome matrix C was formed by mapping the same functional time series of the GSP1000 participant data as used in voxel-wise LNM54,55 (Supplementary Note 4) to the Yeo-Schaefer1000/Melbourne54 atlas and averaging the computed individual FC matrices into the group matrix (no thresholding).

The summation vector of the group connectivity matrix C, or degree, was calculated as the row sum of the connectivity matrix C using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox110. Functional modules66, reflecting the composition of resting-state networks58,73, were identified using the Newman modularity algorithm110.

A simple model describing the elementary factors of the connectome matrix was formed on the basis of the derived network metrics. Subcortical, whole-brain and modular degree were computed as the mean connectivity of matching regions from the brain atlas, together with three FC gradients69 taken as the first three components of a principal component analysis on C (Supplementary Note 13).

Randomized lesions were generated by several randomization strategies, including spatially rotating the original cortical lesions across the cortical surface (spin-null permutation45). Alternative randomization methods included the generation of random synthetic lesions by taking random samples from the brain atlas (matching lesion size) and a biologically driven randomization that drew random lesions from the total collection of clinically informed lesions associated with a wide range of conditions and disorders (Supplementary Note 6).

A randomized normative connectome matrix was generated by randomizing the connections in the connectivity matrix C (threshold r > 0.2, other thresholds yielded similar results) using the rewiring method described in refs. 51,52. LNM maps were compared between the original connectome and its randomized counterparts (1,000 permutations performed; see Supplementary Note 7 for details). Alternatively, full degree-disrupting randomization of C was examined.

Synthetic lesions were constructed by randomly selecting regions with equal probability P = 1/R from all regions in the atlas, dilated by including the closest neighboring parcels (n = 4), and for voxel-wise LNM further mapped to corresponding voxels in the MNI atlas volume. Lesion sets (n = 50) with varying levels of overlap between lesions were created by randomly selecting a first lesion with probability P = 1/R from all brain regions, with the second to nth lesion placed in that region as 1/R × q, and in all other brain regions with probability P ~ 1/R. As such, parameter q ensured a variable level of overlap between some of the lesions in the set, while all other lesions remained completely randomly distributed across the brain. The level of lesion overlap within each set as a function of q was quantified by means of the average Dice coefficient among all lesion pairs in the set, ranging from zero (no overlap) to one (complete overlap; see Supplementary Note 16 for details). We refer to Supplementary Note 16 for null-model simulations using synthetic lesions and randomizing patient lesions, preserving modular assignment.

Oceans provide essential benefits to people and the economy, underpinned by the extent and condition of marine ecosystems and infrastructure—or ‘blue' capital. However, the impacts of climate change on blue capital have been largely overlooked in influential indicators such as the social cost of carbon (SCC). Here we integrate the latest ocean science and economics into a climate-economy model, capturing climate change impacts on corals, mangroves, seaports, fisheries and mariculture to estimate their welfare repercussions at a global scale. Conceptually, this ocean-based SCC (blue SCC) represents a component of the total SCC currently omitted in standard estimates. We estimate the 2020 blue SCC to be US$48 per tCO2 (US$38–70, 25th–75th percentile) with baseline discounting, representing an almost doubling of the SCC estimate from the same model without considering ocean-related impacts. The blue SCC increases to US$168 for a discount rate of 2%.

Estimated Blue SCC across five SSPs, reflecting different trajectories of socioeconomic development and associated emissions. Each SSP results in a different increase in global mean temperature by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels. End-of-century global mean surface temperature increases are as follows: SSP1: 2.60 °C, SSP2: 3.58 °C, SSP3: 4.18 °C, SSP4: 3.82 °C, SSP5: 3.95 °C.

Mean PAWN index values and 95% confidence intervals showing the influence of each input parameter on the blue SCC, based on global sensitivity analysis with bootstrapping. The elasticity of substitution between blue capital components (θ) is the most influential parameter. Other important drivers include the non-use value of corals, the fraction of non-substitutable nutrients from fisheries, and the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL).

Right: Blue SCC estimates using alternative pure rate of time preference (prtp) and elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (emuc) pairs calibrated to near-term discount rates of 1.5–3%.

Empirical complex systems can be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions influencing collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' apparent superior descriptive power—compared to classical pairwise networks—comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost, challenging their application. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a valuable description of empirical systems. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework, accounting for how structures affect diffusion behaviors, quantifying the entropic cost and distinguishability of higher-order interactions to assess their reducibility to lower-order structures while preserving relevant functional information. Empirical analyses indicate that some systems retain essential higher-order structure, whereas in some technological and biological networks it collapses to pairwise interactions. With controlled randomization procedures, we investigate the role of nestedness and degree heterogeneity in this reducibility process. Our findings contribute to ongoing efforts to minimize the dimensionality of models for complex systems.

Spatially mapping the transcriptome and proteome in the same tissue section can profoundly advance our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and function. Here we present Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue sequencing plus (DBiTplus), an integrative multimodal spatial omics approach combining sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed protein imaging on the same section, enabling both single-cell-resolution cell typing and transcriptome-wide interrogation of biological pathways. DBiTplus utilizes spatial barcoding and RNase H-mediated cDNA retrieval, preserving tissue architecture for multiplexed protein imaging. We developed computational pipelines to integrate these modalities, allowing imaging-guided deconvolution to generate single-cell-resolved spatial transcriptome atlases. We demonstrate DBiTplus across diverse samples including frozen mouse embryos, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human lymph nodes and lymphoma tissues, highlighting its compatibility with challenging clinical specimens. DBiTplus uncovered mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, progression and transformation in human lymphomas. Thus, DBiTplus is a unified workflow for spatially resolved single-cell atlasing and unbiased exploration of biological mechanisms in a cell-by-cell manner at transcriptome scale.

The advent of high-throughput single-cell technologies has revolutionized our understanding of biological systems, enabling comprehensive analyses at the molecular level across diverse biological contexts1. These approaches lack spatial context, limiting our understanding of intercellular interactions within tissues. Spatial omics addresses this limitation using a wide range of approaches. Array-based approaches such as Slide-seq2 utilize spatially barcoded surfaces to capture mRNA transcripts. Tissue barcoding approaches such as DBiT-seq3, spatial CITE-seq4 and spatial ATAC-seq5 use spatially defined delivery of DNA barcodes to profile the transcriptome, proteome or epigenome. Imaging-based methods such as MERFISH6 utilize combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging to achieve subcellular resolution. Similarly, technologies such as STARmap7 sequence nucleic acids directly within tissues or cells. Broadly, in situ sequencing or imaging techniques offer higher spatial resolution and sensitivity but may lack transcriptome-wide coverage, whereas sequencing-based methods provide transcriptome-wide coverage, often at the expense of high spatial resolution. Multiplexed protein imaging technologies such as CODEX8 have also been developed, offering single-cell resolution profiling of protein markers for in situ cell typing.

Currently, most spatial multi-omic technologies involve running single spatial omics assays separately on adjacent or serial tissue sections, followed by computational data integration of the multimodal datasets. Due to heterogeneity in cellular composition and tissue architecture, even between adjacent sections from the same block, integrating multimodal data computationally may be suboptimal, as perfect concordance between tissue sections is almost unattainable. Thus, new methods for spatially resolved multimodal and multi-omics measurements on the same tissue sections are necessary. Single-cell spatial multimodal metabolomics approaches such as REDCAT combine protein and metabolite measurements in the same tissue section9. IN-DEPTH was also recently developed for same-slide spatial multi-omics integration10.

Here, we developed DBiTplus, which combines spatially resolved transcriptomics sequencing with multiplexed immunofluorescence (mxIF) imaging for the unbiased co-profiling of the whole-transcriptome and protein markers on the same tissue section. We tested several cDNA retrieval methods, settling on an enzymatic approach using RNase H after spatial barcoding, which maintains tissue integrity and morphology before mxIF imaging. A computational approach, modified from the MaxFuse algorithm11, was developed to integrate the multi-omic spatial transcriptomic and mxIF datasets, and a robust cell-type decomposition (RCTD)-like approach12 used for DBiTplus spot cell-type deconvolution and spot splitting to generate pure cell-type sub-spots. We applied DBiTplus to elucidate the process of embryogenesis in optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-frozen and paraffin-embedded C57BL/6 (C57) mouse embryo sections. Applying DBiTplus to healthy human lymph node and lymphoma tissues demonstrated the capability to generate high-quality single-cell-resolved transcriptome and protein data from the same tissue section, addressing the hurdles associated with data integration and registration from adjacent sections.

In the standard DBiT-seq workflow, mRNAs are reverse-transcribed in situ within the tissue matrix, and DNA barcodes A (Ai; i = 1–50) and B (Bj; j = 1–50) delivered perpendicularly through microfluidic chips with 50 parallel channels. The barcodes ligate to form a unique two-dimensional array of barcoded spots. After tissue lysis, barcoded cDNAs are recovered, purified and amplified for paired-end sequencing to generate spatial gene expression maps. This technique has been adapted to profile the transcriptome, epigenome and proteome and, more recently, applied to archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks3,4,5,13. Central to the efforts to combine DBiT-seq with mxIF was to develop techniques to release cDNA from tissue sections while maintaining tissue integrity. Two chemical approaches (using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) and an enzymatic approach (using RNase H) were tested (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Following successful retrieval of the cDNA and preparation of a sequencing library, the intact tissue section was imaged using Akoya Biosciences' PhenoCycler-Fusion platform or Bruker Spatial Biology's CellScape platform, and routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining performed on the same tissue section (Fig. 1a). For FFPE samples, the Patho-DBiT workflow13 was used (until spatial barcoding was completed), following which the tissue section was incubated at 55 °C with a mix of Triton X-100 and Thermostable RNase H enzyme to break down RNA strands in RNA–DNA hybrids and to facilitate the diffusion through the permeabilized cell membranes. Another overnight incubation at 37 °C was performed to increase cDNA recovery from the tissue. The retrieved cDNAs were pooled and a sequencing library built. The intact tissue section can be stored at −20 °C until mxIF imaging. FFPE tissue sections underwent brief rehydration and antigen retrieval steps before mxIF imaging. After successful imaging, the flow cell could be removed from the slide and routine H&E staining performed on the same section. For fresh frozen samples, the DBiTplus workflow was identical, excluding FFPE-specific steps.

We developed a workflow integrating the mxIF cell-by-protein and DBiTplus spot-by-gene matrices into a unified feature matrix with cell-type labels and spatial coordinates (Fig. 1b), starting with whole-cell segmentation of the mxIF data using Mesmer14 and quality-control steps. The mxIF datasets were annotated via MaxFuse11 integration with a reference single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset such as the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas15. Utilizing tissue boundary detection and image transformation, mxIF and DBiT-seq images were co-registered to enable accurate matching and alignment of the same cells across modalities (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Cell-type counts from mxIF segmentation masks were mapped to DBiTplus spots, which were subdivided into pure cell-type sub-spots for cell-type-specific gene expression estimation, enabling single-cell annotation beyond existing deconvolution tools (Fig. 1b).

Preliminary experiments on OCT-frozen embryonic day 13 (E13) mouse C57 embryo sections tested cDNA retrieval methods. The barcoded region of the tissue was covered with a clean polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well gasket and incubated at room temperature with 50 μl of 0.1 M NaOH for 15 min, which was then collected and neutralized with equimolar hydrochloric acid (HCl). NaOH disrupted tissue morphology (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In mouse spleen serial sections, each section was subjected to a different cDNA retrieval approach: 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min, 90% DMSO for 30 min and 10 U of RNase H at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then imaged with a 25-marker mouse immune panel by Akoya Biosciences. DMSO-treated and NaOH-treated sections yielded poor-quality CODEX staining, whereas the RNase H-treated section yielded 14 positively staining markers including CD45R (B cell lineage) and CD169 (macrophages; Extended Data Fig. 1c). Thus, the enzymatic approach was selected for further optimization (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

A new Thermostable RNase H (New England Biolabs, M0523S; optimal activity > 65 °C) was introduced. E13 mouse embryo sections underwent spatial barcoding with proteinase K lysing (control) or RNase H-mediated cDNA release (test). Sequencing detected 24,102 and 20,973 genes, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). Adding 0.5% Triton X-100 to the RNase H mix did not compromise tissue integrity, but saw an increase in mean gene counts per spot (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). Replicates showed high correlation within and between test and control slides (R = 0.87 and R = 0.72, respectively), and strong consistency was observed between test replicates (R = 0.84; Extended Data Fig. 2c). Spatial clustering identified eight clusters, with clusters 2 and 3 corresponding to the diencephalon, mesencephalon and telencephalon, evidenced by the expression of Zbtb20 and Id4 (embryonic neocortex, forebrain; Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Spatial patterns of select genes—Sox11, Col2a1 and Sox2—matched in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas and the Mouse Organogenesis Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas (MOSTA) from STOmicsDB16 (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Clusters 0 (control) and 2 (test) showed remarkably similar spatial distributions and 1,109 overlapping genes, underscoring the ability of DBiTplus to generate high-quality spatial transcriptome data and recapitulate tissue biology (Extended Data Fig. 2g).

We assessed the feasibility of the workflow in FFPE tissues, the ‘gold standard' for preserving clinical tissues. We profiled human cerebellum and lymph node FFPE sections, which retained their architecture after spatial barcoding and cDNA recovery (cDNA size ranged from 200 to 800 base pairs; Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). CODEX imaging resolved distinct cerebellar layers (granular, Purkinje and molecular layers). AQP4+ glial cells were observed across all three layers, and the single layer of large pear-shaped CALB1+ Purkinje cell bodies was most prominent in the Purkinje cell layer (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Lymph node CODEX staining recapitulated expected architecture, including CD20+ B cells and CD21+ follicular dendritic cells in the follicle, and CD3ε+ T cells in interfollicular regions (Supplementary Fig. 1e).

DBiTplus was applied to an E11 paraffin-embedded mouse embryo (Fig. 2a) and showed a strong correlation (R = 0.99) with the standard DBiT-seq workflow (on the adjacent section) with 27,884 overlapping genes. Each spot captured ~1,200 genes and 3,300 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs; Fig. 2b–d). The same section was stained with a 26-marker CODEX panel. Unsupervised clustering identified ten transcriptomic clusters, which closely aligned with anatomic structures and spatial protein patterns from the CODEX data (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Cluster 4 expressed liver markers (Hba.a1, Hba.a2, Hbb.bt, Afp and Serpina6), while cluster 8 expressed embryonic heart markers (Myh6, Myl7, Myh7 and Tnnt2; Extended Data Fig. 3c). mRNA and protein expression showed consistent spatial patterns for genes such as Mki67, Nefl and Sox2 (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, spatial expression of Sox2 (pluripotency, cluster 0) Hoxa10 (limb muscle development, cluster 1) and Sox11 (progenitor cell behavior regulation including neurogenesis, cluster 2) matched in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas and the MOSTA dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3d). A trained support vector machine model enabled comprehensive cell-type annotation of the whole CODEX dataset (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Integration of CODEX and DBiT-seq allowed deconvolution of DBiTplus spots into constituent cell types (Fig. 2g), outperforming TACCO (Supplementary Fig. 4). Using Seurat weighted-nearest-neighbor (WNN) methodology, further enhanced cell-type separation, clearly distinguishing epithelial cells from other cell types.

We applied DBiTplus to adjacent sections of a benign human lymph node, using 50-μm (Fig. 3) and 25-μm microfluidic devices, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5). After cDNA retrieval, sections were stained with a 35-plex CODEX panel and H&E staining was done (Fig. 3a). Unsupervised clustering revealed five transcriptomic clusters, including B cells (MS4A1, cluster 1), smooth muscle cells in the medulla (MYH11 and CALD1, cluster 3) and macrophages lining the medullary cords (MARCO, cluster 4; Fig. 3b,c). DBiTplus and CODEX images were co-registered, aligning the cellular-level data from the CODEX images with the spatial transcriptomic data from the DBiTplus spots (Fig. 3d). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding of the reference scRNA-seq and CODEX datasets using MaxFuse is shown in Fig. 3e. Endothelial cells had the highest f1-scores (for label-transfer accuracy), while germinal center B cells (GCB cells) had lowest scores (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Cell-type distributions matched known lymph node biology, with T cells and B cells predominating (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Joint embedding of DBiTplus and CODEX (Fig. 3g) and violin plots of the cell-type-specific modality weights from WNN analysis, showed that the CODEX (protein) contributed more for T cell-subtype identification, relative to DBiTplus (transcriptome), and the converse was observed for B cell subtypes such as GCB and plasma B cells (Fig. 3h). This can be explained by the marker composition of the CODEX panel, which included more T cell than B cell markers.

Each DBiTplus spot was subdivided into pure cell-type sub-spots, with cell-type identities assigned through MaxFuse label transfer and validated against CODEX markers (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), CD20, CD8, CD4, FOXP3, CD31) from the same region of the tissue. The imprint of the microfluidic channels, visible in the β-actin channel, provided additional confirmation of spot locations. Three methods—TACCO (Optimal transport-based)17, Cell2location (Bayesian probabilistic model)18 and RCTD (Poisson regression-based deconvolution)12—were tested to benchmark spatial cell-type deconvolution, relative to the ground-truth CODEX-informed spot-level cell-type dataset (Fig. 3i). TACCO performed best, with 50% of spots showing Pearson scores > 0.6, versus 36% for Cell2location (Fig. 3j,k). Metrics for RCTD are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4d. Average silhouette width (ASW) scores, with or without CODEX (0.47 versus 0.46), were similar for the DBiTplus transcriptome dataset, indicating comparable clustering structure in the DBiTplus dataset alone. However, adjusted Rand index (ARI) scores improved from 0.09 to 0.21 with CODEX guidance, reflecting more accurate cell-type assignment (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

UMAP of the DBiTplus (transcriptome) revealed diverse immune (B cell and T cell subsets) and stromal populations (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Cell-type-specific markers MS4A1 (canonical B cell marker), IL7R (naive CD4+ T cells), CTLA4 (regulatory T cells) and CALD1 and MYH11 (endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells) distinguished immune subsets (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Exploring B cell activation and maturation, violin plots revealed distinct transcriptional profiles—MS4A1, POU2F2 and CD22—broadly expressed across naive B cells, memory B cells and activated B cell populations, but downregulated in plasma B cells with concurrent upregulation of IGHM, consistent with plasma B cell maturation. IL4R was enriched in GCB/naive/activated B cell subsets, indicating activation or a poised state for activation, while MKI67 and TOP2A were upregulated in cycling B cells, indicating active proliferation. These patterns validate B cell-subtype annotations and capture functional transitions from naive to proliferative and terminally differentiated states (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

To delineate transcriptional differences between antigen-inexperienced and antigen-experienced B cells, we compared naive and activated B cells using differential gene expression and pathway analysis. Naive B cells upregulated MS4A1, IGHM, IL4R and POU2F2, consistent with a resting phenotype capable of antigen sensing and homing. Correspondingly, B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling, CXCR4 signaling and RHO GTPase cycle pathways were upregulated, whereas apoptosis signaling was downregulated, underscoring reflecting migratory readiness and pro-survival status. In contrast, activated B cells upregulated IL4R, CD2, POU2F2 and LPP genes and EIF2 signaling, BCR signaling and antigen presentation pathways, consistent with immune activation and survival (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). These findings underscore functional divergence between naive and activated B cells and validate the resolution of our spatial transcriptomic profiling.

We evaluated RNA–protein concordance in DBiTplus, comparing spatial transcriptomics with CODEX imaging. This is important because the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts can be discordant, influenced by spatial and temporal mRNA variations and the protein biosynthesis machinery19. Of the 35 markers in the human lymph node CODEX panel, CD68 was the only gene transcript missing (Extended Data Fig. 6a). As validation, we compared our normalized gene expression to a reference lymph node dataset from Bai et al.13 (also using Patho-DBiT), noting generally consistent gene expression levels (R = 0.89, P < 2.2 × 10−16), particularly for highly abundant transcripts like PTPRC, ACTB and HLA.DRA. Low-expressing genes, such as GZMB and IFNG, were present at low levels in both datasets. Interestingly, CD68 transcripts were detectable in the reference dataset (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Given the documented discrepancies between transcript and protein expression in immune cells, we evaluated the correlation between average normalized mRNA and protein levels in our dataset20. As expected, we observed minimal correlation (R = 0.23, P = 0.18), consistent with prior findings in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, particularly for T cell markers such as CD4 (Extended Data Fig. 6d). CD68 protein expression was clearly visible in the CODEX images (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f), and other macrophage-associated markers such as CD14 and CD163 were detected in both modalities (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). These findings underscore the strength of DBiTplus in co-mapping RNAs and proteins on the same tissue section, allowing for cross-validation and enhancing confidence in cell-type annotation and spatial localization.

Assessment of CODEX data from the DBiTplus workflow revealed staining quality comparable to control lymph node sections (two sections away from the Fig. 3 sample), with strong correlations (Pearson > 0.85) for key cell-type markers including CD3ε, CD20 and podoplanin (Supplementary Figs. 6a,b and 7). H&E staining after DBiTplus, evaluated against standard H&E and post-CODEX H&E (no prior DBiT), showed partially diminished nuclear detail, but still allowed trained pathologists to identify major cell types based on cellular morphology and spatial context (Supplementary Fig. 6c). This suggests the utility of these H&E images for inferring single-cell spatial gene expression in the dead space regions of the microfluidic channels using tools like iStar21. It is worth noting that post-CODEX H&E imaging can be challenging due to potential tissue damage during the flow cell removal, which may compromise reliable histological analysis.

To investigate lymphoma progression, we profiled a marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) sample that showed increased large cell populations, high proliferation index and clinical progression without overt histological transformation (Fig. 4a). Unlike healthy lymph nodes with well-defined follicular structure, MZL is characterized by effacement of normal tissue architecture through the infiltration of large, atypical B cells and proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with irregular nuclei, condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 8a and Fig. 4b). Clinical immunohistochemical staining was performed for relevant clinical markers (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Interestingly, we observed robust follicular dendritic cell networks marked by CD21, with clusters of CD3+ and CD5+ T cells.

A 2.5-mm × 2.5-mm region was profiled with DBiTplus (25-μm microfluidic device) and CODEX (44-marker panel) on the same tissue section. CODEX revealed extensive CD20+ Ki67+ proliferating B cells (Fig. 4c). B cells were classified as large or small B cells based on size and CD20 intensity. Integration of protein and RNA data revealed concordant expression of CD31, CD4 and TIGIT in the joint UMAP embedding (Supplementary Fig. 8c). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is composed primarily of malignant B cells (both large and small, ~55%) and T cells (~30%), consistent with mxIF and clinical immunohistochemical images for CD20 and CD3 (Fig. 4d,e). The transcriptional profile of large B cells was consistent with biological evolution with upregulated genes like IL6ST (interleukin-6 signaling), CLU (apoptosis inhibition) and SYNE2, AHNAK and MARCKSL1 (protein synthesis and cell growth)22,23 indicating increased survival, and dysregulated inflammatory signaling (Extended Data Fig. 7a). DEG analysis between small and large B cells showed upregulation of NFKBIA, suggesting potential dysregulation of the frequently overactive nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway, as well as upregulation of PPRX1, ANTRX1 and VMP1, associated with migration/metastasis, PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling and autophagy, respectively, in large B cells24,25,26. Small B cells showed upregulation of PKHD1L1 and EXOSC10, associated with B cell lymphoma growth, activation and DNA repair27,28 (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Pathway analysis highlighted the upregulation of the NF-κB signaling pathways and WNT–β-catenin signaling, and a downregulation of epigenetic and chromatin organization, PI3K/AKT and BCR signaling in small B cells, while large B cells revealed upregulation in noncanonical NF-κB signaling, chromatin and histone modification and PI3K–AKT signaling pathways (Fig. 4h,i and Extended Data Fig. 7d).

Upstream regulator analysis of DEGs in large B cells identified SOX4 (a MYC upstream regulator through ATK family and TP53 inhibitor) and downregulation of RAD21 (cohesion complex gene), whose reduced expression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) correlates with decreased survival, suggesting underlying pro-tumor survival mechanisms29 (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Causal network analysis (which identifies upstream regulators of gene expression in large B cells) highlighted SYK, an SRC family kinase involved in BCR and PI3K–AKT signaling, as a key master regulator. Additional regulators included upregulated DOCK2 (proliferation regulator through RAC and ERK activation in B cell lymphomas) and downregulated SPEN (Notch signaling pathway regulator; Extended Data Fig. 7g,h), These transcriptional shifts offer insight into the biological programs underlying biological progression of MZL.

We performed pseudotime analysis on the deconvoluted data of small and large B cell transcriptomes using Monocle 3 (ref. 15) and found small and large B cells on a differentiation continuum, revealing dynamic transcriptional changes across MZL progression (Fig. 4j,k). UMAP of B cell markers showed that both small and large B cells expressed POU2F2 and MS4A1, whereas ANTXR1 and SP4 were restricted to large and small B cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7i). ANTXR1 is known to be elevated in the progression of several cancers and has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in DLBCL30. PTMA, PRRX1, FOXP1 and ASH1L increased, reflecting enhanced proliferation and transcriptional and epigenetic programs, while B cell-specific genes MS4A1 and PAX5 reduced in pseudotime, consistent with the molecular evolution of indolent MZL (Extended Data Fig. 7j and Fig. 4l). These findings suggest that MZL progression (with the increased presence of large B cells as well as aggressive clinical features) is driven by a coordinated loss of B cell identity and immune function, coupled with the upregulation of proliferation, transcriptional reprogramming and epigenetic remodeling pathways, characteristic of aggressive lymphoma transformation.

Richter's transformation is the evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into aggressive lymphomas, often DLBCL, although rare cases involve Hodgkin or T cell lymphomas31. Recent multi-omics studies have identified distinct Richter's transformation subtypes, clonal origins and high-risk genomic features32. Most DLBCL-Richter's transformation cases (~80%) are clonally related to the original CLL, representing true transformations, with poor prognosis (median overall survival <1 year), although de novo DLBCL can occur in individuals with concurrent CLL33. We profiled a rare case of concurrent CLL and Richter's transformation-DLBCL within the same lymph node, providing a unique spatially contiguous context to study Richter's transformation (Fig. 5a). H&E staining revealed a region of densely packed small monomorphic cells transitioning into a sheet of large pleomorphic cells with open chromatin corresponding to the CLL and DLBCL regions, respectively (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We applied DBiTplus to 5-µm-thick sections followed by imaging with a 30-marker panel (using CellScape, with relevant CLL/DLBCL markers such as CD5, LEF1 and CD20). An adjacent section was also imaged as a quality-control measure (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). mxIF imaging revealed proliferating CD20brightKi67high large B cells (DLBCL region), contrasting with the CD20dimKi67low small B cells (CLL region), as well as a higher density of T cells within the DLBCL region (Fig. 5c,d). Leveraging the distinct features of CLL and DLBCL (CD20dimKi67low versus CD20brightKi67high), B cells were initially classified as large or small based on size, and the remaining cells in the TME, annotated using MaxFuse (Fig. 5e), with B cells making up ~60% of all cells (Fig. 5f). T cell infiltration was higher in DLBCL than CLL, with small B cells, on average, located closer to the nearest T cell compared to large B cells (Extended Data Fig. 8d–f). Large B cells had the largest diameters of ~20 μm (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). Some overlap of large B cells in CLL and small B cells in DLBCL suggested a gradual transition between the two regions (Extended Data Fig. 8i,l). To refine CLL cell classification, we applied a gating strategy based on cell with size and normalized CD20 and Ki67 expression (Extended Data Fig. 8j,k).

Aberrant immune regulation contributes to CLL initiation and progression, and Richter's transformation is associated with increased FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and CD163+ macrophages, and elevated LAG-3 compared to de novo DLBCL34,35. Spatial gradient plots revealed enrichment of CD163+ macrophages, CD274 (PD-L1) and CD20+ cells in DLBCL regions (Fig. 5h), indicating an immunologically active yet suppressed microenvironment. Regional scores for activation (CD38, CD45RO), cytotoxicity (granzyme B, CD56, CD8), proliferation (Ki67), immunosuppression (CD274, FOXP3, CD163) and exhaustion (CD279) using multiplexed imaging data (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 9) were all higher in DLBCL than CLL regions (two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, ****P < 0.0001), mirroring the distribution of CD8+ T cells with highest exhaustion and large B cells, macrophages and regulatory T cells showing highest immunosuppression scores within the TME. This aligns with reports of aberrant PD-1+ neoplastic B cells and increased infiltration of FOXP3+ T cells and CD163+ macrophages in Richter's transformation versus CLL, potentially influencing responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Additionally, CLL cells have been shown to overexpress PD-L1, which engages PD-1 on T cells, promoting immune tolerance through downstream inhibitory signaling36.

Distinct genetic and transcriptional alterations characterize Richter's transformation, including TP53 and CDKN2A deletions, NOTCH1 gain-of-function mutations and c-MYC hyperactivation37. UMAP and spatial clustering revealed clear separation of cell types (Extended Data Fig. 9b and Fig. 5j). Large B cells uniquely expressed ROR2, SMOC2 and PDE1C, implicated in proliferation, migration and regulation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, while small B cells overexpressed anti-apoptotic BCL2, consistent with their more indolent and chronic nature, and AFF3, suggesting IGHV-mutated CLL (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e and Fig. 5k). Pathways upregulated in small B cells included BCR signaling, histone modification and T cell exhaustion, whereas CTLA4 signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes was downregulated (Fig. 5l). In large B cells, p53 and apoptosis signaling were upregulated, although PTEN was downregulated, suggesting activation of intrinsic stress responses, whereas canonical proliferative and epigenetic programs such as mTOR, ERK/MAPK, PI3K signaling, and DNA methylation and transcriptional repression were downregulated. This reflects the hypomethylation typically observed in Richter's transformation versus CLL and de novo DLBCL and indicates a shift from canonical proliferative circuits. Additionally, suppression of T cell antigen receptor signaling may reflect impaired immune engagement, and upregulation of extracellular matrix remodeling suggests altered tumor–stroma interactions (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Aberrant cell-surface expression of co-inhibitory receptors CTLA4 and LAG-3 on large B cells may play a role in immune escape (Fig. 5m). Spatial scoring of T cell activation and exhaustion (based on previously published gene lists38,39,40) highlighted DLBCL hotspots, while higher scores of BCR activation were observed in the CLL region, suggesting reduced BCR survival signaling dependency in the transformed lymphoma (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b and Fig. 5n),

DBiTplus further enables spatial profiling of small noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate mRNA synthesis and gene expression41. The miR-17-92 cluster, miR-150 and miR-15b are critical for B cell differentiation and germinal center selection, whereas miR-21, miR-155 and miR-222 are known to be upregulated in lymphoid malignancies, with high miR-21 expression linked to the activated B cell subtype of DLBCL42. Unsupervised clustering at the DBiTplus spot level revealed seven distinct miRNA clusters, with clusters 0 and 1 corresponding to the histological transition from CLL to DLBCL (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Differential analysis identified several miRNAs relevant to disease progression: miR-34a, miR-21 and miR-155 (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Interestingly, miR-21 is known to inhibit expression of PTEN and activate the PI3K–AKT pathway, increasing chemotherapy resistance43, confirming the small and large B cell pathway analysis (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Other miRNAs such as miR-342 and miR-132, implicated in other lymphomas, warrant further investigation in the context of Richter's transformation. These findings demonstrate the unique capability of DBiTplus to spatially map miRNAs and interrogate their roles in hematological malignancies.

We applied Monocle 3 to the DBiTplus-deconvoluted single-cell transcriptomes of this CLL-DLBCL transformation. UMAP visualization revealed distinct clusters for large B cells and small B cells, indicating substantial transformation-associated transcriptional shifts (Extended Data Fig. 10e). Pseudotime analysis of small B cells revealed dynamic gene expression changes: ATM (linked to NF-κB activation), MKI67 (proliferation) and LEF1 (diagnostic CLL marker) increased over pseudotime, whereas AFF3, BCL2 and TCL1A decreased (Extended Data Fig. 10f–h). Pseudotime heat map highlighted progressive upregulation of several CLL-associated genes across multiple pathways such as DNA damage response (TP53, ATM), chromatin modification (ASXL1, SETD2) and RNA splicing (SF3B1; Extended Data Fig. 10i). BIRC3, a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of noncanonical NF-κB signaling in CLL, exhibited transient upregulation before declining, consistent with 11q deletion-associated poor prognosis. These transcriptional dynamics reveal gradual remodeling of the CLL transcriptome toward a more aggressive state, underscoring the molecular changes that may underlie Richter's transformation.

Spatial multi-omics integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics while preserving spatial context, providing a comprehensive view of molecular processes in tissues. Traditional approaches utilize separate assays on adjacent tissue sections limiting alignment and multimodal integration accuracy due to tissue heterogeneity. To overcome this, we developed DBiTplus, which combines unbiased transcriptome-wide spatial sequencing with mxIF (CODEX or CellScape) on the same tissue section, compatible with both OCT-frozen and FFPE samples. We optimized enzymatic cDNA retrieval using RNase H, while preserving tissue architecture for multiplexed imaging.

By registering DBiTplus data with high-resolution imaging, we achieve precise colocalization of transcriptomic and proteomic data. This enabled mxIF-informed DBiTplus spot deconvolution, allowing for accurate identification of cell types. Our approach involved splitting spots into pure cell-type sub-spots and utilizing the Seurat WNN methodology for reliable cell-type deconvolution and splitting the transcriptomes of individual sub-spots into single-cell transcriptional profiles. Thus, leveraging mxIF data to guide the splitting of DBiT spatial transcriptomes can enable the creation of truly single-cell-level spatially resolved transcriptome atlases.

Application to human lymph node and lymphoma samples revealed distinct spatial organization and enabled high-resolution mapping of lymphoma progression and transformation. DBiTplus also captures the whole milieu of small RNAs, particularly miRNAs, providing insights into the molecular biological mechanism of disease evolution.

DBiTplus shares common limitations with sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics approaches; low capture depth can lead to dropout of low-abundance transcripts, which may be exacerbated by the lower transcript recovery rate of DBiTplus, compared to the standard DBiT-seq workflow, an important consideration when profiling rare cell populations. Further, the tight clamping of the tissue during the DBiTplus workflow may disrupt tissue architecture outside the clamped region and may lead to reduced imaging signal. Nonetheless, these limitations are counterbalanced by several strengths: DBiTplus enables whole-transcriptome spatial profiling without being constrained by predesigned panels, can be integrated with high-plex protein imaging on the same tissue section, and is flexible and cost-effective for broad adoption. While Xenium and CosMx achieve single-cell spatial resolution through direct imaging of transcripts, DBiTplus even allows for unbiased profiling of total RNAs including small noncoding RNAs (that is, miRNAs), which is unique for discovery of new RNA biological mechanisms.

In summary, DBiTplus represents a spatial multi-omics approach that integrates sequencing-based and imaging-based spatial assays on the same tissue section, enabling image-guided deconvolution into single-cell-resolved spatial transcriptomes. By combining multiple molecular layers at single-cell resolution, DBiTplus provides unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions, opening new avenues for spatial multi-omics.

De-identified archived benign FFPE human lymph node and lymphoma tissue blocks were obtained from Yale Pathology Tissue Services (YPTS). The tissue retrieval and distribution for research was conducted with the approval of the Yale University Institutional Review Board (approved IRB no. 1401013259) and oversight by the Tissue Resource Oversight Committee. Written informed consent for participation in any cases where identification was collected alongside the specimen, was obtained from individuals or their guardians, in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each sample was handled in strict compliance with HIPAA regulations, University Research Policies, Pathology Department diagnostic requirements and Hospital bylaws.

The mouse tissue used in this study was obtained from a commercial vendor, Zyagen (San Diego, CA), which procured and handled the animals under their in-house Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols. Because no live animal procedures were conducted at our institution, separate IACUC approval was not required. C57 embryo sagittal frozen sections, E13 (MF-104-13-C57), C57 spleen frozen sections (MF-701-C57) and C57 embryo sagittal paraffin sections, E11 (MP-104-11-C57), were purchased from Zyagen. Mouse embryo frozen sagittal sections and mouse C57 spleen frozen sections were made of freshly collected tissues, snap frozen in OCT blocks. E11 mouse whole-embryo paraffin sagittal sections were made of freshly collected tissues, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and processed for paraffin embedding. Both OCT and paraffin blocks were also sectioned at a thickness of 7–10 μm and mounted on the center of poly-L-lysine-covered glass slides (63478-AS, Electron Microscopy Sciences).

After review and selection by a board-certified pathologist, optimal paraffin blocks were sectioned by YPTS at a thickness of 7–10 μm and mounted on the center of poly-L-lysine-coated 1 × 3-inch glass slides. Serial tissue sections were collected simultaneously for DBiT-seq and H&E staining. Human brain cerebellum paraffin sections (HP-202) were purchased from Zyagen and made of freshly collected tissues, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections were stored at −80 °C until use.

To perform RNA integrity number tests, 15–20-μm-thick curls were obtained from YPTS. The RNeasy FFPE Kit for RNA Extraction from Qiagen was used. Following RNA extraction, the High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape assay was used with the Agilent TapeStation system to assess RNA quality. The RNA integrity number equivalent, which automatically assesses RNA degradation, and the DV200, the percentage of RNA fragments > 200 nucleotides, were used as metrics for determining RNA quality.

Details of the fabrication process for the PDMS wafers and microfluidic chips can be found in a prior publication3.

The DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, with the sequences provided in Supplementary Tables 6 and 7. The barcodes (100 μM) and ligation linker (100 μM) were annealed at a 1:1 ratio in 2× annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA). The mixes were placed in a thermal cycle and heated to 97 °C to anneal and slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of −0.1 °C s−1. The barcodes can be stored at −20 °C for up to 6 months.

OCT-embedded tissue sections stored in a −80 °C freezer were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. The section was then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed three times with 0.5× DPBS-RI (1× DPBS diluted with nuclease-free water and 0.05 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor). The tissue was permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature using 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS, followed by a wash with 0.5× DPBS-RI (1× DPBS diluted with nuclease-free water and 0.05 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor) to stop the permeabilization. After air-drying, a PDMS reservoir was placed over the region of interest (ROI) on the tissue slide. In situ polyadenylation was performed with Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase. The samples were first equilibrated by adding 100 μl wash buffer (88 μl nuclease-free water, 10 μl 10× Poly(A) Reaction Buffer, 2 μl 40 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. After removing the wash buffer, 60 μl of the Poly(A) enzymatic mix (38.4 μl nuclease-free water, 6 μl 10× Poly(A) Reaction Buffer, 6 μl 5 U μl−1 Poly(A) Polymerase, 6 μl 10 mM ATP, 2.4 μl 20 U μl−1 SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor, 1.2 μl 40 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor) was added to the reaction chamber and incubated in a humidified box at 37 °C for 30 min. To remove excess reagents, the slide was dipped in 50 ml DPBS and shake-washed for 5 min. Next, 60 μl of the reverse transcription mix (20 μl 25 μM RT Primer, 16.3 μl 0.5× DPBS-RI, 12 μl 5× RT Buffer, 6 μl 200 U μl−1 Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 4.5 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μl 20 U μl−1 SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor, 0.4 μl 40 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor) was loaded into the PDMS reservoir and sealed with parafilm. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then at 42 °C for 90 min, followed by a wash with 50 ml DPBS. For the in situ ligation of barcode A, the first PDMS device was carefully aligned over the tissue slide, positioning the 50 center channels over the ROI. The chip was imaged to record positions for downstream alignment and analysis. An acrylic clamp was used to secure the PDMS to the slide, preventing interchannel leakage. The ligation mix (100 μl 1× NEBuffer 3.1, 61.3 μl nuclease-free water, 26 μl 10× T4 ligase buffer, 15 μl T4 DNA ligase, 5 μl 5% Triton X-100, 2 μl 40 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor and 0.7 μl 20 U μl−1 SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor) was prepared. For the barcoding reaction, 5 μl of a ligation solution (comprising 4 μl of ligation mix and 1 μl of 25 μM DNA barcode A (A1-A50)) was added to each of the 50 inlets. The solution was drawn through the channels using a gently controlled vacuum. After incubating at 37 °C for 30 min, the PDMS chip was removed, and the slide was washed with 50 ml of DPBS. Next, a second PDMS device with 50 perpendicular channels was attached to the air-dried slide over the ROI. A brightfield image was taken, and barcode B was ligated similarly. The tissue section was then washed with nuclease-free water to remove any residual salts, and a final brightfield image was taken to mark the boundaries of the microfluidic channels on the tissue ROI.

FFPE tissue sections were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature from the −80 °C freezer. Tissue sections were baked for 1 h at 60 °C to facilitate the removal of paraffin and increase adhesion of the tissue section to the slide. The tissue slide was then immersed into xylene twice for 5 min for deparaffinization. This was followed by rehydration steps in a series of ethanol dilutions: two rounds of 100% ethanol, and one each of 90%, 70%, 50% and 30% ethanol. Finally, the tissue sections were immersed in distilled water for 5 min. Next, the tissue slide was immersed into preheated antigen retrieval buffer (Discovery CC1 buffer (Roche, Basel) or Tris-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0 (Abcam)) and allowed to boil at 95–100 °C for 10 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The intact tissue slide was then imaged using the ×10 objective on the M7000 Imaging EVOS System and the same profiling approach described above applied.

For cDNA retrieval, the barcoded region of the tissue was covered with a clean PDMS well gasket, and 100 μl cDNA extraction solution (10 μl 5% Triton X-100, 74 μl nuclease-free water, 10 μl 1× RNase H Reaction Buffer and 6 μl Thermostable RNase H (M0523S, New England Biolabs)) was loaded into it. The reservoir was then clamped tightly with the slide to avoid any leakage and sealed with parafilm. The clamped tissue slide was incubated in a humidified box at 55 °C for 3 h. Following this, the cDNA extraction solution was collected and 1 μl of 0.5 M EDTA was added to inactivate the RNase H enzyme. The intact tissue slide was washed with 100 μl of nuclease-free water, which was then collected. Following this, 100 μl of cDNA extraction solution was added to the tissue slide as described previously, and the clamped slide was incubated in a humidified box at 37 °C overnight. The cDNA extraction solution was collected and 1 μl of 0.5 M EDTA was added to inactivate the RNase H enzyme. The intact tissue slide was washed with 100 μl of nuclease-free water, which was also collected and an additional wash step with 0.1× SSC buffer done. The collected cDNA extraction solution was then pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. For control slides, the standard lysing process described in previous publications from the lab was followed3.

The tissue clamps were removed, and the intact tissue was washed in nuclease-free water and then with 1× PBS. Following this, the tissue slide was incubated with 500 μl of DAPI solution (two drops of NucBlue Fixed Cell ReadyProbes Reagent in 500 μl of 1× PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The tissue slide was then imaged in the DAPI channel using the ×20 objective on the EVOS M7000 Imaging System. This image is used to co-register the DBiTplus and mxIF images. The tissue slide was then washed with 1× PBS three times and stored at −80 °C until the multiplexed fluorescence imaging step.

To construct the sequencing library, the pooled cDNA extraction solution was first purified using the Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit, following the recommended 5:1 ratio and eluted into 100 μl of nuclease-free water. Biotinylated cDNAs were captured using streptavidin beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1, Invitrogen). Before use, the beads were washed three times with 1× B&W buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 and resuspended in 100 µl of 2× B&W buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl). The beads were then mixed with the purified cDNA in a 1:1 volume ratio and incubated with gentle rotation at room temperature for 60 min. The beads were subsequently washed twice with 1× B&W buffer and once with 1× Tris buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. Streptavidin beads bound with cDNA molecules were resuspended in 200 μl of TSO Mix (75 μl nuclease-free water, 40 μl 5× RT buffer, 40 μl 20% Ficoll PM-400, 20 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 10 μl 200 U μl−1 Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 5 μl 40 U μl−1 RNase Inhibitor, 10 μl 100 μM TSO Primer). The template switch reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min and then at 42 °C for 90 min with gentle rotation. Afterward, the beads underwent a single wash with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 0.1% Tween 20 and another wash with nuclease-free water. Second-strand synthesis was then performed as follows: the beads were washed twice with TE-TW buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) and resuspended in freshly prepared 200 μl 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min with gentle rotation. The beads were washed once with 500 μl of TE-TW, and once with 500 μl 1× TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). The beads were then resuspended in 200 μl second-strand synthesis reaction solution (40 μl Maxima 5× RT Buffer, 20 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 2 μl 1 mM dN-SMRT oligo, 5 μl Klenow Enzyme 133 μl H2O) and rotated end-over-end at 37 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with nuclease-free water and were resuspended in 200 μl of PCR Mix (100 μl 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 84 μl nuclease-free water, 8 μl 10 μM PCR Primer 1, 8 μl 10 μM PCR Primer 2). This suspension was then distributed into PCR strip tubes. An initial amplification was performed with the following PCR program: 95 °C for 3 min, five cycles at 98 °C for 20 s, 63 °C for 45 seconds, 72 °C for 3 min, followed by an extension at 72 °C for 3 min and a hold at 4 °C. The PCR product was purified using SPRIselect beads at a 0.8× ratio, according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The resulting cDNA amplicon was then analyzed using the TapeStation system with D5000 DNA ScreenTape and reagents. The purified PCR product can be stored at −20 °C until the next steps if necessary.

The SEQuoia RiboDepletion Kit was used to remove rRNA and mitochondrial rRNA from the amplified cDNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. 20 ng of cDNA was used as the input amount, and three rounds of depletion were performed. We observed that two rounds of depletion could suffice. Next, following the PCR steps described in the previous step, ten PCR cycles were sufficient to directly ligate sequencing primers, using a 100 μl system consisting of 50 μl 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, ~27 μl solution from the rRNA removal step, 4 μl 10 μM P5 primer, and 4 μl 10 μM P7 primer and ~15 μl of water. The library product was purified using SPRIselect beads at a 0.7× ratio, according to the manufacturer's standard protocol, and sent out to Novogene Corporation to be sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 or NovaSeq X Plus Sequencing System with paired-end reads of 150 base pairs in length.

A modified version of the CODEX PhenoCycler-Fusion protocol (https://www.akoyabio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CODEX-User-Manual.pdf) was adopted for tissue sections used in the DBiTplus workflow. Since the tissue had already been deparaffinized and rehydrated during the DBiTplus workflow, the CODEX process began with a gentle antigen retrieval step using 1× AR9 buffer for 5–10 min. The tissue was then allowed to cool to room temperature and was rinsed twice with nuclease-free water and hydration buffer, followed by staining buffer as the antibody cocktail was prepared. The tissue slide was incubated with the antibody cocktail at room temperature for 3 h in a humidified chamber. After incubation, the tissue underwent a series of steps including post-fixation, ice-cold methanol incubation and a final fixation step. Attached to the flow cell, the tissue section was incubated in 1× PhenoCycler buffer with additive for at least 10 min to improve adhesion. The CODEX cycles were then set up, the reporter plate was prepared and loaded, and the imaging process began. A final .qptiff file was generated, at the end that could be viewed using QuPath (V0.5.1)44. For further details on the PhenoCycler antibody panels, experimental cycle design and reporter plate volumes, see Supplementary Data 1.

MxIF staining and imaging was performed using the CellScape platform (Bruker Spatial Biology). Human FFPE CLL samples were prepared as previously described and shipped to Bruker Spatial Biology in Saint Louis at 4 °C. Pre-DBIT samples were shipped in standard slide mailers. Post-DBIT samples were shipped in 50 ml conical tubes with PBS to prevent sample dehydration in transit. In preparation for staining, pre-DBIT samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated according to the CellScape user manual. Briefly, pre-DBIT samples were washed for 5 min three times in HistoClear II (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield), two times in 100% ethanol (EtOH), one time each in 90% EtOH, 70% EtOH, 50% EtOH, 30% EtOH and, finally, CellScape Wash Buffer. Immediately following deparaffinization (pre-DBIT samples), or 24 h before running the CellScape experiment (post-DBIT), heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed at 110–120 °C under low pressure in a pressure cooker with samples placed in plastic Coplin jars (Fisher, Waltham) filled with Discovery CC1 buffer (Roche, Basel) for 15 min. Thereafter, samples were allowed to cool for 25 min on the benchtop. Slides were then washed with CellScape Wash Buffer, mounted in the CellScape Whole-Slide Imaging Chamber, which was immediately filled with CellScape Storage Buffer and stored at 4 °C until use. The multiplex proteomic assay was performed on the CellScape platform using automated iterative cycles of fluorophore-conjugated primary antibody staining, imaging and photobleaching. The assay consisted of 12 cycles, with each cycle beginning with a 10-s photobleach and subsequent background measurement for each channel to be stained. This was followed by automated staining of up to three antibodies incubated for 15 min per cycle. Antibodies were subsequently washed off and fluorescence images were acquired. The 31-plex assay included Sytox Green (Thermo, S7020), the VistaPlex Cell Boundaries (Bruker Spatial Biology, VISTAPLEX3101), Immune Profiling (Bruker Spatial Biology, VISTAPLEX3102) and Architecture (Bruker Spatial Biology, VISTAPLEX 3103) kits, as well as the following custom-conjugated primary antibodies: LEF1 (Abcam, ab137872), CD5 (Leica, CD5-4C7-L-U) and CD23 (Leica, CD23-1B12-L-U).

Following the mxIF imaging, the flow cell can be removed and histological H&E staining performed on the same tissue section. To remove the flow cell, the tissue slide with the flow cell is immersed in xylene or HistoClear for a minimum of 20 min to weaken the adhesive. A razor was then used to carefully detach the flow cell from the tissue slide. The tissue slide was then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and then with 1× PhenoCycler Buffer without additive three times for 10 min each. Histological H&E staining on the FFPE sections was conducted by YPTS. The H&E images were taken using the Motic EasyScan digital slide scanner at a magnification of ×40.

The standard CODEX data preprocessing and filtering pipeline was first applied to extract cell positions and cell-level features from two adjacent CODEX slices separately. Six marker points were then manually identified from the two stacked CODEX images. The optimal affine transformation, which minimized the distance between paired marker points, was estimated using the ‘transform' module from the Python package ‘skimage'. This transformation was subsequently applied to align cell positions from the two slices into a common coordinate system. To ensure statistical robustness, the spatial dimensions were discretized into bins with a pixel size of 100 (~4,000 common bins), and the mean values of selected features were computed by aggregating the cells within each bin. Common bins across both datasets were identified, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the strength of linear relationships between corresponding features, and scatterplots were generated to visually represent the correlations.

Read 2 from the FASTQ file was processed to extract UMIs and spatial barcodes A and B. Read 1, containing cDNA sequences, was aligned to the mouse GRCm39 or human GRCh38 reference genome using STAR (V2.7.8a)45. Spatial barcode sequences were demultiplexed with ST_Pipeline (V1.8.1)46, using the predefined coordinates of the microfluidic channels, and ENSEMBL IDs were converted to gene names. This generated a gene-by-spot expression matrix for downstream analysis. Entries in the matrix that corresponded to spot positions without tissue were excluded.

The spatial transcriptomic data from the Richter's transformation (Fig. 5) was preprocessed following the ASTRO Pipeline47, also utilized by Bai et al.13.

For comparative analyses, and to account for varying sequencing depths, the raw sequencing reads were uniformly downsampled to the read count of the sample with the minimum number of reads using Seqkit (V2.3.1)48. The downsampled reads were processed as described in the sequence alignment and generation of gene expression matrix section above. The average number of UMIs and genes per pixel were calculated during the spatial gene expression analysis using the Seurat (V4.3.0)49 pipeline, taking into account only useful pixels (pixels actually covering tissue) and were visualized as violin plots.

Spatial gene expression analysis at the spot level was conducted using the Seurat V4.3.0 pipeline. Initially, gene expression within each spot was normalized and variance-stabilized using the SCTransform method, specifically designed for scRNA-seq datasets. Linear dimensional reduction was then performed with the ‘RunPCA' function, and the optimal number of principal components for further analysis was determined using a heuristic approach, visualized by an ‘Elbow plot' that ranks principal component analysis (PCA) components by their variance percentages. Subsequently, the ‘FindNeighbors' function embedded spots into a k-nearest-neighbor graph structure based on Euclidean distance in PCA space, and the ‘FindClusters' function applied a modularity optimization technique to cluster the spots. The ‘RunUMAP' function was used to visually explore spatial heterogeneities through the UMAP algorithm. Finally, DEGs defining each cluster were identified using the ‘FindMarkers' function for pairwise comparisons between spot groups or ‘FindAllMarkers' for DEGs for each identity (cluster or cell type) versus all other cells combined.

All scRNA-seq data utilized in this study are publicly available. The scRNA-seq dataset for the mouse embryo was obtained from the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas Project, which can be accessed at https://oncoscape.v3.sttrcancer.org/atlas.gs.washington.edu.mouse.rna/landing/. For this study, cells with a ‘development_stage' of 10.5 to 11.5 days post-coitum were selected to correspond with CODEX measurements, using the MaxFuse method as described below. Doublet removal and cell annotations were conducted by the original authors of the dataset. The scRNA-seq dataset for human lymph nodes was retrieved from the Cell2location repository, and is available for download at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/cell2location.cog.sanger.ac.uk/paper/integrated_lymphoid_organ_scrna/RegressionNBV4Torch_57covariates_73260cells_10237genes/sc.h5ad__;!!IBzWLUs!XDud8EZcXLnWNMGYjYHAFdgJyM_lWL-_j9l6RweZDqQXLP1uY3a78B7_-BgAEzSHFVLk6TfuCwekjLtKGhyb4z8FJVvCtJhUcRVGqg$/. Cell-type annotations were provided by the original study.

Whole-cell segmentation was performed using the Mesmer method14 using pretrained weights. For cell mask prediction, the default training resolution of 0.5 μm per spot was adopted. Cells within the [0.05, 0.95] cell-size quantile range and possessing DAPI signal intensities exceeding the 0.1 quantile threshold were retained for analysis. mxIF features were extracted by summing the signal for each feature per cell. For each mxIF feature, the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles were calculated, and each single-cell-level mxIF feature was subsequently scaled to a [0, 1] range, with the 0.05 quantile mapped to 0 and the 0.95 quantile mapped to 1. Values exceeding this range were clipped to 0 or 1, as appropriate.

The integration of scRNA-seq data and mxIF data was accomplished utilizing the MaxFuse algorithm11. Before integration, standard preprocessing protocols were applied to all scRNA-seq data using Scanpy. This preprocessing included count normalization, log1p transformation and the identification of highly variable genes, resulting in the selection of 5,000 genes exhibiting the highest variability. Linked features between the scRNA-seq and mxIF datasets were identified based on corresponding protein and gene names. From these linked features, those with a standard deviation greater than 0.01 were selected to enhance integration performance. During the pivot matching process, the number of principal components used to construct the nearest-neighbor graph was determined by examining the elbow of the singular value decomposition plot. A smoothing weight of 0.3 was applied, as recommended by the MaxFuse method, to account for the weak linkage between the two modalities. Following integration, low-quality pivots were removed to ensure the reliability of the cross-modal pivot pairs. Approximately 10% of cells from the mxIF datasets, representing high-confidence matches, were selected to construct these pivot pairs. For each pivot pair, cell-type labels from the scRNA-seq data were transferred to the matched mxIF cells. To extend cell-type annotation to the entire mxIF dataset, a support vector machine model was trained on the pivot mxIF cells to predict cell-type labels based on protein expression measurements. Once trained, the model was applied to the remaining non-pivot cells within the mxIF dataset, thereby achieving comprehensive cell-type annotation across the dataset.

To isolate the highly proliferative, enlarged B cell population in the MZL and CLL to DLBCL samples, we applied a three-way thresholding strategy based on protein abundance and morphometric size. For each of the markers CD20 and Ki67, as well as for the per-cell area measurement, we calculated the 60th-percentile value across all cells in the tissue section. Any cell whose CD20 intensity exceeded the CD20 0.6 quantile and whose Ki67 intensity exceeded the Ki67 0.6 quantile and whose physical cell size exceeded the area 0.6 quantile simultaneously was labeled as a ‘large B cell'. Cells failing to meet this simultaneous triple threshold were not assigned to this category. All cells that did not satisfy the ‘large B' criteria were subsequently merged with the scRNA-seq reference using the MaxFuse pipeline, followed by the label-transfer procedure detailed in the ‘Integration of mxIF imaging data with scRNA-seq' section. Conversion of cell size from pixel to area was based on the resolution of 0.5 μm per pixel. Diameter was inferred by modeling the cell as a circle and computing the diameter based on number of pixels in the segmentation mask.

To align the high-resolution mxIF image with the low-resolution DBiTplus spot image of the FFPE mouse embryo dataset, tissue boundaries were initially identified in both images. The input image was first smoothed using a Gaussian filter (implemented via the ‘filters.gaussian' function from the scikit-image package) to reduce noise and enhance relevant structures. Subsequently, Otsu's thresholding method (used through the ‘filters.threshold_otsu' function from the scikit-image package) was applied to the smoothed image to compute an optimal threshold value. This threshold was then used to generate a binary image, effectively separating the foreground (potential tissue) from the background. To ensure the detected regions were solid, any holes within the binary regions were filled using a binary hole-filling algorithm (utilizing the ‘binary_fill_holes' function from the SciPy package). The final output was a binary image with no holes enabling identification of the tissue's outer boundary. Following the identification of tissue boundaries, an optimal similarity transformation was determined and applied to the mxIF image. This transformation was computed using the ‘transform' module from the scikit-image package, aiming to minimize the squared error loss between the transformed mxIF image and the DBiTplus image. Given the cell positions in the mxIF image and spot positions in the DBiTplus image, the learned image transformation can be utilized to register the cells. This registration ensures that cellular-level data from the mxIF images are correctly aligned with the spatial transcriptomics data from the DBiTplus spots.

The reference scRNA-seq dataset was normalized to a common total count per cell corresponding to the dataset's median sequencing depth. Specifically, total counts were calculated for each cell in the scRNA-seq dataset, the median value was determined and this value was used as the ‘target_sum‘ in the function ‘scanpy.pp.normalize_total'. Following normalization, the average expression profile for each cell type was computed based on the normalized counts. μk,j denotes the average raw expression of gene j of cell type k in the scRNA-seq data. The deconvolution of DBiTplus spots is achieved by computing the cell-type proportions of mxIF cells aligned to each spot. Let βk,i denote the proportion of the contribution of cell type k to spot i, and xi,j denote the total raw expression of gene j in DBiTplus spot i. To attribute gene expression to specific cell types within each DBiTplus spot, we split each spot into pure cell-type sub-spots. This is done by computing the expected cell-type-specific gene expression at each DBiTplus spot. The calculation uses the formula shown in equation (1):

For single-cell-level gene data analysis, to normalize gene expression values, we first calculated the median UMI counts per pure cell-type sub-spot. This median value was then used as the scale.factor in the NormalizeData function so that all sub-spots are normalized to a common library size representative of the dataset's central tendency. Linear dimension reduction was then performed with the ‘RunPCA' function, and the optimal number of principal components for further analysis was determined using a heuristic approach, visualized by an ‘elbow plot' that ranks PCA components by their variance percentages. Subsequently, the ‘FindNeighbors' function embedded spots into a k-nearest-neighbor graph structure based on Euclidean distance in PCA space, and the ‘FindClusters' function (resolution = 0.7, all other parameters at default values) applied a modularity optimization technique to cluster the sub-spots. The ‘RunUMAP' function was used to visually explore spatial heterogeneities through the UMAP algorithm. Finally, DEGs defining each cluster were identified using the ‘FindMarkers' function for pairwise comparisons between spot groups or ‘FindAllMarkers' for differential expression for each identity (cluster or cell type) versus all other cells combined.

mxIF cells were aggregated into pure cell-type sub-spots, and DBiTplus spots were similarly divided into pure cell-type sub-spots. Subsequent analyses were performed using the Seurat WNN methodology, with measurements from the pure cell-type sub-spots serving as input data. The RNA data underwent normalization using a scale factor derived from the median UMI count. Following normalization, variable features were identified, and PCA was conducted on the RNA assay. Subsequently, the default assay was switched to the protein modality, variable features were identified, and PCA was performed on the protein data under the reduction name ‘apca'. For each cell, the nearest neighbors within the dataset were determined based on a weighted combination of RNA and protein similarities. The cell-specific modality weights and multimodal neighbors were calculated using the ‘FindMultiModalNeighbors' function. The integrated results were then utilized for visualization and clustering.

We used Cell2location for the deconvolution analysis. First, a negative binomial regression model was trained to estimate reference transcriptomic profiles for all cell types profiled with scRNA-seq data (sc_subsampled_park2020.h5ad). The ‘major celltype' annotation was used to ensure consistency. Lowly expressed genes were excluded using the filtering strategy recommended by Cell2location (cell_count_cutoff = 5, cell_percentage_cutoff2 = 0.03, nonz_mean_cutoff = 1.12). The model was trained for 600 epochs and reached convergence. Next, we estimated cell-type abundances in the spatial transcriptomics dataset (LN50UM) using the reference profiles. The following Cell2location hyperparameters were applied: N_cells_per_location = 33 (estimated from nuclei counts in H&E images using QuPath, version 0.50). Training was stopped after 50,000 iterations, with all other parameters set to default values. To assess concordance between our mxIF-guided deconvolution and the Cell2location results, we calculated, for each spot, the Pearson correlation between the vectors of cell-type proportions produced by the two methods. Correlations were summarized by: (i) the proportion of spots above thresholds (>0.9, >0.8, >0.7, >0.6), and (ii) spatial heat maps of correlation values derived from spot coordinates. We also plotted the overall correlation distribution using 0.1-wide bins. RCTD provides a principled, likelihood-based framework for inferring which single-cell transcriptional programs underlie the mRNA captured in each spatial spot. Conceptually, it treats the observed counts as a mixture of reference cell-type profiles and estimates the mixture fractions that best explain the data, while explicitly accounting for technical variability such as total UMI depth. In our workflow, the analysis was implemented in R (spacexr v2.2.1) with Seurat, SeuratDisk and zellkonverter facilitating seamless interchange between Seurat and AnnData formats. The DBiTplus dataset supplied the query layer: raw spot-level counts were extracted from the Spatial assay, two-dimensional spot coordinates were obtained through GetTissueCoordinates() and spot-specific library sizes were computed with colSums(counts). These three components were wrapped in a SpatialRNA() object, which together with a preprocessed single-cell reference served as input to create.RCTD(). Model fitting proceeded via run.RCTD() with doublet_mode = ‘full'. The resulting cell-type weight matrix was normalized so that proportions across all reference types sum to one in every spot (normalize_weights()), appended to the DBiT Seurat object with AddMetaData(), and finally exported for downstream comparison with other deconvolution methods and for integration into our spatial analyses. Cell-type deconvolution with TACCO (v0.2.2) was performed in Python. Deconvolution was carried out with tc.tl.annotate, which treats every spatial spot as a compositional mixture of the single-cell expression profiles. Specifically, we passed the DBiT AnnData object (adata) and the gene-matched reference (ref) to tc.tl.annotate, using ‘celltype' as the label to be transferred, result_key = ‘TACCO' to store the output, and reconstruction_key = ‘rec' to save reconstructed expression values. Setting multi_center = 1 let the algorithm place a single, data-driven centroid in expression space for each cell type, striking a balance between flexibility and over-fitting. After inference, ‘tc.pp.filter' was applied to mirror any gene or cell filtering decisions across reference and query, ensuring that subsequent comparisons rested on an identical feature space.

Pseudotemporal analysis was performed with Monocle 3 (ref. 15) on average gene expressions of pure cell-type sub-spots obtained from proteome-informed cell-type deconvolution of the DBiTplus spots. The Seurat object was subset to include only cell types of interest. The raw count matrix was converted converted to a monocle cell dataset using the ‘new_cell_data_set' function. The raw count matrix was normalized with the ‘preprocess_cds' function. Dimensionality reduction was performed with the ‘reduce_dimension' function with default parameters (reduction_method = ‘UMAP', umap.n_neighbors = 15, umap.min_dist = 0.1, preprocess_method = ‘PCA'). Next, the cells were clustered using the ‘cluster_cell' function and the ‘learn_graph' function to generate a principal graph from the reduced dimension space. The ‘order_cells' function was used to order the observations in a pseudotemporal manner and the trajectory visualized with the ‘plot_cells' function. Pseudotime plots of specific genes were plotted using the ‘plot_genes_in_pseudotime' function. The ‘graph_test' function was used to identify DEGs and the heat map of the DEGs plotted (both k-means and hierarchical clustering) with a modified version of code from ref. 50.

Ingenuity pathway analysis (Qiagen)51 was used to explore the biological pathways implicated in the DEGs from our Seurat clusters or cell types. The gene expression profile of each pure cell-type sub-spot was replicated m times where m is the number of cells of the corresponding cell type in the corresponding spot. This replication step ensured proper sample sizes for P-value calculations. The DEGs per cluster or cell type are generated using the FindAllMarkers function or FindMarkers (for pairwise comparisons) in Seurat. The list of genes with corresponding log2fold change values, P value and adjusted P value of each gene, was exported as a CSV file and used as input for the Qiagen ingenuity pathway analysis software. The Ingenuity Knowledge Base (genes only) served as the reference set for performing core expression analysis. The z-score assesses the activation or inhibition level of specific pathways by measuring the congruence between the observed gene expression profile and the pathway's known regulatory pattern from the literature. Positive z-scores denote predicted activation or upregulation, whereas negative z-scores indicate inhibition or downregulation. A z-score ≥ 2 signifies a statistically significant upregulation in pathway activity whereas a z-score ≤ −2 denotes significant downregulation of a specific pathway. The significance (−log10P value) of each pathway enrichment is further evaluated using a right-tailed Fisher's exact test. Pathways were plotted as bar charts using Prism V10 or R (4.2.0-foss-2020b). The graphical summary provides a quick overview of the major biological themes in the ingenuity pathway analysis core analysis. The upstream regulator analysis identifies a list of upstream regulators that may be responsible for the observed gene expression changes in the list of DEGs in our datasets. The enhanced causal network analysis provides a comprehensive approach to identifying upstream molecules that control the expression of the DEGs in our datasets.

Prism V10 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analyses and the specific tests used are indicated in the main text and figure captions.

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction, including pathological CD4+ T cell immunosuppression, are archetypal in critical illness, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. Here we characterized the metabolic properties of human CD4+ T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4+ T cells in critical illness showed subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T (Treg) cells preferentially acquiring glycolytic capacity that associated with sustained cellular fitness and worsened clinical illness. Adapted Treg cells were more metabolically flexible and stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT under mitochondrial stress. Single-cell transcriptomics suggested reactive oxygen species (ROS) and kynurenine metabolism as drivers of Treg cell remodeling. Subsequent inhibition of ROS and kynurenine metabolism attenuated glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring, respectively, in Treg cells. These findings indicate that metabolic dysfunction was a contributor to CD4+ T cell remodeling in critical illness and suggest avenues to restore effective immunity.

Critical illness (CI) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and life support due to severe organ failure affects over 5 million patients annually in the USA1. Among the most common ICU diagnoses is sepsis, a dysregulated host response to infection causing end-organ injury2. Sepsis accounts domestically for over 200,000 deaths per year and more than US$24 billion in healthcare expenditures3,4. Current management includes antimicrobials and/or surgical source control to address the inciting infection alongside supportive care measures, including vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy, to sustain vital functions while host repair mechanisms mediate recovery. Despite decades of research, no targeted therapies exist to effectively treat the pathophysiology of sepsis5.

Immunologic dysfunction is a hallmark of sepsis. Early sepsis features excessive inflammation with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (referred to as a ‘cytokine storm') that contribute to tissue injury6. In parallel, a compensatory but disproportionate immunosuppressive response develops and can continue beyond the acute phase. This impaired immune state predisposes patients to secondary infections, persistent organ dysfunction, hospital readmissions and death7,8,9. CD4+ T cells are central to this immunosuppressive remodeling, with effector CD4+ T cells acquiring an ‘exhausted-like' phenotype characterized by high PD-1 and LAG-3 expression, attenuated TNF and interferon-γ (IFNγ) secretion and increased apoptosis, whereas suppressive Treg cells are relatively preserved10,11,12. The severity of this cell-mediated immune impairment is underscored by the frequent detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in critically ill patients13 at rates similar to solid organ transplant recipients receiving T cell immunosuppressants14. Although these phenotypes are consistently observed, the pathways underlying CD4+ T cell immunosuppression in human CI and sepsis remain incompletely understood.

Metabolic dysfunction is pervasive in CI, including sepsis15. The metabolic state of immune cells is a mechanistic determinant of their fate and function. Immunometabolism is central to the pathogenesis of obesity, autoimmunity, cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection16,17 and metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in these conditions18. Previous human studies from individuals with sepsis have reported abnormalities in mitochondrial complex I and V activities and broad impairments in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation among bulk T lymphocytes19,20; however, the overall role of CD4+ T cell immunometabolism in sepsis and other CI syndromes remains understudied, particularly stratified by CD4+ T cell subset.

In this study, we used biospecimens from critically ill patients to comprehensively profile the metabolic dependencies and capacities of CD4+ T cell subsets. We showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven glycolytic reprogramming, together with increased kynurenine metabolism, heightened metabolic plasticity in Treg cells and promoted their resilience and suppressive function at the expense of conventional CD4+ T cell subsets. This enhanced glycolytic capacity in Treg cells was additionally associated with worse clinical outcomes.

We prospectively collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 156 patients in the medical and surgical ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center upon ICU admission, as well as serially, at day 2 and day 7 post-admission if available (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1). Participants were adjudicated into critically ill patients who were nonseptic (CI-NS; n = 75, 57% male, median age 63 years, IQR 55–70) and critically ill patients with sepsis (CI-Sep; n = 81, 62% male, median age 65 years, IQR 56–75; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Nonacutely ill healthy control participants (NHCs; n = 24, 54% male, median age 54 years, IQR 42–58) were recruited from the community as controls. Complete blood counts from CI-NS and CI-Sep showed a mixed neutrophilic (NHC median 3.72 × 103 μl−1, CI-NS 7.12 × 103 μl−1 and CI-Sep 13.51 × 103 μl−1) and monocytic (NHC median 0.42 × 103 μl−1, CI-NS 0.57 × 103 μl−1 and CI-Sep 0.67 × 103 μl−1) response with marked lymphopenia (NHC median 1.92 × 103 μl−1, CI-NS 0.99 × 103 μl−1 and CI-Sep 0.83 × 103 μl−1) (Fig. 1b,c), as reported21, a characteristic hematologic pattern in critically ill patients reflecting heightened innate immune activation and loss of circulating lymphocytes.

Source data

To decipher the immunometabolic landscape of CD4+ T cells in CI-NS and CI-Sep, we used a puromycin-incorporation assay in 9 NHC, 30 CI-NS and 32 CI-Sep samples collected 48–72 h (day 2) post-ICU admission. CD4+ T cell subsets, including CD45RA+CCR7+ naive T (TN) cells, CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory T (TEM) cells, CD45RA−CCR7+ central memory T (TCM) cells, CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells, CXCR3+CCR6− type 1 helper T (TH1) cells and CCR4+CCR6+ TH17 cells, had similar dependence on glucose, fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis compared to NHCs (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), whereas mitochondrial dependence and glycolytic capacity broadly differed between CI and NHCs (Fig. 1e,f). Compared to NHCs, CI Treg cells showed the greatest increase in glycolytic capacity (median CI-NS +15%, CI-Sep +34%), whereas TEM (CI-NS +2%, CI-Sep +12%), TH1 (CI-NS +4%, CI-Sep +9%) and TH17 (CI-NS +8%, CI-Sep +6%) had the least increase (Fig. 1f). These differences were higher in CI-Sep compared with CI-NS (Fig. 1f). There was broadly increased metabolic output across all CD4+ T cell subsets in CI compared with NHC (Fig. 1g). Treg cell glycolytic capacity remained persistently raised up to day 7 of hospitalization (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Two metabolically distinct programs marked by sensitivity (Purolo) or resistance (Purohi) to the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin were detected in Treg cells from NHCs, whereas CI-Sep Treg cells were considerably enriched in Purohi cells (Fig. 1i,j). Collectively, although their baseline dependence on glucose was unchanged, CI Treg cells showed reduced mitochondrial dependence and higher overall glycolytic capacity, indicating metabolic flexibility as part of a putative stress-adaptive program.

While lymphopenia was evident in both CI-NS and CI-Sep, the degree of attrition varied across CD4+ T cell subsets (Fig. 1k). At day 2 post-ICU admission, CI-Sep patients showed reduced frequencies of conventional CD4+ T (Tconv) cell) subsets relative to NHCs, including TN cells (median 9% versus 16%), TEM cells (5% versus 13%), TH1 cells (2% versus 6%) and TH17 cells (0.3% versus 0.6%). By contrast, the frequency of Treg cells was preserved in CI-Sep (0.8%) compared with NHC (0.9%) (Fig. 1k). Estimated absolute cell counts showed a similar tendency in a subset of 4 NHCs, 13 CI-NS and 18 CI-Sep (Extended Data Fig. 2d), aligning with reports that stable or increased Treg cell frequencies in sepsis reflect a loss of Tconv cell subsets10. Treg cell proliferation was similar in CI compared to NHCs (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Increased acquisition of glycolytic capacity, represented as the change in CI-Sep versus NHC mean glycolytic capacity for each CD4+ T cell subset, directly associated with CD4+ T cell subset resistance to attrition (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 2f), consistent with metabolic plasticity as a determinant of cellular persistence in CI and sepsis that ultimately favors Treg cells over CD4+ Tconv cells.

Profiling of glycolytic and oxidative features of CD4+ T cell subsets indicated that glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 1 (HK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were broadly increased in CI-NS and CI-Sep (Fig. 2a-c), whereas GAPDH was not substantially changed compared to the NHC CD4+ T cell subset counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Phosphofructokinase (PFKP) was modestly decreased in CI-Sep Treg cells compared with NHC Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Additionally, the mitochondrial electron carrier cytochrome c, which is central to oxidative phosphorylation, was similarly expressed between CI and NHCs across all CD4+ T cell subsets (Fig. 2d). Analysis of mitochondrial attributes showed that CD4 TN cells had higher mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ratio of MMP:mass in CI-Sep compared with NHCs (Fig. 2e-i). CI-Sep TEM cells were enriched for a population of cells with high mitochondrial mass, but negligible MMP (MasshiMMPlo) (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with severe mitochondrial dysfunctional and/or cell death and aligning with the high rate of attrition of CD4+ TEM cells in CI. Overall, CI drove broad metabolic remodeling across CD4+ T cell subsets, with Treg cells showing the most pronounced glycolytic augmentation and resistance to attrition.

To assess the functional capacities of CD4+FOXP3− Tconv and CD4+FOXP3+Treg cells in CI, PBMCs isolated from 10 NHCs, 14 CI-NS and 13 CI-Sep were stimulated with antibodies against CD3, CD28 plus CD2 (CD3/CD28/CD2 antibodies) to stimulate the T cell antigen receptor for 24 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. The frequency of TNF+, IL-17A+ and IL-4+CD4+ Tconv cells was higher, whereas the frequency of IFNγ+CD4+ Tconv cells was similar, in CI-Sep compared to NHCs (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a); however, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of TNF among TNF+CD4+ Tconv cells was lower in CI-Sep compared with NHCs (Fig. 3b), consistent with an exhausted-like phenotype. IL-2+CD4+ Tconv cells were also more frequent in CI-NS and CI-Sep compared with healthy controls (Fig. 3b), potentially reflecting autocrine and/or paracrine survival signaling. CD4+ Tconv cells in CI-NS and CI-Sep exhibited increased frequency and MFI of activation (CD25) and checkpoint (PD-1 and LAG-3) proteins compared with CD4+ Tconv cells in NHCs (Fig. 3c), indicating a mixed phenotype of activation and impairment consistent with their cytokine profile.

Treg cells also exhibited functional and phenotypic differences in CI-NS and CI-Sep compared with NHCs. CI-NS and CI-Sep had a higher frequency of PD-1+ and LAG-3+ Treg cells, markers associated with suppressive effector Treg cells in humans, compared with NHCs22,23 (Fig. 3d,e). In addition, CD39 and TIGIT are markers of highly suppressive Treg cells that inhibit Tconv cells by several mechanisms including participating in the hydrolysis of proinflammatory extracellular ATP24 and by promoting secretion of (FGL225, respectively. Both CD39 and TIGIT had sustained expression across NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep Treg cells compared with NHCs (Fig. 3d,e). The frequency and MFI of IL-10, as well as expression of proinflammatory cytokines like IFNγ and IL-17A were also comparable in NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep Treg cells (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). CI-Sep and CI-NS Treg cells had increased expression of CD25, which is associated with suppressive function26, and similar expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 compared with NHC Treg cells (Fig. 3e). Together, these expression patterns point to an overall more suppressive phenotype of CI Treg cells relative to NHC Treg cells.

Increased metabolic plasticity in subsets of CD4+ T cells may enable adaptation to mitochondrial stress27, which is systemic in CI. To investigate this interplay, we stimulated PBMCs from 10 NHC, 14 CI-NS and 13 CI-Sep with or without a sublethal dose (10 nM) of the mitochondrial electron transport complex V inhibitor oligomycin for 24 h to partially impair mitochondrial energetics and simulate ICU-associated mitochondrial stress. Expression of FOXP3, which directly correlates with Treg cell suppressor activity28, decreased in NHC Treg cells (−16%), but was relatively preserved in CI-NS (−9%) and CI-Sep Treg cells (−4%) incubated with oligomycin (Fig. 3f,g). The frequency of highly suppressive TIGIT+ Treg cells increased in CI-NS (+21%) and CI-Sep (+23%) but not in NHC (−4%) when stimulated and exposed to oligomycin compared with stimulation alone, although TIGIT MFI in TIGIT+ Treg cells was modestly and equivalently reduced in NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep Treg cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3f,h and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Expression of CD25, CD39 and IL-10 changed variably in Treg cells incubated with oligomycin, but the changes did not differ between NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). The frequency of LAG-3+ Treg cells was reduced in CI-NS and CI-Sep, but not in NHC stimulated and oligomycin-incubated PBMCs, compared with stimulation alone (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Thus, the more metabolically plastic Treg cells in CI had increased resistance to mitochondrial stress and maintained expression of FOXP3 and TIGIT.

The frequency of TNF+, IFNγ+, IL-4+ and IL-17A+ Tconv cells decreased to varying degrees in stimulated oligomycin-exposed PBMCs compared with stimulation alone, but the magnitude of reduction was comparable between NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep (Fig. 3i). There were modest differences in the MFI of IL-17A and TNF in CD4 Tconv cells in CI-Sep versus NHCs after oligomycin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4f). By contrast, expression of CD25, PD-1 and LAG-3 were more strongly reduced in oligomycin-treated CD4 Tconv cells in CI-NS and CI-Sep compared with NHCs (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Expression of the pro-survival cytokine IL-2 was impaired in oligomycin-treated CD4 Tconv cell from CI-NS and CI-Sep compared with NHCs (Fig. 3i), underscoring a metabolically enforced vulnerability that may predispose to attrition in CI. In summary, CI Treg cells resisted mitochondrial stress and thereby maintained a suppressive phenotype, whereas CI Tconv exhibited persistent vulnerability to mitochondrial impairment with loss of effector function.

To investigate the mechanisms of CD4+ T cell metabolic remodeling, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on PBMCs from 9 NHC, 19 CI-NS and 19 CI-Sep donors. This yielded a dataset consisting of 644,147 cells, which were annotated using canonical transcriptional markers as 9 major cell lineages and 27 distinct cell populations (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5). The proportion of total CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes was increased and that of CD4+ T lymphocytes was reduced in CI compared with NHCs (Fig. 4c). Among the CD4+ T cell subsets, we observed a reduction or tendency for reduction in the proportion of CD4+ TN cells and CD4+ TEM cells and a relative preservation of Treg cell proportion in CI compared with healthy controls (Fig. 4d), broadly consistent with the flow cytometry data.

Pseudobulked differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 to evaluate sample-level differences indicated that most transcriptional changes were unique to CI-Sep, or shared between CI-NS and CI-Sep (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 1). Accordingly, we focused subsequent analyses on CI-Sep compared with NHCs. All CI-Sep CD4+ T cell subsets had increased expression of inflammatory regulators (SOCS1 or SOCS3) among the top differentially expressed genes (Fig. 5b). CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells showed increased expression of activation-related (NFKBIZ and IL22) and negative feedback regulation (DUSP5) transcripts, whereas CI-Sep Treg cells exhibited increased expression of a glucocorticoid-responsive transcript (FKBP5) (Fig. 5b). Over-representation analysis found enrichment of cellular stress pathways across all CI-Sep CD4+ T cell subsets compared with NHCs (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 2). CI-Sep CD4+ TN cells showed transcriptional evidence of cellular activation (GOBP_LYMPOCYTE_ACTIVATION, GOBP_REGULATION_OF_CATABOLIC_PROCESS) (Fig. 5c), consistent with known bystander effects in sepsis29,30, whereas CI-Sep Treg cells showed disproportionate enrichment of pathways related to glucose catabolism (GOBP_GLUCOSE_CATABOLIC_PROCESS) as well as NADH regeneration (GOBP_NADH_REGENERATION) (Fig. 5c), which supports cellular redox balance.

ORA, over-representation analysis.

To further understand the transcriptional states of the CD4+ T cell subsets, we examined the expression patterns of individual genes canonically associated with core effector and regulatory programs in CD4+ TN, CD4+ TEM and Treg cells. Activation markers (CD69, ICOS and TFRC) were increased across all CD4+ T subsets in CI-Sep compared to NHCs (Fig. 5d). Some transcripts increased (IFNG, IL17A and IL22) and others decreased (IL2 and TNF) in CD4+ TEM cells in CI-Sep compared to NHCs (Fig. 5d). Mediators associated with wound healing and tissue repair (TGFB1 and AREG) were increased in CI-Sep CD4+ TN and TEM cells compared to NHCs (Fig. 5d), suggesting a role in tissue homeostasis beyond antimicrobial defense. CI-Sep Treg cells had increased expression of IL10, increased expression of transcripts encoding checkpoints markers (CTLA4, PDCD1 and LAG3), and persistently high expression of TIGIT and ENTPD1 compared to NHC Treg cells (Fig. 5d). CI-Sep Treg cells also showed comparable expression of FOXP3 relative to NHC Treg cells (Fig. 5d). STAT5A was increased in CI-Sep CD4+ TN cells, CD4+ TEM cells and Treg cells compared to NHCs (Fig. 5d), likely reflecting enhanced IL-2 and IL-7 signaling tone. CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells and Treg cells exhibited broadly remodeled chemokine and homing receptor expression (for example decreased CD4+ TEM cell CXCR3 and increased Treg cell CCR5 in CI-Sep relative to NHCs) (Fig. 5d), suggesting altered tissue recirculation. Finally, CD4+ TN, CD4+ TEM and Treg cells in CI-Sep expressed increased pro-apoptotic (BAX and BAK1) and anti-apoptotic (BCL2 and MCL2) transcripts compared to the NHC counterparts (Fig. 5d), consistent with severe cellular stress and a compensatory survival program.

We orthogonally validated the over-representation analysis approach with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) library, which broadly encompasses cellular processes and includes a robust group of metabolic gene sets. Very few pathways were significantly downregulated, limited to those related to spliceosome, herpes simplex virus 1 infection and metabolism of xenobiotics by CYP450 in CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells relative to NHC CD4+ TEM cells (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 3). CD4+ TN cells were marked by enrichment of pathways related to bacterial infection, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling (Fig. 5e). JAK-STAT signaling was significantly enriched in CI-Sep CD4+ TEM and Treg cells compared to NHCs, with additional enrichment of leukocyte transendothelial migration and microRNA pathways in CI-Sep Treg cells compared to NHCs (Fig. 5e). All CD4+ T cell subsets showed significant enrichment of HIF-1 signaling in CI-Sep compared to NHCs (Fig. 5f), consistent with widespread cellular hypoxia, a context in which metabolic plasticity may be critical to sustain cellular fitness and function. Glycolysis was enriched in CI-Sep CD4+ TN cells and Treg cells with minimal change in CD4+ TEM compared to their NHC counterparts (Fig. 5f). A trend toward oxidative phosphorylation enrichment was observed only in CI-Sep Treg cells relative to NHC Treg cells (Fig. 5f).

Evaluation of individual metabolic gene expression profiles in single cells indicated all CI-Sep CD4+ T cell subsets showed increased expression of genes involved in glucose transport (SLC2A3, encoding GLUT3), glycolytic processing (HK1, PFKP and PKM) and lactate production (LDHA) compared to NHCs (Fig. 5g). Tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcript abundance changes in CI-Sep CD4+ TN, CD4+ TEM and Treg cells were more modest and heterogenous compared to NHCs (Fig. 5g). Hypoxia-related genes (HIF1A, SLC16A3 and DDIT4) were consistently higher across CI-Sep CD4+ TN, CD4+ TEM and Treg cells compared to NHCs, as were several other core metabolic regulators including in fatty acid oxidation (CPT1A) and one-carbon metabolism (MTHFD2) (Fig. 5g). No single gene seemed to mediate the CD4+ T cell subset-specific difference in glycolytic capacity, though several transcripts (such as SLC2A3 and PFKP) were numerically most enriched in CI-Sep Treg cells compared to CI-Sep CD4+ TN and TEM cells (Fig. 5g). Overall, CI and sepsis globally rewired CD4+ T cell transcriptional states toward cellular activation and functional impairments, inflammatory stress and metabolic adaptation, with the most pronounced enhancement of glycolytic features found in Treg cells.

Next, pseudobulked differential expression analysis of the scRNA-seq dataset revealed few genes with robust statistically significant differences between CI-Sep (n = 19 donors) and CI-NS (n = 19 donors), although immune checkpoint markers were increased in CI-Sep CD4+ TEM (HAVCR2) and Treg (LAG3) cells compared to CI-NS (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 1). At single-cell level, CI-NS CD4+ TEM cells had a tendency toward a TH1 cell gene expression profile (IFNG, TBX21, EOMES and CXCR3), whereas CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells had a TH17-biased signature (IL17A, IL22, RORC and CCR6) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). In addition, the number of IL2 transcripts in CD4+ TN and TEM cells was reduced in CI-Sep compared to CI-NS (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To better explore these subtle differences, we performed GSEA using the KEGG pathway library. The most enriched pathways in CI-Sep relative to CI-NS, including HIF-1 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, were restricted to Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 3). By contrast, numerous pathways were downregulated across all CD4+ T cell subsets in CI-Sep compared to CI-NS, including autoinflammatory gene sets with overlapping leading-edge genes belonging to the HLA family (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). HLA transcripts, which have been linked to CD4+ T cell effector cytokine production, proliferation and survival31,32, had a slight tendency for reduction in expression at the single-cell and sample level in CI-Sep CD4+ T cells compared to CI-NS CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g), aligning with reports of reduced HLA expression in T cells from trauma patients who subsequently develop sepsis33. Broadly, CI-NS and CI-Sep CD4+ T cells generally clustered together based on their largely shared transcriptome and remained distinct from NHCs (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Together, sepsis status exerted only a modest impact on the overall CD4+ T cell transcriptome in CI.

Mitochondrial oxidative stress leads to the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, which can promote HIF-1α and increase the expression of glycolytic genes34. GSEA of the scRNA-seq dataset identified significantly increased ROS pathway activity in CD4+ TN cells and Treg cells from CI-Sep relative to NHCs (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 3), indicating mitochondrial ROS could be a driver of glycolytic remodeling in CI. Single-cell analysis indicated many (SOD2, TXN, MAP3K5 and ROMO1), although not all (GPX4), canonical ROS-associated genes were broadly increased in CI-Sep CD4+ T cells compared to NHCs (Fig. 6b). Flow cytometry showed increased mitochondrial ROS in CI-Sep CD4+ T cells compared to NHCs (Fig. 6c,d), whereas treatment of NHC (n = 6), CI-NS (n = 7) and CI-Sep (n = 8) PBMCs with MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrially targeted superoxide scavenger, for 24 h caused a large attenuation of the glycolytic remodeling in CI Treg cells (pooled from CI-NS and CI-Sep) compared to vehicle-treated CI Treg cells (mean glycolytic capacity 36% versus 49%, respectively) (Fig. 6e). A similar effect with MitoTEMPO treatment was not observed in CI CD4+ TN cells, and only modestly detected in CI CD4 TEM cells, compared to vehicle-treated CI TN and TEM cells, respectively (Fig. 6e). No appreciable effects of 24 h of MitoTEMPO treatment compared to vehicle treatment were observed on FOXP3 stabilization and TIGIT upregulation in CI Treg cells or on expression of TNF in CI CD4+ Tconv cells in stimulated PBMCs exposed to mitochondrial impairment with low-dose oligomycin (Fig. 6f,g). These findings implicated mitochondrial ROS as a mechanistic contributor to the acquisition of glycolytic capacity but not regulation of FOXP3 or TIGIT expression in Treg cells from patients who are CI.

To evaluate the factors that contributed to the stabilization of the suppressive phenotype, such as FOXP3 and TIGIT expression in CI-Sep Treg cells, we used computational flux balance analysis (FBA). Across a curated set of 22 metabolic reaction families from the global human metabolism reconstruction (Recon2) encompassing pathways for major macronutrient metabolism and those relevant directly to T cells, CI-Sep CD4+ Treg cells showed disproportionate enrichment in predicted flux through several pathways, including tryptophan metabolism, methionine and cysteine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, urea cycle and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism compared to CI-Sep TN and TEM and all NHC CD4+ T cell subsets (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 4). Tryptophan is metabolized by IDO1/2 or TDO2 into N-formyl-l-kynurenine, which is hydrolyzed to kynurenine (Fig. 7b). CD4+ T cells do not express IDO/TDO enzymes, but can uptake N-formyl-l-kynurenine and kynurenine through LAT1 (encoded by SLC7A5)35, which contribute to de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis, acetyl-CoA production and a variety of immunomodulatory intermediates36,37,38,39,40, including some that can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and/or promote Treg cell suppressive capacity in healthy human Treg cells41,42. Increased plasma levels of kynurenine are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis43,44. Pairwise comparisons of FBA results showed that across CI-Sep Treg cells versus NHC Treg cells, CI-Sep CD4+ TN cells or CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells, kynurenine-associated reactions were among the most substantially altered in the tryptophan metabolic network (Fig. 7c–e). There was a tendency for increased expression of genes for N-formyl-l-kynurenine and kynurenine import (SLC7A5), N-formyl-l-kynurenine hydrolysis (AFMID), kynurenine transamination (KYAT1 and KYAT3) and quinolinic acid catabolism for de novo NAD synthesis (QPRT) in CI-Sep Treg cells compared to NHC Treg cells, CI-Sep CD4+ TN cells or CI-Sep CD4+ TEM cells (Fig. 7f,g). Based on the intrinsic fluorescent properties of kynurenine, we measured kynurenine uptake in CD4+ T cell subsets by flow cytometry35. LAT1-mediated kynurenine uptake was increased in all CI-Sep CD4+ T cell subsets, including CI-Sep Treg cells, compared to NHC (Fig. 7h and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Consistent with this, CI-Sep Treg cells exhibited an increased transcriptional signature of AHR activity compared to NHC Treg cells45 (Fig. 7i).

Source data

To determine whether kynurenine exposure alone was sufficient to augment Treg cell glycolytic capacity, we treated NHC PBMCs for 24 h with 10 μM kynurenine, a dose within the plasma concentration range in sepsis43. Exogenous kynurenine modestly but consistently increased the glycolytic capacity of NHC Treg cells, an effect not observed in CD4+ TN or TEM cells (Fig. 7j). Conversely, short (3 h) or extended (24 h) treatment of CI-Sep PBMCs with the kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) inhibitor GSK180 did not alter the glycolytic capacity in any CD4+ T cell subset (Fig. 7k and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c), suggesting that central kynurenine intermediates were not contributing directly to the glycolytic capacity. This neutral impact was not due to a deficit of kynurenine in human plasma-like medium (HPLM), which we measured at near physiological levels (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In contrast to kynurenine, supplementation of NHC and CI-Sep PBMCs for 24 h with leucine, another LAT1 substrate, did not alter the glycolytic capacity of CD4+ T cell subsets including CD4+ Treg cells, suggesting that the effect of kynurenine on Treg cell glycolytic capacity is not a general property of all LAT1 transported amino acids (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Kynurenine metabolism can bypass KMO through anthranilic acid, which feeds further downstream reactions, including de novo NAD synthesis that could influence glycolysis (Fig. 7b). Treatment of NHC and CI-Sep PBMCs with the QPRT inhibitor phthalic acid for 24 h resulted in a modest reduction in glycolytic capacity in CI-Sep Treg cells compared to vehicle-treated CI-Sep Treg cells (Fig. 7l). As a control, inhibition of LDHA, a canonical enzyme in NAD/NADH recycling that sustains glycolysis, in NHC and CI-Sep PBMCs for 24 h produced a large reduction in glycolytic capacity broadly in CD4+ TN, TEM and Treg cells from NHCs and CI-Sep (Extended Data Fig. 7f). These observations suggested that while kynurenine metabolism was altered disproportionately in CI-Sep Treg cells compared to CI-Sep TN and TEM cells, it had only a minimal role in the glycolytic reprogramming of CI-Sep Treg cells, potentially via de novo NAD generation.

Kynurenine metabolism promotes the formation of suppressive Treg cells in healthy individuals41,42, but direct evidence of its role in human systemic inflammatory diseases is limited. To test the role of kynurenine in sepsis, we stimulated NHC and CI-Sep PBMCs with CD3/CD28/CD2 antibodies for 24 h with low-dose (10 nM) oligomycin in the presence or absence of KMO inhibitor GSK180. Compared to vehicle-treated CI-Sep Treg cells, treatment with GSK180 led to partial reversal of both FOXP3 stabilization (−6% with vehicle versus −10% with GSK180) and augmented TIGIT expression (20% with vehicle versus 10% with GSK180) in CI-Sep Treg cells (Fig. 7m). No effect on FOXP3 or TIGIT expression was seen in NHC Treg cells treated with GSK180 compared to NHC Treg cells treated with vehicle (Fig. 7m). GSK180 further reduced the frequency of PD-1+ and LAG-3+CD4+ Tconv cells in both NHC and CI-Sep with GSK180 treatment compared to vehicle (Extended Data Fig. 7g), and had no effect on the frequency of CI-Sep TNF+, IFNγ+ or IL-2+ CD4+ Tconv cells, though GSK180 treatment led to a modestly greater reduction in the frequency of CI-Sep IL-17A+CD4+ Tconv cells compared to vehicle treatment (Fig. 7n and Extended Data Fig. 7h). Thus, impairment of kynurenine metabolism at the level of KMO selectively attenuated the suppressive features in CI-Sep Treg cells without substantially compromising or exaggerating CI-Sep CD4+ Tconv cell effector function, highlighting a potential axis for rebalancing immune suppression and effector responses in sepsis.

We also applied FBA to CD4+ T cell subsets from CI-NS patients and found that the flux changes observed in CI-Sep CD4+ T cells were broadly conserved across the same major 22 Recon2 reaction families in CI-NS CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i and Supplementary Table 4). CI-NS Treg cells had higher tryptophan metabolic flux than NHC Treg cells, CI-NS CD4+ TN or TEM cells, though CI-NS Treg cell tryptophan metabolic flux was less than CI-Sep Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 7j). Comparison of global effect sizes of metabolic flux across all reactions indicated a strong correlation between CI-Sep versus NHC and CI-NS versus NHC Treg cells, with consistently larger effect sizes in CI-Sep Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 7k). Collectively, these data show that enhanced kynurenine metabolism promotes the stabilized suppressive phenotype of CI Treg cells.

Next, we analyzed the associations between Treg cell glycolytic capacity and ICU metrics of overall disease severity, individual organ failures and clinical outcomes in pooled CI-NS (n = 30) and CI-Sep (n = 30) samples to gain adequate power. Glycolytic capacity in CI Treg cells positively correlated with illness severity, including Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (Fig. 8a). No associations of CI Treg cell glycolytic capacity were seen with sex or age (Fig. 8b,c). While CI Treg cell glycolytic capacity was not correlated with peak plasma lactate, there was a trend between lower blood pH and higher Treg cell glycolytic capacity (Fig. 8d,e). Patients with higher vasopressor requirements (with all vasopressor doses converted to a standardized norepinephrine equivalent dose), which is an indicator of more severe shock, exhibited higher Treg cell glycolytic capacity compared to patients on lower or no vasopressors (Fig. 8f). There was no association between CI Treg cell glycolytic capacity and severity of lung injury as measured by alveolar gas-exchange metrics (SpO2/FiO2 or PaO2/FiO2) (Fig. 8g,h).

a, Spearman rank correlation showing the association between pooled CI Treg cell (n = 60; 50% CI-Sep) glycolytic capacity and SOFA (left) and APACHE II scores (right). A locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing (LOWESS) curve was fitted and bootstrapped 95% confidence interval are shaded. b, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) dichotomized by sex. c, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) dichotomized by age <65 years (median 55 years, IQR 47–60) or ≥65 years (median 71 years, IQR 68–78). d, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 58) by plasma lactate levels grouped as lower 50% (median 1.6 mmol l−1, IQR 1.1–1.8 and upper 50%, median 4.3 mmol l−1, IQR 3.1–5.8). e, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) by plasma pH grouped as normal or alkalotic (median 7.40, IQR 7.37–7.44) versus low pH (median 7.26, IQR 7.20–7.29). f, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) grouped by vasopressor dose, reported as norepinephrine equivalent dose (NEE), into low NEE (lower 50%, median 0.000 μg kg−1 min−1, IQR 0.000–0.036) and high NEE (upper 50%, median 0.197 μg kg−1 min−1, IQR 0.134–0.389). g, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) by SpO2:FiO2 (S:F) ratio grouped into low S:F (lower 50%, median 136, IQR 110–176) and high S:F (upper 50%, median 338, IQR 262–433). h, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) by PaO2:FiO2 (P:F) ratio grouped into low P:F (lower 50%, median 124, IQR 111–146) and high P:F (upper 50%, median 338, IQR 270–382). i, Histogram showing the hospital length of stay (LOS) in days among survivors to hospital discharge. The cohort median shown at 11.5 days (blue dashed line) was used to stratify into the shortest 50% (median 7 days, IQR 6–8) and longest 50% (median 16 days, IQR 13–23). Rug plot aligned below the histogram depicts the date of death post-admission for nonsurvivors. j, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) grouped into short hospital LOS (n = 22) versus long hospital LOS or death (n = 38). k, Glycolytic capacity of Treg cells from CI donors (n = 60) with short hospital LOS (n = 22), long hospital LOS (n = 22), or death (n = 16). Lactate measurement in d and arterial blood gas measurement of PaO2 in h was not performed by the treating clinical team in all patients; values shown where available. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test (b–h) and a Kruskal–Wallis test (k). Data for b–h,j,k are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

Primary illness severity and the acquisition of secondary complications can prolong hospital length of stay or lead to in-hospital mortality. In this CI cohort, 16 individuals died during the hospitalization and 44 survived to hospital discharge. We grouped the 44 survivors into cohorts of short and long hospital lengths of stay (defined as below and above the median hospital length of stay, respectively) (Fig. 8i). Patients with a long hospital length of stay or in-hospital death had significantly higher Treg cell glycolytic capacity than those with a short hospital length of stay (Fig. 8j), with similar effects observed when long length of stay and in-hospital death were examined individually (Fig. 8k). Together, these results linked CI Treg cell metabolic remodeling to greater illness severity, more profound shock and acidemia, prolonged hospital length of stay and mortality in CI.

Here, we found that CI CD4+ T cells underwent subset-specific metabolic rewiring characterized by persistence of Treg cells that showed enhanced glycolytic capacity and stabilization of suppressive features and attrition of less metabolically plastic CD4+ Tconv cells that showed functional impairments. Parallel changes in mitochondrial ROS and kynurenine metabolism in Treg cells promoted glycolytic remodeling and suppressive adaptations, respectively. The magnitude of Treg cell metabolic reprogramming was associated with greater illness severity and adverse clinical outcomes.

Our findings highlighted the need to model disease-specific factors, like metabolic stress, which was evident transcriptomically with robust hypoxic and cellular stress signatures across all CI CD4+ T cell. The association between adaptive glycolytic remodeling in CI Treg cells and severe shock, but not impaired gas exchange in the lungs, suggested that these stress features may be imprinted from T cell transit through inadequately perfused, dysoxic tissues rather than arising from intrinsic respiratory failure. By modeling aspects of this physiological context through partial mitochondrial impairment ex vivo, we unmasked key CI Treg cell phenotypes, including stabilization of FOXP3 and upregulation of TIGIT.

Kynurenine metabolism promoted immunosuppressive features in CI Treg cells. While its effects were partial (reflecting the complex physiological changes in sepsis) our findings harmonize with previous clinical studies that linked elevated plasma kynurenine to poor clinical outcomes43,44 and extend previous findings, showing that kynurenine promotes Treg cell programs in healthy human T cells41,42, to human inflammatory disease. Tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism are druggable46, and our data suggest KMO inhibition may support the restoration of immune balance by attenuating excessive Treg cell immunosuppressive features without inducing CD4+ Tconv cell hyperactivation. In contrast to other candidate immunomodulatory strategies, kynurenine has both immune and nonimmune effects. Kynurenine is an arterial vasodilator47 and kynurenine-derived metabolites are both neurotoxic48 and tissue toxic49,50, which may contribute to severe shock and end-organ injury, respectively. Consistent with this, high plasma kynurenine levels associate with ICU delirium51. Preclinical models support inhibition of KMO as a strategy to reduce acute kidney injury in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion52 and multiorgan injury in rodent models of acute pancreatitis50,53. Together, these data support kynurenine metabolism among preclinical targets as a potential multifaceted therapeutic axis in CI, though further integrated studies will be necessary to prove utility.

This study has several limitations. The generalizability of these findings to other CI populations, including trauma and burn, or to less severely ill patients with infection outside of the ICU, remains unclear. Most analyses were performed at a single time point 2 days post-ICU admission. Limited blood volumes and a focus on rare cell subsets, like Treg cells, prevented the use of certain assays like stable isotope tracing and extracellular flux analysis, which require larger cell numbers. We deferred expanding Treg cells, as such protocols risk substantial metabolic confounding. We validated some of the transcriptomic findings experimentally (ROS and kynurenine), while others remain exploratory and hypothesis generating, particularly where effect sizes are modest and transcript abundances are low. In addition, effect sizes varied across experimental findings, reflecting both sepsis heterogeneity and its multifactorial nature, where no single pathway likely fully accounts for the observed metabolic remodeling.

Despite these constraints, our study used human biospecimens exclusively, included a diverse cohort of nonseptic ICU controls and generated a large scRNA-seq dataset from PBMCs in non-COVID CI. By focusing on ICU patients (with a median SOFA score of 9 in CI-Sep), these data complement previous large-scale human sepsis scRNA-seq studies that enrolled broader, less severely ill cohorts (for example, median SOFA 2–4 (ref. 54) and 5 (ref. 55)). While CI-Sep generally exhibited larger effect sizes than CI-NS, the directionality of changes was consistent between the two, suggesting overlapping mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction in CI.

Our results indicated that metabolic remodeling favored Treg cell persistence and suppressive function (a shift broadly implicated in patient morbidity and mortality)56. These findings provide mechanistic insight into CD4+ T cell dysregulation in human CI and underscore the value of context-specific, cell subset-resolved analyses. More broadly, they highlight that newly acquired metabolic capacities, not just metabolic deficiencies such as impaired mitochondrial function19,57,58, may shape immune cell fate in CI and sepsis. These findings inform our understanding of immune dysfunction in human CI and suggest precision-based candidates for restoring immune homeostasis.

All study protocols were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB) (institutional protocol approval numbers 211462 and 191562). CI adults (≥18 years of age) were enrolled from the medical and surgical ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2022 to 2024 as part of The Sepsis ClinicAl Resource And Biorepository (SCARAB). Exclusion criteria included active exsanguination without hemostatic control or hemoglobin ≤7.5 g dl−1, ICU stay >48 h or cardiac arrest before enrollment, moribund state with imminent death, receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at the time of enrollment, pregnancy, medical trainees, in police custody, ICU admission solely for frequency of nursing care, or admission for uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis, drug overdose or alcohol withdrawal. For this analysis, we additionally excluded individuals receiving T cell-directed immunosuppression (such as tacrolimus, azathioprine and mycophenolate), immunomodulatory antineoplastic agents (such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab and rituximab) and those with severe leukopenia with insufficient PBMCs for analysis, active hematologic malignancy or previous allogenic stem cell transplant.

Written informed consent was obtained from patients or surrogates. If informed consent could not be obtained owing to lack of patient capacity or inability to reach a listed surrogate, then patients were enrolled under an IRB-approved waiver of consent for minimal-risk research. Nonacutely ill healthy controls were recruited from bedside surrogates of enrolled ICU patients and provided written informed consent. Healthy controls were required to be ≥18 years of age; exclusion criteria included: pregnancy, presence of an acute infection, severe anemia, receipt of T cell-directed immunosuppression or receiving any immunomodulatory antineoplastic agents, presence of a hematologic malignancy, or previous allogeneic stem cell transplant. ICU participants were not compensated; healthy controls received USD40 for participation.

Peripheral blood was collected from patients in the ICU within 24 h of ICU admission (day 0) and then serially at days 2 and 7 after study enrollment. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed with day-2 samples. Approximately 7–11 ml of blood were collected at each time point in citrate and EDTA vacutainer tubes, which were pooled for PBMC isolation. Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory data, imaging reports, medications and flowsheet data were abstracted from the electronic medical record into a HIPAA-compliant REDCap database. We abstracted International Classification of Disease, Clinical Modification 10 (ICD-10-CM) diagnoses codes entered into the electronic medical record during the course of each patient's hospital admission to identify comorbidities and calculate the weighted Elixhauser–van Walraven Comorbidity Index59,60. Healthy control participants contributed up to 50 ml of peripheral blood at a single time point; only age, sex and race/ethnicity were recorded in a HIPAA-compliant REDCap database.

Sepsis status was adjudicated post-hospitalization by a practicing physician intensivist (Extended Data Fig. 1). The presence of an infection was established based on positive bacterial cultures, infection-equivalent findings such as a visibly contaminated abdomen during laparotomy or through integrative clinical assessment in the absence of the former. End-organ dysfunction was assessed using Sepsis-3 criteria, defined as a SOFA score increase of ≥2 from the patient's baseline2. Patients meeting both infection and organ-injury criteria as a result of that infection were classified as having sepsis (CI-Sep); all others were designated nonsepsis (CI-NS).

Fresh peripheral blood was diluted 1:2 with PBS and layered over 15 ml of Lymphoprep density gradient medium (STEMCELL Tech., cat. no. 18061) in SepMate-50 tubes (STEMCELL Tech., cat. no.85450). After density gradient centrifugation (1,200g for 15 min at 20 °C), the PBMC-containing upper layer was pelleted (400g for 10 min at 20 °C), RBC-lysed for 7 min with ACK buffer (Gibco, cat. no. A1049201), washed (300g for 10 min at 20 °C), filtered through a 70-μm strainer and washed a final time (300g for 10 min at 20 °C). Isolated PBMCs were resuspended in Bambanker Cell Freezing Medium (GC LYMPHOTEC, cat. no. BB02) at 2 million PBMCs per ml, aliquoted and slow frozen in a CoolCell FTS30 freezing container (Corning, cat. no. 432006) at −80 °C. PBMC aliquots were transferred to liquid nitrogen vapor phase storage within 72 h.

PBMCs were thawed by rapid rewarming at 37 °C for 3 min and immediately diluted 1:5 in HPLM (Gibco, cat. no. A4899101) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. F0392) and 100 U ml−1 of penicillin plus 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin (P/S) (Gibco, cat. no. 15140122). Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 20 °C, washed twice in the same medium and filtered through a 35-μm cell strainer cap during the final wash to remove debris. PBMCs were resuspended in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S for immediate use in downstream experiments.

Cells were distributed in 96-well V-bottom microplates (Corning, cat. no. 3894), pelleted (300g for 5 min at 4 °C) and washed twice in cold PBS. All cell staining was conducted in 50-μl volumes. Cells were stained with Ghose Dye Red 780 Fixable Viability Dye (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 18452, diluted 1:2,000) and Human TruStain FcX solution for Fc receptor blocking (BioLegend, cat. no. 422302, diluted 1:40) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with flow staining buffer (cold PBS with 2% FBS) and stained for surface markers (antibodies listed in Extended Data Table 2) in flow staining buffer for 30 min at 4 °C followed by two additional washes. In some experiments, intracellular markers were evaluated. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using 100 μl of Fix/Perm reagent (Tonbo Biosciences, cat. no. TNB-0607-KIT) for 30 min at room temperature followed by two washes in permeabilization buffer (Tonbo Biosciences, cat. no. TNB-1213-L150). Cells were stained for intracellular markers (antibodies in Extended Data Table 2) in permeabilization buffer for 30 min at 4 °C followed by two washes in permeabilization buffer. Data were acquired on a Miltenyi MACSQuant Analyzer 16 flow cytometer and exported as MQD files, which were analyzed in FlowJo v.10.9.0 (Becton Dickson & Company). Representative gating is shown (Extended Data Fig. 8).

We measured metabolic dependencies and capacities using a flow cytometric puromycin-incorporation assay adapted from the SCENITH method61. After cryothaw, PBMCs were rested for 3 h cells at 37 °C in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S to allow for metabolic recovery. For each sample, single metabolic inhibitors were added in separate wells for 30 min at 37 °C: glucose-dependent pathway inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) (Cayman Chemical, cat. no. 14325, 100 mM), mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin A (Cayman Chemical, cat. no. 11342, 1.5 μM), glutaminase 1 (GLS1) glutaminolysis inhibitor CB-839 (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-12248, 10 μM) or carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) fatty acid oxidation inhibitor Etomoxir (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. E1905, 5 μM). Control wells with vehicle or a full inhibitor cocktail (ATP extinction control) were included. Cells were pulsed with puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. P8833, 10 μM) for 40 min at 37 °C, washed in cold PBS and prepared for flow cytometry with intracellular detection of puromycin by antibody staining as described above. Metabolic dependencies and capacities were calculated from the geometric MFI of puromycin as originally reported61. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 3 h or 24 h at 37 °C in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S with l-kynurenine (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-104026, 10 μM), l-leucine (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-N0486500, 500 μM), GSK180 (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-112179, 10 μM), phthalic acid (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-I0508, 100 μM), FX-11 (Millipore-Sigma, cat. no. 427218, 20 μM) or MitoTEMPO (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-112879, 10 μM) before the puromycin-incorporation assay.

Mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ROS were measured using MitoTracker Green FM (Invitrogen, cat. no. M46750), TMRE (Invitrogen, cat. no. T669) and MitoSOX Green superoxide indicator (Invitrogen, cat. no. M36006), respectively. Cryorecovered PBMCs were resuspended in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S, rested for 30 min at 37 °C and treated with either MitoTracker Green FM (25 nM), TMRE (40 nM), or MitoSOX Green (500 nM) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold flow staining buffer and prepared for flow cytometry as described above.

Cryorecovered PBMCs were resuspended in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S and stimulated with ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28/CD2 T Cell Activator (STEMCELL Tech., cat. no. 10970, 1:20 dilution) for 24 h at 37 °C. Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug, BD, cat. no. 555029, 1:1,000 dilution) was added for the final 5 h to enable intracellular cytokine detection. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Where indicated, cells were treated with low-dose oligomycin (Cayman Chemical, cat. no. 11342, 10 nM), GSK180 (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-112179, 10 μM) or MitoTEMPO (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-112879, 10 μM) for the full 24 h stimulation.

Intracellular kynurenine uptake was measured as previously described35 with modifications. Cryorecovered PBMCs were incubated in HPLM with 10% dFBS and P/S for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with warm PBS and stained with Fc-block, viability dye and cell surface antibodies in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed once with prewarmed 37 °C HBSS and resuspended in 37 °C HBSS containing l-kynurenine (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-104026, 100 μM) for 5 min. Uptake was quenched with 100 μl IC Fixation Buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-8333) for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with flow staining buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. l-kynurenine was detected by its intrinsic spectral properties using a 405-nm excitation (violet laser) and a 450/50-nm emission filter (V1 channel, MACSQuant Analyzer 16). Where indicated, LAT1 transport inhibitor BCH (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-108540, 10 mM) was added at time of cell plating or a saturating quantity of LAT1 substrate l-leucine (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-N0486, 5 mM) was added at the time of l-kynurenine treatment as controls for receptor specificity. Where indicated, HBSS with l-kynurenine chilled to 4 °C was added to cells on ice for the 5-min pulse to discriminate l-kynurenine uptake versus cell surface binding.

To determine the pre-existing availability of l-kynurenine in the media preparations used in experiments where modulations included adding exogenous l-kynurenine or a kynurenine-3-monooxygenase inhibitor (KMOi), we performed quantitative liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). l-kynurenine levels were tested in fresh HPLM, fresh HPLM plus 10% dFBS and P/S, and HPLM plus 10% dFBS and P/S stored for 30 days at 4 °C. Then, 1 ml of −80 °C 80:20 methanol:water was added to the 330 µl of the medium sample in a 1.7-ml tube and vortexed vigorously. Then, 20 nmol of internal standard (13C-1-Lactate, Millipore-Sigma) was spiked into each sample. Cells were then placed in −80 °C freezer to extract for 15 min. After extraction, any insoluble debris was pelleted at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing extracted metabolites was then transferred to a new 1.7-ml tube. Extracts were then dried under N2. Dried samples were resuspended in 50 µl 3:2 mobile buffer A: mobile buffer B (see below) and transferred to 1.7-ml tubes. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any insoluble debris. A standard curve was generated using 20 nmol of internal standard (13C-1-Lactate) in samples containing either 0, 3.75, 7.5, 15 or 30 nmol of a natural isotope kynurenine standard. Then, 18 µl of the sample was then chromatographed with a Shimadzu LC system equipped with a 100 × 2.1 mm, 3.5-μm particle diameter XBridge Amide column (Waters). Mobile phase A: 20 mM NH4OAc, 20 mM NH4OH and 5% acetonitrile in H2O, pH 9.45 (pH with NH4OH); mobile phase B: 100% acetonitrile. With a flow rate of 0.45 ml min−1 the following gradient was used: 2.0 min, 95% B; 3.0 min, 85% B; 5.0 min, 85% B; 6.0 min, 80% B; 8.0 min, 80% B; 9.0 min, 75% B; 10 min, 75% B; 11 min, 70% B; 12 min, 70% B; 13 min, 50% B; 15 min, 50% B; 16 min 0% B; 17.5 min, 0% B; and 18 min, 95% B. The column was equilibrated for 3 min at 95% B between each sample. Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was conducted in negative and positive mode with a detection window of 120 s using an AB SCIEX 6500 QTRAP with the following analyte parameters: m/z 209 → 94 (positive mode, retention time: 6.3 min) for l-kynurenine; m/z 90 → 43 (negative mode, retention time of 6.0 min) for 13C-1-lactate internal standard. All analytes were quantified via LC–MS/MS using the standard curve.

Cryopreserved PBMCs were rapidly thawed at 37 °C for 3 min, diluted dropwise into 7 ml of room temperature HPLM with 10% dFBS and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with HPLM with 10% dFBS and once in cold PBS with 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA), with the final wash passed through a 35-μm cell strainer (Falcon, cat. no. 352235). Cells were resuspended in cold PBS with 0.04% BSA at 1,000 cells per μl. Single-cell RNA-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5' HT Kit v2 (10x Genomics) targeting 20,000 cells per sample. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (S4 flow cell, PE150) to a target depth of 50,000 reads per cell. Raw data were processed with Cell Ranger (v.7.1.0) using the GRCh38-2020-A genome assembly with the intron inclusion option enabled.

Raw feature barcode matrices from Cell Ranger were processed through a custom Nextflow workflow executed within Docker containers on AWS HealthOmics. Ambient RNA and technical artifacts were removed using CellBender remove-background (v.0.3.0)62. Learning rates (0.0000005–0.00005) and training epochs (150–300) were iteratively tuned; defaults were used for all other parameters.

CellBender outputs were filtered using Seurat (v.4.3.0)63 to exclude cells with >20% mitochondrial content or <400 or >5,000 detected features. Doublets were identified and removed using scDblFinder (v.1.13.10)64 using temporary SCTransform normalization and shared nearest neighbor clustering (2,000 highly variable genes (HVGs), 30 principal components and resolution 0.5), which were discarded after doublet removal. Sample-level metadata were added, and cleaned matrices were converted to AnnData using the sceasy package (v.0.0.7)65.

Filtered per-sample data were merged, normalized (target_sum = 1 × 104) and log-transformed using Scanpy (v.1.9.5)66. The top 5,000 HVGs were selected using the ‘seurat_v3' method. Data were integrated and modeled using scVI-tools (v.1.0.4)67. The scVI model was trained using n_hidden = 128, n_latent = 30, n_layers = 2, negative binomial likelihood (gene_likelihood = ‘nb') with gene level dispersion, dropout rate of 0.1, AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001. Training proceeded for up to 400 epochs with early stopping. Modeling incorporated categorical covariates (Biologic_Sex), continuous covariates (percent.mt, nCount_RNA, and percent.ribosomal) and batch correction (batch_key).

Scanpy (v.1.9.5) was used to create a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) graph (scanpy.pp.neighbors) using the scVI latent space (use_rep = ‘X_scVI', n_neighbors = 30). Clustering was performed with the Leiden algorithm (scanpy.tl.leiden, resolution = 1). DEGs for each cluster were identified using scVI's differential_expression function with denoised expression values. Cell types were annotated using canonical marker genes with the Azimuth Human PBMC core reference map as the primary guide68, supplemented by literature-defined markers and expert consensus. Clusters lacking clear marker dominance were iteratively subclustered (resolutions between 0.2 and 2.0) until high-confidence annotations could be assigned. Clusters exhibiting two distinct, nonoverlapping gene expression profiles were excluded as potential doublets. A small B cell cluster unique to sample 10069-MS-0033 expressing canonical markers of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ROR1, FMOD and CD5) and identical heavy- and light-chain V-segments (IGHV3-66 and IGKV1D-39) was excluded as a probable subclinical neoplasm. Final annotations were provided at two levels: celltype_coarse for major lineages and celltype_fine for granular subpopulations.

Cell lineage proportions were quantified using Scanpro (v.0.2)69 applied to NHC, CI-NS and CI-Sep samples with both celltype_coarse and celltype_fine cell lineage annotations.

Pseudobulk profiles were generated from single-cell data using the Python implementation of the decoupleR package (v.1.6.0)70 by summing counts per cell type across within each sample, retaining profiles from ≥20 cells and with ≥1,000 total counts. Differential expression was performed using PyDESeq2 (v.1.40.2)71 with low-expression genes removed (filter_by_expr function, min_count=3, min_total_count = 25). Visualization of per-sample gene expression was performed using pseudobulk counts normalized to CPM and log-transformed. Visualization of single-cell gene expression was performed using Scanpy-normalized and log-transformed single-cell counts. Normalized, scaled pseudobulk gene expression profiles were used to select the top 2,000 HVGs (Seurat v3 method) followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward's linkage based on Euclidean distances.

Over-representation analysis of significantly upregulated genes (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) was performed with decoupleR using the GO:BP collection. GSEA72 was performed on pseudobulk differential gene expression results (Wald statistic) using GSEApy (v.1.1.4)73 with 1,000 permutations and the KEGG 2021 Human and Hallmark 2020 libraries, using a fixed random seed. NES and FDR-adjusted P values were used to score pathways. A binary matrix indicating leading-edge gene membership across significantly enriched gene sets (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) was constructed and pairwise Jaccard similarity between pathways was calculated based on shared leading-edge genes. Pathway activity for a human pan-tissue AHR gene signature45 was quantified using the AUCell method74 implemented in decoupleR.

FBA was conducted using the Compass package (v.0.9.10.2)75. For each condition and cell subset, single-cell transcriptomes were normalized to CPM (scanpy.pp.normalize_total) and aggregated into tab-delimited input files. Compass was run with the IBM CPLEX optimization engine using the Recon2 consensus metabolic reconstruction76 and default parameters (penalty-diffusion knn, lambda 0, num-neighbors 30) with microclusters of 25 cells. Reaction penalty scores were negative log-transformed to yield values representing reaction flux potential and filtered to remove low-confidence or invariant reaction. For bidirectional reactions, all reactions were modeled but only positive fluxes were retained for visualization. Reaction activity was standardized as z-scores or calculated as Cohen's d effect sizes for visualization and comparison between conditions.

Statistical analyses were performed in Python (v.3.9) using scipy.stats (v.1.11.4), scikit-posthocs (v.0.9.0) and statsmodels (v.0.14.1). Two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests were used for two-group comparisons and Kruskal–Wallis tests with Dunn's post hoc testing for multigroup comparisons. Spearman correlations were used for associations with LOWESS smoothing (fraction = 0.8) with 1,000 bootstrap resamples applied where indicated. Patient summary statistics (median, IQR and P values) were generated using tableone (v.0.9.1).

For scRNA-seq analyses, logit-transformed proportion testing used an empirical Bayes ANOVA (scanpro); differential expression used the Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (DESeq2); over-representation analysis used a one-tailed Fisher's exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction; gene-set enrichment used a permutation-based Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (pyGSEA); and Compass flux comparisons used two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Effect sizes were represented as Cohen's d values derived from the pooled s.d. Bar graphs show means with error bars representing s.e.m. Boxplots follow standard conventions (median line, IQR box boundaries and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR).

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications54,55. For flow cytometric assays reporting mean intensity values, including the puromycin-incorporation assay, cell populations with <25 detected cells were excluded because a mean could not reliably be estimated. One scRNA-seq sample (10069-MS-0036) was excluded before analysis after grossly failing quality control metrics. Some clinical variables were unavailable for specific patients in the electronic medical record and were therefore not included. The investigators were not blind to the sample group assignments while completing the analysis. Most data were generated from ≥2 independent experimental replicates and shown as pooled data, with limited analyses performed in a single replicate (Figs. 2a,c,d, 6f,g and 7k,l and Extended Data Figs. 3b and 7b–f).

Treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a major unmet need, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To identify molecular determinants of refractory RA, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling on synovial tissue biopsy samples taken 6 months before and after treatment. In the baseline biopsy samples of non-remitting patients, we identified increased fibrogenic signaling within vascular tissue niches, marked by high fibroblast COMP expression. We uncovered a role of endothelial-derived Notch signaling as an upstream regulator of fibroblast transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling via its opposing ability to induce TGFβ isoform expression while suppressing TGFβ receptors, generating a proximal-to-distal gradient of TGFβ sensitivity that can be altered with disruption of steady-state Notch signaling. In posttreatment biopsy samples, we observed significant immune depletion with expansion of fibrogenic niches, a process that can be reversed by inhibition of Notch and TGFβ signaling in RA patient-derived organoids. Collectively, our data implicate targeting of TGFβ signaling to prevent exuberant synovial tissue fibrosis as a potential therapeutic strategy for refractory RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation in the synovium1,2. While there have been significant advances in the treatment of RA with the introduction of biologics targeting inflammatory mediators, treatment-refractory RA remains a major challenge3. Greater than 50% of patients do not achieve remission with initial lines of therapy and 5–30% of patients remain unresponsive to multiple lines4,5. Clinically, such treatment-refractory patients present more frequently with concomitant noninflammatory pain, suggesting an alternate pathophysiology6. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying refractory RA remain poorly understood. Synovial fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that together with macrophages constitute the joint lining membrane7. In RA, fibroblasts undergo expansion and acquire pathological states that sustain inflammation and drive joint damage8,9,10,11,12. Transcriptomic analysis of RA synovium has revealed high phenotypic and functional diversity among synovial fibroblasts8,9,10,11,13,14 and fibroblastic gene signatures that predict treatment failure15,16,17.

Fibrosis is a pathogenic process characterized by exuberant fibroblast activation, leading to the accumulation of connective tissue components and extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by TGFβ18,19. Fibrosis leading to organ damage is typically associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis and interstitial lung disease and is a contributor to joint stiffness and pain in osteoarthritis20. In contrast, the potential contribution of synovial tissue fibrosis to RA has not been well studied.

We have previously uncovered the role of spatial context in driving signals that generate fibroblast diversity and define positional identity9,21. Until recently, spatially aware transcriptomic profiling of fibroblasts required multiple iterations of protein or RNA detection, which poses a major barrier to high-dimensional characterization of cellular niches and associated signaling. Here, we applied a subcellular resolution, high-dimensional spatial transcriptomic technology to pretreatment and 6-month posttreatment synovial biopsy samples to identify spatial determinants of treatment resistance in recent-onset RA. At this stage, there is a window of opportunity to achieve remission, which predicts better outcomes22. In the baseline biopsy samples of non-remitting patients, we identified significant enrichment of fibrogenic fibroblast signatures, marked by the expression of COMP, localized to vascular niches where we observed coordinated spatial patterning of TGFβ activity. Mechanistically, endothelial-derived Notch signaling actively fine-tunes TGFβ-mediated fibrogenic signaling by simultaneously inducing TGFβ expression and suppressing TGFβ receptor expression, resulting in the establishment of a perturbable endothelial proximal-to-distal transcriptional gradient among fibroblasts.

After treatment, both remission groups exhibited significant immune depletion; however, lack of pain-related clinical response sustained disease activity in non-remission patients, which was linked to increased fibrogenic signaling. Therapeutic inhibition of Notch and TGFβ signaling successfully reversed fibrogenic gene and protein expression in RA patient-derived synovial organoids. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ signaling drives an expansion of fibrogenic fibroblasts in RA that leads to a treatment-refractory synovial tissue phenotype and that targeting TGFβ signaling could represent an adjuvant therapy to prevent the development of refractory RA.

To identify spatial features associated with non-remission, we performed spatial transcriptomics analysis on 17 treatment-naive biopsy samples from patients with early RA as part of the 396.10 study (Fig. 1a). Newly diagnosed RA patients were assigned to triple-therapy disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic adalimumab. Remission, defined as Disease Activity Score-28 for Rheumatoid Arthritis with Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) < 2.6 and Disease Activity Score-28 for Rheumatoid Arthritis with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) < 2.4, was recorded after 6 months of treatment (Supplementary Table 1). In this cohort, 10 patients achieved remission, 5 did not achieve remission and 2 patients, classified as borderline, met the criteria for only one of either DAS28-ESR or DAS28-CRP remission. Baseline DAS28-ESR/CRP and its individual components did not differ significantly between patients who achieved remission (n = 10) and those who did not (n = 5), but non-remitting patients had significantly lower improvements in disease activity (Supplementary Table 1). We first identified major synovial tissue niches in baseline biopsy samples using a method that leverages spatial differences in transcript expression to draw boundaries between tissue compartments23 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Graph-based clustering of tiles revealed seven niches that were enriched for distinct transcripts and their corresponding cell types: (1) fibroblast-rich, (2) vascular, (3) stromal-adipose, (4) lining fibroblasts (‘liningF'), (5) lining macrophages (‘liningM'), (6) T cells and B cells (‘immuneT') and (7) plasma cells (‘immuneP'; Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Table 1). The lining niches (liningF, liningM) consisted of a mix of synovial lining fibroblasts (CD55+) and lining macrophages (HTRA1+). The immune niches contained dense infiltrates composed of either primarily T cells (CD3E+) and B cells (MS4A1+; ‘immuneT') or plasma cell aggregates (MZB1+; ‘immuneP'). Vascular niches consisted of various endothelial subtypes including venules (SELP+), capillaries (PLVAP+) and arterioles (PODXL+), mural cells, including pericytes (RGS5+) and vascular smooth cells (ACTA2+) and NOTCH3+ vascular fibroblasts. Stromal-adipose niches contained vascular cells and fibroblasts embedded among adipocytes (ADIPOQ+). Fibroblast-rich niches were composed primarily of sublining fibroblasts (COL6A1hi).

Hierarchical clustering of niche composition classified samples into three broad categories, one characterized by stromal-adipose enrichment (n = 4), another by immune niche enrichment (n = 5) and a third marked by expanded vascular and fibroblast niches (n = 7; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d). While we observed high concordance between immune niche tissue area and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-based lymphomyeloid pathotype classification24 (Extended Data Fig. 1e), clear distinctions did not appear between the diffuse myeloid and pauci-immune pathotypes (Fig. 1c), suggesting that spatial transcriptomics analysis captures complexity in cellular organization beyond traditional histologic assessment of synovial tissue pathotype. Tissue areas of fibroblast-rich niches negatively correlated with the area of combined immune niches, consistent with prior studies utilizing histology25,26 and single-cell transcriptomics11,15,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1f). We observed no significant differences in baseline niche composition by remission status, although we could not exclude the possibility that heterogeneity in tissue sampling masked underlying distinctions (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Therefore, we investigated whether transcriptional differences could differentiate remission groups.

Since the sample size of our cohort was limited, we leveraged bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the larger PEAC cohort (n = 69)16 to identify genes significantly associated with nonresponse (Fig. 2a). We applied the nonresponder gene signature to spatial niches and found enrichment of the signature in stromal-adipose, fibroblast-rich and vascular niches (Fig. 2b). Among synovial cell types, fibroblasts were enriched in the three nonresponder-associated niches and exhibited the highest nonresponse scores (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

To identify specific fibroblast phenotypes15 most strongly associated with nonresponse, we subtyped fibroblasts in our spatial transcriptomic data and identified one lining and four sublining subsets. The fibrogenic sublining subset was characterized by high ECM gene expression (COL6A1, COL8A1, COMP), the inflammatory subset by expression of inflammatory mediators (CXCL12), and the vascular subset by NOTCH3 and THY1 expression. A minor subpopulation was marked by expression of L1CAM, a nerve-associated adhesion molecule27 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2b). We confirmed that lining fibroblasts were the most abundant fibroblast subtype in lining niches and that vascular and inflammatory fibroblasts were most enriched in the immune niches (Fig. 2c)28. Notably, fibrogenic fibroblasts were the subtype most enriched for the nonresponse signature (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and were specifically expanded in the nonresponse-associated fibroblast-rich, stromal-adipose and vascular niches (Fig. 2c).

To assess whether fibrogenic programs stratified remission groups, we calculated a 12-gene fibrogenic activation score using fibrogenic fibroblast markers, including POSTN, CTHRC1 and SFRP4 previously described in fibrotic disease29,30,31 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2d). The fibrogenic score was significantly elevated in pretreatment fibroblasts of non-remitting patients compared to remitting patients (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f).

While the vascular and inflammatory fibroblast compartments have previously been characterized8,9,12,14, the fibrogenic compartment in RA remains incompletely understood25. To assess the phenotypic overlap between RA fibrogenic fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in fibrotic diseases, we first confirmed enrichment of the 12-gene fibrogenic fibroblast signature in publicly available systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis datasets32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Spatial profiling of RA synovial tissue and lung tissue from patients with late-stage RA interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) exhibiting usual interstitial pneumonia (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d) then revealed high and specific enrichment of the signature in regions identified through histology as subepithelial-localized fibroblastic foci (Extended Data Fig. 3c). In RA synovial tissue, the fibrogenic signature was expressed more diffusely throughout the sublining compartment, with high-expressing regions characterized by deeper pink eosin staining compared to low-expressing regions, indicating increased ECM deposition. Collectively, we observed strong transcriptomic overlap between fibrogenic populations in RA and fibrotic disease (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Next, to determine whether there are specific cellular subtypes within the RA fibrogenic compartment associated with nonresponse, we subsetted and reclustered fibroblasts from patients in the AMP RA/SLE single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset15 that were highly enriched for the 12-gene fibrogenic signature derived from the spatial transcriptomic dataset (top 10% of cells; Extended Data Fig. 4a). We observed three broad fibrogenic subclusters: a CXCL12-expressing inflammatory cluster, a COMP-expressing cluster that coexpressed DKK3 and FMOD, previously found to be associated with treatment resistance17, and a POSTN-expressing cluster relatively enriched for COL1A1 expression, illustrating distinct phenotypes among RA fibrogenic fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Genes coexpressed in the POSTNhi cluster were positively associated with treatment response in the PEAC bulk RNA-seq data, in contrast to COMP-coexpressed genes, which were more associated with treatment nonresponse (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Accordingly, the COMPhi fibroblast cluster exhibited striking enrichment of the nonresponder signature compared to the POSTNhi and CXCL12hi fibrogenic subclusters, suggesting that COMP expression, specifically denotes the subset of fibrogenic fibroblasts in RA associated with treatment resistance33,34 (Fig. 2e). At the transcript level, COMP was more elevated in the treatment-naive biopsy samples of patients who failed to achieve remission compared to DKK3, FMOD or POSTN (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4e) and was more broadly enriched across non-remission niches (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Additionally, baseline COMP+ cell abundance correlated with reduced 6-month and 12-month improvements in tender joint counts (deltaTJC28) in the non-remission group (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Further, there was a positive trend among the remission and non-remission groups between baseline COMP+ cell abundance and DAS28-ESR at 12 months, highlighting the link between COMP+ cell abundance and longer-term disease activity (Extended Data Fig. 4g).

Next, to investigate tissue niches in which increased fibrogenic activation might drive differences in remission status, we first classified all niche tiles into low, medium and high for fibrogenic signature expression (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4h). Immune and lining niches were highly represented among tiles with low and medium fibrogenic expression, whereas fibroblast-rich, stromal-adipose and vascular tiles were prominently represented among tiles with high fibrogenic signatures, consistent with nonresponder signature enrichment. Among the three relevant niches, fibrogenic scores in only the vascular niche were elevated in non-remission, suggesting that vascular-associated fibrogenic activity may drive treatment nonresponse (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4i).

To improve localization of fibrogenic fibroblasts in synovial tissue, we designed a targeted panel of 50 stromal-associated genes for spatial transcriptomics analysis of additional RA synovial tissue samples (n = 4). The smaller panel enhanced the detection of relevant transcripts, including TGFβ isoforms, key regulators of fibrosis19 and COMP (~14-fold increased detection). Gating on fibrogenic tissue regions, defined by high COL1A1 expression, we found that COMP and POSTN transcript kernel density estimates mapped to spatially distinct areas (Fig. 3a,b), consistent with their differential single-cell expression patterns15. We observed two major patterns of COMPhi fibroblast localization: (1) within pauci-cellular fibroblast-rich regions and (2) within the distal layers of perivascular regions, surrounding mural cells and vascular fibroblasts (Fig. 3c). Accordingly, patient-level analysis of the spatial data revealed a positive association between the proportion of vascular cells and the abundance of COMP-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 3d). POSTN transcripts, in contrast, were coexpressed with mural cell (ACTA2) and vascular fibroblast (COL15A1) markers, indicating strong expression of POSTN in the proximal cell layers of vascular regions (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Together, our data indicate that both subsets of fibrogenic fibroblasts localize to the perivascular compartment in RA synovia, but in distinct layers.

Scale bars, 200 µm. Immunofluorescence is representative of n > 5 RA synovial tissue.

We next asked whether TGFβ isoform expression is spatially associated with fibrogenic niches in RA (Fig. 3e). TGFB1 colocalized with the lining fibroblast marker CD55 and endothelial cell (EC) marker PECAM1. TGFB2 transcripts strongly colocalized with CD55. TGFB3 transcripts not only colocalized with markers of endothelial (PECAM1) and mural (ACTA2) cells, suggesting vascular and perivascular enrichment, but also overlapped with fibrogenic transcripts, including POSTN, COMP and COL1A1, indicating broad coexpression within fibrogenic populations. Analysis of TGFβ isoform expression by cell type in 396.10 spatial transcriptomic data confirmed lining fibroblast-specific expression of TGFB2, diffuse expression of TGFB1 and stromal-vascular-enriched TGFB3 expression (Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Immunofluorescence staining of synovial tissue revealed perivascular localization of TGFβ1, TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 protein (Fig. 3h), although TGFβ2 also appeared in immune aggregates. Accordingly, we observed that a specific indicator of active TGFβ signaling, pSMAD3, was restricted to fibroblasts in vascular regions and absent in pauci-cellular regions characterized by dense collagen deposition (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting that active TGFβ signaling occurs specifically in the vascular compartment. Together, the observed spatial patterning of both fibrogenic gene expression and TGFβ indicates that the perivascular niche is an important hub for fibrogenic signaling.

To better understand how vascular ECs generate spatial patterning of TGFβ signaling in fibroblasts, we modeled and spatially profiled co-cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with synovial fibroblasts in two-dimensional (2D) and in three-dimensional (3D) systems (Fig. 4a,b). In both systems, we observed distinct fibroblast transcriptional programs as a function of proximity to the nearest EC: fibroblasts in the most proximal layer expressed Notch target genes including JAG1, HES1 and NOTCH3, which decreased in distal layers of fibroblasts that were over one cell layer away (Fig. 4c–e and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Like Notch target genes, POSTN expression was also highest on the proximal layer of fibroblasts adjacent to ECs and gradually decreased in distal fibroblasts, in contrast to COMP expression, which increased in distal compartments (Fig. 4f–h and Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). Collectively, EC-derived signals pattern fibrogenic gene expression in a proximal-to-distal manner, where POSTN represents an EC-proximal program and COMP expression represents an EC-distal program.

Next, we evaluated the distribution of TGFβ isoforms and their receptors along the EC proximal-to-distal axis to identify receptor–ligand pairs responsible for differential fibroblast responses to TGFβ. Consistent with the expression pattern in RA synovia, TGFB1 was expressed on ECs and on the EC-proximal fibroblast layer, with fewer average transcripts in EC-distal fibroblasts (Fig. 4i–l and Extended Data Fig. 5h–j), while TGFB2 was lowly and diffusely expressed. TGFB3, like TGFB1, was induced on endothelial-proximal fibroblasts and then sharply decreased in EC-distal fibroblasts. Transcripts of TGFBR1, the TGFβ signaling co-receptor, TGFBR2, the ligand-binding receptor, and TGFBR3, a high-affinity TGFβ binding co-receptor for all isoforms35,36, were lowest in EC-proximal layers and gradually increased in EC-distal fibroblasts (Fig. 4m–o and Extended Data Fig. 5k–m); the observations were concordant across both the 2D and 3D culture systems. Collectively, these data suggest that endothelial-derived signals determine spatial patterning of TGFβ signaling via paired regulation of TGFβ ligands and receptors.

Given the distinct spatial pattern of TGFβ-related transcripts in fibroblasts generated by contact with neighboring ECs, we evaluated the potential role of endothelial-derived Notch in regulating TGFβ signaling. We reanalyzed scRNA-seq data from Matrigel-embedded 3D organoids of fibroblasts and ECs treated with or without the Notch inhibitor DAPT9 (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 6a). We observed significant induction of TGFB1, TGFB3 and fibrogenic gene expression when ECs were included in organoids as well as suppression of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 expression (Fig. 5c). The addition of DAPT reversed TGFB induction and TGFBR suppression, directly implicating Notch signaling as an upstream regulator of fibroblast TGFβ signaling.

Data are shown as the mean ± s.d. Statistical analysis was performed by a two-sided ratio paired t-test for d, e and h, two-sided Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon test for c and unpaired two-sided t-tests for i–k.

A 2D culture system showed similar effects of Notch activation on fibroblast TGFβ signaling. We stimulated synovial fibroblast cell lines (n = 6) with plate-bound DLL4 and observed strong induction of TGFB1 and TGFB3 gene and protein expression and suppression of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 that was reversed with the addition of DAPT (Fig. 5d–g). Further, there were significant peaks in the promoter regions of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 for binding of a Notch-associated transcription factor (RBPJ) in HepG2 cells, supporting a role for Notch in direct transcriptional regulation of TGFβ receptors (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

Next, we assessed the impact of Notch and TGFβ signaling on fibrogenic gene expression and observed induction of fibrogenic collagens (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1) with DLL4 stimulation that was reversed with the addition of DAPT or TGFβ inhibitor (SB431542; Fig. 5h). We evaluated the extent to which Notch-mediated TGFβ signaling occurs in a cell contact-dependent or soluble manner (Extended Data Fig. 6c–f). Low concentrations of soluble TGFβ1 were induced in the supernatant of DLL4-stimulated cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c), but conditioned medium from DLL4-stimulated fibroblasts was unable to induce TGFβ-responsive genes in recipient fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similarly, when we cultured fibroblasts in a Transwell chamber above DLL4-stimulated fibroblasts, we observed no induction of TGFβ signaling (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Additionally, antibody blockade against individual or pan-TGFβ isoforms did not substantially diminish ECM production. Altogether, our findings suggest that Notch-induced TGFβ signaling primarily occurs in a contact-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 6f).

We then systematically tested the effects of each TGFβ isoform and receptor for Notch-mediated fibrogenic signaling (Fig. 5i–k and Extended Data Fig. 6g–i). siRNA knockdown of TGFB diminished pro-collagen 1 alpha 1 (PRO-COL1) production in two of three cell lines for siTGFB1, one of three cell lines for siTGFB2 and one of three cell lines for siTGFB3. Combinatorial knockdown of pairs of TGFβ isoforms (Extended Data Fig. 6h) did not significantly diminish PRO-COL1, suggesting redundant roles for all three TGFβ isoforms in mediating Notch-driven fibrogenic signaling in vitro. Among TGFβ receptors, knockdown of TGFBR1 did not significantly alter pro-collagen production (Extended Data Fig. 6g), whereas TGFBR2 knockdown diminished production in two of three cell lines and TGFBR3 knockdown diminished production in three of three cell lines (Fig. 5i). Combinatorial knockdown of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 diminished PRO-COL1 production the most, suggesting that expression levels of these receptors more strongly regulate PRO-COL1 compared to TGFBR1 (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Subsequently, we examined how DLL4 stimulation regulated the distinct EC-proximal (POSTN) and EC-distal (COMP) fibrogenic programs (Fig. 5j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6i). Although the production of both proteins was strongly induced by soluble TGFβ (Extended Data Fig. 6f), POSTN was potentiated by Notch signaling, whereas COMP was highly suppressed, and both were diminished with TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 knockdown. Overall, while the responses of COMP and POSTN expression to soluble TGFβ and TGFβ receptor knockdown were similar, opposing impacts of Notch signaling on COMP and POSTN implicated an additional mechanism by which Notch regulates the patterning of TGFβ responsiveness in fibroblasts.

To quantify the temporal dynamics of EC-derived Notch in regulating fibrogenic programs, we first set up 2D and 3D co-cultures treated with or without DAPT and TGFβi, collecting and replacing media every 24 h to measure interval production of POSTN, COMP and PRO-COL1 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). In both systems, co-cultured fibroblasts exhibited sustained production of PRO-COL1 and POSTN compared to monocultured fibroblasts and was diminished with DAPT or TGFβi. In contrast, COMP production temporally decreased in co-culture, consistent with the suppression of COMP expression by endothelial-derived Notch signaling. Next, we cultured a fixed number of fibroblasts with varying numbers of ECs, measuring interval protein production. In an EC ratio-dependent manner, POSTN production was significantly induced, whereas COMP production was suppressed (Fig. 6a,b). Furthermore, the suppression of COMP production mirrored the temporal EC ratio-dependent downregulation of TGFβRII and TGFβRIII, suggesting that changes in fibroblast TGFβ receptor availability may create a dynamic threshold on the ability of fibroblasts to respond to TGFβ (Fig. 6c,d). Accordingly, analysis of Xenium co-culture and synovial tissue data revealed significantly higher expression of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 in COMPhi fibroblasts compared to POSTNhi fibroblasts (Fig. 6e–h).

a–d, A fixed number of fibroblasts were seeded with varying numbers of HUVECs. Monoculture: 5,000 fibroblasts, 5:1 ratio: 5,000 fibroblasts and 1,000 HUVECs, 2:1 ratio: 5,000 fibroblasts and 2,500 HUVECs, 1:1 ratio: 5,000 fibroblasts and 5,000 HUVECs. a,b, ELISA quantification of POSTN (a) and COMP (b) production during co-culture.

P values are shown for the comparison between TGFBR3-OE and GFP-OE data points. The bar plot on the right represents the area under the curve. Data points are shown as the mean ± s.d., represent n = 3 biological replicates and are representative of at least two independent experiments. For statistical analysis, a two-tailed Student's t-test was used for a–d, i and j, and a two-sided Wilcoxon test was used for g.

Next, to determine the extent to which suppression of COMP production in co-culture was mediated by dynamic TGFβ receptor downregulation, we used lentivirus to overexpress TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 in fibroblasts (Fig. 6i,j and Extended Data Fig. 7c). ECs co-cultured with fibroblasts overexpressing TGFBR3, but not TGFBR2, had significantly diminished suppression of COMP. Moreover, daily POSTN production was significantly enhanced in co-cultures with TGFBR3-overexpressing fibroblasts, despite negligible effects of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 on the fibroblast response to TGFβ itself, suggesting that modulation of TGFβRIII availability is specific to endothelial-derived Notch signaling in patterning of TGFβ responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e).

Since we established that steady-state EC-derived Notch signaling generates a proximal-to-distal axis of TGFβ response in fibroblasts, we next sought to understand the consequences of disrupting steady-state patterning on fibrogenic gene expression. We hypothesized that disruption of a steady-state Notch signaling can activate expression of EC-distal gene expression programs. Knockdown of EC-specific Notch ligand DLL4, fibroblast-expressed JAG1 or a combination of both at the start of co-culture significantly diminished POSTN (Fig. 7a,b). COMP was suppressed through day 3 but was de-repressed starting on day 4 in the DLL4 knockdown condition (Fig. 7b).

The data in a and b are shown as means ± s.d., represent n = 3 biological replicates and are representative of at least two independent experiments. A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was performed for a and b and two-tailed Wilcoxon tests for d, f, h, g, l and n. In the boxen plots, boxes show nested quantile ranges (median, 25–75%, 12.5–87.5%, 6.25–93.75%, and so on), the center line shows the median (50th percentile), the whiskers represent minimum and maximum values, and the outliers are shown as individual points outside the whiskers.

To characterize alterations in spatial patterning resulting from disruption of steady-state Notch signaling, we applied in situ hybridization to co-cultures treated with control or DLL4 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. 1a). As at the protein level, we observed significant induction of COMP expression (P = 1.4 × 10−6) and diminishment of POSTN expression (P = 0.04) in the DLL4 knockdown condition (Fig. 7c–f). When we compared the average expression of POSTN in relation to EC distance, we observed no significant changes, as expected, given its EC-proximal restricted patterning (Fig. 7c,d). In contrast, we observed that average COMP expression was higher with DLL4 knockdown compared to control and that the average distance of COMPhi cells to ECs increased (Fig. 7e,f). We also examined the effect of DLL4 knockdown on TGFβ isoform and receptor expression (Fig. 7g–n). While we observed no significant changes in the patterns of TGFB1 and only modest changes for TGFBR2 expression across cells (Fig. 7g,h,k,l), we observed a significant increase in the average expression of TGFBR3 and decrease in the average expression of TGFB3 (Fig. 7i,j,m,n). As with COMP expression, we observed elevated TGFBR3 expression in both EC-proximal and EC-distal compartments of DLL4 knockdown co-culture (Fig. 7n). Together, these data suggest that the expansion of COMP-expressing fibroblasts was specifically linked to the de-repression of TGFβRIII mediated by DLL4 knockdown, rather than increases in TGFβ expression, a potential mechanism by which EC-derived Notch signaling dictates the spatial patterning of fibrogenic signaling.

To examine the extent to which COMP expression is linked to Notch-mediated tuning of fibroblast sensitivity in synovial tissue, we scored vascular niches according to their expression of Notch transcriptional targets (Supplementary Fig. 2b). TGFBR3 expression was negatively correlated with vascular Notch activation scores across biopsy samples, supporting the role of Notch signaling in suppressing TGFβ receptor expression in vivo. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that Notch can tune TGFβ sensitivity via TGFβ receptor regulation in vascular niches.

Next, we evaluated the effect of treatment on fibrogenic signaling by analyzing 17 paired posttreatment synovial biopsy samples (Fig. 8a–c and Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). Across patients we observed substantial depletion of immune niches and immune subtypes and relative expansion of fibroblast-rich niches regardless of response status or treatment arm (Fig. 8b). Accordingly, tissue niche composition and swollen joint counts (SJC44, P = 0.2273) did not significantly differ between patients who achieved remission and those who did not (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g and Supplementary Table 1). However, while DAS28-ESR components decreased across remission groups, non-remission status was driven by significantly higher tender joint counts (TJC53, P = 0.0037) and VAS pain scores (P = 0.0233; Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 8g).

Scale bar, 1 µm. h, ELISA data showing supernatant levels of POSTN, COMP and PRO-COL1 in PDOs incubated overnight (left), alongside the median per-patient log2 fold change of these proteins after 3 days of treatment, normalized to overnight per-organoid protein production (n = 10–13 PDOs per condition). Statistics by Gaussian GLM, patient included as a cofactor, with FDR correction. i,j, Representative images of transcript expression in indicated conditions (top) and per-PDO average mural cell (i) and fibroblast (j) expression of indicated genes (bottom). In b, d, i and j, a two-sided Wilcoxon test was used.

Examination of fibrogenic gene expression in fibroblasts from posttreatment biopsy samples revealed elevation of the fibrogenic signature across groups (Fig. 8c and Extended Data Fig. 8h). Accordingly, we observed increases in the percentage of fibroblasts expressing COMP in most patients (remission/borderline, 5/10 patients; non-remission, 6/7 patients), with starker increases under DMARD treatment (Fig. 8d and Extended Data Fig. 8i). COMPhi tissue regions became more pauci-cellular after treatment, with an inverse relationship between COMP+ cell abundance and COMP+ cell density (Fig. 8d–f). These data suggest that after treatment, COMP-expressing fibroblasts expand and may deposit fibrous ECM. Over time, this process could generate pauci-cellular niches, thus supporting active fibrogenic remodeling in the fibroblast-rich compartment of RA following immune depletion.

Next, we evaluated whether serum markers could be used as surrogates to track fibrogenic activity in synovium by profiling pretreatment and posttreatment serum with an ~5,400-plex protein panel (Olink; Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Neither individual fibrogenic proteins nor inflammatory markers showed significant trends by time point or remission group (Extended Data Fig. 9a). A number of stromal markers, including EGFL7 (r = 0.685), an endothelial-expressed angiogenic factor37, were highly correlated with the fibrogenic score or change in fibrogenic score, although they did not meet significance (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Therefore, we extended our analysis to the AMP cohort15 to identify which cell-type abundance (CTAP) phenotype was most associated with fibrogenic signaling (Extended Data Fig. 9c–f). Fibroblasts from the CTAP characterized by endothelial, fibroblast and myeloid cells (CTAP-EFM) were the most strongly enriched for the fibrogenic gene signature and COMP expression compared to fibroblasts from other CTAPs (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Interestingly, patients belonging to CTAP-EFM, on average, also had significantly longer disease duration (Extended Data Fig. 9d). We performed differential abundance analysis of serum proteins in CTAP-EFM patients (n = 7) versus those classified as belonging to other CTAPs (n = 60). In patients belonging to CTAP-EFM, we observed enrichment of several established fibrogenic markers including SPARC, OGN and CCN2 (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Collectively, these data support fibrogenic remodeling in a subset of patients with RA who have a longer disease duration and the potential to capture proteomic signatures at later stages of disease when joint activity may be reflected systemically38.

Finally, we evaluated the feasibility of targeting Notch and TGFβ signaling to diminish fibrogenesis in RA synovial tissue (Fig. 8g–j and Extended Data Fig. 10a–e). We obtained synovial tissue from patients with active RA (n = 6), generated >30 patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from each tissue with a 2-mm punch biopsy tool, and treated each PDO with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), DAPT or TGFβi for 72 h after overnight rest, collecting media after the initial overnight incubation to establish the baseline per-PDO fibrogenic protein secretion. Across RA donors, we observed relatively high and variable production of COMP, POSTN and PRO-COL1 (Fig. 8h). Treatment of RA PDOs with both DAPT and TGFβi resulted in a significant reduction of COMP, POSTN and PRO-COL1 (Fig. 8h and Extended Data Fig. 10a). We applied the custom fibrogenic gene panel to spatially profile PDOs from three RA donors (Fig. 8i,j and Extended Data Fig. 10b–f), identifying four distinct cellular niches based on marker gene expression: vascular, lining, sublining and mural (Fig. 8g and Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). There was evidence of immune activity, although the panel was not designed to detect these populations (Extended Data Fig. 10d). To determine the effect of DAPT on perivascular TGFβ isoform and receptor expression, we examined the EC-proximal mural cell compartment where Notch signaling was most enriched (Fig. 8i and Extended Data Fig. 10e). Consistent with our observations from in vitro-cultured fibroblasts, DAPT treatment significantly suppressed TGFB1 and TGFB3 expression while de-repressing TGFBR2 and TGFBR3. Further, per-organoid fibroblast COMP expression was significantly diminished by TGFβi and reduced with DAPT (Fig. 8j and Extended Data Fig. 10f). Spatially, COMP was most abundantly expressed in the pauci-cellular regions, where TGFβi most profoundly reversed gene expression (Fig. 8j). Collectively, our data suggest that therapeutic targeting of Notch or TGFβ signaling may abrogate fibrogenic signaling in RA synovia.

Treatment failures in RA lead to high costs for society and cause undesirable morbidity associated with immunosuppression. Several factors have been suggested to contribute to RA treatment failure3, yet no novel therapeutically targetable mechanism has been identified. Our study defined a Notch–TGFβ-driven fibrogenic transcriptional program associated with non-remission in RA, consistent with previous studies that have suggested an association between the expansion of synovial fibroblasts and refractory RA15,17,39. By implicating Notch signaling in regulating fibroblast TGFβ activity, our results provide a molecular driver of synovial tissue fibrosis in RA.

Notch is an evolutionarily conserved pathway by which cells generate boundaries within tissue40. In fibroblasts, we previously reported an essential role of Notch signaling in the determination of vascular fibroblast positional identity9. Our results demonstrate that Notch tightly regulates TGFβ receptor signaling in the perivascular compartment. Our model further suggests that the border between mural cells and fibroblasts is actively maintained via constant Notch signaling from the endothelium and that disruption of stable Notch signaling resensitizes perivascular fibroblasts to TGFβ signaling, generating the fibrogenic niche. In this model, fibrosis occurs when the tissue senses a loss of vascularity through reduced Notch signaling.

Consistent with previous studies of RA synovia, we find substantial immune depletion after treatment. However, we find this occurs whether patients achieve remission or not, suggesting that reducing the immune compartment alone is not sufficient to achieve clinical remission. Several recent studies have highlighted pain sensing as an important feature of synovial biology41,42. In our cohort, pain and tender joint count, rather than inflammatory components, were the drivers of sustained disease activity, thereby linking fibrogenic fibroblast populations to lack of clinical response in pain parameters. Further, we hypothesize that the subpopulation of patients who achieved remission at 6 months but still showed increased COMP expression may have a higher risk of relapse compared to patients with stable levels. This is consistent with our finding that baseline COMP transcript abundance correlated with 12-month DAS28-ESR across remission groups, and that the COMP+ fibroblast population coexpresses genes such as DKK3 previously described in patients who were refractory to multiple lines of therapy17. A validation study with a larger cohort and longitudinal data by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Autoimmune and Immune-Mediated Disease (AMP-AIM) network is underway to address changes in synovial tissue in response to treatment.

Based on our findings, targeting fibrogenic activation and endothelial–fibroblast cross-talk may interrupt synovial tissue fibrosis and prevent refractory RA. Specifically, our study implicates TGFβ3 and TGFβRIII as spatially regulated components of TGFβ signaling that drive differential TGFβ response in fibroblasts. Of note, therapeutic targeting of TGFβ3 by anti-TGFβ3 antibody attenuated fibrosis in an animal model of fibrosis43, raising the possibility of selectively targeting TGFβ3 as an adjuvant therapy to prevent exuberant synovial tissue fibrosis in RA patients.

RA synovial tissue was obtained from patient donors at the Flinders Medical Center and was approved by the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol no. 396.10), the Mass General Brigham Human Research Committee (IRB 2019P002924), the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (IRB 20-1908) and Hospital for Special Surgery (IRB 2014-233). Samples were obtained via synovial biopsy or retrieved from patients with RA who were undergoing arthroplasty or synovectomy and were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or OCT-embedded immediately after retrieval. RA synovial biopsy samples were retrieved using the small-bore arthroscopic method on active joints under direct vision. A biopsy was performed on the same joint at baseline and 6 months. Clinical characteristics of patients are available in Supplementary Table 1. Enrollment complied with relevant ethical regulations of all institutions. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

FFPE blocks were sliced onto Xenium slides according to the Xenium In Situ for FFPE Tissue Preparation Guide (CG000578 Rev C, 10x Genomics) protocol. The Xenium slides were then prepared following the Xenium In Situ for FFPE-Deparaffinization and Decrosslinking protocol (CG000580 Rev D, 10x Genomics). In brief, the slides were baked at 60 °C for 30 min and then sequentially immersed in xylene, ethanol and nuclease-free water to deparaffinize and rehydrate the tissue. Immediately after, the Xenium slides were incubated in the decrosslinking and permeabilization solution at 80 °C for 30 min, followed by a wash with PBS-T.

For co-cultures, Xenium slides were precoated with diluted 1:10 diluted Matrigel (Corning, 356231) after which a mixture of fibroblasts (120,000) and HUVECs (60,000) were seeded for 72 h. Slides were fixed and permeabilized according to protocols for fresh frozen tissue (CG000581).

Next, the slides were prepared according to the Xenium Prime In Situ Gene Expression user guide (CG000760 Rev A, 10x Genomics) for the remaining steps or Xenium In Situ Gene Expression - Probe Hybridization, Ligation & Amplification (CG000582) for co-culture. Probes from the Xenium Prime 5 K Human Pan Tissue & Pathways Panel (PN-1000671, 10x Genomics) and the custom add-on panels were hybridized to the samples at 50 °C for 18 h. After hybridization, the slides underwent washing, incubation with a ligation reaction mix, another wash step and DNA amplification. Finally, cell segmentation staining was conducted, and the slides were treated with an autofluorescence quencher and DAPI before being loaded into the Xenium instrument.

Processed Xenium slides were loaded in the Xenium Analyzer and imaged, following the guidelines in the Xenium Analyzer User Guide (CG000584 Rev F, 10x Genomics). After scanning, the Xenium slides were removed from the Xenium Analyzer, and processed with post-run H&E staining according to the Xenium In Situ Gene Expression - Post-Xenium Analyzer H&E Staining protocol (CG000613 Rev A, 10x Genomics).

Cells in Xenium data were segmented using Xenium Onboard Analysis, based on nuclear expansion (custom panel co-culture data) or multimodal cell segmentation using cell boundary, interior and nuclear stains (5k data).

Single-cell and niche analysis were performed using Seurat v5.0.0 after filtering out cells with ≤50 transcript species (‘nFeatures') and log normalizing data for each sample with the median transcripts detected as the scale factor. Single cells from different samples were integrated using Harmony44. Niches were identified using Tessera23 based on Harmony embeddings. We labeled cell types and niches in 5,101-gene panel data based on the enrichment of marker genes associated with co-clustering cells or niches. For cell types, neighbor detection and UMAP were run with 20 principal components, and clustering with a resolution of 0.3. For niches, neighbor detection and UMAP were run with 10 principal components, and clustering with a resolution of 0.2. Example niches were selected among the top three most typical (by Euclidean distance to the average cell-type representation) within a single sample in which all niches were detected. In some cases, Xenium Explorer v3.2 was used for visualization of transcripts.

For the 50-gene custom panel data, endothelial and mural cells were identified based on enrichment of markers (PECAM1 and ACTA2, respectively) in clustered data. For comparison to COMP+ fibroblasts, fibroblasts were identified based on expression of PDGFRB and NOTCH2 > 0 and exclusion from endothelial and mural cell clusters.

We calculated kernel density estimates using the tidy_kde function from the eks R package45. Pairwise Pearson correlations were calculated by taking density values for different transcripts at each pixel within a sample, after selecting for subregions on the slide based on 50% contour regions of the COL1A1 kernel density estimate or regions with DAPI above background, as specified. For COMPhi regions in Fig. 7, we considered cell counts per area within regions defined by the 50% contour region of the kernel density estimate per sample. We used the R packages terra and raster to mask subregions.

For analysis of scRNA-seq data, we used the R package Seurat v5.0 for downstream analysis. The filtered count matrix was used as input, and we used SCTransform to normalize data before principal coordinate analysis and UMAP projection. Differential expression analysis was performed using the FindMarkers function with a Wilcoxon test and gene signature scores were applied to datasets using the AddModuleScore_Ucell function from the UCell package. The DotPlot function was used to generate bubble plots depicting the expression of indicated genes across cell populations and the VlnPlot function was used to generate violin plots.

OCT-embedded synovial sections were equilibrated at −20 °C for 10 min, and 10-m sections were obtained using a cryostat, mounted onto a glass slide and stored at −80 °C. Before staining, slides were equilibrated for 5 min at 20 °C, sections were encircled with a PAP pen (ImmEdge, Vector Labs), rehydrated with PBS for 5 min at 20 °C, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, and blocked for 1 h in TBS-T with 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100. The following primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C: phospho-SMAD3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200 dilution), TGFβ1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:100 dilution), TGFβ2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:50 dilution), TGFβ3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:100 dilution), NOTCH3-PE (BioLegend; 1:50 dilution), CD45-FITC (BioLegend; 1:50 dilution), collagen I (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:1,000 dilution) and vWF (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:100 dilution). Primary antibodies were removed, and sections were washed with PBS-T three times before secondary antibody incubation with the following antibodies at a 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer: AF660 anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21074) and AF555 anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-21424). Secondary antibodies were removed, sections were washed three times with PBS-T and mounted using Fluoromount-G mounting medium with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired on an EVOS M7000.

Synovial fibroblast cell lines were thawed and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1% MEM amino acids, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol and 1% gentamicin (pH 7.4). HUVECs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were thawed and maintained in EGM-Plus media supplemented with the EGM-plus bulletkit (Lonza). Passages 3 to 6 were used for experiments. For DLL4 stimulation experiments, cell culture plates were precoated overnight with 5 μg ml−1 DLL4-Fc (R&D Systems) and for co-cultures, plates were precoated overnight with a 1:10 dilution of Matrigel (Corning, 356231) and washed with PBS. In some conditions, cells were treated with TGF beta-1 (PeproTech, 10 ng ml−1), DAPT (Selleckchem, 10 µM) or TGFβ inhibitor (SB431542, 10 µM) or antibodies against TGFβ isoforms (Proteintech a-TGFβ1 69012-1-Ig; Thermo Fisher Scientific a-TGFβ1,2,3 MA5-23795, R&D Systems a-TGFβ2 AB-12-NA, R&D Systems a-TGFβ3 MAB243) at a concentration of 5 μg ml−1. The following siRNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to monocultures or co-cultures at a 20 nM concentration at the start of cultures and were re-dosed every 72 h, when applicable: NTC (4390843), JAG1 (s1174) and DLL4 (s534448), TGFB1 (s14054), TGFB2 (s14059), TGFB3 (s224725), TGFBR1 (s14073), TGFBR2 (s14077) and TGFBR3 (s24). siRNA treatment was performed as described in the Lipofectamine RNAiMax protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For RT–qPCR experiments, 10,000 fibroblasts were seeded in 96 wells. For immunoblotting, 250,000 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates before stimulation and cell lysis. For co-cultures, a fixed number of fibroblasts (5,000) were cultured with HUVECs (5,000) at a 1:1 ratio, unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends.

Fibroblasts or co-cultures were trypsinized and directly stained with an equal volume of primary antibody solution (Cell staining buffer, BioLegend) containing eFluor 780 Fixable Viability Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:1,000 dilution), TGFβR2-APC (BioLegend; 1:100 dilution), TGFβRIII (Proteintech, 20000-1-AP; 1:100 dilution) or CD31-FITC (BioLegend; 1:100 dilution) for 30 min at 4 C. Cells were washed with cell staining buffer (BioLegend), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 20 °C, washed, and stained with AF555 anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 °C for detection of TGFβIII. Cells were washed and resuspended in cell staining buffer. PDOs after 4 days of culture were disaggregated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing Liberase TL (100 μg ml−1; Sigma Aldrich) and DNAse I (100 μg ml−1; Stemcell Technologies), filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer, washed and stained as described with eflour780 Fixable viability dye, CD31-BV21 (BioLegend; 1:100 dilution), FITC-CD45 (BioLegend; 1:100 dilution) and PE-PDPN (BioLegend; 1:100 dilution) in the presence of Fc blocking reagent (BioLegend). Data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II and further analyzed with Flowjo version 10.

A 3:1 ratio of fibroblasts and ECs (7500 fibroblasts, 2500 HUVECs) was seeded on Matrigel (Corning; 1:10 dilution) precoated 96-well plates (Agilent, 204626-100). After culture and treatment with siRNA for 5 days, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% NBF and processed for staining and imaging according to the manufacturer's protocol with the RNAScope multiplex fluorescent V2 assay (ACD Bio, SOP 45-009 A). Images were acquired on an EVOS M7000.

Results were quantified by segmenting nuclei based on DAPI staining using Cellpose46 and performing nuclear expansion to approximate cell boundaries. We then used scikit-image47 to calculate mean intensities per cell.

Following incubation, cells were trypsinized and rinsed with cold PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 350g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89900) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitor mini-tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32961) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Active Motif, 37492). The cell lysate was briefly vortexed at high speed to dissociate aggregates, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at high speed for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227). Between 30 µg and 50 µg of protein was subjected to SDS–PAGE (Bio-Rad, 1610734) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, 1704273) using the Bio-Rad TRANS-BLOT TURBO transfer system (Bio-Rad, 690BR324) with a dry transfer protocol for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were blocked for 15 min in Everyblot blocking buffer (Bio-Rad, 12010020), then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against TGFβ1 (Proteintech, 21898-1-AP; 1:500 dilution), TGFβ2 (Proteintech, 19999-1-AP; 1:500 dilution), TGFβ3 (Proteintech, 18942-1-AP; 1:500 dilution), TGFβR1 (RD Biosciences, AF3025; 1:300 dilution), TGFβR2 (Bioss, bs-0117R; 1:500 dilution), TGFβR3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2519S; 1:500 dilution), GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-15738) or beta-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 3700). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, anti-Rabbit, 32460, anti-Mouse, 31430, or anti-Goat, A16005) for 1 h at 20 °C. All the antibody dilutions were in Everyblot blocking buffer. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34095) or SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34577) and imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system.

Olink protein concentration values (NPX) from AMP RA/SLE and 396.10 cohort patients were extracted with the OlinkAnalyze package. A count matrix and a separate file with metadata indicating each patient's CTAP, remission status or clinical data were formed. The lmfit and eBayes functions from the limma package were used to identify the differential abundance of proteins in patients belonging to CTAP-EFM compared to patients classified in other CTAPs and the cor function in R was used to calculate correlations. −log10(unadjusted P values) are reported in the volcano plot and adjusted P values (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) are reported in the associated bar plot.

We analyzed both bulk RNA-seq and pseudo-bulk data from spatial transcriptomics data using DESeq2 (ref. 48).

Supernatant was collected on the indicated days and stored at 4 °C in sealed polypropylene plates before assay by ELISA. For measurement of pro-collagen 1 alpha 1 (R&D Systems, DY6220-05), COMP (R&D Systems, DY3134) or POSTN (R&D Systems, DY3548B), TGFβ1 (R&D Systems, DY240-05), TGFβ2 (R&D Systems, DY302) and TGFβ3 (DY243) plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with diluted capture antibody solution, washed with PBS-T and blocked for 1 h at 20 °C in blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS). For activation of latent TGFβ into an immunoreactive form, supernatant was incubated with 1 N HCl for 10 min followed by neutralization with 1.2 N NaOH/0.5 M HEPES buffer per the manufacturer's protocols. Supernatant was diluted in a blocking buffer and incubated on plates for 2 h at 20 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation of detection antibody and 30-min incubation of HRP-Streptavidin (R&D Systems) with PBS-T washes in between. The ELISA was developed with 50 µl of TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stopped after 20 min with 50 µl of 2 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance was read with a plate reader (Spectramax) at 450 nm with a 570-nm background subtraction.

Cells were lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA was extracted per the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's protocols. The qPCR mastermix was prepared using Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix (Agilent), and samples were run on an AriaMX Real Time PCR machine (Agilent). The relative abundance of transcripts was normalized to the expression of GAPDH mRNA using the 2−ΔΔCT method. All primer pair sequences were obtained from Origene and synthesized by IDT.

TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 plasmids (pLV[Exp]-Bsd-CMV) were ordered from VectorBuilder. 293FT cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells in a T75 flask and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol with 11.18 μg of target plasmid and 17.8 μg of packaging mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, V53406) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015) in a T75 flask. Virus supernatants were harvested and filtered after 4 days and concentrated overnight using Peg-it virus precipitation solution (System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were transduced with lentiviral supernatants containing polybrene (10 μg ml−1) for one week, with regular media changes, followed by one week of selection with blasticidin (10 μg ml−1) before use in experiments.

Cryopreserved synovial tissue specimens were thawed in a 37 °C water bath, transferred into a solution of DMEM + 10% FBS followed by PBS. Synovial tissue fragments were subsequently transferred from PBS to a 100-mm × 15-mm Petri dish and punched with a 2-mm punch biopsy tool (Integra, 33-31-P/25) to generate organoids; a minimum of 30 organoids were generated per tissue sample. Organoids were implanted into wells of a 96-well plate that were precoated with 50 μl of Matrigel (Corning, 356231). After allowing Matrigel to polymerize for 30 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of EGM-2 media was added to each well and incubated overnight. For inhibitor treatment, all media were removed before adding 100 μl media containing DMSO, DAPT (10 µM) or TGFβi (10 µM). Supernatant before (16 h) and after (72 h) inhibitor treatment was collected for ELISA analysis. For spatial profiling, PDOs were embedded in OCT after treatment, stored at −80 °C and later sectioned onto Xenium slides (10 µM) using a cryostat.

H&E staining and imaging were performed following the Visium HD FFPE Tissue Preparation Handbook (CG000684). Samples were then processed and sequenced following the Visium HD Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits User Guide (CG000685). Space Ranger version 3.0 was used for analysis. Bins (8 µm) were used for visualization of gene signatures.

Fibroblast and fibroblast–endothelial 3D cultures were generated as previously described9. Briefly, fibroblast-only cultures consisted of 200,000 fibroblasts and fibroblast plus EC cultures contained 100,000 synovial fibroblasts and 100,000 HUVECs, which were combined in a single 35-µl droplet of Matrigel, seeded on ultralow-attachment plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 174930) and cultured in 1 ml EGM-2 medium replaced at indicated time points (Lonza).

In total, 5,000 fibroblasts were seeded onto both 96-well Transwell inserts (0.2-µM pore) and DLL4 precoated receiver plates (Corning, 3381). After incubation for 72 h, fibroblasts in the Transwell chamber and receiver plates were lysed in TRIzol for RT–qPCR.

Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.4.1 or R version 4.4.1/4.4.2. There were no tests performed to assess normality. Differences between data that were assumed to be normally distributed were assessed using Student's two-tailed t-tests, and differences in data assumed to be non-normally distributed data were evaluated with Mann–Whitney U tests. Detailed statistical descriptions, including sample size and calculation methods, are provided in the figure legends and text. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Cortisol is a key regulator of stress and circadian physiology, yet current monitoring relies on invasive blood sampling or saliva assays that are prone to contamination and provide limited temporal resolution. Wearable sweat cortisol sensors are promising, but require electronic sensing systems and have limited capability for long-term, time-sequenced monitoring. Here we present a wearable paper-based microfluidic platform that integrates plasmonic-gold-nanoflower-based colorimetric assays to enable non-invasive tracking of cortisol in eccrine sweat. Sweat is induced by carbachol iontophoresis and directed through collection channels using either electronically timed sequential activation or paper-based delay valves with self-powered electrochromic indicators. In human studies, the system resolved circadian variations, acute stress responses to cold pressor challenges, and jet-lag-associated disruptions, with the results closely matching those from saliva and serum assays. This wearable lateral flow technology establishes sweat as a viable medium for real-time hormone monitoring and may enable personalized management of stress, sleep and circadian misalignment.

Managing stress is a critically important aspect of maintaining good physical and mental health1. Cortisol, a key biomarker for stress, is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands2. Activation of the stress-responsive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis induces the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. The resulting complex metabolic processes lead to elevated blood pressure and glucose levels, as mechanisms to respond to stressful scenarios3. Chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of cortisol can have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular, immune, renal and endocrine systems1. Misalignment of circadian rhythms, also controlled by cortisol, can likewise lead to adverse health effects4,5. Knowledge of cortisol levels can, therefore, potentially assist in the management of sleep patterns and stress-related disorders, including those related to post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome6.

Despite the importance of cortisol, monitoring its concentration in biofluids remains challenging. The collection and analysis of blood samples involves complex procedures, trained personnel and dedicated facilities6. Saliva is an attractive alternative to blood, but one that is prone to contamination by substances in the mouth7. Eccrine sweat is therefore of increasing interest3,6,8,9,10,11. Wearable devices for electrochemical sensing of cortisol in sweat12,13,14 offer important capabilities but require electronics for sensing and offer limited capacity for the time-dynamic detection of cortisol over hours. Conventional colorimetric sensors have some potential, but face challenges due to the extremely low concentrations of cortisol present in sweat3.

Lateral flow immunoassays that use colorimetric readout have proven utility in sensing biomarkers in blood serum, urine, nasal swabs and saliva. For measuring cortisol, such assays operate based on competitive binding between cortisol and a conjugate of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and cortisol (BSA–CTS), both of which bind anti-cortisol antibodies on plasmonic nanoparticles. The sensitivity depends on various physical, chemical and biological factors, including label type, bioreceptor affinity and flow rate15. Among these, the optical label is critically important. Relative to commonly used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) are particularly attractive for this purpose, due to their high surface areas and enhanced extinction coefficients associated with localized surface plasmon resonances16,17,18. Their complex surface structure also improves antibody immobilization efficiency18. Previous studies have demonstrated these enhancements in lateral flow assays (LFAs), but their application in detecting cortisol remains unexplored.

This Article reports a skin-interfaced device that combines paper-based microfluidic structures and LFAs that use AuNFs for the sampling and analysis of sweat in a time-sequential fashion following iontophoretic delivery of carbachol through the surface of the skin. The results include versions of the device with two different sampling modes: (1) a pre-programmed electronic timer circuit for sequenced iontophoresis events; and (2) a passive valve structure and self-powered electrochromic timer with which to capture distinct sampling events. Demonstrations of this technology involve studies on the diurnal cycle, cold pressor tests (CPTs) and responses to jet lag. Levels of cortisol in sweat measured in this fashion align well with separate assays based on saliva and serum. The results suggest the potential for routine biochemical assessments of stress and mental health, to guide therapeutic intervention.

The platform comprises four major components: an encapsulation layer that caps the entire system; an integrated iontophoresis module with an electronic timer for time-triggered sweat stimulation; a set of agarose hydrogels containing carbachol (blue; carbagel) or KCl (yellow); and a skin-interfaced LFA module with four separate assays (Fig. 1a). A three-dimensional (3D) schematic illustration shows the assembly of these components in the device (Fig. 1b). The carbagel elements interface with the skin at a position next to the paper-based microfluidic cellulose collection channels. Iontophoretic delivery triggers the release of sweat, which then passes to the LFA (Fig. 1c). These multiple LFA assays support time-resolved measurements across multiple collection channels. Each channel has a separate sample pad to transfer sweat towards a conjugation pad, which contains AuNFs that are conjugated with an anti-cortisol antibody (AuNF–Ab conjugates) (Fig. 1d). Then, the sweat moves through the nitrocellulose membrane, which is spotted with BSA–CTS for the test line and anti-immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) antibody for the control line. An absorbent pad at the end of the nitrocellulose membrane absorbs any excess sweat. An exploded view of the LFA (Fig. 1e) highlights each component, from the bottom skin adhesive to the top viewing window. The assay includes a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with an adhesive layer, microfluidic spacers, nitrocellulose membranes, conjugation pads, sample pads, absorbent pads and viewing windows made of superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic materials. Optical images show the device on the skin with hydrogel (Fig. 1f) and electronics (Fig. 1g). Figure 1h presents an image of an LFA on the body, displaying the test and control lines. Figure 1i illustrates the principles and operation for time-sequenced iontophoretic stimulation at 20-min intervals, with sweat flow visualized by green food dyes spotted on the conjugation pad.

Figure 2a summarizes the principles of the competitive LFA for detecting the concentration of cortisol in sweat. The sample pad contains a phosphate buffer (1 M; 2 μl) that adjusts the pH of entering sweat to 6.5. Upon wetting the conjugation pad, cortisol in the sweat binds to the antibody on the AuNFs and moves along the nitrocellulose membrane, where the test line contains BSA–CTS and the control line contains anti-IgG antibody. At physiologically relevant sweat rates (0.5–1.0 μl min−1), the transit time of ~6–12 min provides sufficient incubation for cortisol to fully bind to the antibody3. As described elsewhere, the nanoflower geometry enhances the sensitivity of the assay due to the enhanced light extinction coefficient, large surface area and reduced velocity associated with flow through the nitrocellulose membrane compared with spherical geometries18,19. This scheme offers limits of detection that span into picomolar concentrations, consistent with physiological concentrations of cortisol in sweat.

Extended Data Fig. 1a highlights the synthesis of AuNFs via the reaction of para-aminobenzenethiol with Au3+ ions. Upon reduction of gold ions by thiolate complex formation, the clear solution turns reddish brown, indicating the formation of AuNFs. Figure 2b shows the ultraviolet absorbance spectrum of AuNFs, with a maximum peak at 558 nm, resulting from their larger size compared with typical AuNPs. Figure 2c presents a transmission electron microscopy image of a typical AuNF, with an average size of 164 nm, as determined from dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2d). A concentration-dependent increase in the zeta potential (the electrical potential at the particle's surface) follows from an increase in the anti-cortisol antibody concentration, demonstrating successful binding of the antibody to the surface of AuNFs (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

In this competitive LFA assay, AuNF–Ab conjugates bind to the immobilized BSA–CTS antigen at the test line in the absence of cortisol in sweat, forming a distinct and intense band (Extended Data Fig. 1c). The residual AuNF–Ab conjugates, both with and without cortisol, subsequently interact via their fragment crystallizable regions with the anti-mouse IgG antibody at the control line. Increasing the cortisol concentration (0–100 ng ml−1) results in a progressive fading of the test line colour due to the partial or full occupation of anti-cortisol antibody with sweat cortisol and competition with BSA–CTS at the test line, which disappears entirely at approximately 1,000 ng ml−1 (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 1c–g). Similarly, the control line becomes more pronounced with increasing cortisol concentration (Fig. 2f). Thus, the LFA demonstrates high-contrast bright bands at both the test and control lines, particularly at low and high cortisol concentrations. As such, the control-to-test-line ratios provide sensitive quantification of cortisol concentrations. The optimization of adjusted sweat pH levels (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i), working buffers (Extended Data Fig. 1j,k), BSA–CTS (Extended Data Fig. 1l,m) and anti-cortisol antibody (Extended Data Figs. 1m and 2a) yields a highly sensitive assay, as demonstrated by the standard calibration curve for artificial sweat solution spiked with cortisol concentrations ranging from 100 pg ml−1 to 100 ng ml−1 at a flow rate of 0.5 μl min−1 (Fig. 2g). Application of the signal-to-noise method20 determined the limit of detection for cortisol to be 75 pg ml−1, supporting the sensitivity of the assay into the low-picomolar range. The calibration curve covers the physiologically relevant concentrations of cortisol in sweat, which extends to 100 ng ml−1.

A series of experiments validates the operation of the system. The results indicate negligible sensitivity to sweat flow rate and injection volume, over relevant ranges, after optimization (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). The standard calibration curves obtained for three different real sweat samples with baseline cortisol concentrations of 1.0, 0.9 and 0.3 ng ml−1, as well as artificial sweat samples, all of which are spiked with cortisol, are consistent (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.99; Fig. 2i). Furthermore, cortisol concentrations obtained from the LFA assay correlate with those measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit (r = 0.94; Fig. 2j). Quantitative readouts of test line intensity under varying illumination conditions (4,500–5,500 K) and using various imaging devices (digital and smartphone cameras) show negligible signal variation, supporting the robustness of the assay (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f). Protocols for analysing the LFA signals appear in Extended Data Fig. 3a–g and the Supplementary Information section ‘Analysis of wearable LFA'. The LFA signals remain consistent for up to 6 h after assay completion, which is critical for time-sequenced iontophoretic sweat sampling and detection over several hours (Fig. 2k).

Optical images of the time-sequenced iontophoresis module appear in Extended Data Fig. 4a–c. Figure 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4d–f show a block diagram and connection scheme. First, activating the long-term timer (TPL5110) with a switch generates a pulse signal that triggers the short-term timer (TLC551). The short-term timer, pre-configured in one-shot mode, then activates one of the step-up converters (R1218) from the four channels (initially set to 00) through a 2-to-4 decoder (SN74LVC1G139) connected to a 2-bit counter (74HC73). During this activation, direct electrical current flows from positive (+) to negative (−) bottom electrodes, thereby delivering carbachol locally through the skin to trigger sweat production. Here, the limiting converter resistor determines the magnitude of the electrical current, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 4e. After a set duration (for example, 5 min), the short-term timer turns off and shifts the counter by one position. The counter sequence follows the order: 00 → 01 → 10 → 11 → 00. A timing diagram in Fig. 3b also confirms the time-sequenced series of iontophoretic sweat stimulation. This stimulation sequence repeats according to the preset timing parameters. In the photographs (on the right-hand side of the graph), the centre LED and red LED on each channel represent activation of the short-term timer and current counter sequence, respectively. Extended Data Fig. 4g,h presents the results for stimulation time interval (tinterval) versus long timer resistance (RL) and stimulation time (ton) versus short timer resistance (Rs), respectively. Extended Data Fig. 4i demonstrates a low level of timing variability.

Figure 3c,d shows a schematic of the flexible printed circuit board with electronic components on the top and bottom of the iontophoretic stimulation module. The main timer modules reside at the centre of the device, with each channel next to the main timer modules in a counter-clockwise order. The remaining components, including a switch, a battery and wireless charging circuits, are located on separate flexible printed circuit board islands, which fold onto the main timer modules during packaging.

Experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations that include the properties of the hydrogel (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b), the current densities (Extended Data Fig. 5c–k) and the distances between the stimulation site and collection channel (Fig. 3e,f) serve as guides to maximize the sweat rate that follows from iontophoretic delivery. Carbagel produces about 20 μl sweat, compared with 5 μl for the alternative pilogel (pilocarpine in hydrogel), at 0.5% wt/vol, 4.3 μA mm−2 and a 1.5-mm distance between the stimulation site and collection channel (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Carbagel is better suited for the application presented here than pilogel, as the miniaturized LFA requires more than 10 μl sweat for operation. The total amount of sweat can be controlled with the limiting converter resistor. For values from 500–200 Ω, the current through the skin ranges from 100–500 μA (Extended Data Fig. 5c), with a corresponding increase in sweat volume (Extended Data Fig. 5d–h). Extended Data Fig. 5i–k illustrates FEA results for the effect of current density on electric field distribution through the skin. The LFA can be filled within 30 min of stimulation for the case of a paper-based microfluidic collection channel with dimensions of 2 mm × 10 mm (Extended Data Fig. 5l,m).

The distance between the stimulation site and collection channel is a critical parameter for maximizing the collected sweat volume and minimizing cross-contamination between each collection channel (Fig. 3e,f). At distances greater than 5.5 mm from the stimulation site, little sweat emerges from the collection channel, thereby defining a minimum distance to avoid cross-contamination. At a distance of 1.5 mm, sweat volumes of over 20 μl can be produced while forming a tight seal with the skin. A series of FEA simulations and on-body stimulation experiments confirm capabilities in time-sequenced iontophoretic stimulation with zero cross-contamination (Fig. 3g–l).

Water vapour that emerges from the nitrocellulose membrane tends to condense on the surface of the viewing window, thereby frustrating the ability to visualize the LFA (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Superhydrophilic surfaces prevent droplet condensation by causing water to spread evenly as a thin film21,22. However, the exclusive use of superhydrophilic materials leads to wicking of sweat away from the nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 4b). The placement of superhydrophobic material on top of the sample and conjugation pad resolves this issue by blocking sweat flow through the top window (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6c–j). Figure 4d demonstrates the effectiveness of a superhydrophilic window (contact angle: 9.4°) in preventing droplet formation compared with superhydrophobic (contact angle: 151°) or untreated PET (contact angle: 82°) windows. The configuration with both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials enables reliable operation and clear visualization after 15 min (Fig. 4e) and 4 h (Fig. 4f) of continuous heating on a hotplate at 30°. Characterization of the contact angle (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), atomic force microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d), optical properties (Fig. 4g–i) and reactive-ion etching process parameters (Extended Data Fig. 7e) of these materials provided additional insights, as discussed in the Supplementary Information section ‘Characterization of superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces'.

A simple, passive alternative to the electronic module described previously comprises a series of LFAs coupled with BSA-gated paper-based microfluidic delay valves and electrochromic timers. The result provides an effective solution for chronosampling and defining the timing of sweat collection without the need for electronics (Fig. 5a). Narrow paper-based microfluidic cellulose channels with drop-cast layers of BSA (4%; 1.5 μl) serve as delay valves that direct sweat in a time-sequenced manner into separate LFAs. These valves temporarily restrict the flow until the BSA dissolves, allowing sequential delivery of sweat into each LFA and electrochromic timer pair. Electrochromic timers aligned with the valves and LFAs operate through a colour change associated with the reduction of a layer of polyaniline. Specifically, the timers comprise a two-electrode galvanic cell wherein polyaniline serves as the cathode, nickel metal serves as the anode and human sweat acts as the electrolyte (Fig. 5b). Digital image capture and analysis quantifies the change in colour, thereby allowing determination—with an appropriate calibration factor—of the time for sweat collection into each LFA.

The data represent mean values ± s.d. (n = 3 technical replicates for d–g and i–m).

Benchtop validation and on-body demonstrations of this system show expected sequential filling of each LFA and colorimetric readout of the timing (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 8a). The delay time of the valves increases with higher BSA loading (Fig. 5d), caused by the higher contact angles at higher BSA concentrations (Fig. 5e). The volume and concentration of the drop-cast BSA solution determine the extent of BSA loading. Increasing valve widths lead to shorter delay times (Fig. 5f). The computational framework for simulating these valves integrates multiphase flow dynamics in porous media with a temporal evolution model of dissolution. The valve operates via negative capillary pressure, halting fluid propagation until the dissolution of the BSA induces a dynamic reduction in the contact angle (θ). As the BSA concentration asymptotically approaches 0, the contact angle θ approaches superhydrophilic conditions (θ → 0°)23,24, thereby enabling controlled fluid permeation through the valve architecture (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 9a–c).

Figure 5h displays information on the timer, specifically the galvanostatic charge/discharge traces obtained from both the polyaniline cathode (black trace) and nickel anode (purple trace) under an applied current of 5 µA. The data include colorimetric b values (blue diamonds) and representative digital photographs of the polyaniline electrode. During reduction, polyaniline displays a sloping voltage plateau at 0.3 V associated with its conversion from the fully oxidized pernigraniline phase to the partially oxidized emeraldine phase. During this transition, the colour of the electrode changes substantially, transitioning from dark blue to pale green (appearing red in photographs due to the roughened Au electrode). Further reduction results in complete conversion of the emeraldine phase to the leucoemeraldine phase, but this conversion does not provide a substantial colour change. Importantly, the voltage that develops at the aniline electrode remains above that of the Ni anode, such that spontaneous discharge of the electrochemical cell is maintained irrespective of the charge state. Similarly, this colorimetric and redox transition is completely reversible upon application of an oxidizing current, as evidenced by the charging trace provided in the bottom half of Fig. 5h.

An optical image of an optimized device on the wrist appears in Extended Data Fig. 9d, showing the paper-based microfluidic sweat collection inlet, BSA valves, electrochromic timers and LFA channels. In the assembled device, spontaneous reduction initiates with the introduction of sweat into the timing well, resulting in polyaniline reduction and a concomittant colour change analogous to that displayed in Fig. 5h. The total timing duration in this assembly depends on a load resistor placed between the anode and cathode that limits the rate of battery discharge. Appropriate selection of the resistance can address the requirements of a specific application (Fig. 5i). Timing durations from several minutes to over one hour are achievable in this way. As timing in this structure relies on the standard reduction potentials of the anode and cathode, it is comparatively less sensitive to temperature effects than analogous diffusion-based colorimetric timing systems8, as displayed in Fig. 5j. Reducing species, such as ascorbic acid, can act as interferents by reacting with the oxidized polyaniline membrane on the timer and discolouring the timer prematurely. A trace of polyaniline on the cellulose paper-based microfluidic channel before the timer reacts with any reducing species before sweat reaches the timer, thereby protecting the timer from discolouration by sweat. Subjecting polyaniline cathodes to progressively increasing concentrations of ascorbic acid reveals the effect of exogenous reducing species on electrochromic timing elements (Fig. 5k). Increasing concentrations of reductants induce spontaneous reduction of the electrode (and a concomitant lightening of the apparent coloration) with full reduction obtained at 100 mM. Following solution pre-reduction, the effect of reductive interferents can be effectively eliminated. Detailed schematics, characterizations and simulations of the timer appear in Extended Data Fig. 10a–k and Supplementary Information sections ‘Principles and dynamics of electrochromic timer' and ‘Concentration polarization in electrochromic timing elements'.

The resulting structure exhibits excellent performance for real sweat in benchtop (Fig. 5l) and on-body (Fig. 5m) studies. Figure 5n shows a practical demonstration of the device with two participants. Iontophoresis initially induced sweat, which filled the first set of LFAs and electrochromic timers. After 15 min, participants began exercising while collecting sweat for the next sets of LFAs and timers. Both participants showed a slight increase in sweat cortisol concentration following exercise (Fig. 5n).

Trials with human participants demonstrate the ability of the device to monitor daily cycles, the effects of CPTs and the results of disruptions to the sleep cycle caused by jet lag (Fig. 6a,b). The data in Fig. 6c show variations in cortisol concentrations aligned with circadian rhythms for three participants over three days. Cortisol concentrations measured in saliva using an ELISA kit provide data for comparison. Collection of sweat and saliva samples occurred at 17:00 on the first day; 9:30, 12:00, 14:30 and 17:00 on the second day; and 9:30 on the third day. On the first day, the integrated device was used with a 2 h 30 min stimulation interval set by the electronic timer. For both saliva and sweat, cortisol concentrations started low for all participants on the first day (17:00), peaked on the second day morning (09:30), gradually decreased throughout the second day (17:00) and then increased again on the third day morning (09:30). Data from circadian rhythm studies reveal a strong correlation between sweat cortisol and saliva cortisol (r = 0.73) for six participants (Fig. 6d).

Investigations of the effect of CPTs on sweat and serum cortisol concentrations further highlight the versatility of the integrated system in studying psychoneurological responses to acute stress (Fig. 6e). Sweat iontophoretic stimulation and serum collection occurred on an interval set to 20 min. Both serum and sweat cortisol concentrations increase upon exposure to ice water, reaching peak values at 20 min after exposure, followed by recovery at 40 min after exposure (Fig. 6f–h).

Monitoring disruptions to circadian rhythms is particularly relevant for night shift workers, intercontinental airline travellers and patients with insomnia or excessive sleepiness5. Jet lag, in particular, affects travellers crossing multiple time zomes, sometimes leading to daytime fatigue, insomnia, nausea and early waking25. Measurements of sweat and serum cortisol concentrations offer valuable insights into the impact of jet lag on circadian rhythms before travel, immediately after travel and during recovery (Fig. 6i–k). In one case, a participant travelled from Chicago to Seoul and returned 26 days later, with a nine-hour time difference (Fig. 6i). Cortisol concentrations in sweat and serum were measured 3 days before departure, 1 day after returning to Chicago and 12 days after recovery. Before travel, the participant displayed a typical circadian rhythm, with higher cortisol concentrations in the morning (09:30) and lower concentrations in the afternoon (16:00). After returning to Chicago, the rhythm reversed, with lower cortisol concentrations in the morning (09:30) and higher concentrations in the afternoon (16:00). After 12 days of recovery, the circadian rhythm normalized, with higher cortisol concentrations in the morning (09:30) and lower concentrations in the afternoon (16:00).

In another case, a participant travelled from Chicago to Taiwan and returned 20 days later, with a 13-h time difference (Fig. 6j). Cortisol concentrations for sweat and serum were measured 1 day before departure, 1 day after returning to Chicago and 12 days after recovery. Similar to the first participant, this participant exhibited a typical circadian rhythm before travel, a reversed circadian rhythm after travel and a normalized rhythm after recovery. Additionally, we investigated sweat cortisol concentrations for a participant who travelled from Chicago to Seoul and returned after 17 days, with a 9-h time difference (Fig. 6k). Sweat cortisol concentrations were measured 5 days before departure, 1 day after returning to Chicago and 12 days after recovery. Similar circadian rhythm profiles to those of the other two participants were observed for this participant. A positive correlation between sweat and serum cortisol concentrations was observed, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.73 for 10 participants (Fig. 6l), demonstrating the relevance of sweat cortisol in monitoring the effects of acute stressors, as well as disruptions to circadian rhythms by jet lag, effectively.

The wearable platform introduced here provides a rapid, convenient method for time-sequential sampling of eccrine sweat and measurements of cortisol concentrations, with accuracy and selectivity across a range of physiologically relevant values. The simplicity of the electronics design and the use of quantitative colorimetric readout schemes enabled by AuNF-based LFAs represent two essential features of the technology that are advantages relative to other approaches. The timing circuit and chronosampling valves both enable time-resolved sampling and quantification of sweat cortisol. The circuit autonomously controls sweat stimulation and sampling over extended periods, while the valves support short-term electronics-free operation and compatibility with natural modes of sweating. These two strategies provide complementary options for dynamic sweat monitoring across different use-case scenarios. Comprehensive benchtop studies with artificial sweat provide a basis for understanding all aspects of the operation and for optimizing essential design choices. Human participant studies, including quantitative correlations with concentrations of cortisol measured in saliva and serum using conventional techniques, confirm the practical value of the technology. Additional physiological studies demonstrate the ability to track circadian rhythms, monitor responses to acute stresses (such as those induced by CPTs) and determine the effects of jet lag on circadian misalignment. Potential applications span these scenarios and others, where elevated cortisol levels—particularly those that are persistent—can guide therapeutic intervention. Combination of this platform with biophysical monitoring systems26,27 will extend the capabilities to develop a more comprehensive understanding of stress. Extensions of this type of wearable LFA technology may allow for evaluation of the concentrations of other biochemical species of interest in sweat.

Human trials were approved by the Institutional Review Board (STU00220834) at Northwestern University and all participants gave complete, informed, signed consent before participating in the on-body experiments. All 13 human participants (nine males and four females) from the laboratory participated randomly in the experiments based on no specific selection criteria and no compensation. A priori power analysis for a two-tailed bivariate normal model correlation indicated that the minimum sample size to yield a statistical power of at least 0.8 with an alpha of 0.05 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.7 was 13 for Fig. 6d (26 datapoints) and Fig. 6l (33 datapoints).

A 25-mM solution of 4-aminobenzene-1-thiol (ABT) in 95% ethanol was added to 10 mM HAuCl4 solution containing 0.001% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in ultrapure water with a reaction ratio of 1 to 9 (vol/vol). The resulting mixture turned purple-brown within 10 s. Afterward, the mixtures were triple-washed with centrifugations at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 min to remove excess reagents.

The preparation of AuNF–Ab conjugates began by sonicating a solution of AuNFs for 10 s to disperse the material evenly within the tube. Conjugation of antibody to the AuNFs involved mixing 200 μl AuNF stock solution with 800 μl borate buffer (5 mM) and adding 0.5 μl anti-cortisol antibody (1.16 mg ml−1). The borate buffer (5 mM) was obtained by diluting 20 mM borate buffer in deionized water (2% vol borate buffer in deionized water). After ensuring complete mixing, the mixture was incubated for 2 h in a rotating mixer at 10 r.p.m. and then left undisturbed for an additional 5 min at room temperature. At this stage, AuNFs were bound with antibodies. Adding 100 μl 1% BSA solution to the mixture, followed by subsequent incubation for 1 h in a rotating mixer at 10 r.p.m., blocked the unbound surfaces of the AuNFs. After 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 2,500g for 35 min at 4 °C and washed with 1 ml borate buffer (5 mM) three times for complete removal of the supernatant. After final centrifugation, the precipitate was reconstituted in 100 μl 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C until later use.

The sample pad (2.0 mm × 1.5 mm) was treated with 2 μl buffer (pH 6.5) and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 10 min. The sample pad was designed with a staircase structure to facilitate efficient sweat absorption and transport towards the assay components. To reduce non-specific biofouling of AuNF–Ab conjugates, the conjugate pad was initially impregnated with 5 μl of a working buffer containing 30% (wt/vol) BSA and Tween 20 and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, AuNF–Ab conjugates were deposited onto the conjugate pad at a volume of 2 μl and dried under the same conditions.

Nitrocellulose membranes were miniaturized for wearable implementation and cut into 2-mm-wide pieces using an infrared laser (LPKF) before assembly into standard LFA cassettes. The test line reagent comprised BSA–CTS at a 1/8 dilution factor with a final concentration of 0.125 mg ml−1, whereas the control line contained an anti-mouse IgG antibody at 1 mg ml−1. Both reagents were dispensed onto the nitrocellulose membrane using predefined parameters, including a dispensing volume of 0.325 μl mm−1 and a speed of 100 mm s−1, followed by drying in a vacuum chamber at room temperature for 20 min. The test and control lines were spaced 5 mm apart for optimal visualization and signal differentiation.

The preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces involved fluorine plasma treatment using a deep reactive-ion etching system (SPTS). The PET substrate with a thin layer of adhesive (FLX000464; Flexcon) was placed in the chamber with the adhesive side facing up, followed by evacuation to a pressure of 1.6 Pa. CF4 gas was then introduced at a flow rate of 50 sccm, with a glow discharge at 200 W for 2 min.

Dropcasting 1.5 μl BSA (4% wt/vol; Sigma–Aldrich) solution onto the designated valve location in the cellulose paper completed the preparation of BSA-gated paper-based microfluidic delay valves, followed by drying under vacuum for 20 min.

A 3D printer (Formlabs) created the guide jig for the alignment and assembly of different layers. The sequential assembly of the chamber wall, PET substrate, skin adhesive and cellulose collection paper was conducted by aligning the edges of each layer using the 3D-printed guide jig. LFA components and covers were assembled by flipping the device and assembling from the opposite side. Assembly of system was complete after all four LFA modules were placed in the chamber and covered by the superhydrophilic viewing window.

Electrochromic timers were assembled as a two-terminal electrochemical cell wherein polyaniline served as the cathode, nickel metal served as the anode and human sweat acted as an electrolyte. Timing elements were fabricated from thin-film Au electrodes supported on flexible polyimide, as follows. Substrate materials were initially prepared by electron beam deposition of metal films (100 nm Au, with a 20-nm Cr adhesion layer; AJA International) onto a large polyimide substrate (75 µm thickness; surface area: ~700 cm2) whose surface was cleaned (sequential rinsing with water and isopropanol) and treated with ultraviolet ozone (UVOCS; 5 min). Deposition was performed at a constant rate of 1 Å s−1. Following deposition, electrode traces were patterned using an ultraviolet laser micromachining system (ProtoLaser U4; LPKF Laser and Electronics SE) at an output power of 0.5 W in a single pass. This laser power was sufficient to affect the complete ablation of the Au/Cr layer along the cutting path, with little damage to the underlying polyimide substrate. Arrays of eight timers were patterned in this fashion in preparation for subsequent chemical treatment by electrodeposition.

The high reflectivity of gold electrodes before roughening places tight constraints on both the lighting and the view angle as ambient reflections strongly impact the apparent electrode colour. Roughening the surfaces of these electrodes reduces the reflectivity and facilitates the angle-independent extraction of colour information, thereby improving the timing reliability. Cathode preparation began with the application of a roughened Au layer to reduce the reflectivity of the bare Au substrate. Rough gold was deposited by cyclic voltammetry between −1.8 and 0.2 V (scan rate: 0.5 V s−1) from a 10-mM solution of HAuCl4 in 2.5 M NH4Cl supporting electrolyte using an Au slug as the counter and reference electrode28. A total of 25 cycles were applied, pausing every five cycles to mix the electrolyte solution with a pipette to reduce the accumulation of bubbles on the electrode surface. Following roughening, polyaniline was deposited from a monomer solution of 0.5 M aniline in 1 M H2SO4 by the application of a constant reducing current of 50 µA for 400 s using an Au slug as the counter electrode and a double-junction Ag/AgCl electrode (BASI) as the reference. To ensure even and dark coloration of polyaniline cathodes, electrodes were subsequently oxidized by polarization to 0.4 V in pH 4.5 solution before cutout and assembly (again using Ag/AgCl as the reference and Au as the counter electrode).

Nickel anodes were applied by electrodeposition from a commercially available bright nickel plating bath (Gold Plating Services) by the application of a reducing potential of −1.5 V versus Ni metal for 120 s using an Ni wire as the counter and reference electrode. Following electrodeposition, individual timers were cut from the substrate (ProtoLaser U4; 0.5 W; 30 repetitions) for integration with the paper-based microfluidic assembly.

Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics, employing tetrahedral mesh elements for all of the computational analyses. A refined mesh with feature sizes smaller than one-fifth of the electrode width was adopted to ensure accuracy. The numerical solver dynamically controlled time step sizes through backward differentiation formulas, with the initial step sizes kept small to prevent singularity. The total current was applied to the anode during stimulation, whereas zero external electric potential was applied to the cathode. The material properties and key parameters used in the simulation included: a skin conductivity σ of 0.026 S m−1 (ref. 29); a diffusion coefficient D of 14.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 (ref. 30); a reaction rate constant k of 0.05 min−1; an initial carbachol concentration c0 in the carbagel of 1%; a sweat rate coefficient ζ/c0 of 40 μl min−1; a critical concentration ct/c0 of 0.004; and a saturation concentration cmax/c0 of 0.025.

Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics31,32. Darcy's law interface23 was utilized to describe the fluid flow through the filter paper (porous medium). The mass source was utilized to describe the inlet flow rate qin of 1 μl min−1 in the centre circle. A no-flow condition was applied across the vertical boundaries, whereas the upper and lower boundaries were set to a zero-pressure outlet condition. The phase transport in the porous medium interface was employed to define the water saturation phenomenon within the filter paper. The Brooks and Corey model33 was utilized to model the capillary pressure in two-phase flow, denoting the entry capillary pressure as pec = \(\frac{2\gamma \cos \theta }{{r}_{\rm{c}}}\) 34, where γ is the surface tension, rc is the pore radius and θ is the contact angle measured from the experiments, dependent on the BSA concentration φ. To define the BSA dissolution mechanism, the Nernst–Brunner equation35 was utilized, combined with the water fraction s in the filter paper: \(\frac{\Delta \varphi }{\Delta t}\) = −χφs, where φ is the BSA concentration and χ is the dissolution rate constant. The domain ordinary differential equation and differential algebraic equation interface was employed to describe the BSA dissolution. The material properties and key parameters used in the simulation included: a paper porosity ε of 0.8; a pore radius rc of 1 μm; a surface tension γ of 72.3 mN m−1; a pore size distribution index λp of 2; a permeability K of 1 × 10−13 m−2; and a dissolution rate constant χ of 1.8% min−1.

A 3D printer (Formlabs) created the sandwich mould for baking the encapsulation layer. Smooth-On Dragon Skin 10 (with a mixing ratio of 1:1) was poured into the mould, degassed in a vacuum chamber for 30 min and baked in a 75 °C oven for 3 h.

Five healthy volunteers (four male and one female) with regular sleep–wake rhythms participated in a diurnal cortisol cycle test. Participants did not have any food intake for at least 60 min before each testing. The on-body testing comprised sweat stimulation sessions throughout three consecutive days, including: (1) day one at 17:00; (2) day two at 09:30, 12:00, 14:30 and 17:00; and (3) day three at 09:00. After sanitizing the forearm, sweat was stimulated and collected simultaneously by the iontophoresis-integrated LFA device, where 130-μA current was applied for 5 min. Saliva samples were collected immediately after the sweat stimulation and stored under −18 °C until further use. The image of the LFA assay was taken with an RGB Calibrate ColorChecker 24 (Classic Nano; 24 mm × 40 mm) 1 h after the complete wetting of the LFA strip.

For saliva collection, volunteers thoroughly rinsed their mouth with water 15 min before collection. A saliva salivate (Sarstedt) was used to collect saliva samples by keeping a cotton swab inside the mouth for 5 min. The participants avoided chewing the swab during collection. After 5 min, the cotton swab was returned to the salivate and centrifuged for 2 min at 2,000g. The supernatant of saliva sample was then collected using a pipette and stored in a −18 °C freezer until use.

Five healthy volunteers (four males and one female) participated in the standard CPT in the afternoon (between 15:00 and 17:00) to avoid the effect of diurnal cortisol cycle variation. The CPT began with an initial sweat collection session through iontophoresis on the forearm of the dominant hand for 5 min. At the same time, capillary blood samples were collected from the non-dominant hand for the purpose of baseline blood cortisol concentration determination. After baseline sample collection, the iontophoresis device with a timer was turned on for sequential sweat stimulation. Immediately after the initial iontophoresis, volunteers immersed the dominant hand wearing the integrated LFA device into the icy cold water (2 °C) and removed the hand after 3 min. Fresh capillary blood was collected from the non-dominant hand at different stages synchronized with iontophoresis time (immediately after the CPT, at 20 min and at 40 min).

For capillary blood collection, an alcohol pad was used to sanitize the volunteer's fingers before collection. A 21-G lancet punctured the sanitized finger to draw blood droplets. A 15-μl capillary blood collection tube (PTS Diagnostics) was used to collect blood droplets of over 50 μl into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtube. The collected blood sample was set aside for 40 min at room temperature for blood clotting. After 40 min resting, the blood sample was centrifuged at 2,000g for 15 min to separate the serum from the clotted white and red blood cells. The supernatant serum was collected in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtube and stored in a −18 °C freezer until use.

Four healthy volunteers (three males and one female) participated in the jet lag study. All volunteers experienced a time difference of more than eight hours, as well as varying degrees of jet lag symptoms. All volunteers took flights from the USA to East Asia and stayed there for more than two weeks. Before travel, baseline sweat cortisol concentrations were quantified using the LFA device in the morning (09:30) and afternoon (16:00). For two participants, capillary blood samples were collected at the same time, with sweat cortisol measurement. Likewise, sweat and blood samples were collected and measured in the morning (09:30) and afternoon (16:00) on the first and twelfth day after the return flight.

All statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro (version 2022; OriginLab) and G*Power 3.1.9. For Fig. 2c, four different batches were imaged to characterize the shape and size of the AuNFs. The selected image is representative of approximately 85 nanoparticles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Hundreds of Millions of Audio Devices Need a Patch to Prevent Wireless Hacking and Tracking","https://www.wired.com/story/google-fast-pair-bluetooth-audio-accessories-vulnerability-patches/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

Google designed the wireless protocol known as Fast Pair to optimize for ultra-convenient connections: It lets users connect their Bluetooth gadgets with Android and ChromeOS devices in a single tap. Now one group of researchers has discovered that the same protocol can also enable hackers to connect with that same seamless convenience to hundreds of millions of earbuds, headphones, and speakers. The result is an enormous collection of Fast Pair-compatible audio devices that allow any spy or stalker to take control of speakers and microphones, or in some cases track an unwitting target's location—even if the victim is an iPhone user who has never owned a Google product.

Today, security researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group are revealing a collection of vulnerabilities they found in 17 audio accessories that use Google's Fast Pair protocol and are sold by 10 different companies: Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech, and Google itself. The hacking techniques the researchers demonstrated, which they're collectively calling WhisperPair, would allow anyone within Bluetooth range of those devices—close to 50 feet in their testing—to silently pair with audio peripherals and hijack them.

Depending on the accessory, a hacker could take over or disrupt audio streams or phone conversations, play their own audio through the victim's ear buds or speakers at whatever volume they chose, or undetectably take over microphones to listen to the victim's surroundings. Worse yet, certain devices sold by Google and Sony that are compatible with Google's device geolocation tracking feature, Find Hub, could also be exploited to allow stealthy, high-resolution stalking.

“You're walking down the street with your headphones on, you're listening to some music. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,” says KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta. “Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. I can inject audio. I can track your location.”

“The attacker now owns this device,” adds researcher Nikola Antonijević, “and can basically do whatever he wants with it.”

The researchers demonstrate their hacking and tracking techniques in the video below:

Google today published a security advisory in coordination with the researchers, acknowledging their findings and describing its efforts to fix the problem. Since the researchers first disclosed their work to the company in August, they say, Google appears to have alerted at least some of the vendors of vulnerable devices, many of whom have made security updates available. However, given that very few consumers ever think about updating the software of internet-of-things devices like headphones, earbuds, or speakers, the KU Leuven researchers warn that the WhisperPair vulnerabilities may still persist in vulnerable accessories for months or years to come.

In most cases, applying those updates requires installing a manufacturer app on a phone or computer—a step most users never take and often aren't even aware is necessary. “If you don't have the app of Sony, then you'll never know that there's a software update for your Sony headphones,” says KU Leuven researcher Seppe Wyns. “And then you'll still be vulnerable.”

When WIRED reached out to Google, a spokesperson responded in a statement thanking the researchers and confirming their WhisperPair findings. “We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting,” the spokesperson writes. “We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.”

Google also noted that it's pushed out fixes for its own vulnerable audio accessories and an update to Find Hub in Android that the company says prevents rogue actors from using WhisperPair to track victims. Within hours of Google informing the researchers about that fix, however, they told WIRED that they had found a bypass for the patch and were still able to carry out their Find Hub tracking technique. Google didn't immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment on the researchers' bypass of its patch.

As for Google's statement that it hadn't seen exploitation of the WhisperPair vulnerability in the wild, the researchers note that Google would have no way to observe audio accessory hijacking that didn't involve Google devices.

WIRED also reached out to all nine other companies whose accessories the KU Leuven researchers determined to be vulnerable. Xiaomi responded in a statement that it “has been in communication with Google and other relevant parties and is working with suppliers to roll out [over-the-air] updates” to its Redmi brand of earbuds. JBL, which is owned by Harman Audio, said in a statement that “Google has advised JBL about potential security vulnerabilities that could impact devices including headphones and speakers. We have received the security patches from Google and the software will be updated via JBL apps over the next few weeks.”

Jabra responded in a statement that it had pushed out patches for Bluetooth vulnerabilities in the Airoha chipset it uses in its accessories in June and July. Given that the researchers didn't tell anyone about their findings until August, however, they suggest that Jabra may be confusing their work with unrelated findings from June.

Logitech said it has “integrated a firmware patch for upcoming production units,” and points out that its affected device, the Wonderboom 4 speaker, doesn't have a microphone that could be used for eavesdropping. OnePlus told WIRED that the company is looking into the issue. Marshall, Nothing, and Sony didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment.

The researchers' WhisperPair attack takes advantage of a collection of flaws in the implementation of Fast Pair in the devices the team checked. Most fundamentally, Google's specification for Fast Pair devices states that they shouldn't be able to pair with a new computer or phone while already paired. But for the 17 vulnerable devices, anyone can silently pair with the target device, even if it's already paired.

Using the Fast Pair vulnerabilities the researchers discovered, an attacker would only need to be in Bluetooth range and obtain a so-called Model ID value that's specific to the target device model. The researchers note that these Model IDs can be obtained if an attacker owns or purchases a device of the same model as the target's. They note, too, that in some cases, this ID is shared by the device when a computer or phone attempts to pair with it. And in addition to both of these methods of obtaining the right Model ID for a target device, the researchers also found that they could query a publicly available Google API for every possible Model ID and determine them for all devices.

In their experiments, the KU Leuven team used a low-cost Raspberry Pi 4 minicomputer to test their technique, attempting to pair with 25 different already-paired Fast Pair devices from 16 different vendors, and found that the majority of the devices and vendors they tested were vulnerable. They carried out their pairing techniques from about 14 meters (about 46 feet) from the target—though they think that greater distances would likely be possible—and the takeovers took between 10 and 15 seconds, they say.

The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds and five models of Sony earbuds and headphones they tested also suffered from a distinct, disturbing security issue. If the devices weren't previously linked to a Google account—say, because they were used only with an iPhone—then a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the target accessory, but also link it to their Google account. Google's system is designed to identify the first Android device that pairs with the headphones, or other peripherals, as their owner. That trick would allow the hacker to use Google's Find Hub feature, which tracks the device's geolocation based on its connections to surrounding devices, and follow the target user's movements. “That means that I can now see your device in my Find Hub network wherever you go, at all times,” says Duttagupta.

With that tracking technique, the victim might at some point get a smartphone notification that a Find Hub device was tracking them, thanks to safety features designed by Google and Apple to prevent Find Hub devices from being used to follow an unwitting victim. But any victim who followed up on the alert would see that Google or Apple was warning them that it was their own device tracking them and likely assume the alert was just a glitch, the researchers argue.

For all of these issues, there's no easy change in the settings of accessories that users can make to protect themselves. “There's no way to turn Fast Pair off, even if you'll never use it,” says Wyns. “You can factory-reset your device, and that will clear the attacker's access, so they will have to do the attack again, but it's enabled by default on all of the supported devices.”

The WhisperPair vulnerabilities seem to have emerged from a complex and interrelated set of problems. The researchers point out that it is common for both peripherals manufacturers and chipmakers to make mistakes in implementing the Fast Pair technical standard. Not all of these flaws result in security vulnerabilities, but the extent of the confusion raises questions about the strength of the standard, the researchers say.

Google offers a Validator App through the Play Store that vendors have to run as part of getting their products certified to use Fast Pair. According to its description, the app “validates that Fast Pair has been properly implemented on a Bluetooth device,” producing reports on whether a product has passed or failed an evaluation of its Fast Pair implementation. The researchers point out that all of the devices they tested in their work had their Fast Pair implementation certified by Google. That means, presumably, that Google's app categorized them as passing its requirements, even though their implementations had dangerous flaws. On top of this, certified Fast Pass devices then go through testing in labs Google selects that review pass reports and then directly evaluate physical device samples before large-scale manufacturing to confirm that they align with the Fast Pair standard.

Google says that the Fast Pair specification provided clear requirements and that the Validator App was designed mainly as a supportive tool for manufacturers to test core functionality. Following the KU Leuven researchers' disclosure, the company says it added new implementation tests specifically geared toward Fast Pair requirements.

Ultimately, the researchers say, it is difficult to determine whether the implementation issues that led to the WhisperPair vulnerabilities came from mistakes on the part of device manufacturers or chipmakers.

WIRED reached out to all the chipmakers who manufacture the chipsets used by the vulnerable audio accessories—Actions, Airoha, Bestechnic, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Realtek—but none responded. In its comments to WIRED, Xiaomi noted, “We have confirmed internally that the issue you referenced was caused by a non-standard configuration by chip suppliers in relation to the Google Fast Pair protocol.” Airoha is the maker of the chip used in the Redmi Buds 5 Pro that the researchers identified as vulnerable.

Regardless of who is at fault for the WhisperPair vulnerabilities, the researchers emphasize that one conceptually simple change to the Fast Pair specification would address the more fundamental issue behind WhisperPair: Fast Pair should cryptographically enforce the accessory owner's intended pairings and not allow a secondary, rogue “owner” to pair without authentication.

For now, Google and many device manufacturers have software updates ready to fix the specific vulnerabilities. But installations of those patches are likely to be inconsistent, as it almost always is in internet-of-things security. The researchers urge all users to update their vulnerable accessories, and they point users to a website they created that provides a searchable list of devices affected by WhisperPair. For that matter, they say that everyone should use WhisperPair as a more general reminder to update all of their internet-of-things devices.

The broader message of their research, they say, is that device manufacturers need to prioritize security when adding ease-of-use features. After all, the Bluetooth protocol itself contained none of the vulnerabilities they've discovered—only the one-tap protocol Google built on top of it to make pairing more convenient.

“Yes, we want to make our life easier and make our devices function more seamlessly,” says Antonijević. “Convenience doesn't immediately mean less secure. But in pursuit of convenience, we should not neglect security.”

In 2010, the FBI sent Wikipedia a letter that would be intimidating for any organization to receive.

The missive demanded that the free online encyclopedia remove the FBI's logo from an entry about the agency, claiming that reproducing the emblem was illegal and punishable with fines, imprisonment, “or both.” Rather than back down, a lawyer for the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts Wikipedia, shot back a sharp refusal outlining how the FBI's interpretation of the relevant statute was incorrect and saying that Wikipedia was “prepared to argue our view in court.” It worked—the FBI dropped the matter.

But the spat presupposed a society based on the rule of law, where a government agency would hear a legal argument in good faith rather than overriding it with power. Fast-forward to the present day, and things are very different. Elon Musk has dubbed the site “Wokepedia” and alleged that it's controlled by far-left activists. Last fall, Tucker Carlson devoted an entire 90-minute podcast to railing against Wikipedia as “completely dishonest and completely controlled on questions that matter.” And after Republican congresspeople James Comer and Nancy Mace accused Wikipedia of “information manipulation” in a congressional investigation, the foundation replied with a respectful explainer about how Wikipedia works, taking a more conciliatory approach rather than arguing about government overreach. The pragmatic shift reflects a world where the Trump administration selects winners and losers based on political preference.

As the world's most famous free internet encyclopedia turns 25 today, it's facing a host of challenges. Forces on the political right have attacked Wikipedia for alleged liberal bias, with the conservative Heritage Foundation going so far as to say that it will “identify and target” the site's volunteer editors. AI bots have relentlessly scraped Wikipedia's information, straining the site's servers. Compounding these issues is the struggle to replenish the project's volunteer community, the so-called graying of Wikipedia.

Beneath these threats is the foreboding feeling that the culture has drifted away from Wikipedia's founding ideals. Aiming for neutrality, evaluating sources, volunteering for the public benefit, sustaining a noncommercial online project, these concepts seem at best old-fashioned and at worst useless in today's overtly partisan, lawless, antihuman, “greed is good” phase of the internet.

Still, there remains the possibility that Wikipedia's most influential days lie in its future, assuming it recasts itself inside the crucible.

Bernadette Meehan, Wikimedia Foundation's new CEO, whose résumé includes stints as a foreign service officer and ambassador, is well poised to meet these attacks, according to chief communications officer Anusha Alikhan. “The diplomacy and negotiation skills are things that I think will lend well to the current environment,” she told WIRED. But even the best diplomat would struggle with the current slate of challenges: The UK has proposed age-gating Wikipedia under its Online Safety Act. In Saudi Arabia, Wikipedia editors have been imprisoned after documenting the country's human rights abuses on the platform. And the Great Firewall continues to block every version of the site for mainland China.

What's perhaps more telling is that even inside the Wikipedia community, longtime contributors are worried about its diminishing relevance. In a widely circulated essay, veteran editor Christopher Henner said he fears that Wikipedia will increasingly become a “temple” filled with aging volunteers, self-satisfied by work nobody looks at anymore.

Beyond these ongoing censorship battles, Wikipedia is also struggling to explain why human labor still matters in the age of artificial intelligence. Although nearly every major AI system trains on Wikipedia's freely-licensed content, the tech industry's message since 2022 has been that human-powered knowledge production has been rendered irrelevant by AI. Except that's not true. While we are still in the early days of the AI revolution, it seems for now that AI applications perform better when they are trained on human-written and human-vetted information, the kind that comes from human-centered editorial processes like Wikipedia's. When an AI system trains recursively on its own AI-generated synthetic data, it is likely to suffer from model collapse.

Given this symbiotic relationship, it is deeply ironic that AI companies have soaring stock prices while Wikipedia itself appears to have lost more than a billion visits per month between 2022 and 2025. No doubt this is caused in part by a shift in consumer preferences; instead of going to Wikipedia articles directly, people are consuming its information in fragments delivered by AI chatbots. The shuttering of local news organizations has worsened the problem because it leaves Wikipedia editors with fewer reliable sources to do the work of building out the encyclopedia. Wikipedia's message to tech companies is simple: If you rely on its content, please support the system that helps sustain it.

But even if Google and Meta chip in to provide financial support for Wikipedia's APIs, that doesn't address the project's most crucial resource—the volunteers. Between 2016 and 2025, new user registrations dropped by more than a third, according to Wikimedia Statistics. As Henner, the longtime volunteer, said in his essay, “The data is clear: We're losing new editors. The website that built our community is no longer attracting contributors at sufficient rates.” To improve Wikipedia's visibility to younger audiences, it launched a short-form video initiative in October 2024 that has so far published more than 800 videos and racked up 23 million views across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, according to a Foundation representative. The popular social media account Depths of Wikipedia, run by independent creator Annie Rauwerda, proves that people love the site's bottomless trove of quirky knowledge. Whether that affection translates into new editors remains to be seen.

It's worth remembering that when Wikipedia launched in 2001, the internet wasn't the attention-economy hellscape we scroll through today. In fact, part of the reason Wikipedia feels somewhat refreshing, as well as a bit quaint, in 2026 is that it's a rare noncommercialized corner of the internet without ads and algorithmic surveillance. Then again, it's likely that Gen Z, which grew up with an internet full of influencers and sponsored content, views Wikipedia's nonprofit spirit with higher skepticism. Millennials like Steven Pruitt took up Wikipedia-editing during the Great Recession as a fun hobby to fill their free time, but years of hypercapitalism and economic precarity have trained many Gen Zers to see any unpaid labor as a scam. It's all a matter of perspective. For some, editing Wikipedia is a noble cause that helps build a more trustworthy internet. For others, it's thankless work that AI companies strip-mine for a profit. At least making TikToks offers the potential for monetization.

Hannah Clover, the youngest-ever “Wikimedian of the Year,” has become a de facto spokesperson for the cohort of Wikipedia's Gen Z editors. The 23-year-old Canadian told WIRED many older people do not understand the challenges faced by her generation. “A lot of us are just trying to pay our rent and do our best to live through a cost-of-living crisis,” she said. A few years ago, Clover was working at McDonald's, editing Wikipedia from her mobile phone during her shift breaks and while commuting on the bus. Beyond the economic challenges, Clover said her generation struggles with angst about climate change, feeling positive about the future, and finding an overall sense of purpose. “Quite a lot of people want to hope for a better future, they're just not sure how they can personally make a difference,” she said. “Editing Wikipedia was quite a game changer for me in this capacity, but I also can't fault anyone who just wants to use their limited free time to relax in another way that isn't quite as mentally taxing.”

Back in October, when Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was asked about Musk's new Grokipedia, he said, “We'll still be here in 100 years, and he won't.” And to be fair, Wikipedia's demise has been predicted before, and it has withstood a long line of failed prognosticators and challengers, including Google's Knol, Citizendium, and Everipedia. As Wikipedia crosses the quarter-century mark, one possible outcome is that it continues to serve as a key knowledge base for humans that's likewise guiding AI systems. But let's be clear: Wikipedia isn't too big to fail. If volunteers keep dropping off, if people only complain about Wikipedia without once trying to edit it, then donations alone won't move the needle.

Because whether Wikipedia finds a path forward as a high-quality, human-powered project isn't ultimately up to Musk or Wales or Google Gemini. We, the people, can choose to support the commons—or we can let it die.

The embattled Tea app is back.

Months after being removed from Apple's App Store in light of major data breaches, the app that allows women to share anonymous Yelp-style reviews of men is relaunching with a new website designed to help women “access dating guardrails without limitation,” Tea's head of trust and safety Jessica Dees told WIRED.

The app, which launched in 2023 and went viral last summer, getting to number 1 on the iOS App Store, lets users post photos of men while also pointing out red flags, such as if they are already partnered or registered sex offenders. But just as its popularity skyrocketed, it suffered from data leaks that exposed users' personal information. While the company claims it has boosted its security features, experts tell WIRED there's still plenty of reason to be cautious.

The new site features “meaningful improvements” intended to bolster security, including “tightening internal safeguards, reinforcing access controls, and expanding review and monitoring processes to better protect sensitive information,” Dees claimed in an email. The company has also partnered with a third-party verification vendor to ensure that users are women—part of an “eligibility check.” During the sign-up process users are given the option to take a selfie video recording or submit a selfie photo with a government ID, which is then processed by the third-party system. “Our community's trust is something we treat with real seriousness and we've invested deeply in building the right expertise and systems,” Dees said.

In addition to the website, Tea has added new features on its Android app, including an in-app AI dating coach that provides advice for different dating scenarios and a chat analysis capability, called Red Flag Radar AI, set to launch in the coming months, that can surface potential warning signs in suitors. “In both cases, AI is designed to supplement community insight and can help inform a community member's point of view on something they might not be sure about,” Dees said. (Tea remains unavailable in the Apple App Store.)

Tea's founder, Sean Cook, created the app after the “terrifying” online dating experience his mother had gone through—she was catfished and “unknowingly” communicated with “men who had criminal records,” according to the site. In a news release, the company said, “Tea's rapid rise has brought the complexities of online dating into the global cultural conversation.”

On July 25, Tea suffered a data breach that revealed users' photos, driver's licenses, home addresses, direct messages, and other private documentation, 404 Media first reported. The leak, according to a statement from the company, exposed 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and photos of people's IDs, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages, some of which were posted on 4Chan and Reddit. Days later, 404 Media reported a second breach affecting 1.1 million users, exposing “messages between users discussing abortions, cheating partners, and phone numbers they sent to one another,” putting the safety and privacy of its women users at even greater risk.

The controversy sparked a fierce debate online about privacy rights and gender-based violence women are often subjected to while using dating apps. It also led to the creation of TeaOnHer, a rival male version of the Tea app that lets men post anonymously about women. Both apps were removed from the App Store following complaints about policy violations, privacy concerns, and content moderation issues. Tea was slapped with 10 potential class action lawsuits in federal and state courts, alleging breach of implied contract and negligence. In one of the lawsuits, a woman alleged that Tea failed “to properly secure and safeguard … personally identifiable information.”

Dees said she wants the launch of the new site to help put that chapter behind them. “The relaunch reflects a focused effort to broaden access to Tea's safety and verification tools while deepening accountability across the platform,” she said, adding that “the need for safety-focused dating tools remains real and urgent.”

According to multiple studies, women are disproportionately impacted by the risks of online dating, often encountering physical harm. But while whisper networks can be vital tools to help keep women safe when navigating the dating wilds, apps like Tea are often less effective than IRL communication because they lack “situational trust and/or relationship building,” said Carrie Ann Johnson, an assistant professor of women's and gender studies at Iowa State University. “I hope women think hard before sending in their photos or information to them. Tea will likely still be successful, but they should not be trusted like a whisper network because they are not providing one.” To reestablish user trust, she said, “they need to be absolutely clear about what they can reasonably protect and give strong warnings about what people should and should not share on a public site, even with protections.”

In terms of mitigating risk and future breaches, websites are equally as vulnerable to harm as apps, “and unfortunately this particular app has inflamed a lot of people, which makes it a target,” software security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh said. Leitschuh was recently served ads on Instagram for Tea Checker, a rival app that lets men “discreetly” find out if they have been posted on Tea. “An important question to ask is if Tea has had an external entity come in and do an audit of their software stack to see if there's any vulnerabilities that are immediately apparent. If they've had a pen test, that would significantly incline them towards a better news outcome next round.” Penetration tests, or pen tests, are simulated cyberattacks that companies undergo to repair security weaknesses and improve their computer systems; among security professionals they are considered more comprehensive than vulnerability assessments.

Dees said the company has completed and continues to “actively conduct penetration testing at the infrastructure level, and the web app is protected by enterprise-grade platform security and backend controls.”

Considering potential legal concerns, Tea said it will monitor and moderate unchecked allegations made by users.

“If there are disputes, we offer non-Tea users a way to request a moderation review through a process explained on our website. We will intervene if there is a pattern of harassment, sexually explicit photos, or if we become aware of a safety issue related to a minor,” Dees said. “We believe in the right of our users to share safety-related warnings grounded in their lived experiences, and we ask users to attest that they are participating in good faith.”

Thinking Machines cofounders Barret Zoph and Luke Metz are leaving the fledgling AI lab and rejoining OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker announced on Wednesday. OpenAI's CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, shared the news in a memo to staff this afternoon.

Two narratives are already forming about what prompted the departures. The news was first reported on X by technology reporter Kylie Robison, who wrote that Zoph was fired for “unethical conduct.”

A source close to Thinking Machines alleged that Zoph had shared confidential company information with competitors. WIRED was unable to verify this information with Zoph, who did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

According to the memo from Simo, Zoph told Thinking Machines CEO Mira Murati on Monday he was considering leaving. He was then fired on Wednesday. Simo went on to write that OpenAI doesn't share the same concerns about Zoph as Murati.

The personnel shake-up is a major win for OpenAI, which recently lost its VP of research, Jerry Tworek. A third Thinking Machines staffer, Sam Schoenholz, is also rejoining OpenAI, per the company's announcement.

The departures are a blow to Thinking Machines, which also lost another co-founder, Andrew Tulloch, in November when he took a new job at Meta. In a post on X, Murati confirmed Zoph's depature and said that Soumith Chintala will replace him as the startup's chief technology officer.

Zoph and Metz left OpenAI in late 2024 to start Thinking Machines with Murati, the ChatGPT maker's former chief technology officer. Zoph was previously OpenAI's vice president of post-training, where he led teams that made final improvements to AI models before they were deployed into products like ChatGPT and OpenAI's API. Metz worked at OpenAI for two years during his first stint at the company and contributed to projects like ChatGPT and the o1 AI reasoning model.

Simo told employees in her memo that Zoph will report directly to her, and Metz and Schoenholz will work under him. The hiring announcement timeline was accelerated, she said, so they still have to work out some details about their roles.

Thinking Machines Lab is one of several well-funded AI startups led by former top OpenAI researchers, reflecting the incredible appetite among investors to cash in on the AI race. Last year, Murati's startup was last valued at $12 billion, and was recently in talks to raise more than $4 billion at a $50 billion valuation. The startup's main product today is called Tinker, which allows developers to customize AI models on their own datasets.

Once you've gotten used to an air purifier, it's hard to go back to living without one. I like them in the winter because they help the air feel less stale when I can't crack my windows open. And goodness knows they're handy in the warmer months, when Mother Nature and her army of grasses and leaves threaten to make me sneeze all day long. We've hand-tested multiple models for our air purifier buying guide, and Coway's have been a consistent favorite. The brand's popular design-forward Airmega line is discounted right now up to 30 percent off—this is close to what they ran for Black Friday. The sale ends January 30, so if you regret not buying an air purifier while they were on sale during the holidays, this is your chance.

Be sure to check out our other recently updated buying guides, including the Best Ventless Fireplaces, Best Office Chairs, and Best Blenders.

Coway

The best affordable air purifier offers excellent value for the price, even when it's not on sale. This is the best price we've seen since Black Friday (and it comes within $30 of that cost), and it usually doesn't fall cheaper than it is right now outside of seasonal shopping events. It can clean a room up to 361 square feet, exchanging the air at 4.8 times per hour. We recommend running it in a slightly smaller room to allow for lower noise levels. It has a built-in timer allowing for automatic shutoff after one, four, or eight hours, and there's an Eco Mode that'll turn it off after 30 minutes without detected pollution.

We like this purifier's color-coded light, which shows blue for clean air and purple or red for different levels of pollutants based on its built-in air sensor. That sensor can also automatically adjust the Mighty's fan speed. The whole device is easy to port around, thanks to its incorporated back handle, replacement filters are inexpensive (WIRED editor Kat Merck has a Mighty and buys these), and it has a three-year warranty.

This big ol' air purifier is the most effective option we tested for homes with high ceilings. The design is a little Dune-y, but it can clean the air four times per hour in a 1,000-square-foot space if you're running it at its highest setting. It's also pretty quiet, around 50 decibels at its loudest, and there's a control panel lock to help prevent accidental setting changes.

It has Coway's air quality indicator light where blue is good and red is bad, so it's a handy way to monitor your air quality at a glance. It has three different airflow speeds and an auto mode that'll adjust fan speed as needed. The machine is heavy at 50 pounds, but it has built-in wheels and handles for easier maneuvering, plus a solid five-year warranty.

Coway

This tabletop model received an honorable mention in our air purifier buying guide—also see our in-depth review here—but it's still a decent pick for small spaces. And we mean small; following the CDC recommendation, it can effectively clean the air in a 100-square-foot space five times an hour. But it's also about the size of a roll of paper towels, and the large indicator light on top is easy to spot from across a room. There's a built-in timer and nightlight too. It's covered by a three-year warranty. If you don't need to cover a large amount of space, but you still want a little purifier for your living room, kitchen, or bedroom from a reliable, proven brand, this is a safe bet—especially at this price.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Taylor Soper on Jan 14, 2026 at 6:36 pmJanuary 15, 2026 at 9:08 am

One of Seattle's tallest skyscrapers has a new name that reflects JPMorganChase's growing banking and technology hub in Seattle.

Formerly known as the Russell Investments Center, the building at 1301 Second Ave. is now the JPMorganChase Center.

The renaming coincides with JPMorganChase adding an additional 40,000 square feet at the 42-floor tower, which also houses Zillow Group and Perkins Coie. 

The financial services giant, which now occupies 128,000 square feet, is also relocating its Seattle Tech Center from 1201 Third Ave. to the newly expanded space. 

JPMorganChase has 850 employees in Seattle, including 400 tech workers — that's up slightly from 380 people last year. 

The company's Seattle Tech Center opened in 2018, in part to tap into the region's talent pool. The center focuses on areas including cybersecurity, cloud technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It's led by Mamtha Banerjee, a computer scientist, business leader, and Seattle startup veteran.

JPMorganChase implemented a five-day in-office policy last year. It has more than 2,220 employees across 150 branches and corporate offices in Washington state. There are about 320,000 employees globally. The company recently opened a new headquarters in Manhattan.

The company also on Wednesday anounced $1.5 million in grants to five Seattle-area nonprofits: Business Impact NW, Friends of Little Saigon, Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, Seattle University's RAMP-up, and the Capitol Hill EcoDistrict program of the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle.

The office expansion comes as downtown Seattle hit another record high for vacancy rate last year at 34.7% in Q4, as hybrid work continues to weigh on the commercial real estate market. 

Zillow once filled several floors of the JPMorganChase Center but scaled down after committing to remote work during the pandemic. More than 70% of the Zillow's workforce is made up of remote employees.

Russell Investments moved its Seattle headquarters last year from 1301 Second Ave. to nearby Rainier Square.

Seattle-area startup Included announced Wednesday that it has been acquired by Phenom, a global human resources company based in Pennsylvania. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Included launched five years ago in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the widespread move by companies nationwide to better support racial and ethnic diversity throughout their operations. The startup initially focused its data analytics on DEI-related efforts, but expanded to support employee retention and engagement, faster hiring timelines, and managing performance evaluations.

Raghu Gollamudi, Included's co-founder and CEO, called the acquisition “a major accelerator for our vision.”  

“By integrating Included into Phenom's Applied AI platform, we'll bring more Native AI and Agentic AI into people analytics — so teams can move from static dashboards to insights that are timely, actionable, and embedded in how work actually happens,” Gollamudi said on LinkedIn. 

Included has less than 15 employees, according to LinkedIn data. Jennifer Lyons, spokesperson for Phenom, said via email that “a majority of Included employees have become Phenom employees.”

She added that Included will not continue as a standalone brand. “Phenom has a successful history of natively integrating acquisitions into our broader Applied AI platform,” she said. “This approach helps existing customers of both companies succeed.” 

Included was created by a trio of co-founders:

Included raised $7.3 million from investors that include FlyingFish, SignalFire, Ascend, Trilogy Equity Partners and Alumni Ventures.

While Phenom would not provide details on the deal, Lyons said, “Investors are pleased.”

Editor's note: Story updated Jan. 15 to correct the funding total and include comments from Phenom regarding the status of former Included employees, Included's integration and investor response.

MontyCloud, a Redmond, Wash.-based startup that helps companies optimize their cloud operations, raised a fresh Series B round to fuel growth. 

The company announced the funding in a press release this week but did not reveal the amount raised. A new SEC filing shows $11.4 million raised. We've reached out to the company for details. 

Founded in 2018, MontyCloud builds software that helps companies run and control their cloud infrastructure automatically, from enforcing governance policies to optimizing cloud spend. MontyCloud is part of a broader push to use AI not just for apps, but for automating back-end IT operations.

The company says cloud spend under management has grown more than 400% over two years, with recurring revenue nearly tripling (both measured by compound annual growth). MontyCloud targets Managed Service Providers (MSPs) as well as enterprise companies.

The latest round was led by Riverside Acceleration Capital. Other backers include Lytical Ventures, S3 Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, and Raptor Group.

MontyCloud is led by CEO Walter Rogers, a tech industry vet who joined the company in 2022. The company was founded by Venkat Krishnamachari, chief product officer, and Kannan Parthasarathy, chief technology officer.

“Our growth reflects a fundamental shift in how organizations approach CloudOps,” Rogers said in a statement. “The industry is moving away from manual processes and fragmented tools toward a model that enables teams to optimize and operate cloud environments while unlocking new opportunities to monetize CloudOps.”

MontyCloud has 85 employees, with a majority based in India, according to LinkedIn.

Just when you thought the circular deals couldn't get any more circular, OpenAI has invested in CEO Sam Altman's brain computer interface (BCI) startup Merge Labs. 

Merge Labs, which defines itself as a “research lab” dedicated to “bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability,” came out of stealth on Thursday with an undisclosed seed round. A source familiar with the matter confirmed previous reports that OpenAI wrote the largest single check in Merge Labs' $250 million seed round at an $850 million valuation.

“Our individual experience of the world arises from billions of active neurons,” reads a statement from Merge Labs. “If we can interface with these neurons at scale, we could restore lost abilities, support healthier brain states, deepen our connection with each other, and expand what we can imagine and create alongside advanced AI.”

Merge Labs said it intends to reach these feats noninvasively by developing “entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes” to “transit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound.” 

The move deepens Altman's competition with Elon Musk, whose startup Neuralink is also developing computer interface chips that allow people who suffer from severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts. Neuralink currently requires invasive surgery for implantation, where a surgical robot removes a small piece of skull and inserts ultra-fine electrode threads into the brain to read neural signals. The company last raised a $650 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June 2025. 

While there are undoubtedly medical use cases for BCIs, Merge Labs seems more focused on using the technology to fulfill a Silicon Valley fantasy of combining human biology with AI to give us superhuman capabilities. 

“Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are an important new frontier,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “They open new ways to communicate, learn, and interact with technology. BCIs will create a natural, human-centered way for anyone to seamlessly interact with AI. This is why OpenAI is participating in Merge Labs' seed round.” 

Aside from Altman, other co-founders include Alex Blania (CEO) and Sandro Herbig (product and engineering lead) at Tools for Humanity, another Altman-backed company (and creator of the eye-scanning World orbs); Tyson Aflalo and Sumner Norman, co-founders of implantable neural tech company Forest Neurotech; and Mikhail Shapiro, a researcher at Caltech.

Blania and Herbig said in separate social media posts that they would continue their roles at Tools for Humanity. Merge Labs did not confirm whether Alfalo and Norman would maintain their positions at Forest Neurotech, only saying that the company would continue operating and will have a “wonderful working relationship” with Merge. Shapiro intends to continue teaching at Caltech.

A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the co-founders are also Merge Labs' board members.

As part of the deal, OpenAI will work with Merge Labs on scientific foundation models and other frontier tools to “accelerate progress.” In its blog post, OpenAI noted that AI will not only help accelerate R&D in bioengineering, neuroscience, and device engineering, but that the interfaces will also benefit from AI operating systems that “can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.”

In other words, Merge Labs could function as a remote control for OpenAI's software. That leads into the circular nature of the deal: If Merge Labs succeeds, it could drive more users to OpenAI, which then justifies OpenAI's investment into the company. It also increases the value of a startup Altman owns using resources from a company he runs.

OpenAI is also working with Jony Ive's startup io, which it acquired last year, to produce a piece of AI hardware that doesn't rely on a screen. Recent unconfirmed leaks suggest the device might be an earbud. 

OpenAI primarily invests through the OpenAI Startup Fund, which has invested in several other startups connected to Altman, including Red Queen Bio, Rain AI, and Harvey. OpenAI has also entered into commercial agreements with startups Altman personally owns or chairs, including nuclear fusion startup Helion Energy and nuclear fission company Oklo.

Altman has been dreaming about the “merge” — the idea that humans and machines will merge — since at least 2017 when he published a blog post guessing it would happen somewhere between 2025 and 2075. He also speculated that the merge could take many forms, including plugging electrons into our brains or becoming “really close friends with a chatbot.”

He said a merge is our “best-case scenario” for humanity surviving against superintelligence AI, which he describes as a separate species that's in conflict with humans. 

“Although the merge has already begun, it's going to get a lot weirder,” Altman wrote. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.”

TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and Merge Labs for more information.

This article has been updated to confirm that Merge Labs' founders will continue work at their respective companies.

As part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.

In addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.

These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers' queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn't just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. 

The foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.

“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation's CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” 

In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site's past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia's YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.

The organization's birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.

India's top court has ruled against Tiger Global in a tax case stemming from its Flipkart exit during Walmart's 2018 takeover, a decision that strengthens New Delhi's ability to challenge offshore treaty structures and could raise tax risk for global funds counting on predictable exits from one of the world's fastest-growing major markets.

On Thursday, the Indian Supreme Court backed the tax authorities in a dispute over whether Tiger Global could use its Mauritius-based entities to claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty and avoid paying capital gains tax in India on profits linked to its exit in the Walmart–Flipkart deal. The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Rulings, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.

The ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India's hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.

In its verdict, a two-judge bench said (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India's advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.

Tiger Global first invested in India's e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with an initial $9 million investment, before increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart for about $1.4 billion in 2018.

The tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.

While selling Flipkart's stake during Walmart's $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.

The Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.

“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”

The judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, wrote on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form”, signalling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.

Tiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.

The firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.

WhatsApp is allowing AI providers to continue offering their chatbots to users with Brazilian phone numbers, days after the country's competition regulator ordered the company to suspend its new policy that bars third-party, general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the app via its business API.

Under the new policy, the company is providing a 90-day grace period starting January 15 to developers and AI providers, mandating them to cease responding to user queries on the chat app, and notify users that their chatbots won't work on WhatsApp. 

Now, Meta told developers that they don't have to notify users with Brazilian phone numbers (with code +55) of any changes or cease offering their services, per a notice to AI providers seen by TechCrunch. 

“The requirement to cease responding to user queries and implement pre-approved auto-reply language (mentioned below) before January 15, 2026, no longer applies when messaging people with a Brazil country code (+55),” the notice reads.

WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a query seeking to confirm the decision.

The policy, which goes into effect from today, impacts general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok on the platform. Notably, the policy does not stop businesses from providing customer service via bots within WhatsApp to their customers. 

In its notice, Brazil's competition agency said it would investigate if Meta's terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company's chatbot that's offered on WhatsApp.

Meta has previously provided a similar exemption to users in Italy after the country's competition agency took issue with the policy in December. Separately, the EU has also opened an antitrust investigation into the new rules.

The company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.

“These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE's probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform.”

The tech world's nonconsensual, sexualized deepfake problem is now bigger than just X.

In a letter to the leaders of X, Meta, Alphabet, Snap, Reddit, and TikTok, several U.S. senators are asking the companies to provide proof that they have “robust protections and policies” in place and to explain how they plan to curb the rise of sexualized deepfakes on their platforms.

The senators also demanded that the companies preserve all documents and information relating to the creation, detection, moderation, and monetization of sexualized, AI-generated images, as well as any related policies.

The letter comes hours after X said it updated Grok to prohibit it from making edits of real people in revealing clothing and restricted image creation and edits via Grok to paying subscribers. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

Pointing to media reports about how easily and often Grok generated sexualized and nude images of women and children, the senators pointed out that platforms' guardrails to prevent users from posting nonconsensual, sexualized imagery may not be enough.

“We recognize that many companies maintain policies against non-consensual intimate imagery and sexual exploitation, and that many AI systems claim to block explicit pornography. In practice, however, as seen in the examples above, users are finding ways around these guardrails. Or these guardrails are failing,” the letter reads.

Grok, and consequently X, have been heavily criticized for enabling this trend, but other platforms are not immune.

Deepfakes first gained popularity on Reddit, when a page displaying synthetic porn videos of celebrities went viral before the platform took it down in 2018. Sexualized deepfakes targeting celebrities and politicians have multiplied on TikTok and YouTube, though they usually originate elsewhere.

Meta's Oversight Board last year called out two cases of explicit AI images of female public figures, and the platform has had nudify apps selling ads on its services, though it did sue a company called CrushAI later. There have been multiple reports of kids spreading deepfakes of peers on Snapchat. And Telegram, which isn't included on the senators' list, has also become notorious for hosting bots built to undress photos of women.

In response to the letter, X pointed to its announcement regarding its update to Grok. 

“We do not and will not allow any non-consensual intimate media (NCIM) on Reddit, do not offer any tools capable of making it, and take proactive measures to find and remove it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Reddit strictly prohibits NCIM, including depictions that have been faked or AI-generated. We also prohibit soliciting this content from others, sharing links to “nudify” apps, or discussing how to create this content on other platforms,” the spokesperson added.

Alphabet, Snap, TikTok and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The letter demands the companies provide: 

The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

The move comes just a day after xAI's owner Elon Musk said that he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California's attorney general opened an investigation into xAI's chatbot, following mounting pressure from governments across the world incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen.

xAI has maintained that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such edits in the first place. 

The problem isn't constrained to non-consensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI's Sora 2 reportedly allowed users to generate explicit videos featuring children; Google's Nano Banana seemingly generated an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and racist videos made with Google's AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.

The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don't exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.

U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. The Take It Down Act, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of non-consensual, sexualized imagery. But a number of provisions in the law make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.

Meanwhile, a number states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed laws that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban non-consensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.

He always felt culturally like family to me. His peaks—the biting humor about corporate absurdity, the writing on systems thinking and compounding habits, the clarity about the gap between what organizations say and what they do—unquestionably made me healthier, happier, and wealthier. If you worked in tech in the 90s and 2000s, Dilbert was a shared language for everything broken about corporate life.His views, always unapologetic, became more strident over time and pushed everyone away. That also felt like family.You don't choose family, and you don't get to edit out the parts that shaped you before you understood what was happening. The racism and the provocations were always there, maybe, just quieter. The 2023 comments that ended Dilbert's newspaper run were unambiguous.For Scott, like family, I'm a better person for the contribution. I hope I can represent the good things: the humor, the clarity of thought, the compounding good habits with health and money. I can avoid the ugliness—the racism, the grievance, the need to be right at any cost.Taking inventory is harder than eulogizing or denouncing. But it's more honest.

Same to me when it comes his comics. There is an ugly part I did not like about Scott Adams but, that doesn't mean I will like his work (Dilbert) less. I have to admit it felt disappointing to find out about his vitriol online. Best wishes to his family and rest in peace for Scott. alway

reply

There are a few artists whose output I can't even enjoy any more because their vitriol became so out of control that I couldn't see their work without thinking of their awfulness, though. (Note: I'm not talking about Scott Adams. I'm honestly not that familiar with his later life social media)

reply

Thank you for at least acknowledging this.  It's valid to appreciate someone's art while disagreeing with their behavior, but it's also valid if someone's behavior sours you on their art and makes it difficult to appreciate what they've accomplished - especially if you start to recognize some of their inner ugliness in their artistic endeavors.Personally, I found that I connected with his early work a lot more than his latter work, as I found Dlibert's ""nerd slice of life"" arc a lot more compelling than his ""Office microaggression of the week"" arc.  Scott revealing his inner ugliness did not make me eager to return, but I still keep a well-worn Dlibert mouse pad on my desk that my Dad gave me as a teenager; the one that says ""Technology: No place for whimps.""Wherever Scott is now, I hope he's found peace.EDIT: A few strips that live rent-free in my head.    - https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-quest-for-randomness

I'm not sure if Adams' later real-life self-superiority and mean spiritedness evolved from that over time, or if he was always like that inside and we just didn't see it, but I find myself unable to laugh with the strips in the same way now nevertheless.

I would, for instance, watch The Ninth Gate a couple times a year if Polanski hadn't directed it, or had directed it post jail instead of hiding from justice for 25 years. Instead I watch it about twice a decade. Luke Beson is almost as problematic, and I have a hard time reconciling just how brilliant Gary Oldman is as Stansfield with how creepy the overall tone is, especially the European cut. I enjoyed that movie when I was young and had seen the American version. Trying to show it to other people (especially the Leon version) and seeing their less enthusiastic reactions made me see the balance of that story less affectionately. As well as seeing it through the lens of an adult responsible for children instead of being the child. Now I watch The Fifth Element and that's about it.

But yeah, he's generally acknowledged as a really nice guy, and also easy to work with.Weird Al Yankovic, too, is not generally considered a ""great artist"".  A funny musician who made a career making silly parody songs a few decades ago, sure, but that's not what I'd call a ""great artist"".  Again, not to denigrate his work; it was pretty funny stuff as I recall, but nothing super-amazing.By contrast, people who are generally considered the very top of their profession frequently have serious personality problems.  Kevin Spacey was considered one of the best actors in Hollywood, and look what happened to him.  Tom Cruise is generally considered one of the most talented actors of all time, and while he's amazing on-screen, he's a certifiable crackpot and mouthpiece for a dangerous cult.  Klaus Kinski was also an extremely talented actor, and also extremely mentally ill and unstable.

And as was once put to me, the reason that some artists are not appreciated until after their death isn't just a matter of not meeting your heroes, but because they understood something about the present moment that the public was not yet prepared to reflect upon. That we appreciate them in retrospect because they tell us something we are not yet ready to hear. That requires a degree of empathy for humanity that is not well represented in a strictly narcissistic diagnosis.

Well said. It feels really weird to have to defend this in this day and age.It's ok for a hot actress to be dressed in a skimpy outfit. It was a big deal for our young selves when we watched her.

The only person who had a right to complain was Carrie Fisher -- and she did, because it was an uncomfortable costume.It's ok to have sexy accesses in sexy outfits. It's not ok if those are the only roles they get, but this wasn't the case.

No, it doesn't give bad vibes. It was a sexy actress wearing a skimpy outfit for a couple of scenes in the whole goddamn trilogy! And she kicked butt.Repeat after me: sexy scenes in  movies are ok. And young Carrie Fisher was hot, and that was also ok. I was half in love with her when I first watched Star Wars.Now, you can ask why Mark Hamill  or Harrison Ford weren't put in skimpy outfits and whether it was more often women who got those scenes, and that'd be pertinent. But this doesn't give slave Leia a bad vibe.It's OK if those scenes had sexy vibes. Sexy vibes aren't bad. This didn't define Leia either, she was mostly competent and kicked imperial butt.

In the internet age, simply consuming an artists media funds the artist. Get as philosophical as you'd like while separating the art from the artist, but if they're still alive you're still basically saying ""look you're a piece of shit but here's a couple of bucks anyways"".

If we go by the vibe of this thread, it's yet another reason to avoid social media. You wouldn't want to reward people like this.As for the broader topic, this segues into the worryingly popular fallacy of excluded middle. Just because you're not against something, doesn't mean you're supporting it. Being neutral, ambivalent, or plain old just not giving a fuck about a whole class of issues, is a perfectly legitimate place to be in. In fact, that's everyone's default position for most things, because humans have limited mental capacity - we can't have calculated views on every single thing in the world all the time.

At a certain point you're just making the argument that any lack of action directly opposing something is ""allowing it to thrive"", making anyone directly responsible for everything.Not technically wrong, but at a certain point there has to be a cutoff. Can you really hold yourself responsible for enjoying a movie which is problematic because one of the batteries in one of the cameras used to produce it was bought from a guy who once bought a waffle from a KKK bake sale? The ""problematic-ness"" is there, no doubt, but how much can you orient your actions towards not-benefiting something you disapprove of before it disables you from actually finding and spreading things you actually do like?

I do agree that the consumption of that media could very easily increase its cultural strength.Even in your influencer example, there are ways to bring less traffic/ad views to that content while allowing some ability to consume. example here: https://libredirect.github.io/

I think if formal Latin was really that great a language, it would have endured much longer.  Latin is a horribly complicated language, and this is probably a big reason why ""vulgar Latin"" came about, and why Latin-influenced languages evolved from it (Spanish, French, Portuguese, etc.), yet were neither actual Latin themselves, nor as complicated.There's a good reason English is so popular these days, and it's not just US dominance.  English is a really easy language to learn poorly.  It's hard to get all the little details right (like this apostrophe stuff), especially for formal writing, and it's hard to really master it, but it's really easy to learn it at a basic level and become decently conversational with it.  You'll make lots of mistakes at this level, but it doesn't matter because with the way the language works, listeners will still understand you just fine.  It's not like highly inflected languages where conjugating something incorrectly suddenly changes the meaning completely.A complicated language like formal Latin makes sense if you want your language to be more like a rigid technical specification: it leaves much less room for ambiguity.  But this is not at all easy for speakers of other languages to learn well enough as a 2nd language for international trade.

Nothing wrong with that and I may be overthinking but utilitarian line of thinking is the reason why a lot of issues actually happen because Politicians might promise something on an utilitarian premise where there real premise might be unknown.Morals are certainly in question as well and where does one stop in the utilitarian line of thinkingBut I overall agree with your statement and I wish to expand on it that if we are thinking about offsetting, one of the ideas can be to keep on buying even books written by many authors, overall aggregate can be net positive impact so perhaps we can treat it as a bank of sorts from which we can withdraw some impact.

I do think there was another formula he gravitated towards, though. Maybe one in every four strips, it seemed to me like he would have a canonically ""stupid"" character present a popular belief or a common behavior, and then have his author self-insert character dunk on them... And that was it, that was the entire comic. Those strips weren't very witty or funny to me, they just felt like contrived fantasies about putting down an opponent.Once I noticed that, it became harder to enjoy the rest of his comics. And easier to imagine how he might have fallen down the grievance politics rabbit hole.

Were these people trustworthy? Because that sounds exactly like the kind of urban legend that people like to parrot, or like a pretty standard way to cope with not getting hired.

The idea of a company in the 80's going around that they are promoting Asians to positions over white people, sounds as far fetched as finding oil in my backyard. The reverse is way more likely in that time periode.More then likely, he was not qualified for the job. But people often have a hard time accepting this, and feel entitled for position. Often by virtue of working somewhere longer. When passed over for promotion, then they create narratives its not themselves who is the issue, but it must be somebody else their fault.So when you 20, 30, 40 years later tell the story, are you going to say ""well, i was not qualified"" or are you going to double down that you got passed over for a promotion, because ""somebody had it out for me"", or as ""DEI hire"" as that was the trending topic in conservative circles. What is a little lie to make yourself feel better, and have the world perceive you as the victim of horrible DEI hiring practices ... in the 80s!!!If people think racism is rampaging today, they really did not live in the 80's...

But also for the DEI thing specifically, what's going on is that objecting to the implementation details is proof that you oppose the stated goal.

Try explaining to a “go back to where you belong” racists that you're not from Africa (or from Mexico, or wherever) - you have a different ethnic background, or you're a natural born citizen - racists don't care about the nuance, you're coloured and they're bigoted, and race differences are enshrined.So if that's the case - if you're just going to be lumped into the same bucket as every other (say) black person anyway - then you're only going to make yourself weaker by dividing yourselves - you need to organize to push back against racism, and that means your natural allies are going to be all the other people that racists are racist about - and by extension, all the other people bigots are bigoted about. Now it doesn't matter if you were born in Egypt, or in the Sudan, or in Somalia or Jamaica or Haiti or Illinois- racists all treat you as ‘black', and it's on that basis, that shared identity as people oppressed for being black, that you struggle for justice.And what is justice if not redress?Anyway the point I'm making here is, it's not DEI that's enshrining race - it's racists. The reason DEI is organized along racial lines is because that's how racism is applied by the bigots who believe in that crap.Very much along the same lines of why “all lives matter” in response to “black lives matter” is a very deliberately racist statement - because it's mocking the struggle of oppressed people to get justice for themselves and to defend themselves from their oppressors.

Also that freedom of speech is very limited is correct, and there is extensive online censorship. But that doesn't mean the government ignores what people think. Almost all domestic government policies are broadly supported by the population. And when public opposition is strong then the government is known to delay implementation or change course.Notable examples are Covid Zero, the K Visa, and the reclassification of drug use offenses.

Post-WWII, Chiang Kai-shek was far too friendly with the defeated, disgraced, and oft-hated Japanese military.  And the blatantly racist Americans.  Vs. Mao was friendly with (if often made out to be a tool of) the Soviets - hardly nice people, but in China far less ill-behaved or loathed.  Since Mao won the Chinese Civil War - with considerable help from the Soviets, and far more help from the cruelty, corruption, and poor company of the Nationalist regime - then ""dialed back"" Soviet power and influence over the following decades, he'd seem the obvious winner of the ""Freed China from Foreign Domination"" crown.

Now, someone who disagrees with the statement ""it's ok to belong to <ethnic group>"" is usually called a racist. That's if we stick to the default meaning of words, without second and third guessing what people really mean to say when they deny it's ok to belong to an ethnic group.

reply

The context of that poll was an alt-right uplifting of the phrase ""it's OK to be white"", as though they were being oppressed and were finally removing the yoke of hatred they'd endured. A similar poll might ask about the phrases ""not all men"" or ""me too"". In isolation, who could possibly have a problem with either of those?, but these things aren't taken in isolation.I'd be curious about a followup question like ""is it acceptable for someone to be white"", which is asking the exact same question, on the surface, but in context is asking something completely different.

There have absolutely been cases of VPs becoming President without ever winning their own primary though, and I doubt most would describe those cases as DEI despite demographics often playing a large part in VP picks.

reply

Though Harris was an unserious VP pick in the first place (2020). Given that Biden was 183 years old at the time, he should have picked a VP that Americans or at least Democratic voters had demonstrated at least moderate acceptance as a President in the primary, instead of picking essentially the least popular Democrat in the race (just to pander? Why else?). I guess the DEI dogma told him that it's better to have a Black woman on the ticket even if she was the worst choice by any measure: ability to get votes, relatability, or political experience. The funniest part is that Harris was most unpopular in the primary with the 'wokest' Democratic voters -- they hated her for being a decent D.A. and charging criminals with crimes, even ones who were 'disadvantaged minorities.' DEI forced her selection anyway because she checked two identity boxes.

reply

Actually more Californians voted for the Republican against her in the 2014 election for attorney general, than voted for Harris when she later ran for Senate in the special election.Obama by contrast had won 3.6 million votes, in a smaller state, for a decisive 70% win in his Senate race.Harris was a joke of a candidate who was obviously unelectable outside of a deep blue state, but she was forced on us so the DNC could virtue signal.

In this case, he was responding to a Rasmussen poll asking whether people agreed with the statement, “It's okay to be white.” Among Black respondents, 26% said they disagreed either strongly or somewhat, while 21% weren't sure. From this, Adams deduced that nearly half of all Black Americans don't think it's okay to be white and presumably hate white people.> In fact, in addition to doubts about Rasmussen's sampling methods, the question itself is misleading. “It's okay to be white” is a slogan long used as a seemingly innocuous “code” by white supremacists and popularized by internet trolls a few years ago. Most likely, many Black people in the survey had some vague knowledge of this background or realized they were being asked a trick question of sorts. More than one in four white respondents (27%) also declined to endorse the statement.> Adams could have acknowledged his error. Instead, he dug in his heels, improbably claimed that he was using “hyperbole” to illustrate that it's wrong to generalize about people by race, and seemed to take pride in his “cancellation” (which he can afford financially). He has also found a troubling number of more or less mainstream conservative defenders, including Twitter owner Elon Musk and highly popular commentator Ben Shapiro. On Twitter, Shapiro acknowledged that Adams' rant was racist — only to add that “if you substituted the word ‘white' for ‘black' ” in it, you would get “a top editorial post at the New York Times.”

More than one in four white respondents (27%) also declined to endorse the statement.> Adams could have acknowledged his error. Instead, he dug in his heels, improbably claimed that he was using “hyperbole” to illustrate that it's wrong to generalize about people by race, and seemed to take pride in his “cancellation” (which he can afford financially). He has also found a troubling number of more or less mainstream conservative defenders, including Twitter owner Elon Musk and highly popular commentator Ben Shapiro.

It becomes racist when you spread negative racial stereotypes. Which the statements were doing, unless the survey number was 100% and the sample size was the population size. And neither were.Also, important context: The statement in question is a white supremacist slogan [0][1][2], much like ""White Power!"". Is anyone who doesn't agree with the phrase ""White Power!"" a racist, too, because that must mean that they seek to deny power to white people? Does not agreeing with the slogan ""White Power!"" mean you will kill all white people?0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_okay_to_be_white1: https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/its-okay-be-white2: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2025.2...

Then, of course, racism consists of the believe that some races are intrinsically less valuable (in whatever sense) than others. I didn't see Scott Adams voice that part. But I might have missed it or it might have been implied.But it's important to note that US identity politics of the last couple of decades looks increasingly weird to me as an outsider in any case.

Sorry, but no.The scientific community has moved away from 'race' in the biological sense (although there is debate) but the sociological construct of race, which is what we refer to in this context, obviously exists.When a person 'self identifies' as Black, or Asian or White - that is 'race' - in the  'social construct' sense and it's perfectly accepted and normal - the recognition of that does not make one racist.

It's literally on the census form.'Race' is a cultural euphemism for broader ethnicity.AKA 'European = White' - 'African = Black' - more or less.These are not arbitrary groups of 'self identification' like 'emo' or 'punk'.These groups are even self organizing - every single US city is built around small enclaves of groups - they pop right out on urban maps.We've been fighting tribal wars since the dawn of time, it's not hard to imagine how the 'Flemish' vs. 'Dutch' is not going to extend to 'European vs. African'.Elon Musk, on twitter, 2 days ago, was interjecting on this horrible bit of 'race war' nonsense, talking about 'blacks eviscerate whites' etc..Again - while there's feeble support for the notion of 'race' in the field of biology (although I think it's more controversial than stated), we obviously have cultural foundations around those concepts.Honestly - this kind of argument is plausibly the 'worst thing' about HN.

In that statement, it's not disdain for another group, it's disdain and resignation over racial politics.He seems to in fact have empathy, but has become maligned for some reason.He's seems to be 'giving up' on the cause and suggesting people go their separate ways.It's frankly much more cynical than it is racist.That's nothing near a traditional racist view.It's the posture of a cynical, old angry man - not some kind of White Nationlist.I'm not justifying anything but I am indicating that these thins are obviously nuanced.That said - I'm reflecting on a single comment, not his entire body of ugly commentary.

> In a February 2023 poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a polling firm often referred to by conservative media, 72% of 1,000 respondents agreed with the statement ""It's okay to be White"". Among the 130 black respondents, 53% agreed, while 26% disagreed, and 21% were unsure. Slate magazine suggested that some negative respondents may have been familiar with the term's links with white supremacy.Scott was a rather intelligent person with an MBA from UC Berkeley. How do you go from a sample of 130 black people a majority who agree with the slogan and only a minority against (less than a quarter). To all black people? Is that not an extreme overreaction?

It is indeed, but I think it makes sense to see it in the context of the culture wars. You can be upset at 47% of respondents to a poll disagreeing or being unsure that it's ok to be from your ethnic group; but that compounds with being upset at the perceived folly of a cultural movement that denies this is wrong or even encourages this way of thinking. It's the usual polarization mechanism, where apparent extremism of one side is so upsetting that it fuels or justifies an equally extreme reaction on the other.So again, I don't think it makes sense to judge these statements in a vacuum as if they were well thought and considered. They are momentary angry reactions to a perceived wrong.

But some people, especially in white supremacist and adjacent circles, who had never used ""All Lives Matter"" before started using it as a response to ""Black Lives Matter"".The implication was the BLM was asking for special treatment for Black people. In reality what BLM was saying was that Black lives matter too (in retrospect maybe they should have actually included ""too"" in the slogan), and ALM as a response to that is essentially dismissing BLM's concerns.Semi related is why we have a Black History Month but no White History Month in the US. Every month is a de facto white history month.

Adams here was doing one of two things, either being blatantly racist or (perhaps the more generous, and perhaps more likely) being extremely bad at comedy?It is of course ""possible"" to comedically play around with ""what team am I on,"" but you have to be good at it or you look like -- if not racist -- a completely oblivious weirdo, and he was obviously one of the two here?

There are many responding about “ignoring racism,” “whitewashing,” or the importance of calling out bigotry.I'm not sure how that follows from a comment that literally calls out the racism and describes it as “unambiguous.”Striving to “avoid the ugliness” in your own life does not mean ignoring it or refusing to call it out.

But at an art gallery, Picasso is near worshipped despite his torrid misogyny and abuse in his personal life which was terrible even by the standards of his day. The views on his art were formed at a time before cancel-culture was a thing.Realising:- everyone has performed good and bad actions- having performed a good action doesn't ""make up for or cancel out"" a bad action. You can save thousands of people, but murdering someone still should mean a life sentence.- you can be appreciated for your good actions while your bad actions still stand.: all these take some life experience and perhaps significant thought on the concepts.

I've struggled with this point of view since my early teens, and possibly even earlier. There is no amount of good one can do to compensate for even the slightest misdeed.As much as I may agree, however, it's probably the most damaging and destructive moral framework you can possibly have, because it just consumes anything positive.

Because it is much easier for people to universally accept a system where good or neutral deeds are expected by default, and misdeeds are punished.It is very difficult to construct an alternative system that humans could internalise. Where would you draw the line? What about saving 50 people, and then killing 49? Should they cancel each other, too?

We have to do the best we can to be kind and minimise suffering, while understanding that there will inevitably be a diversity of judgements on moral matters. And if those moral judgements have real-world effects, there will be moral judgements about that too.The lack of moral universality is how it is, not a failure. And it never ends: there are no right answers, although there might very well be wrong ones. Its up to us.

But even if it is, in fact, a thing - it's clearly not backed by ""one particular moral judgement"", as it is commonly portrayed. Lots of people face disapproval and punishment for a diversity of chosen moral stance, including people who could be categorised as ""liberal"" and who are typically considered to be those doing the ""cancelling"".Supporers of the abolition of slavery or apartheid, or of human rights for minority communities, were for many years ""cancelled"" in the US, and in Europe, for example. Today, in the US, supporters of social equality and diversity are being ""cancelled"".So I suspect that ""cancel culture"" is what you get when one moral/political group (of any persuasion) only sees part of the bigger picture, and uses that to manufacture a grievance.

Great way of avoiding 99% of the harm with that, is literally getting off social media, if that ever happens to you. Most people around you in real-life won't know about it, nor recognize you, or anything else, unless you had a pattern of bad behavior for a longer period of time.But you can still make mistakes, even online, and eventually people forget about it.

To err is to be human. If you minimize your life to minimize negative impacts on others, you are hurting yourself (and your friends and family). If you make a mistake, learn from it and try to be better.

One metric is just by if people still want to hang out with you. Sure, you made a mistake and hurt their feelings before. But they're still your friends, and still talk to you because they, on balance, predict that interacting you will be good for them. Said less cynically - they genuinely like you. Or - if the ""you"" is too difficult to accept (as it often is with mental health issues), you can see it in relationships of people around you.Human beings are messy, and relationships (of all types) even more so. We all have brought both joy and sadness to those important to us. Trying to avoid harm above all else, will necessarily also reduce the joy you bring to others - you become withdrawn, isolated, cautious in all interactions.Separately - hurting another person is not always a sign of a moral sin. Accidents and misunderstandings happen, no person can predict every result of their actions, and also - sometimes two people are genuinely in conflict, and there won't be a happy end to it.

That said, it is strange to even consider being good, which is generally a rather easy thing to be, to be some kind of task you should be paid for even virtually. Being basically good is the trivial cost to avoid becoming anti-social. Why should a social group even tolerate you otherwise? With that in mind, as mentioned before, I think you'll find that social groups are highly tolerant of many misdeeds.

If someone cured cancer, do you think they couldn't be tried for murder?

reply

If someone offered to cure cancer, but only if you permitted them to commit a single specific murder, is that a reasonable trade? All you've got there is yet another trolley problem.

reply

If we make decisions based on what will have the best outcome, well the trolley problem is trivial; minimise the negative outcome.In the scenario of murder for the cancer cure, you're still left with someone who was murdered. My take is that this isn't any less bad than someone who was murdered for something other than the cure for cancer, which in turn means I would stop this murder even if it meant not curing cancer.

reply

You've lost me. Isn't that also the case in any trolley problem? The trolley is a sort of satirical analogy. The thing actually being considered is ""I get this good thing but I'm also left with this bad thing as a direct result"".I guess a key difference is before versus after the fact. Agreeing to the outcome to ""pay"" for what you want is different than deliberating over an act committed by the same person after the fact in the absence of any prior agreement. But if the only issue is the lack of an agreement then it's less a matter of ""murder non-fungible"" and more a matter of enforcing legal procedure for the sake of social stability. The state needs to maintain its monopoly on violence I guess.

Demanding people being pure and good, denying their egoistical sides can lead to quite terrible outcomes. The art is to deal with these character sides as well.I don't have a huge group of friends but all of them have flaws like me. If you can forgive yourself, people start to believe that you can forgive others too and maybe you would make friends. Generally people that only point the finger at the smallest flaws are called self-righteous for a reason. And no, they often do not have many friends.

Even a insane nazi can feed half africa, while the most saint like person, may give humanity nothing.The value society assigns is not the value a person has.

The things a EVA worker contributes to all life inside the hull, can be substantial while he is a useless drunk on the inside. And somebody with a fishbowl over his head, cosplaying astronaut on the inside contributes nothing. Somebody yelling - redistribute the spacesuits, its cold in here - does more damage to society, then the useless drunk ever will.

cancel culture isn't a synonym for shaming.cancel culture is a modern phenomenon that is facilitated by modern media formats -- it could not have existed earlier.shaming is about making a persons' opinion known to the public to receive outcry. Cancel culture includes deplatforming, legal action, soap-boxing, algorithmic suppression, networked coordination between nodes, and generally the crowds exert institutional pressures against the targets' backing structure rather than to the person themselves or individuals near them in order to get their target fired or minimized somehow.You shame a child who stole a cookie by telling them that now they need to go brush their teeth, and that they won't get one after dinner , and that you're disappointed that you found them to be sneaking around behind your back.You don't kick them out of the house and tell the neighborhood not to hire them under threat of company wide boycott from other moms.

It was also synonymous with ostracism, to be excluded from society, to have little to no chance of regular financing or loans, to have debts called, to be fired and have little hope of being employed.It was socially networked suppression, operating at the speed of club dinners and afternoon teas.Such things go back in time in many societies, wherever there was a hierarchy, whispers, and others to advance or to tread down.

The first one is about Dilbert going to an anti-white-man protest, which might be how people on the right perceive something like a BLM event, but it's not what these events actually are.

The originals' core premise was universal workplace satire that criticized the office as a system: bureaucracy, incentives, incompetence, managerial nonsense... stuff that felt broadly true no matter one's politics. Even when it got cynical, it was still observational, in the sense of ""here's how corporate life warps people."" This depiction of what is essentially everyone's shared day-to-day struggles is the thing that gave it a place in mainstream culture.In direct contrast, Dilbert Reborn is about Adams's personal grievances: his divorce and subsequent inability to find another partner, his fall from grace and full embrace of the alt-right movement, and his long-held beliefs about race, sex and other social issues that he quadrupled down on. Its core premise is ""I was wronged; subscribe to the uncensored version; also here's the political/culture commentary bundle."" It uses the recognizable characters and brand equity of the original comics to sell a fundamentally different product: paywalled, grievance-tinged, ""spicier"", creator-centric franchise built in the wake of his 2023 meltdown and institutional rejection.There's actually quite a few conservative comedians and cartoonists I find funny. Adams was not one of them. The fundamental truth about successful humor is that you cannot make it about you and your own grievances. Adams totally failed at that.

Weird to read this assertion in a thread about Scott Adams, who literally had his whole career ended.

""It's why you believe [...]"" But you don't know what I believe.""Scott Adams claimed [...] because of a response to a survey question [...]"" But his statement is, if one applies some very basic ""media literacy"" (as you like to call it), clearly rhetorical, with the underlying message that there seems to be a lot of racial hatred from blacks towards whites in the United States in 2023, and that this racial hatred seems to be institutionally supported, and that as a white person of means he'll use his means to avoid this racial hatred and suggests others do the same. The cited survey is merely one data point he presents to support this belief. Arguing as if he arrived at this conclusion purely off of that alone is total sophistry.I don't live in the US, so perhaps that will give you some reprieve. Scott Adams might well have been wrong. I don't claim to know here if he was, just that you haven't actually contended with his position at all despite writing a lot of angry words, and that this excess of sophistry justifies a dismissive response.

I think my eyes just rolled out of my head. Firstly because you think “BLM” was a someone you can attribute an opinion to, and secondly, the mind-numbingly idiotic view you did ascribe to “them”.Turn off cable news and Twitter; it may help.

If I say something racist at home, my friends and family will shame me - that is social consequence. If I say something racist at home and the person I invited over publicly posts that on Twitter and tags my employer to try to get me fired, that's cancel culture, and there's clearly a difference.There are virtually no social groups where it's socially acceptable to get offended by what an individual said and then seek out their friends, family, and co-workers to specifically tell them about that thing to try to inflict harm on that individual. That would be extremely unacceptable and rude behavior in every single culture that I'm aware of, to the point where it would almost always be worse and more ostracizing than whatever was originally said.

> But something doesn't need to be illegal for us to push back against it.This is exactly what cancel culture is.  It's pushing back on something (usually legal, but behavior we don't strongly don't agree with).And its absurd to me how the right acts like cancel culture is a left movement.  The right has used it too.  Look at all the post Charlie Kirk canceling that happened, huge scale -- even the government got involved in the canceling there.  Colin Kaepernick is probably one of the most high profile examples of canceling.  The big difference is that the right has more problematic behaviors.  Although more of it is being normalized.  Jan 6 being normalized is crazy to me, but here we are.

You conveniently left out the part about mob mentality there. I don't think anyone was ever objecting to people expressing their disapproval of something in and of itself. Certainly I wasn't.I'm not sure what partisan complaints are supposed to add to the discussion. I don't think it matters if one, both, or neither ""team"" are engaging in the behavior. The behavior is bad regardless.> I'd stop using HN and I'd tell others to also not use it. I'd implement cancel culture on it.That's a boycott but I don't believe it qualifies as ""cancelling"". Identifying YC associated businesses and telling people not to patronize them due to the association might qualify. Trying to get people who continued to use HN after the policy change fired would qualify.

Someone posting things that don't fit your worldview and make you mad doesn't rise to that bar.

First, speak out about it and shame those engaging in it. If its not socially acceptable to ruin someone's live over their opinions then less people will go along with the mob and it becomes less of a problem.Second, make sure that people's livelihoods are not ruined by people being mad at them. That's essentially what anti-discrimination laws do we just need to make sure they cover more kinds of discrimination. Essentially large platforms should not be allowed to ban you and employers should not be able to fire you just because a group of people is upset with something you expressed outside the platform/company.

Ah, fight cancel culture with cancel culture.So you're going to legislate that employers can't fire people because of something they've done outside of work (presumably as long as its legal)?  Many professions have morality clauses -- we'd ban those presumably?  And if you had a surgeon who said on Facebook that he hated Jews and hated when he operated on them (but he would comply with the laws) -- as a hospital you'd think that people who raised this to you had no ground to stand on.  That they should just sue if they feel they got substandard treatment?

Note I didn't say race quotas (i.e. hire minimum 50% non-white) were bad. I just said, there are people who oppose this idea, they should at least be permitted to air their views, a discussion is important.I was drummed out for that. To me that's cancel culture in a nutshell. Suppression, censorship, purge anyone who opposes your idea but also anyone who even wants to discuss it critically (which is the only way to build genuine consensus).Now 20 years on what I see when I interact with younger people is there are two camps. One of those camps has gone along with this and their rules for what constitutes acceptable speech are incredibly narrow. They are prone to nervous breakdown, social withdrawal, and anxiety if anyone within earshot goes outside of the guard rails for acceptable speech. Mind you what the First Amendment protects as legal speech is vastly, vastly vastly broader than what these people can handle. I worry for them because the inability to even hear certain things without freaking out is an impediment to living a happy life.Meanwhile there is a second camp which has arisen, and they're basically straight up Nazis. There is a hard edge to some members of Gen Z that is like, straight up white supremacy, ""the Austrian painter had a point,"" ""repeal the 19th"" and so on, non-ironically, to a degree that I have never before seen in my life.If you don't see the link here and how this bifurcation of the public consciousness emerged then I think you're blind. It was created by cancel culture. Some of the canceled realized there was no way for them to participate in public discourse with any level of authenticity, and said fuck it, might as well go full Nazi. I mean I presume they didn't decide that consciously, but they formed their own filter bubble, and they radicalized.We are likely to soon face a historically large problem with extreme right wing nationalism, racism and all these very troubling things, because moderate views were silenced over and over again, and more and more people were driven out of the common public discourse, into the welcoming arms of some really nasty people. It's coming. To anyone who thinks ""cancel culture"" is not a serious concern I really encourage them to rethink their views and contemplate how this phenomenon actually CREATED the radicalization (on both sides) that we are seeing today.

To anyone who thinks ""cancel culture"" is not a serious concern I really encourage them to rethink their views and contemplate how this phenomenon actually CREATED the radicalization (on both sides) that we are seeing today.

Sure - but I'd argue that's due to the overall unhealthy aspects of internet use and not specifically 'cancel culture'.The internet has become a constant stream of something that is simultaneously designed to maintain your attention and engagement ( control you ), and sell you stuff ( control you ).

I think that's a far too strong. I can see how grievances can be exploited to promulgate these views, and unfair cancelling might be one of those, but I don't see that as the main driving grievance that has been exploited - what I see is the timeless  'times are hard and it's some other groups fault' grievance as the main engine.I'd also argue that extreme right wing views are on the rise in many places in the world, and I'd argue most of them never got anywhere near the US level of cancel culture - and indeed things like positive discrimination are still just seen as discrimination.I think it's unlikely to be one factor - but if I had to choose one, I'd say there is a better correlation between the relatively recent rise in day to day internet use and the rise in prominence of such views.

I want to reinforce this fact. Consider the origins of the term ""ostracism"", where a sufficiently objectionable individual could be literally voted out of the village. If that doesn't count as being ""cancelled"" I don't know what does.

I didn't give Picasso the benefit of the doubt because he was an amazing artist.  I did so simply because I was ignorant of how horrible he was.Some people have trouble updating their feelings when new information arrives.I like him -> He causes harm -> I want to continue liking him -> his harm wasn't so bad.That's all.Picasso made some cool stuff.  I will never display any of it in my home because he was horrible.

I think people are perfectly allowed to appreciate the art while knowing he was not nice as a person. People are multifaceted, both as actors and in judgement of others.So where to draw the line is the question.And the answer is: this isn't linear. Context matters and is different for spaces and people.  For example, you state seeing the art first, finding out he was not nice later and how that shaped your judgement.------ SpacesNot having Picasso art in your house is clearly fine. It's your space, your personal choice what you put there.Demanding his art be removed from all art galleries around the world is not fine. Art galleries are mostly public spaces whose role is specifically to view artistic results largely from an artistic point of view. They are allowed to acknowledge his personal life and usually do - but that is not how you judge art.And so we have two perfectly fine and yet contradicting choices towards housing the art of Picasso.------ PeopleA victim of similar abuse as Picasso dished out may not want to see his art in the gallery due to association - this is fine.A person who simply doesn't care for that style of art may be indifferent or also not want to see it - also fine.A person who thinks Picasso fundamentally moved the art world forward may definitely want to see this art - also fine.And so differing people's attitudes towards Picasso are also easily understandable and fine.

Scott's body of work spans many years and - like music bands - the early stuff is much different to the later stuff. To say he confined himself to ""expressing prejudiced views"" seems to overlook a whole lot of that early work.To say his work doesn't ""match"" other artists work is subjective. I got/get the occasional giggle out of Dilbert - more often in the earlier ones. I don't care for Picasso's art at all but I recognise that other people do. Who's body of work should I personally rate higher? The top comment mentions feeling like Scott was family, while acknowledging all the flaws of Scott.This is why I mention that good and bad actions can both stand.

Scott's work in the 1990s (i.e. ~30 years ago) was genuinely very funny at the time for anyone who worked in an office, including myself, when I was working as an engineering intern at a company.  One strip I remember in particular came out just when our company had announced some silly new initiative and gave out free sweatshirts to motivate everyone, and the Dilbert strip that Sunday was almost exactly the same thing except it was t-shirts there.  The timing was eerie.It's sad to me how Adams fell, which largely seemed to happen after the popularity of Dilbert waned and may have been a reaction to that, but his work was funny and lovable in its earlier days.

What's most commendable is the effort to examine and revise inherited beliefs, especially when they cause harm.4. This framework lets me understand how any individual arrived at their views without endorsing those views.I think this is why responses often split: some treat explanation as endorsement, others don't.

Writing in the 1990s and 2000s, author Albert Jack[18] and Messianic minister Richard Pustelniak,[19] claim that the original meaning of the expression was that the ties between people who have made a blood covenant (or have shed blood together in battle) were stronger than ties formed by ""the water of the womb"", thus ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"".

Well... one cannot choose family for one is always bound to them by biology. Does that matter? No. One's life is more than that. One can leave family in the dust, a choice many of Adam's targets had to make to continue living, while others never even got to make that choice. Either way, equating (and let's be frank: most often elevating) yesterday's ""hero"" to family status certainly is a choice.In this spirit: ""Here's a nickel kid, buy yourself a better eulogy.""

No, that's your own personal interpretation, perhaps from your own culture.

reply

There is a thin line here. People need people like Adams to be a racist to justify themselves. If you look for flaws in everyone overstepping conventional dogmata, you would rate higher on a scale that approximates authoritarian personalities. My case here is exactly such a case as well. It is only an approximation, but it would be a delusion to ignore these tendencies in online or media discussions.Perhaps he was racist, I didn't know him personally. He certainly was controversial and he wanted to provoke. That comes with a price. But statements with inverted skin colors are simply treated differently.

To the extent that is arguably true (and I'd argue it mostly is not, there may be a one-way effect and/or a parasocial attachment, but “personal relationship” requires two-way interaction, and confusing a parasocial attachment for a personal relationship is the start of...lots of bad things) those relationships quite literally do not share the “you don't choose family” aspect that applies to (a subset of) family relationships.

Dilbert came out a bit before I was born, so from my perspective it always existed. Even before I had ever had any kind of office job, I was reading the Dilbert comics and watching the cartoon series, and had even read The Dilbert Principle.It was upsetting that he ended up with such horrible viewpoints later in his life, and they aren't really forgivable, but as you stated it's sort of like a relative you grew up with dying.I really hate my grandmother, because she has repeatedly said very racist stuff to my wife, so I haven't talked to her in since 2018, and the only communication that I have had with her was a series of increasingly nasty emails we exchanged after she called my mother a “terrible parent” because my sister is gay, where I eventually told her that she “will die sad and alone with her only friend being Fox News”.It is likely that I will never say anything to her ever again; she is in her 90s now, and not in the greatest health from my understanding.  When she kicks the bucket in a few years, I think I am going to have similar conflicts.Despite me hating her now, it's not like all my memories with her were bad.  There are plenty of happy memories too, and I am glad to have those, but it doesn't automatically forgive the horrible shit she has said to my wife and mother and sister.I have thought about reaching out, but I cannot apologize for anything I said because I am not sorry for anything I said, and I do not apologize for things unless I actually regret them.Dunno, relationships and psychology are complex and I can't pretend to say I understand a damn thing about how my brain works.

I really hate my grandmother, because she has repeatedly said very racist stuff to my wife, so I haven't talked to her in since 2018, and the only communication that I have had with her was a series of increasingly nasty emails we exchanged after she called my mother a “terrible parent” because my sister is gay, where I eventually told her that she “will die sad and alone with her only friend being Fox News”.It is likely that I will never say anything to her ever again; she is in her 90s now, and not in the greatest health from my understanding.

At some point I stopped reading because the RSS feed kept getting broken and it was just too hard for me to follow.I didn't hear about Adams again until maybe 7-8 years ago when I found out about the sock puppet thing and he had seemingly gone off the deep end.From the meager amount I know, it only got worse from there.It makes things very odd. Given who he was/became I don't miss him. But I did enjoy his work long long ago.

There is a lot of this in the modern era, and probably will only get ""worse"".

Maybe it's because of my upbringing, and moving away from home when I was about 15, but why not? I think most people could actually ""choose family"" (or not, if it's better for you as individual).

Just because you happen to share 0.0001% more DNA than any other human on the planet?Not to take away from the rest of what you say, it's a highly personal experience, and I thank you for sharing that heartfelt message to give people more perspectives, something usually missing when ""divisive"" (maybe not the right word) people end up in the news.

Of course it's different for everyone, some families are so tragic they may not be worth preserving, etc. But that's an outlier-- the modal experience is that the power of family is precisely in the fact that you don't get to choose it.

We just can't go through life changing our people whenever they don't live up to what we want them to be.As you get older, please try to find people who you can love unconditionally until you die.

Protip: the love has to be reciprocated. Never, ever unconditionally love an abuser in the name of family. Set boundaries, when they are crossed, leave. There may be a cost, but it may be lighter than the cost of staying. We may not choose family, but we continually choose whose company we keep.

My brother has a substance abuse problem. When he gets out of prison, he's clean. Them a cousin or uncle that hasn't seen him in a while will stop by with a party favor (an 8 ball of coke or something) and then before you know it my brother is in jail again. They all are alcoholics and drama often escalates to fist fight type drama. Or the women will start throwing stuff around someone's house and trash the place. It's just like normal to them. Sometimes they make up and help clean up and sometimes they don't. But the few times I've been around them on the decades since I made a decision to cut them out, it's always just the same ole shit. They're in a cycle of “dependence on family” while also “destroying family” from my perspective. It's so volatile I can put up with it at all. My kid has only met these people a couple times and it's always for brief time because once the booze get flowing or the other substances get passed around anything can happen. When I was a kid my mom was arguing with her then boyfriend and he ran her over and she was in a full body cast for like 6 months. My dad was always normal ish, from a more stable family, then in my mid 20s he was caught in a pedophile sting situation. And that's just the beginning.Like, who tf are these people. I have no time for this shit, Is my take on it.

In my teens I began to learn that most of the people on my father's side of the family were horrifically broken people with severe issues. There's at least one town in New Mexico where I wouldn't want to use my last name because an uncle of mine has run it deeply through the mud and 20' underground so to speak.I've actively cut those people out of my life. I've decided that blood isn't the only thing that makes family, and that I can choose who I want to treat as family.The infighting bastards who happen to share my last name are not my family.

Your immediately family shares hundreds of thousands more variable sites in your genome than a 'random' individual. Which is to say there would need to be something like a 2^(100000) population of humans before someone 'random' would be as close to you in terms of variable sites.I guess my point being ""you happen to share 0.0001% more DNA"" is just not trivial or a small coincidence that can be waved away with ""we are more similar to each other than not"". Whether any genetic similarity means that one's biological family deserves one's attention, I have no comment.

- The people with whom we share close bonds, stronger than ordinary friendship; we absolutely can (and should) choose them, and choose them wisely.- The people who've disproportionately shaped our development into who we are as persons today; barring sci-fi technologies like time machines or false memory implantation, that's pretty hard to change.GP's comment seems to be more about the latter, and of Scott Adams being in that category.  I agree with that in my case, too; both the Dilbert comics and The Dilbert Principle were formative for me both personally and professionally — which amplified the pain I felt when Adams started to “go off the deep end” and reveal himself to be less of a Dilbert and more of a PHB.

As to ICE deporting criminal aliens, that's not what they're doing. They're kidnapping people off the street and out of their homes and cars, with no warrants. They're literally doing ""Papers, please"" style stops of anybody they even suspect could be an immigrant, including Native Americans. Just a few days ago in Minneapolis they abducted four homeless men who are members of the Oglala Nation. This all sounds pretty Gestapo like to me.

reply

His comments were in response to a Rasmussen Reports poll that asked people if they agreed with the statement ""It's OK to be white"". Around 26% of Black respondents disagreed (with some unsure), which Adams interpreted as meaning nearly half of Black Americans were not OK with white people.Is it reductive? Sure. Is it racist? Of course not. You're allowed to have opinions on the Internet as long as you treat others with respect.

Was Obama's use of ICE also kidnapping, in your eyes?  For reference material, please read the ACLUs papers on their site.No ICE agent has been indicted for kidnapping.  Can you explain why?  ( Remember, they have been doing this for many years, under presidents of both parties ).

reply

Additionally, Obama's use of ICE was far different from what's going on today in that Obama used targeted enforcement prioritizing criminals. ICE today in Minneapolis is just driving around grabbing anyone they think could, possibly, maybe be illegal. US citizens are being swept up by anonymous, violent and poorly trained agents with virtually no accountability. It's causing terror in the community in a way Obama never even came close to. To suggest these are similar is extremely disingenuous.

The ACLU calls it ‘monstrous' and discusses Trump And Obama in the same paper.  They cite Obama for lack of due process and write horrific stories about Obamas usage.Read this paper and try to tell me Obama should not be condemned but Trump should.

Nobody disputes ICE was bad then. The difference is that Obama wasn't cheering them on, saying anybody who was abused or even murdered by ICE deserved it. Trump isn't just allowing this, he's given them a mandate to act this way.

I find that consistent.  The ACLU calls both monstrous.  Obama set the precedent for using ICE in the current way, Trump continued Obamas policies.  The two are similar.If someone says they condemn both, I respect that.  The person has integrity.If someone says they condemn neither ( as I do ), I also respect that.  They are acknowledging what the ACLU and others say — the presidents have used ICE in similar ways.If someone condemns only one and is silent about the other, to me that signals a lack of integrity.  I don't see a logical way to excuse only one.  It doesn't seem possible to tolerate the behavior of one while condemning the other.  Read the ACLU articles if you need evidence of the similarities.You say Trump is 10 times worse than Obama, I see nothing that even remotely suggests this is true.  If you have any articles to show that back this up, please show them.

This is hopeless. I don't think there's anything I could say or show that would change your opinion. If the Epstein affair, his $TRUMP coin, the Qatari plane, the failed Jan 6 coup, the multiple recent ICE shootings didn't make you think that Trump is a worse president than Obama, then I don't think anything will. Not to forget, the many people he sent to CECOT without any due process, his rampant warmongering that threatens even Europe, the complete erosion of America's goodwill on the international scene, his destruction of all public research, the trillions he added to the national debt just so he could give some tax cuts to his friends, and on and on and on it goes.I'm sure you're aware of all these events. I'm sure you have rationalizations for all of them, even the pedophilia. Know that I am no fan of Obama, at all, but anyone still claiming that Trump is no worse than him has a serious issue. I hope you can work through it, in time.

This is the only issue I have with your statement.I have a lot of favourite creators who are noteworthy for something bad or another. I like their stuff. The bad stuff doesnt particularly affect me. We get on fine. I read Howard and Lovecraft. I enjoy the heck out of them. I used to watch reruns of the Dilbert cartoon.The issue here is sort of the implication that family is a net positive despite bad behaviours. Thats bs. Anyone who has had to push shitty assholes from their family isn't happy that they existed, or made better through their existence. Scott Adams is just a niche internet microcelebrity who made some funny comics and said some shitty things on his podcast. Blocking him is a lot easier than getting rid of an abusive family member, and his net effect on someone is going to be a lot lower.

Lime is basic (high pH) so it also discourages (eg) mold growth, but it's not sanitary.More generally, not every word that includes the substring ""white"" is a part of the conspiracy.

How or why Scott Adams went completely of the rails is perhaps something we'll sadly never understand.

  ""WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU!""

Google tells me this is from ""The Dilbert Future"", 1997, pg. 146 under ""Prediction 38"". It's presented as the explanation for when a woman speaks in a meeting, and male coworkers don't listen to, quote, ""the woman who is generating all that noise"".Adams more or less tells female readers to just deal with it, while also telling male readers that they're broken/lying if they're not engaged in a constant sexual fantasy about their female coworkers.To be honest, this did real damage to how I felt about sexuality and gender. Not a huge amount on its own, but it's just such a distorted take from a respected author, whose books my father kept checking out, that I read at a young age.Scott Adams clearly lived an atypical life. Most people don't quit their jobs to write comics about corporate culture. If I had to guess why he took such a hard turn later on, I think, maybe it's something that happens when a humorist can't compartmentalize their penchant for absurdity and need for attention from real life, they can tell jokes that resonate with a lot of people, but at the same time their serious views also end up becoming ungrounded...

If you aren't familiar with it, well I was once given a copy by a friend who said they used it to 'get their partner'.I tried reading it, found it despicable (its basically everything we hate about manipulation in the attention economy,) also the person who loaned it to me had bad narcissistic tendencies; the only time I saw them cry was when someone died that they didnt get to bang.

Do you normally see people cry a lot? I don't think I've seen any of my friends cry more than once.

I mean, no doubt people cry. I just can't remember the last time a friend was crying in my presence. It was honestly probably middle school. Maybe a handful of times since then, across all of my friends (men and women). I imagine women cry around women more than women cry around men, and certainly more than men cry around men.My point was that judging someone for not crying around them much seemed weird to me. Granted, it was a strange thing to cry/get upset about, but the rarity of crying doesn't seem like reason to judge someone as narcissistic.

He said after many years he wasn't sure what hypnotism was exactly, or even if it was an identifiable thing at all, and that in a lot of ways he was just giving people license and cover to do stuff they probably wanted to do anyway. You can't hypnotise people to do something they don't want to, apparently.So if he says “Come up on stage and cluck around like a chicken, make a real show of yourself in front of the crowd”, then quite a few people will go and do it and come away saying “That wasn't me, the hypnotist made me do it, but what laugh eh?”.He was less sure how this might apply to (for example) hypnotic pain control, but it was an interesting take.

He could have easily figured this out but didn't, because he preferred to publish this neo-nazi adjacent rhetoric. Nazis use this talking point all the time, you see.I.e. it's not at all about curiosity. Arguably Scott Adams was one of the least curious famous persons in history. His cartoons were based on office related cliches, and while that provides a bit of laughter and relief to people who have negative experiences from office environments it's not based on curiosity or interest in people.

It's also an extremely low effort take on the issue. That entire article can basically be summed up in a sentence, 'I know very little and I have no explanation for why no one is spoon feeding me'. It's characterised by a blatant lack of curiosity, and presenting things that wouldn't come across as particularly ambigous if you actually were curious about them as highly ambigous and contentious.And this tactic is really, really common among far-right activists. 'I'm just a dumb dude asking innocent questions, are things really as they seem or could women be another species that you need a bit of manly coercion to perfect? Is it really the oil or is it natural causes, like this dude in a suit on the telly said it might be? How come there are so many jews among nobelists, isn't that weiuhrd...?'Again and again he's proven that he does not have either the intellectual integrity and rigour to examine subjects he brings up, and that he somehow thinks he's the most appropriate person to do it. His attempt at Dilbert Reborn is itself a good example of this. I'm not sure whether it's a grift or material he tried to put some authenticity into but I also don't really care, he was told both in words and actions that he should be better and as far as I know never tried to be.

Yes, they think that.> and that white people need to re-establish dominance. To them, equality is a threatNo. When a specific group is singled out and attacked, whether they're white, black, or brown, man or woman, that can not be a basis for equality.

People of all races can have legitimate grievances and harms. Im sure some racist black people said ""black is beautiful"", but that isnt a reason to forbid anyone from saying it.

reply

“It's okay to be white” isn't really the same as saying “black is beautiful” because of the context.“It's okay to be white” is spoken in the context of a majority group that has complete societal power over other minority groups, and is speaking the phrase in response to legitimate questions on the majority's privilege over and treatment of those minorities.It also makes a lot less logical sense for the group with the upper hand to complain. It's distasteful: it's like saying “It's okay to be regional vice president! as if you are blind to the fact that you boss everyone else around.”The white majority justice system incarcerates black people for marijuana possession at a higher rate despite a similar use rate.””Yeah but it's okay to be white.”

They weren't surpressed; he was very open about them from very early on in his career as a comic artist; they were central to his “origin story” and were woven directly into the comics. Its just, for a while, other aspects of his still-recent experience in corporate America gave him other relatable things to say that were mixed in with them, which made it easier to overlook them.

Somewhat later (but still quite a while before what people describe as him “turning”), he would also claim his Dilbert show on UPN was cancelled because he was White, making it the third job he lost for that reason. (More likely, it was cancelled because its audience was both small and White and UPN was, looking at where it had successes and wanting a coherent demographic story to sell to advertisers and in an era where synergies between the appeals of shows on the same network was important to driving ratings, working to rearrange its offerings to focus on targeting Black audiences.)

I remember reading (I think in newspaper interview) in the late 1990s his own description of how comics became his full-time focus and his deep resentment of how difficult it had been to advance in management in corporate America because he was a White man in the 1980s (!?!) was pretty central to it.

Similarly he felt his TV show was cancelled after two seasons because it wasn't PC, but his show wasn't getting good viewership and had a terrible time slot. That's a pretty typical trajectory for a TV show, it's like complaining your startup failed.He wrote a lot about explicitly magical thinking. Sort of along the lines of The Secret; that he could achieve things where the odds were against him through sheer force of will and wishing. That's not necessarily a problem but it does set you up for denial when things don't always go your way. And the denial is dangerous.The later chapters of his life were marked by tragedy. His stepson died of overdose. His marriage collapsed. He lost the ability to speak and had to fight like hell to get a proper diagnosis and treatment (he later recovered). He went through COVID like the rest of us. Unfortunately these events would seem to have hardened and radicalized him.I think we can understand and empathize with that without condoning it. I hope he found his peace in the end.

Even if that was true (I don't believe his allegation), that's just _one company_.  He obviously considered himself a very intelligent and capable person, so it seems the obvious next step would be to go work basically anywhere else?  The Dilbert comics never seemed to push the ideal of company loyalty, so I don't think he felt trapped by obligation there.One only needs to look at the upper management and board of any fortune 500 to disprove the idea that only non-white women are getting promoted.

Personally the only time this has happened to me was when I applied to be a bartender and was told there was a quota for men and women and they had recently hired a man. And I just let that one go, partly because it was a lark and not a career move, partly because I could see the logic in it and chalked it up to the inherent seediness of the enterprise, and partly because my identity had opened a lot of doors for me in the past (""you look like Mark Zuckerberg"" was a comment I got when I was hired at my first startup, in a sequence of compliments about my qualifications) so I wasn't bothered by it closing one.I'm open to hearing other experiences though. I'm reserving judgment until I understand the context.

Let me be clear about this, I would definitely assume it did not happen without really strong evidence of the contrary. Based on my assessment of his character and the details of his story.Assuming anything else is giving him way too much credit, and the effect of giving benefit of the doubt here is likely allowing a known racist to spread a false narrative that is based on lies and engineered to sow discontent.

If diversity is your goal, and you have two equally skilled applicants of different sexes, you should choose the under represented applicant. Elastic made the right choice.Likewise at Ubisoft, if you don't explicitly make room for diversity at the top level of the company then you're never going to get to an equitable state.

reply

The Elastic situation wasn't ""two equally skilled applicants"". I'd already been offered and had accepted the position. Rescinding an accepted offer because another candidate better fits demographic targets is materially different from choosing between two candidates at the offer stage.On the broader point: I understand the goal of achieving equitable outcomes. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Explicitly excluding individuals from opportunities based on immutable characteristics, whether in the 1960s or today, remains discrimination, regardless of which direction it flows.If we're serious about equity, we need solutions that don't require accepting discrimination as a necessary tool. Lowering barriers to entry, addressing bias in evaluation, expanding candidate pools, mentorship programmes: these grow the pie rather than just redistributing the slices.The moment you tell someone ""you're qualified, but you're the wrong demographic,"" you've created exactly the kind of experience that radicalises people. I've experienced it. It's corrosive, regardless of how noble the underlying intent.

Sure, elastic handled that poorly, rescinding an offer like that is very unprofessional, but that's an indictment of their HR department and has nothing to do with the gender of the other candidate.I understand where you're coming from, what you're asking for is a gradual transition to equity. But until that transition is done, you're also asking the groups that were systematically discriminated against to endure the effects of that discrimination for longer. And those soft approaches you listed take a looooong time to work, and only while the pie is getting larger.At one of my previous companies they took those soft approaches. The result was that entry level positions were very equitable, but the higher the seniority the higher the percentage of white men. At the rate that the company was hiring and promoting, it would take 150 years to achieve equity at all levels.To be clear, that means asking women to wait 150 years before they have a fair shot at leadership positions.But that was all before 2020. After layoffs hit and the growth stopped the equity transition also stopped because the white dudes at the top weren't willing to step down so women could take their place.You say being discriminated against is corrosive, but what about the corrosion that already happened because of all the discrimination that happened up until now? Are you going to do something about it? Or are you just gonna tell the people corroded to deal with it?

At the rate that the company was hiring and promoting, it would take 150 years to achieve equity at all levels.To be clear, that means asking women to wait 150 years before they have a fair shot at leadership positions.But that was all before 2020. After layoffs hit and the growth stopped the equity transition also stopped because the white dudes at the top weren't willing to step down so women could take their place.You say being discriminated against is corrosive, but what about the corrosion that already happened because of all the discrimination that happened up until now?

On the timeline argument: I'm sceptical of extrapolating current rates to 150-year predictions. Organisations change through leadership turnover, market pressure, and cultural shifts that don't follow linear projections. But I take your point that gradualism has costs for those waiting.Here's where we differ: I don't accept that we must choose between “discrimination now” and “discrimination for 150 years.” That's a false binary. The solutions I mentioned aren't just soft approaches; they're structural changes that can accelerate equity without requiring us to accept discrimination as policy.Your point about white men at the top not stepping down cuts both ways. If the existing leadership won't make space voluntarily, and you implement demographic quotas, you've just created a system where different qualified people are blocked. People like me, who didn't benefit from the original discrimination but are now paying for it.I grew up in generational poverty. As far back as records go, my family has never held money or power. The people you're describing as beneficiaries of historical privilege might share my demographic category, but we share nothing else. Class gets erased in these conversations, and that erasure makes the solutions less effective, not more.What about the corrosion that's already happened? I think about it constantly. But I don't believe the answer is to corrode more people in the opposite direction and call it justice. That's how you get radicalisation and backlash, not equity.

So if this is the system we're stuck with, and it's an unfair system, then let's at least make sure it's equitably unfair.The goal is not to make sure the most qualified person gets the job. I actually think evaluating others fairly is impossible so that's an impossible goal.Sorry if you feel that you got the short end of the stick. I got it too. Someone has to.

You're arguing we should take turns being discriminated against because fixing the system is too hard. I'd rather actually try to reduce the total amount of discrimination instead of just spinning the wheel to see whose turn it is to lose.“Someone has to get the short end” isn't wisdom: it's defeatism, and toxic at that.

Any claim that racism against white men is common has to reconcile this fact. If the system is so biased against them, how do they end up so incredibly overrepresented? Are they so much better than everyone else that they get most of the spots despite this unjust discrimination? Or maybe the bias actually goes the other way.

Adams jumped to Pacific Bell and completed his degree, thinking he was on the fast track to upper management. But in his book, Adams wrote that as was the case at Crocker National, his new employer was also coming under fire for a lack of diversity in its executive ranks.Instead of getting mad, Adams got to drawing. Believing all this was a sign for him to revive his dream of cartooning, he purchased a primer on how to submit a comic strip and went about creating Dilbert.

In fact, growing up in the very affluent part of my city, I saw a bunch of kids die using opiates to mentally escape the weird family fiefdoms where they [p/m]atriarch inexplicably wouldn't ever need for money, so went completely off the rails mentally.  I was prescribed a bunch of opiates (including fent) after a bad ski accident, and can tell you that they basically work by turning down the volume on life around you.  I can understand why someone would turn to them to mentally escape a bad family life.About the only good thing I can say about recreational Xanax is that those kids are generally still alive in contrast to the ones who preferred opiates.

And then he'd get quoted out of context again. I'm not sure if it bothered him, but he started adding preambles to his post, like ""hey suchandsuch publication, if you want to take this post out of context, jump to this part right here and skip the rest.""I stopped reading around this point. But later when he came out with his ""trump is a persuasion god, just like me, and he is playing 4d chess and will be elected president"" schtick, it seemed like the natural conclusion of hill climbing controversy. He couldn't be held accountable for the prediction. After all, he's just a comedian with a background in finance, not a politics guy. But it was a hot take on a hot topic that was trying to press buttons.I'm sure he figured out before most people that being a newspaper cartoonist was a downward-trending gig, and that he'd never fully transition to online.

Is this idea that top 25% is ""very good"" at something innumeracy, or a subtle insight I'm missing? There's got to be a million skills that you could assess rank at -- writing embedded C code, playing basketball, identifying flora, PacMan, archery, bouldering… I can't imagine ever being able to not continue this list -- and you should expect to be in the top 25% of roughly a quarter of those skills, obviously heavily biased towards the ones you've tried, and even more biased towards the ones you care about. It's hard to imagine anyone who's not in the top 25% of skill assessment in a dozen things, let alone two or more…

Everyone (for the sake of my argument) wants to be an engineer at a FAANG but there are tons of folks making more money with more autonomy because they've found a niche that combines their good-enough technical ability with an understanding or interest in an underserved market.

reply

reply

Beyond that, it's not about becoming very good at two different, completely orthogonal things, it's about becoming very good at two things that are complementary in some way that is of value to others.  Being good at PacMan and Bouldering is only particularly valuable if you are competing for opportunities to participate in a hypothetical mixed reality video game, or perhaps a very niche streaming channel.  Being the top quartile of embedded c code, and flora identification could result in building software/hardware tools to identify flora, which is a niche that currently has multiple competing products that are high value to those interested.

The comics often do little to speak to the current corporate world, outside of squeezed in references.As I see it, decline in quality and the political radicalization go hand in hand. You cannot be a good satirist and be so long removed from the world you are satirizing.

In more traditional places of online discussion, things like flamebait is at minimum penalized and often deleted. Posters with strong tendency towards incivility and outright falsehoods get banned.

It could be tuned to elevate content that doesn't pull people into a degenerative cycle, but that's not nearly as profitable and so it's not.

A ""pot with a lid with holes in it"" does not count as a colander:C = 3 (P+C >=3, but is irrelevant to the discussion).  This is larger than the two colanders in my household so you win.Therefore, your more recent comment indicates that you purchased something that would qualify as a colander under situation #1 (either a typical colander, or pot with drainage in the lid) in the roughly 10 hours between your two comments.

I don't agree that this is a clear-cut example of a cautionary tale.  I think for most people it can be a cautionary tale since it's common to chase things that promise hope in a desperate situation.  We also shouldn't dismiss that someone can weigh the risks and take a gamble on something working out.  I don't think there's anything inherently wrong or stupid for someone trying something conventional even if it backfires.It's important to try and see this from Scott's perspective.  According to him, he had his use of his vocal cords restored by a treatment that was highly experimental and during a time when all the official information said there was no treatment.  If we are to believe his words, it worked out for him once, so it makes sense that he would decide to try things that are unconventional when his entire life was at stake.

In general this is not true, for example if you win the lottery the correct path is not normally to spend all of your money on more lottery tickets.There are definitely other valid reasons to take unconventional paths though.

""our findings suggest that once an individual has fully recovered from initial infection, prior SARS CoV-2 infection protects against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and its related negative outcomes. Moreover, the level of effectiveness seemed similar in both the recovered and fully vaccinated cohorts. With a paucity of vaccine doses, this should be one of several aspects that should be considered when deciding whether or not to prioritize vaccination of previously infected adults.""

reply

In fact the advise here is conditional on ""a paucity of vaccine doses"" so they may(not clear one way or the other from your quote) recommend vaccines for people who have natural immunity if there were enough vaccines to go around.

""Nine clinical studies were identified, ...""All of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the protection of full vaccination and natural immunity; and, three studies found superiority of natural immunity.""

Please actually read the linked article instead of creating some false narrative about people falling back into tribalism. Additionally, his claim from his quote is predicated on ignoring the fact that someone who has natural immunity from past exposure didn't die. It also overlooks those who may suffer long term side effects from the virus that a vaccine would help avoid.

reply

Well Scott Adams was in there, venting (in a video) that his life had basically been ruined by his support for Trump, that he'd lost most of his friends and wealth due to it, and that he felt betrayed and felt like a moron for trusting him since it wasn't even worth it.

(There is a bit of confusion around this topic, due to how different groups use the term transgender. Gender activists generally use transgender to mean anyone who identifies as a different gender than the one assigned at birth; laypeople tend to use the term to mean any person who identifies as a different gender than their sex at birth. The difference matters in cases where a biological male is assigned female at birth [or vice versa], as is likely the case for Imane Khelif: in that case, gender activists would consider Khelif intersex but not transgender, since her gender identity as a woman matches her gender assigned at birth, despite the fact that she is biologically male.)To recap for those who have not been following along: Imane Khelif is an Algerian boxer who was assigned female at birth and raised as a girl. She was disqualified from the female division by the International Boxing Association (IBA) after failing two gender verification tests, performed in Turkey and India. The IBA has ties to Russia, and amidst sanctions against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) cut ties with the IBA, and no longer recognized their eligibility judgments. Since the IOC does not perform sex tests of their own, Khelif was allowed to compete and win gold in the women's division at the 2024 Olympics.The argument that the IBA was lying about the sex tests was always quite weak, since it's not clear what the motivation would be: Algeria has traditionally been an ally of Russia rather than the West.But the confirmation that the IBA was right came in 2025, when Imane Khelif refused to take the sex test required to participate in the 2025 world championships. Those were held in the UK and organized by World Boxing, an American organization that is also recognized by the IOC. They also required participants to undergo a sex test (specifically, a noninvasive PCR test to detect presence of the Y chromosone) performed either by the home country or the UK, so no corrupt Russians in the loop. If Khelif was in fact female, this would be the perfect opportunity for her to clear her name and prove to the world once and for all that she was not a male.Of course, the opposite happened. She refused to take the test, and instead filed a lawsuit, claiming that it was unfair that she was required to undergo sex testing (even though all women had to undergo the same simple PCR test) and demanding that she be allowed to participate without a sex test. Her appeal was denied.To any reasonable person this should prove with nigh-certainty that Khelif is male. Exactly as J.K. Rowling asserted based on the more limited evidence available in 2024.> It's fascinating (in a horrid way) what they consider important.It's fascinating (in a horrid way) how gender ideologues are willing to distort and deny reality. Truly Orwellian stuff.And as to importance: this cuts both ways. Why is it so important for gender activists to allow males with DSDs to compete against biological women?

Gender ideologues or genderists believe that whether someone is a man or a woman is determined primarily by that person's gender self-identification (""A woman is anyone who identifies as a woman"").This in contrast with the classic belief, held by radical feminists, J. K. Rowling, and many others, that whether someone is a man or a woman is determined primarily by the physical attributes of their bodies related to biological sex (genetics, hormones, gonads, etc.)

Yes, it's an ATTEMPTED objective take (hamburglar) of a hot take (ryandvm).I'm pointing out that the hot take was more provocative than the objective take was letting on. To me, objective means factual and facts can be determined independently,e.g., if I were to show someone the language ""recognizing aspects they didn't like"" and ask ""What was the preceding language?"", then I'm guessing most people would assume something less personal than ""falling off the cliffs of insanity"".

Indeed, you will not even find people defending factory farming, except as far as they defend the institution, which is part of the status quo and therefore necessary for promulgating the status quo. (Usually something about ""but farmers will have to change their practices!"", as though farmers don't already change their practices so frequently that it's hard to do academic research on farming.) If you want to find something wrong that people will actually defend, in its own capacity, you need to consider examples like bloodsports… but just thinking about what people might say about the topic is no substitute for actually talking to them about it.

If there is a x5 improvement they will get a method to package both drugs together and sell them for x10 the price. You surely want a profesional mix in the high tech lab instead of a random guy mixing tubes in the back room. Another trick is to add something to the molecule like a methyl -CH3, show that the new version is 10% even better and charge x20 for it.So my guess is that there is some problem to use this mix, but as I said I can't find any obvious error and it's really interesting. I'd love to read a better analysis from someone that is an expert in the area.

Desperation isn't partisan, friend.My father was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer and died from its ravages too.

The dead man, whomever is in question, can no longer harm you. He was a man, maybe a husband and father, and speaking ill of them is of no tangible benefit.  To those that respected or loved them, the relationship is gone, and it is not wise to add to their pain.I have been to the funeral of bad men. His earthly power is gone and if there is an afterlife his judgment is sealed.This goes for all enemies and tyrants and criminals. We use the term ""I am sorry for your loss"" because most times the loss is not ours.

I have a terrible toxic belief troubles you. Can I be a member of society just because I believe pineapple on pizza is acceptable?

To me, comments like ""the entire arc of Scott Adams is a cautionary tale"" rings less of vitriol and more of a kind of mourning for who the man became, and the loss of his life (and thus the loss of any chance to grow beyond who he became).That rings empathetic and sorrowful to me, which seems pretty decent in my book.

And it's the framing of the statement that is the problem.  They didn't say ""I disagreed with Scott"" or ""I didn't like Scott"";  they framed it in a way that made it seem like truth.  ""the entire arc of Scott Adams is a cautionary tale"" makes it seem like he did something wrong and there is some universal truth to be had, when it's really just this person disagreed with Scott's political views.

A Final Message From Scott AdamsIf you are reading this, things did not go well for me.I have a few things to say before I go.My body failed before my brain. I am of sound mind as I write this, January 1st, 2026. If you wonder about any of my choices for my estate, or anything else, please know I am free of any coercion or inappropriate influence of any sort. I promise.Next, many of my Christian friends have asked me to find Jesus before I go. I'm not a believer, but I have to admit the risk-reward calculation for doing so looks attractive. So, here I go:I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, and I look forward to spending an eternity with him. The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven. I won't need any more convincing than that. And I hope I am still qualified for entry.With your permission, I'd like to explain something about my life.For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning. That worked. But marriages don't always last forever, and mine eventually ended, in a highly amicable way. I'm grateful for those years and for the people I came to call my family.Once the marriage unwound, I needed a new focus. A new meaning. And so I donated myself to ""the world,"" literally speaking the words out loud in my otherwise silent home. From that point on, I looked for ways I could add the most to people's lives, one way or another.That marked the start of my evolution from Dilbertcartoonist to an author of - what I hoped would be useful books. By then, I believed I had amassed enough life lessons that I could start passing them on. I continued making Dilbert comics, of course.As luck would have it, I'm a good writer. My first book in the ""useful"" genre was How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. That book turned out to be a huge success, often imitated, and influencing a wide variety of people. I still hear every day how much that book changed lives. My plan to be useful was working.I followed up with my book Win Bigly, that trained an army of citizens how to be more persuasive, which they correctly saw as a minor super power. I know that book changed lives because I hear it often.You'll probably never know the impact the book had on the world, but I know, and it pleases me while giving me a sense of meaning that is impossible to describe.My next book, Loserthink, tried to teach people how to think better, especially if they were displaying their thinking on social media. That one didn't put much of a dent in the universe, but I tried.Finally, my book Reframe Your Brain taught readers how to program their own thoughts to make their personal and professional lives better. I was surprised and delighted at how much positive impact that book is having.I also started podcasting a live show called Coffee With Scott Adams, dedicated to helping people think about the world, and their lives, in a more productive way. I didn't plan it this way, but it ended up helping lots of lonely people find a community that made them feel less lonely. Again, that had great meaning for me.I had an amazing life. I gave it everything I had. If you got any benefits from my work, I'm asking you to pay it forward as best you can. That is the legacy I want.Be useful.And please know I loved you all to the end.Scott Adams

And I hope I am still qualified for entry.With your permission, I'd like to explain something about my life.For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning. That worked. But marriages don't always last forever, and mine eventually ended, in a highly amicable way. I'm grateful for those years and for the people I came to call my family.Once the marriage unwound, I needed a new focus. A new meaning. And so I donated myself to ""the world,"" literally speaking the words out loud in my otherwise silent home. From that point on, I looked for ways I could add the most to people's lives, one way or another.That marked the start of my evolution from Dilbertcartoonist to an author of - what I hoped would be useful books. By then, I believed I had amassed enough life lessons that I could start passing them on. I continued making Dilbert comics, of course.As luck would have it, I'm a good writer. My first book in the ""useful"" genre was How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. That book turned out to be a huge success, often imitated, and influencing a wide variety of people. I still hear every day how much that book changed lives. My plan to be useful was working.I followed up with my book Win Bigly, that trained an army of citizens how to be more persuasive, which they correctly saw as a minor super power. I know that book changed lives because I hear it often.You'll probably never know the impact the book had on the world, but I know, and it pleases me while giving me a sense of meaning that is impossible to describe.My next book, Loserthink, tried to teach people how to think better, especially if they were displaying their thinking on social media. That one didn't put much of a dent in the universe, but I tried.Finally, my book Reframe Your Brain taught readers how to program their own thoughts to make their personal and professional lives better. I was surprised and delighted at how much positive impact that book is having.I also started podcasting a live show called Coffee With Scott Adams, dedicated to helping people think about the world, and their lives, in a more productive way. I didn't plan it this way, but it ended up helping lots of lonely people find a community that made them feel less lonely. Again, that had great meaning for me.I had an amazing life. I gave it everything I had. If you got any benefits from my work, I'm asking you to pay it forward as best you can. That is the legacy I want.Be useful.And please know I loved you all to the end.Scott Adams

I have a few things to say before I go.My body failed before my brain. I am of sound mind as I write this, January 1st, 2026. If you wonder about any of my choices for my estate, or anything else, please know I am free of any coercion or inappropriate influence of any sort. I promise.Next, many of my Christian friends have asked me to find Jesus before I go. I'm not a believer, but I have to admit the risk-reward calculation for doing so looks attractive. So, here I go:I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, and I look forward to spending an eternity with him.

That seems to have all changed in this age of the Internet; where every aspect of your life is exposed for all the world to judge (at least if you are famous). All your words (written or spoken) are presented as proof positive that you and your works are not to be tolerated; even if they are from your teenage years.It seems like you cannot say anything these days without offending a large number of people; some of whom will try to lead a boycott against you.I generally like to enjoy a good book, movie, blog, or comic strip without letting politics get in the way.

This is a strawman and absolutely not backed by historical evidence.Look into the lives of Caravaggio, Milton, Voltaire, Wilde, Verlaine, Goya, Balzac, Courbet, Rimbaud, Schubert, Manet, Wagner, Dickens, Zola, Tolstoy... and see how their personal lives and/or political views/positions negatively affected their standing despite the huge recognition their  creative work had.

It's certainly easier once they're dead. I can't speak for everyone, but part of the issue is that we don't want to financially support anyone who is doing bad stuff, so once they're dead I don't have to worry about funding them.Hyperbolic example; suppose David Duke wrote a fantasy novel.  Let's even assume that this fantasy novel had nothing to do with race or politics and was purely just about elves and gnomes and shit. Let's also assume that the novel is ""good"" by any objective measure you're like to use.I would still not want to buy it, because I would be afraid that my money is going to something I don't agree with.

I understand he sought to convert to Christianity in his last days.  I hope he succeeded in finding God — that he understood that there's more to faith in Christ than chanting “I do believe in Jesus!  I do!  I do!”, that it requires identifying and purging the hatred in one's heart and replacing it with the unconditional love Christ exemplified.  That journey is hard enough when you've spent most/all of a lifetime trying to tackle it; deathbed conversions are even harder, with no time to put that newfound unconditional love into practice.  No time for apologies to those harmed, no time for righting one's wrongs — only bare, raw remorse and shame.May Scott Adams rest in peace.  May he be remembered honestly — both for what he got right and what he got wrong.

I don't have an estate to get in order, so to speak. Then again, I also won't pass along a house full of a lifetime of “collections” or “mementos” with little to no monetary value. The oncoming secondary market is about to be awash in Boomer junk. Nobody wants to send their precious collections to the dump or recycling.One of my biggest mental hiccups to work through of late is the changing nature of collective memories, fame, and idols. Scott is a great example who was “big in the 90s” and 30 years later his method (print cartoons and books) is basically dead and can't be folllowed. Gen Z will be spared Scott, and probably Elvis and the Rocky Horror Picture Show, ABBA, and Garth Brooks comparatively speaking.This is a meandering way to note how fast we can be poof gone and life will move on with a pace quite breakneck.

Maybe, maybe not.  My mother died a couple years ago, and while she was too old to be a boomer, she still had plenty of accumulated possessions in her estate.  We sold as much as we could, kept the few things we wanted and had space for, and the rest went to recycling or the dump.  I'd guess 90% went to the dump.The owner of that stuff may not want to send it to the dump.  My mom would be mortified to hear some of the things she treasured held no value for anyone else, but when you're dead, you aren't making those decisions. The next generation probably isn't that sentimental about it.

I was a child and had just read and enjoyed one of his older books, maybe the Dilbert Principle.  I came from a religious household and I was surprised by something in the book that revealed him to be an atheist.I looked up his email, or maybe it was in the back of the book, and wrote him a quick message about how and why he should convert.  He replied to me (unconvinced) and I replied back, at which point he realized I was a child and the conversation ended.When I heard he was dying of cancer I wrote him another email, again offering my own unsolicited thoughts, this time on cancer and experimental treatments.  He did not reply, but I thought there was a kind of symmetry to it -- I wrote him towards the start of my life and again towards the end of his.Interesting guy, I've enjoyed several of his books and the comics for many years.  He had a big impact.  Tough way to die.

Interesting way to put it.

Also I was not implying that you are a libertarian, I don't think that there are many true libertarians.

Secondly, I noted that my comment was made in less than good faith in the edit I left. I stand by the underlying concepts though. It is my impression that OP is a conservative who is afraid to come out as such in a public forum. This bias (I do not use the word pejoratively here) influences their opinion they shared.Third, I invited OP to illustrate where I am wrong. When someone makes strong statements about the morality of a group and refuses to share their own beliefs on the subject, I believe it's appropriate to assume they are biased in some way. If I say “all devs are brain dead keyboard monkeys” and I'm a dev, that context is important to understand my statement. Based on Capt's comment, I made the above assumptions and shared them as I was feeling snarky and felt that they (if true) would be relevant to the larger discussion.Finally, I'm sure I disagree with you on many things but we can disagree without being rude.https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html

Even if you're correct (I don't agree), consider other things: if you look at someone and your body has an instinctive desire to have sex with them, you are obligated to realize that just doing so without regard for consent or other things is not OK.

But rape is the special crime, more special than any other, and the accusation should be enough, right? For that matter, we might even say women who don't report rape to the authorities in a timely manner are denying the accused the right to fight the allegations properly in court, so that the unsubstantiated allegations stain their reputation forever.

That's the funniest thing I've read in weeks.  Leftists cannot get the nerve to band together politically on any kind of consistent basis.  This is a persistent complaint within left-leaning political forums, ""The Democrats are Spineless"".The idea that they are capable of banding together to commit some kind of political genocide is...  hilarious.You don't have to take my word for it.  You can go hang out with some leftists yourself and see.  If you think internet forums are a bit much and you think you'll get banned (first: behave, don't pick fights), you can try a Unitarian church service.

That could be counter-productive. The left wants ""lone wolves"" doing this stuff. Banding together and coordinate action would go too far, it would implicate everyone.

You're describing what they call ""stochastic terrorism"".  To the extent that the left wing practices it (and sure, some do), they learned from the best - the right wing.This is why overwhelmingly domestic terrorism is a right wing phenomena.  It's juuust starting to change this past year with a few attacks which plausibly at least were on the left-wing spectrum.  The small town I live in has a group which practices this - any place which hosts any kind of pro-LGBT even gets protested, and then vandalized or receives bomb threats.  The last year has been better, but it was A Thing People Were Talking About all over the state for a few years.

But to address the point. There may be base instincts to which we are all subject. But that doesn't mean we should embrace them or proudly wear them as a badge. Violence is entirely natural. And yet most will agree it should not be embraced. Someone proudly declaring themselves as violent will (and should!) be judged harshly. I say the same holds true for racism, whether it is ""natural"" or not.Much (all?) of civilisational progress is characterised by moving away from the natural state to a higher strata. The civil part of civilization is entirely unnatural

I think that there's a gap between ""how can it be anything but OK"" and ""should I feel guilty."" There are plenty of things that aren't OK, but about which you don't need to feel guilty. Should you feel guilty that your body intrinsically craves foods that aren't good for you? I'd say that no purpose is served by feeling that way, but that doesn't mean that it's healthy to indulge those cravings.

Honor his life by speaking frankly about how he affected oneself and others, good or bad. Let the chips fall where they may.

In the last 10 years, the modern black lives matter movement has triggered similar violent backlashes, with every public gathering drawing a militarized police response and hateful counter-protesters. On a policy level, even the most milquetoast corporate initiatives to consider applications and promotions from diverse candidates of equal merit are now being slandered and attacked. In education, acknowledgment of historical racial and gender inequality is under heavy censorship pressure.It really does seem like the more effective we are at acting IRL, the greater the backlash is going to be.

I posit that self-reflection might be a better avenue to understanding this world where Steven Miller is in the White House, at least in the immediate.   Personally, I stopped reading Dilbert quite a while before he cancelled himself, just because it wasn't available in a medium that worked for me.  I do have a couple books on the shelf of old Dilbert comics and I considered getting rid of them when the racism came out.   I cracked one open and laughed out loud at a handful of the comics and so the books are still in my house.   I abhor racism, but he already got my money.  At least for me, and maybe I'm damaged, I still laugh at some of the comics, even after I knew he was a jerk.  I think if one of my black friends told me he was offended that I had those books, I'd get rid of them.How about Harry Potter?  I'm certain that there are some folks here who have been hurt by Rowling's statements and I'm also certain that there are some folks here that would sacrifice a limb to live in the Harry Potter universe.   Do you separate the artist from the art or what's the rational thing?   I have the Harry Potter books on my shelf, I've actually read them out loud to my children.  They also are aware of LGTBQ issues, they know and are around LGTBQ people and we have had conversations about those issues.   Is that enough?  Should one of my kids pick up the Dilbert books, I have a conversation locked and loaded and I already know that I've raised them to be anti-racism.  I don't know that I'm super eager to put more money in to J. K.'s pocket,  I probably won't go to Disney Harry Potter Land or whatever they come up with but I've bought and read the books and I haven't burned them.And make no mistake, had I known he was a biggot in 1995, I don't think I would have continued reading Dilbert or ever bought books.  The problem is it made me laugh, then years later I found out he was a jerk and I still laugh at the comics, I remember laughing the first time I read some of them, and I think of that more when I re-read them than I think about Scott Adams.  Fact is, he still made me laugh all those years ago, I can't put that back in the bottle, it happened.

We have made our society shameless. Pornographers, gamblers, and truly creepy people are told that it's fine to be what they are. I dunno, maybe that really is the case. But having abandoned shame as a method of social cohesion, you don't get to resurrect it for those things you dislike. The two-edged sword cuts both ways.I did not follow the Scott Adams brouhaha when it happened, and vaguely I somehow get the impression it's like the Orson Scott Card thing. I'm afraid to check for fear that when I do I will find there was nothing he should've been ashamed for. People use the word ""bigot"" to mean things I can't seem to categories as bigotry.

If the person/people you're speaking with, already followed this public figure, or was forced by society to be aware of the life of this public figure at all times — and so were surely also aware of the bad turn that person's career/life took — then to your audience, the ugliness would have already been long acknowledged. To your audience, the ugliness may be the only thing anyone has spoken about in reference to the public figure for a long time.And, for an audience who became aware of the public figure a bit later on in their lives, the bad stuff might be all they know about them! (Honestly, there are more than a few celebrities that I personally know only as a subject of ongoing public resentment, with no understanding of what made them a celebrity in the first place.)In both of these cases, if this is your audience, then there's no point to carrying on the ""this is a bad person"" reminders during the (usually very short!) mourning period that a public figure gets. They already know.On the other hand, if you presume someone who has no idea who a certain person is, and who is only hearing about them in the context of their death — then yes, sure, remind away.I think, given the audience of ""people in a comment thread on Hacker News about the death of Scott Adams"", people here are likely extremely aware of who Scott Adams is.---That said, on another note, I have a personal philosophy around ""celebrations of life"", that I formed after deciding how to respond to the death of my own father, himself a very complicated man.People generally take the period immediately after someone's death as a chance to put any kind of ongoing negative feelings toward someone on pause for just a moment, to celebrate whatever positive contributions a person made, and extract whatever positive lessons can be learned from those contributions.Note that the dead have no way of benefitting from this. They're dead!If you pay close attention, most of a community does after the death of one of its members, or a society does after the death of a public figure... isn't really a veneration; there is no respect or face given. Rather, what we're doing with our words, is something very much like what the deceased's family are doing   with their hands: digging through the estate of the deceased to find things of value to keep, while discarding the rest. Finding the pearls amongst the mud, washing them off, and taking them home.Certainly, sometimes the only pearl that can be found is a lesson about the kind of person you should strive not to be. But often, there's at least something useful you can take from someone's life — something society doesn't deserve to lose grasp of, just because it was made by or associated with someone we had become soured on.I think it's important to note that if we don't manage to agree to a specific moment to all mutually be okay with doing this ""examination of the positive products of this person's life"" — which especially implies ""staying temporarily silent about the person's shortcomings so as to make space for that examination""... then that moment can never happen. And that's what leads to a great cultural loss of those things that, due to their association with the person, were gradually becoming forgotten.Nobody (save for perhaps a few devoutly religious people) argues that you should never speak ill of the dead. People really just want that one moment — perhaps a week or two long? — to calmly dredge up and leaf through the deceased's legacy like it's a discount bin at a record store, without having to defend themselves at each step of that process from constant accusations that they're ""celebrating a bad person.""And it is our current societal policy that ""right after you die"" is when people should be allowed that one moment.Feel free to call out Adams' bigotry a week from now! The story will still be fresh on people's minds even then.But by giving them a moment first, people will be able to find the space to finally feel it's safe to reminisce about how e.g. they have a fond memory of being gifted a page-a-day Dilbert calendar by their uncle — fundamentally a story about how that helped them to understand and bond with their uncle, not a story about Adams — which wouldn't normally be able to be aired, because it would nevertheless summon someone to remind everyone that the author is a bigot.

People really just want that one moment — perhaps a week or two long? — to calmly dredge up and leaf through the deceased's legacy like it's a discount bin at a record store, without having to defend themselves at each step of that process from constant accusations that they're ""celebrating a bad person.""And it is our current societal policy that ""right after you die"" is when people should be allowed that one moment.Feel free to call out Adams' bigotry a week from now! The story will still be fresh on people's minds even then.But by giving them a moment first, people will be able to find the space to finally feel it's safe to reminisce about how e.g. they have a fond memory of being gifted a page-a-day Dilbert calendar by their uncle — fundamentally a story about how that helped them to understand and bond with their uncle, not a story about Adams — which wouldn't normally be able to be aired, because it would nevertheless summon someone to remind everyone that the author is a bigot.

In both of these cases, if this is your audience, then there's no point to carrying on the ""this is a bad person"" reminders during the (usually very short!) mourning period that a public figure gets. They already know.On the other hand, if you presume someone who has no idea who a certain person is, and who is only hearing about them in the context of their death — then yes, sure, remind away.I think, given the audience of ""people in a comment thread on Hacker News about the death of Scott Adams"", people here are likely extremely aware of who Scott Adams is.---That said, on another note, I have a personal philosophy around ""celebrations of life"", that I formed after deciding how to respond to the death of my own father, himself a very complicated man.People generally take the period immediately after someone's death as a chance to put any kind of ongoing negative feelings toward someone on pause for just a moment, to celebrate whatever positive contributions a person made, and extract whatever positive lessons can be learned from those contributions.Note that the dead have no way of benefitting from this. They're dead!If you pay close attention, most of a community does after the death of one of its members, or a society does after the death of a public figure... isn't really a veneration; there is no respect or face given. Rather, what we're doing with our words, is something very much like what the deceased's family are doing   with their hands: digging through the estate of the deceased to find things of value to keep, while discarding the rest.

And I was responding to a comment that suggested avoiding that by saying that we shouldn't. Hardly random.As for US politics - it's quite obvious that ignoring or tolerating racism and xenophobia has lead to more bigots and assholes feeling comfortable expressing their views publicly. I think we should shame them out of the public sphere again. That includes talking about someone's abject vileness when they die, like with Scott Adams.You, on the other hand, bring up a random unrelated website. Which is random?

- enjoying the work of an unrepentant bigot who died hundreds of years ago, whose work is in the public domain, who does not materially benefit from your spectatorship (what with them being dead and all)- enjoying the work of an unrepentant bigot who is alive today, whose work they have ownership of, who materially benefits from your spectatorship- enjoying the work of an unrepentant bigot who died mere minutes ago, whose work is owned by their estate, whose heirs materially benefit from your spectatorshipI think the first category is fine, the second category is unambiguously not fine, and the third category is ambiguous, but I would err on the side of ""don't consume"".

FWIW, I use to be a big fan of Crystal Castles (like listening to 4+ hours a day for close to a decade). It was a core part of my culture diet. Once it was known that Ethan Kath was a sexual predator that groomed teenage girls, I simply stopped listening or talking about them ever.Why is this hard? IDK, it really feels like people put too much of their identity into cultural objects when they lack real communities and people in their lives.Also throwing it out there, I don't really know much about Scott Adams (or his work for that matter).

Why is this hard? IDK, it really feels like people put too much of their identity into cultural objects when they lack real communities and people in their lives.Also throwing it out there, I don't really know much about Scott Adams (or his work for that matter).

The thing that is wrong about it is that the purity spiral may get out of control and result in wholesale purging of art, Iconoclast-style (or perhaps Cultural Revolution-style).I don't trust people with an instinct to purge history. They rarely know when to stop.Plus, standards change a lot. Picasso had a teenage mistress. It wasn't as scandalous back then. Should we really be so arrogant as to push our current standards on the entire humanity that once was? If yes, we will be obliterated by the next generation that applies the same logic to us, only with a different set of taboos.

We're allowed to avoid consuming the work of artists we think are horrible humans. We're allowed to encourage others to do that too even. None of that is purging or censorship.

You can still stream all of Crystal Castles songs on every platform, you can still buy their music, their albums still have hundreds of seeders on trackers. Just as I'm sure you can buy your Dilbert books.Telling people to maybe look up to better humans, which it needs to be stated have always existed and aren't a modern invention, should be encouraged.One of the other threads in here an OP states that we should use this moment to reflect and do better in our own lives, what is wrong with this viewpoint?We've seen countless examples of people getting sucked into social media holes and I've yet to encounter a single case where this has ever led to healthy outcomes.

Even calling for a boycott or lack of commercialization of something is not purging from history.

Adams was a mediocre bureaucrat who discovered he could make a living as a competent comedian. His success at that persuaded him that he was an Important Moral Authority.He started as a banker and ended as a self-harming prosperity preacher - not exactly a rare archetype in the US.The funny parts were funny. The rest, not so much.

Isn't this rather common in artists? Bono of U2 comes to mind as a very pronounced example.The problem with being a well-known artist is that you have way too many sycophants. Imagine getting dozens of ChatGPT-like fawning messages every day, but from real people, and not just over e-mail, but whenever you stray out of your house and someone recognizes you.That will mess with self-image of almost everyone except the most stoic personalities.

Now, Adams had plenty of opportunities to defend/explain his comments on certain issues, and he did not satisfy many people with those or perhaps dug himself in deeper (I myself really only know him from Dilbert in the 1990s, and am only superficially aware of anything controversial he did/said outside of that).But I don't see anyone saying anything about him now that was not being said when he was alive.

It is hard to remember how thoroughly Trump's presidential run was seen as a joke in 2015. I bet most people can't remember and somehow think they always knew Trump stood a real chance. That is likely a lie.Scott made specific, reasoned, unique arguments about why Trump would win, with high conviction. This was at a time when it was about as non-consensus and unpopular as possible to do so (it wasn't just that people didn't want Trump to win, there was a complete dismissal of the possibility from both sides of the aisle).The fact that Scott was right, and continued to be right when forecasting much about politics, taught me a lot about the nature of the world we live in. Scott clearly understood something important that I did not at the time.

I'm grateful I got to learn about myself in that way.But, then I started to view Dilbert differently. It felt like only some of the characters deserved empathy.

Did I miss a more complex part of Dilbert?I haven't been able to separate who Scott Adams was, or more specifically, the racist things he said, from his cultural commentary, no matter what insights there are. And, I can't admire ""4d chess"" because it feels like it is bragging that you can predict the winner if you throw an alligator and Stephen J Hawking into a pen together.

But as a natural skeptic his impact helped shape me and my career. It worked for me!I don't understand what causes such successful people to take a hard turn toward apparent bigotry.

Scott Adams stuck out to me because his cartoons were funny and sarcastic. His books felt like he was letting me in behind the scenes. He talked to me, the reader about dealing with large amounts (for the time) traffic to his website in a honest, funny and simple way.His books also had a link to his website, which was pretty unique for a non-technical book at the time.I also quite liked his TV show.I stopped reading them regularly as I grew up. I would see the odd salient dilbert in slack or email.during the trump primary, thats when I bumped into his other side. It was heart breaking to see someone who made what I thought was such observant cartoons shit out such bile.

So, here I go:I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, and I look forward to spending an eternity with him. The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven. I won't need any more convincing than that. And I hope I am still qualified for entry.

If a person presented themselves for the Catholic/Orthodox catechumenate with the caveat ""I'm not a believer but..."", a director with a good humor would reply with something like: ""Of course you're not, not yet, supernatural faith is a gift received in Holy Baptism.""Now, if at the end of the catechumenate (several months) the person admits they can't really offer intellectual assent to what they've been taught, that it boils down to their wanting to hedge their bets and that's all, then the director is going to speak to the priest of the parish, and more than likely the priest is going to meet with the person and tell them they're not prepared for baptism.There are time crunched situations and emergency baptisms, for sure, but even then for an adult asking to be baptized, there generally needs to be a profession of intellectual assent (""I believe..."") and an express openness to the gift of faith.Someone I know recently joined the Catholic Church, in the setting of a community that uses the ""pre Vatican 2"" forms.

Now faith demands that you worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons one with the other, nor making a distinction in their nature. For the Father is a distinct Person, so also the Son, so also the Holy Spirit; yet all Three possess the one nature, the one Godhead.Do you renounce Satan?I do renounce him.And all his works?I do renounce them.And all his attractions?I do renounce them.Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?I do believe.Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?I do believe.Do you also believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?I do believe.Receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Put your whole trust in the heavenly teachings. And lead a life that will truly fit you to be a dwelling place for God. On entering God's Church acknowledge with joy that you have escaped the clutches of death. Worship God the Father almighty, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, our Lord, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.Let us pray. I entreat you, blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, to point out the way of truth and godly knowledge to these servants of yours who grope in uncertainty and doubt in the darkness of this world.

There are time crunched situations and emergency baptisms, for sure, but even then for an adult asking to be baptized, there generally needs to be a profession of intellectual assent (""I believe..."") and an express openness to the gift of faith.Someone I know recently joined the Catholic Church, in the setting of a community that uses the ""pre Vatican 2"" forms. Here are the questions-answers that are asked in the public setting (liturgy/rite) of the Sacrament of Holy Baptism in the older form:What are you asking of God's church?Faith.What does faith hold out to you?Everlasting life.If, then, you wish to inherit everlasting life, keep the commandments, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets. Now faith demands that you worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons one with the other, nor making a distinction in their nature. For the Father is a distinct Person, so also the Son, so also the Holy Spirit; yet all Three possess the one nature, the one Godhead.Do you renounce Satan?I do renounce him.And all his works?I do renounce them.And all his attractions?I do renounce them.Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?I do believe.Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?I do believe.Do you also believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?I do believe.Receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Put your whole trust in the heavenly teachings. And lead a life that will truly fit you to be a dwelling place for God. On entering God's Church acknowledge with joy that you have escaped the clutches of death. Worship God the Father almighty, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, our Lord, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.Let us pray. I entreat you, blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, to point out the way of truth and godly knowledge to these servants of yours who grope in uncertainty and doubt in the darkness of this world. Open their inner sight, the better to see you as the one God, the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father, in union with the Holy Spirit. May it be their good fortune to enjoy the fruit of this avowal both now and forevermore; through Christ our Lord.I sign you on the brow that you may take up the cross of our Lord. I sign you on the ears that you may listen to the heavenly teachings. I sign you on the eyes that you may see the grandeur of God. I sign you on the nostrils that you may sense the sweet fragrance of Christ. I sign you on the mouth that you may proclaim the word of life. I sign you on the breast that you may believe in God. I sign you on the shoulders that you may take on you the yoke of His service.

The almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has caused you to be born over again of water and the Holy Spirit and pardoned you all your sins. May he now anoint you with the chrism that sanctifies in Christ Jesus our Lord, and bring you to everlasting life.

Open their inner sight, the better to see you as the one God, the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father, in union with the Holy Spirit. May it be their good fortune to enjoy the fruit of this avowal both now and forevermore; through Christ our Lord.I sign you on the brow that you may take up the cross of our Lord. I sign you on the ears that you may listen to the heavenly teachings. I sign you on the eyes that you may see the grandeur of God. I sign you on the nostrils that you may sense the sweet fragrance of Christ. I sign you on the mouth that you may proclaim the word of life. I sign you on the breast that you may believe in God. I sign you on the shoulders that you may take on you the yoke of His service. I sign you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, that you may come to your eternal destiny and have life without end.[ Many more prayers and blessings ]Do you wish to be baptized?I do.I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has caused you to be born over again of water and the Holy Spirit and pardoned you all your sins. May he now anoint you with the chrism that sanctifies in Christ Jesus our Lord, and bring you to everlasting life. Take this white robe and keep it spotless until you arrive at the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may be rewarded with everlasting life. Take this burning candle as a reminder to keep your baptismal innocence. Obey God's commandments, so that when our Lord comes for the joyous wedding feast you may go forth to meet Him with all the saints in the halls of heaven, and be happy with Him forevermore.

My very limited personal memories of him are not the one of a kind person, though.He might have had just a very bad day, but I had to endure this guy on a six-hour flight in the early 2000s, and after he insulted basically everyone from Hispanic people to people of colour and even shushed the lady behind us when she said she can't listen to his bullshit anymore, I took a deep breath, looked him in the eyes, and told him I fought in two wars, and the only thing that happens if you keep hate for your ""enemies"" in your heart is that it will eat you from the inside. Let it go.I wished him the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to know the one from the other.He laughed right in my face and told me I don't get it and that he is going to die of old age. He was for sure a fighter and stubborn of his own views.But in the end, he died at a young age, with hate-fuelled cancer inside his prostate and bones suffering from the same mental condition millions of people on the Internet do day by day.People are disturbed not by things but by their view of things.
And People already knew 1846 years ago it is how it is.Marcus Aurelius started each day telling himself: ‘I shall meet with meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable people.'Nothing has changed but the Theater.People now decide to be disturbed by their view of things over the internet, things that will not matter in their whole lifetime for them personally in real life, and Scott Adams is unfortunately the perfect example.He was disturbed by his view, that half of people of colour in the US were ungrateful and ""anti-white"", tho he lived to the age of 68 without ever being harmed by a single black person in his life, as far as I know.The death of Scott Adams is many things at once. A tragedy, a warning, and a foreshadowing of what happens if you cannot accept the world as it is and just be happy with what you got.Life is precious. Don't throw it away keeping hate in your heart and enemies in your head, trying to change how the world works or what our species is, a bunch of assholes all sharing the same fate.Deal with it or die miserably like Scott.

But then the way he dealt with his cancer make me reconsider. Adams publicly acknowledged trying ivermectin and fenbendazole as alternative cancer treatments, which he later declared ineffective, before pursuing conventional medical care in his final months. Unfortunately by then it's too late.https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Engineers_and_wooSomething is wrong with us engineers. We need to have less magical thinking.

Back when Dilbert was massive my company ran the following ad in cinemas in Silicon Valley: https://imgur.com/a/ZPVJau8 Everyone seeing that ad knew what we were referring to.

reply

The problems come when the author believes this about themselves. They probably are smart, and Adams' work is enjoyed because he cleverly recognizes and points out stuff that resonates with people. When this is strongly reinforced, too much, too long, I think it's really unhealthy for some people. Adams seemed to need to show that his thought could not be constrained by convention. He got strong, addictive attention for this. He wanted to be thought of as smart, rather than good.I think the antidote, or at least a protective, to this is being surrounded by people who impress you more than you impress yourself.[Edit: removed a couple of examples of other smart people to avoid stimulating their fans and haters]

I remember how he predicted Trump's victory all the way back in 2015, early in the primaries. He argues that Trump (and Kanye, for that matter) were super-convincers who used mass hypnosis techniques. Sounds utterly bizarre, and yet mass hypnosis struck me as the only possible explanation of Trump's popularity. Because there were certainly no rational arguments for it.And yet, this seemingly critical (if unhinged) thinker who claimed to see through those alleged hypnosis techniques, somehow fell for it.I don't think I'll ever understand Scott Adams.

He went from Illinois state senator (7 years) to US senator (4 years) to President. A prodigious rise, but hardly non-traditional or inexperienced. The equivalent of a new grad at a FAANG becoming a director or VP within a decade.

reply

But that's not my point. My point is that Scott Adams identified it, which to me sounds like recognizing it as fake and manipulation. And yet he supported the guy. That's the thing I really don't get. Then again, JD Vance called him the American Hitler and is now his VP. Many of his most loyal lackeys have called him terrible things. People are easily corruptible, I guess. Or recognize in him a useful tool for their own worst goals.

A cyberattack targeting an oncology journal has taken it offline that published a peer-reviewed study from Tufts and Brown University exploring links of COVID injections to newly diagnosed or rapidly worsened cancer shortly after COVID injections. Did this have anything to do with your cancer? It doesn't seem like this kind of question is allowed to be entertained either.In the early 2000s we would say that the Internet sees censorship as a network failure and routes around it. Now we see that was wishful thinking. The Network Effect prefers centralization and the government prefers subtle control and liability shields held by corporations.

We had billions of COVID shots. Even if there was a weak correlation with 1% of the people going on to get rapidly worsening cancer we'd be seeing cancer spikes everywhere. Do we have anything remotely close to that in real life?Why'd you call him Clott Adams?

reply

I met several people working in cancer medicine, and they tell me that they're seeing the spikes. And some statistics showed very early that something is wrong. But chances are low you'll read anything about that in the media.Look around and see who is dying. It's an old saying about wars that people will not bother to check if something is going wrong before not at least 5-10% of the population have died.

An example that I like (that doesn't include WWII Germans) is William Shockley. He was a pretty horrible person all told. He didn't kill anyone, he was just a shitty guy. And yet the world owes him a debt for accurately describing how semiconductors work at the atomic level. Silicon Valley basically wouldn't exist without him.Adams is like that as well. His work was funny and insightful, his politics were abhorrent. He will always have an asterisk next to his name in the history books because of it.(Not that anyone will care about Dilbert in another decade or so. Much of it today is already about a moment in business that is long past).

I'm trans, I'm autistic, and I caught on how bad he was day one, as his comics had a very specific slant to them that felt less like truly looking at workplace dynamics, and more acting misanthropic and aggrieved.I get you might have not caught on so soon - I'd call myself lucky - but you had plenty of time to figure out that not only he isn't good, but also never was.

Myself, I remember seeing a YouTube video of people being asked “is it OK to be white?”, the same polling question that Scott Adams reacted to (I suppose) angrily/fearfully when only 53% of black people responded affirmatively.  The question landed differently in video form because you could see the individuals in question: they were clearly individuals, even if you could lump them into categories if you wanted to.I remember a few.  There was an elderly black couple who looked happy in their long marriage, who I'd guess to be church goers, who found the question a bit preposterous: of course there's nothing inherently wrong with the color of anyone's skin.  There were belligerent whites who bristled at the implication that someone would suggest that something was inherently wrong with them.  There were white liberals who weren't sure that there wasn't something inherently wrong in them, their inner conflict plain on their faces.One black woman stands out in my memory, because I took minutes to pause the video and reflect on how she made me feel (as a white man who thinks it's racist to judge anyone by the color of their skin).  She was vehemently, virulently of the opinion that it's not at all OK to be white.  Or so it appeared; maybe she was doubling down for the camera.  Her friend was embarrassed and didn't feel comfortable to offer her own opinion.I found this woman's ugly opinion to be personally hurtful, and I found it worthwhile to look inward to the parts that felt judged, that felt unseen, that felt afraid.  I knew that it wasn't representative of all black people, but it still hurt.  I understand the history that lead (mislead) her to such an outlook, but that understanding didn't lead to immediate empathy; I was repulsed by her ignorance and hate (not the color of her skin, it should go without saying).  I closed my eyes and breathed until I found empathy for her.  I just repeated the same exercise; the empathy came more easily this time.In light of this memory, I also have empathy for Scott Adams.  When faced with rejection of whiteness, unfortunately he responded (very publicly!) with fear and (what has been characterized, and may be) racism.  I don't agree with him, but I understand the pain that he was reacting to.  And therefore I can't be so quick to judge him as a “piece of shit”, when there are numerous people (dozens! lol) in this conversation who have had direct personal experience with him, and found him to be a caring and helpful individual.  Maybe he wasn't a total piece of shit, maybe he was just afraid.

Scott Adams said some really stupid, poorly thought out things about minorities and women, and he faced real world consequences for his actions. But he also died slowly and painfully of cancer, and he died crying out for help very publicly.

René Girard explained this mechanism in his mimetic theory and the scapegoat mechanism. People here on hacker news are generally not fully formed human beings, and they instinctively believe that the more they group together in hate against different individuals, the more they will personally benefit. You see it here in every thread, no matter what subject.

reply

Or may be he did know that there would be consequences? Many people who are financially secure do make provocative statements. I think he did many of us a favor, because many of us still have to earn a living and cannot speak out.

That is exactly what I mean about making bigotry shameful again. You should worry about losing your job, and your friends and family, for that.If you stay quiet about your hateful views, then others are more likely too, and maybe some day we can eventually, slowly, move past all of you.

He said ONE THING in his entire career that you can point to as being racist, which, even as it is has context removed that it was in response to a black poll against white people…Just stop and admit you claim he was “deeply problematic” because he was a conservative.

I recall having a ""huh?"" moment when I once saw the titular character say that there's no evidence for climate change.The strangest thing is that I hail from a particularly conservative region of the world and I've met many such Scotts Adamses in college (some of whom went on to work in FAANG companies). I don't share these views and I could never wrap my head around the idea that a clearly intelligent and often otherwise kind person could be like this.

The ivermectin hysteria has been going on since 2020. There are still large political bubbles where people believe ivermectin is a cure-all, and he was in that bubble when he was diagnosed.The evidence is in his public statements. He is on video on the matter, and he has publicly stated elsewhere he that he tried ivermectin and fenbendazole at first. (They didn't work.) Here is him describing how he rejected ADT at first, and how taking it worked a lot: https://x.com/jayplemons/status/1939769665527718024(I can't view the above video myself, since I have X blocked on my network, and the transcript is too long to post here. In short, he notes that he rejected ADT, but then started it when he realized it would ease his symptoms even if not cure him. He found his symptoms did indeed ease.)The problem isn't that he completely ditched conventional medicine, it's that he didn't start conventional medicine immediately. And his appeal for Pluvicto only came in November.Cancer is more survivable the earlier treatment starts. He delayed it for no reason at all. If he didn't start treatment at all, he probably have died earlier. If he didn't reject treatment at all, he probably would still be alive today, possibly even cancer-free.

The reality is that there are tens of millions of racists in the United States. In fact, they put a group of Christian Nationalist (Nat-C) white supremacists in the White House.It's not a Scott Adams problem in particular, and trying to make the issue just about him is a cop out.Loved Dilbert anyway.

The logical advice to respond to that climate would be to act with dignity and treat other people like you'd like to be treated. To reach out and integrate, and build community. Doing that eventually solves the problem, even if it takes time and energy.“Staying away” just ensures perpetual hate and division. It's stupid advice. America literally tried that already and it didn't work.And this is all before we unpack the factual validity of these claims, and the underlying causes of that climate if those claims are really true.I'm amazed at how many people are jumping to this guy's defense. He doesn't need his reputation defended, he dug his own hole.

Wherever you have to go, just get away"".I guess we could discuss whether this is straight up racist, but it sounds pretty bad to me.

Silence allows the messages of hatred to spread more loudly and more rapidly; if you leave fascists along they become emboldened and push the lines even further.  We've seen this over and over, both historically and in America today.

Do not install aluminum wire if you are a homeowner unless you already know enough to use antioxidant paste and also to use a torque screwdriver for terminations and know where to find the torque values for the wiring devices you are using. If you don't apply the paste, the surface of the aluminum will oxidize and eventually likely catch fire if it remains existing long enough.I suggest not even touching copper as a homeowner, but it's your choice and your house.

In reality copper is just convenient. We use it because it's easy to work with, a great conductor, and (until recently) quite affordable. But for most applications there's no reason we couldn't use something else!For example, a 1.5mm2 copper conductor is 0.0134kg/m, which at current prices is $0.17 / meter. A 2.4mm2 aluminum conductor has the same resistance, weighs 0.0065kg/m, which at current prices is $0.0195 / meter!Sure, aluminum is a pain to work with, but with a price premium like that there's a massive incentive to find a way to make it work.Copper can't get too expensive simply due to power demands because people will just switch to aluminum. The power grid itself had been using it for decades, after all - some internal datacenter busbars should be doable as well.

Residential aluminum is a Really Bad Idea because DIY Dave will inevitably do something wrong - which then leads to a fire hazard. Copper is a lot more forgiving.But a large scale datacenter, solar farm, or battery storage installation? Those will be installed and maintained by trained electricians, which means they actually know what a ""torque wrench"" is, and how to deal with scary words like ""corrosion"" and ""oxidation"".Like I said: it's what's used for most of the power grid.

Do most people even have desktop computers anymore, or have they mostly been replaced by laptops, tables, and phones?  I'd be interested to see the efficiency numbers for electric clothes dryers over time.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are also slightly more efficient than older models, even if they are still using resistance heating.  Due to smarter electronics that automatically turn the unit off after the clothes are dry (air humidity sensor).  I think electric ranges, dish washers, toasters and coffee machines have been ubiquitous since the 1960s (but are probably about the same energy-consumption wise).  Air conditioning units are one thing that I'd believe are much more common today than in the 1970s and 1980s. Household sizes are also smaller, so less electricity used for electric water heaters, and the oven, etc..  Electric vehicles are an up and coming user of electricity.  What other appliances are likely to be using more now than before?

Standard small-house service used to be 60A, sometimes as few as 4 circuits! It's now 100A minimum by code, with 200A common.Ovens/ranges have gone from 30A to 50A (dedicated) circuits by code. Microwaves also require dedicated circuits now. Gaming computers with big GPUs are common. Air fryers and electric pressure cookers are newly-common countertop appliances. People definitely use resistive electric space heaters more now (very cheap, much safer than the older options). And there's a trend away from gas and to electric ranges and water heaters. Heat pumps are also increasingly common. You mentioned air conditioners and EV chargers. Kitchens and bathrooms are now required to have dedicated (and GFCI) circuits. Household sizes are smaller, but houses are larger.So I guess I'd say that, properly expanded, individual circuits should carry less current than they used to. But very often, appliances (AC, microwave, gaming rig, air fryers), are just ""plugged in"" to an unexpanded system, with varying results.If you're lucky, they pop a breaker and you call an electrician. If you're not lucky, they push the power draw into uncomfortable zones, esp for Al wire.

I don't track that market (not a gamer), but it seemed substantial enough that I was aware of it. I do travel in geeky circles though.Also, plasma TVs were big for a decade or so, and they run hotter than the CRTs that preceded them, or the LCDs/etc of today.

I can't think of a single appliance from 1970 that consumes less energy than its modern equivalent. Anything with a pump or fan is more efficient and so is lighting. LCD TVs use less energy than CRTs.I also can't think of an appliance that has become common in households that draws more than 100 watts since the 1970 aside from just ‘computers'.If you convert your natural gas furnace to a heat pump, you will use more electricity but excluding that and NG to electric HPWHs leaves only more efficient equipment.

Aluminum has a higher resistance, which means the same diameter will get hotter than copper. Make the cable thicker and its resistance drops, which means it gets less hot.Want more amps at the same temperature? Ohm's law still applies: just use a thicker cable.

Really?  In larger sizes, an equivalent ampacity aluminum cable is generally lighter and more flexible than copper. The main downside is that it's thicker.(Common terminations for larger wire sizes are often dual-rated for aluminum and copper. The engineering details for how to design lugs that work well for aluminum and copper were worked out long ago.)

Look at the electrical fires of the 1950's and 1960's as an example, and that was at household levels of current.Aluminum is used, but everything accounts for the insane coefficient of linear expansion and other annoying properties.

Each feeder can be aluminum if you put special goop on any copper connections.  Breakers accept it just fine, etc.You should avoid it for smaller wiring, though.  There's special 8000 series aluminum if you're trying to be serious with Al feeders

Sure, using or not using your brain is a negligible energy difference, so if you aren't using it you really should, for energy efficiency's sake. But I don't think the claim that our brains are more energy efficient is obviously true on its own. The issue is more about induced demand from having all this external ""thinking"" capacity on your fingertips

reply

So, this is rather complex because you can turn AI energy usage to nearly zero when not in use. Humans have this problem of needing  to consume a large amount of resources for 18-24 years with very little useful output during that time, and have to be kept running 24/7 otherwise you lose your investment. And even then there is a lot of risk they are going to be gibbering idiots and represent a net loss of your resource expenditure.For this I have a modern Modest Proposal they we use young children as feed stock for biofuel generation before they become a resource sink. Not only do you save the child from a life of being a wage slave, you can now power your AI data center. I propose we call this the Matrix Efficiency Saving System (MESS).

I agree with your point about induced demand. The “win” wouldn't be looking at a single press release with already-suspect numbers, but rather looking at essentially all press releases of note, a task not generally valuable enough to devote people towards.That being said, we normally consider it progress when we can use mechanical or electrical energy to replace or augment human work.

Gas-law calculations were where I first encountered this bit of scariness.  It was quite a while ago, and I imagine the behavior has been RLHF'ed or otherwise tweaked to be less of a problem by now.  Still, worth watching out for.

Yes, but I would also expect the training data to include tons of examples of students doing unit-conversion homework, resources explaining the concept, etc. (So I would expect the embedding space to naturally include dimensions that represent some kind of metric-system-ness, because of data talking about the metric system.) And I understand the LLMs can somehow do arithmetic reasonably well (though it matters for some reason how big the numbers are, so presumably the internal logic is rather different from textbook algorithms), even without tool use.

But bus bars generally should be protected regardless of voltage as they carry currents from high current capacity sources so even a lower voltage can be a safety concern.Many server power supplies can take AC or DC input, with the DC input in the 300-500V range as this is comparable to the boost voltage for the AC power factor correction circuit. I just assumed most data centers using DC would be distributing around 400V within each rack.

Even among engineering fields routine handling of diverse and messy unit systems (e.g. chemical engineering) are relatively uncommon. If you work in one of these domains, there is a practiced discipline to detect unit conversion mistakes. You can do it in your head well enough to notice when something seems off but it requires encyclopedic knowledge that the average person is unlikely to have.A common form of this is a press release that suggests a prototype process can scale up to solve some planetary problem. In many cases you can quickly estimate that planetary scale would require some part of the upstream inputs to be orders of magnitude larger than exists or is feasible. The media doesn't notice this part and runs with the ""save the planet"" story.This is the industrial chemistry version of the ""in mice"" press releases in medicine. It is an analogue to the Gell-Mann amnesia effect.

You mention you've done work for public transit - well, if public transit documentation suddenly starts being terrible, will it lead to an immediate, noticeable drop in revenue? Doubt it. Firing the technical writer however has an immediate and quantifiable effect on the budget.Apply the same for software (have you seen how bad tech is lately?) or basically any kind of vertical with a nontrivial barrier to entry where someone can't just say ""this sucks and I'm gonna build a better one in a weekend"".

I don't work for the public transit company; I introduce immigrants to Berlin's public transit. To answer to the broader question, good documentation is one of the many little things that affect how you feel about a company. The BVG clearly cares about that, because their marketing department is famously competent. Good documentation also means that fewer people will queue at their service centre and waste an employee's time. Documentation is the cheaper form of customer service.Besides, how people feels about the public transit company does matter, because their funding is partly a political question. No one will come to defend a much-hated, customer-hostile service.

No, but the availability (more people can afford it) and diversity (different needs are met) increased. I would say that's a positive.

When it became cheaper to mass produce sneakers, tshirts, and anything, the quality of the individual product probably did go down, but more people around the world were able to afford the product, which raised the standard of living for people in the aggregate.  Now,  if these products were absolute trash, life wouldn't make much sense, but there's a friction point in there between high quality and trash, where things are acceptable and affordable to the many.  Making things cheaper isn't a net negative for human progress: hitting that friction point of acceptable affordability helps spread progress more democratically and raise the standard of living.The question at hand is whether AI can more affordably produce acceptable technical writing, or if it's trash.  My own experiences with AI make me think that it won't produce acceptable results, because you never know when AI is lying: catching those errors requires someone who might as well just write the documentation.  But, if it could produce truthful technical writing affordably, that would not be a bad thing for humanity.

It introduces a lower barrier to entry, so more low-quality things are also created, but it also increases the quality of the higher-tier as well. It's important to note that in FOSS, we (Or atleast...I) don't generally care who wrote the code, as long as it compiles and isn't malicious. This overlays with the original discussion...If I was paying you to read your posts, I expect them to be hand-written. If I'm paying for software, it better not be AI Slop. If you're offering me something for free, I'm not really in a position to complain about the quality.It's undeniable that, especially in software, cheaper costs and a lower barrier to get started will bring more great FOSS software. This is like one of the pillars of FOSS, right? That's how we got LetsEncrypt, OpenDNS, etc. It will also 100% bring more slop. Both can be true at the same time.

I truly don't see this happening anymore. Maybe it did before?If there's real competition, maybe this does happen. We don't have it and it'll never last in capitalism since one or a few companies will always win at some point.If you're a higher tier X, cheaper processes means you'll just enjoy bigger profit margins and eventually decide to start the enshittification phase since you're a monopoly/oligopoly, so why not?As for FOSS, well, we'll have more crappy AI generated apps that are full of vulnerabilities and will become unmaintainable. We already have hordes of garbage ""contributions"" to FOSS generated by these AI systems worsening the lives of maintainers.Is that really higher quality? I reckon it's only higher quantity with more potential to lower quality of even higher-tier software.

Nowadays the problem is that both technical and legal means are used to prevent adversarial interoperability. It doesn't matter if you (or AI) can write software faster if said software is unable to interface with the thing everyone else uses.

I'd argue that this started 30  years ago when automated phone trees started replacing the first line of workers and making users figure out how to navigate where they needed to in order to get the service they needed.I can't remember if chat bots or ""knowledge bases"" came first, but that was the next step in the ""figure it out yourself"" attitude corporations adopted (under the guise of empowering users to ""self help"").Then we started letting corporations use the ""we're just too big to actually have humans deal with things"" excuse (eg online moderation, or paid services with basically no support).And all these companies look at each other to see who can lower the bar next and jump on the bandwagon.It's one of my ""favorite"" rants, I guess.The way I see this next era going is that it's basically going to become exclusively the users' responsibility to figure out how to talk to the bots to solve any issue they have.

AI-made documentation has 0% of the quality.As the OP pointed, AI can only document things that somebody already wrote down. That's no documentation at all.

First, I understand what you're saying and generally agree with it, in the sense that that is how the organization will ""experience"" it.However, the answer to ""will it lead to a noticeable drop in revenue"" is actually yes. The problem is that it won't lead to a traceable drop in revenue. You may see the numbers go down. But the numbers don't come with labels why. You may go out and ask users why they are using your service less, but people are generally very terrible at explaining why they do anything, and few of them will be able to tell you ""your documentation is just terrible and everything confuses me"". They'll tell you a variety of cognitively available stories, like the place is dirty or crowded or loud or the vending machines are always broken, but they're terrible at identifying the real root causes.This sort of thing is why not only is everything enshittifying, but even as the entire world enshittifies, everybody's metrics are going up up up. It takes leadership willing to go against the numbers a bit to say, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we provide quality documentation, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we use screws that don't rust after six months, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we don't take the cheapest bidder every single time for every single thing in our product but put a bit of extra money in the right place. Otherwise you just get enshittification-by-numbers until you eventually go under and get outcompeted and can't figure out why because all your numbers just kept going up.

That's one way to frame it. An other one is, sometime people are stuck in a situation where all options that come to their mind have repulsive consequences.As always some consequences are deemed more immediate, and other will seem remoter. And often the incentives can be quite at odd between expectations in the short/long terms.>this sucks and I'm gonna build a better one in a weekendHey, this is me looking at the world this morning.

Coding is like writing documentation for the computer to read. It is common to say that you should write documentation any idiot can understand, and compared to people, computers really are idiots that do exactly as you say with a complete lack of common sense. Computers understand nothing, so all the understanding has to come from the programmer, which is his actual job.Just because LLMs can produce grammatically correct sentences doesn't mean they can write proper documentation. In the same way, just because they are able to produce code that compiles doesn't mean they can write the program the user needs.

I completely agree that the ambitions of AI proponents to replace workers is insulting.  You hit the nail on the head with pointing out that we simply dont write everything down.  And the more common sense / well known something is the less likely it is to be written down, yet the more likely it might be needed by an AI to align itself properly.

That's not sufficient, at least from the likes of OpenAI, because, realistically, that's a liability that would go away in bankruptcy. Companies aren't going to want to depend on it. People _might_ take, say, _Microsoft_ up on that, but Microsoft wouldn't offer it.

I call it the banana bread problem.To curate a list of the best cafés in your city, someone must eventually go out and try a few of them. A human being with taste honed by years of sensory experiences will have to order a coffee, sit down, appreciate the vibe, and taste the banana bread.At some point, you need someone to go out in the world and feel things. A machine that cannot feel will never be a good curator of human experiences.

You may enjoy this story about her work:https://www.folklore.org/Inside_Macintosh.htmlAs a counterpoint, the very worst ""documentation"" (scare quotes intended) I've ever seen was when I worked at IBM. We were all required to participate in a corporate training about IBM's Watson coding assistant. (We weren't allowed to use external AIs in our work.)As an exercise, one of my colleagues asked the coding assistant to write documentation for a Python source file I'd written for the QA team. This code implemented a concept of a ""test suite"", which was a CSV file listing a collection of ""test sets"". Each test set was a CSV file listing any number of individual tests.The code was straightforward, easy to read and well-commented. There was an outer loop to read each line of the test suite and get the filename of a test set, and an inner loop to read each line of the test set and run the test.The coding assistant hallucinated away the nested loop and just described the outer loop as going through a test suite and running each test.There were a number of small helper functions with docstrings and comments and type hints. (We type hinted everything and used mypy and other tools to enforce this.)The assistant wrote its own ""documentation"" for each of these functions in this form:""The 'foo' function takes a 'bar' parameter as input and returns a 'baz'""Dude, anyone reading the code could have told you that!All of this ""documentation"" was lumped together in a massive wall of text at the top of the source file. So:When you're reading the docs, you're not reading the code.When you're reading the code, you're not reading the docs.Even worse, whenever someone updates the actual code and its internal documentation, they are unlikely to update the generated ""documentation"". So it started out bad and would get worse over time.Note that this Python source file didn't implement an API where an external user might want a concise summary of each API function. It was an internal module where anyone working on it would go to the actual code to understand it.

- Most people don't communicate as thoroughly and complete - written and verbal - as they think they do. Very often there is what I call ""assumptive communication"". That is, sender's ambiguity that's resolved by the receiver making assumptions about what was REALLY meant. Often, filling in the blanks is easy to do - as it's done all the time - but not always. The resolution doesn't change the fact there was ambiguity at the root.Next time you're communicating, listen carefully. Make note of how often the other person sends something that could be interpreted differently, how often you assume by using the default of ""what they likely meant was...""- That said, AI might not replace people like you. Or me? But it's an improvement for the majority of people. AI isn't perfect, hardly. But most people don't have the skills a/o willingness to communicate at a level AI can simulate. Improved communication is not easy. People generally want ease and comfort. AI is their answer. They believe you are replaceable because it replaces them and they assume they're good communicators. Classic Dunning-Kruger.p.s. One of my fave comms' heuristics is from Frank Luntz*:""It's not what you say, it's what they hear."" (<< edit was changing to ""say"" from ""said"".)One of the keys to improved comms is to embrace that clarify and completeness is the sole responsibility of the sender, not the receiver. Some people don't want to hear that, and be accountable, especially then assumption communication is a viable shortcut.* Note: I'm not a fan of his politics, and perhaps he's not The Source of this heuristic, but read it first in his ""Words That Work"". The first chapter of ""WTW"" is evergreen comms gold.

The kind of documentation no one reads, that is just here to please some manager, or meet some compliance requirement. These are, unfortunately, the most common kind I see, by volume. Usually, they are named something like QQF-FFT-44388-IssueD.doc and they are completely outdated with regard to the thing they document despite having seen several revisions, as evidenced by the inconsistent style.Common features are:- A glossary that describe terms that don't need describing, such as CPU or RAM, but not ambiguous and domain-specific terms, of which there are many- References to documents you don't have access to- UML diagrams, not matching the code of course- Signatures by people who left the project long ago and are nowhere to be seen- A bunch of screenshots, all with different UIs taken at different stages of development, would be of great value to archeologists- Wildly inconsistent formatting, some people realize that Word has styles and can generate a table of contents, others don't, and few careOf course, no one reads them, besides maybe a depressive QA manager.

But today's AI might do better than the average tech writer.  AI might be able to generate reasonably usable, if mediocre, technical documentation based on a halfheartedly updated wiki and the README files and comments scattered in the developers' code base.  A lot of projects don't just have poor technical documentation, they have no technical documentation.

I think everyone on the team should get involved in this kind of feedback because raw first impressions on new content (which you can only experience once, and will be somewhat similar to impatient new users) is super valuable.I remember as a dev flagging some tech marketing copy aimed at non-devs as confusing and being told by a manager not to give any more feedback like that because I wasn't in marketing... If your own team that's familiar with your product is a little confused, you can probably x10 that confusion for outside users, and multiply that again if a dev is confused by tech content aimed at non-devs.I find it really common as well that you get non-tech people writing about tech topics for marketing and landing pages, and because they only have a surface level understanding of the the tech the text becomes really vague with little meaning.And you'll get lots devs and other people on the team agreeing in secret the e.g. the product homepage content isn't great but are scared to say anything because they feel they have to stay inside their bubble and there isn't a culture of sharing feedback like that.

But even if a PM cares about UX, they are often not in a good position to spot problems with designs and flows they are closely involved in and intimately familiar with.Having someone else with a special perspective can be very useful, even if their job provides other beneficial functions, too. Using this ""resource"" is the job of the PM.

Also true that most tech writers are bad. And companies aren't going to spend >$200k/year on a tech writer until they hit tens of millions in revenue. So AI fills the gap.As a horror story, our docs team didn't understand that having correct installation links should be one of their top priorities. Obviously if a potential customer can't install product, they'd assume it's bs and try to find an alternative. It's so much more important than e.g. grammar in a middle of some guide.

I think I agree, at least in the current state of AI, but can't quite put my finger on what exactly it's missing. I did have some limited success with getting Claude Code to go through tutorials (actually implementing each step as they go), and then having it iterate on the tutorial, but it's definitely not at the level of a human tech writer.Would you be willing to take a stab at the competencies that a future AI agent would require to be excellent at this (or possibly never achieve)? I mean, TFA talks about ""empathy"" and emotions and feeling the pain, but I can't help feel that this wording is a bit too magical to be useful.

For tech documentation, I suppose that AI agents would mainly benefit from Skills files managed as part of the tool's repo, and I absolutely do imagine future AI agents being set up (e.g. as part of their AGENTS.md) to propose PRs to these Skills as they use the tools. And I'm wondering whether AI agents might end up with different usability concerns and pain-points from those that we have.

I do not think that these skills are so easily replaced; certainly the machine can do a lot, but if you acquire those skills yourself you shape your brain in a way that is definitely useful to you in many other aspects of life.In my humble opinion we will be losing that from people, the upscaling of skills will be lost for sure, but the human upscaling is the real loss.

Two years ago, I asked chatgpt to rewrite my resume. It looked fantastic at a first sight, then, one week later I re-read it, and feel ashamed to have sent it to some prospective employers. It was full of cringe inducing babble.You see, for an LLM there are no hierarchies other than what it observed in their training, and even then, applying it in a different context may be tricky for them. Because it can describe hierarchies, relationships by mimicry, but it doesn't actually have a model of them.Just an example: It may be able to generate text that recognizes that a PhD title is a step above from a Master's degree, but sometimes it won't be able to translate this fact (instead of the description of this fact) into the subtle differences in attention and emphasis we do in our written text to reflect those real world hierarchies of value. It can repeat the fact to you, can even kind of generalize it, but it won't take a decision based on it.It can, even more now, get a very close simulation of this, because relative importance of stuff would have been semantically capture, and it is very good at capturing those subtle semantical relationships, but, in linguistic terms, it absolutely sucks at pragmatics.An example: Let's say in one of your experiences, you improved a model that detected malignancy in a certain kind of tumor images, improving its false negative rate to something like 0.001%, then in the same experience you casually mention that you tied the CEOs toddler tennis shoes once. Given your prompt to write a resume according to the usual resume enhancement formulas, there's a big chance it will emphasize the irrelevant tennis lace tying activity in a ridiculously pompous manner, making it hierarchically equivalent to your model kung-fu accomplishments.So in the end, you end up with some bizarre stuff that looks like:""Tied our CEO's toddler tennis shoes, enabling her to raise 20M with minimal equity dilution in our Series B round""

If the business can no longer justify 5 engineers, then they might only have 1.I've always said that we won't need fewer software developers with AI. It's just that each company will require fewer developers but there will be more companies.IE:2022: 100 companies employ 10,000 engineers2026: 1000 companies employ 10,000 engineersThe net result is the same for emplyoment. But because AI makes it that much more efficient, many businesses that weren't financially viable when it needed 100 engineers might become viable with 10 engineers + AI.

Five engineers could be turned into maybe two, but probably not less.It's the 'bus factor' at play. If you still want human approvals on pull requests then  If one of those engineers goes on vacation or leaves the company you're stuck with one engineer for a while.If both leave then you're screwed.If you're a small startup, then sure there are no rules and it's the wild west. One dev can run the world.

Peak productivity has always been somewhere between 1-3 people, though if any one of those people can't or won't continue working for one reason or another, it's generally game over for the project.  So you hire more.This is why small software startups time and time again manage to run circles around with organizations with much larger budgets.  A 10 person game studio like Team Cherry can release smash hit after smash hit, while Ubisoft with 170,000% the personnel count visibly flounders.  Imagine doing that in hardware, like if you could just grab some buddies and start a business successfully competing with TSMC out of your garage.  That's clearly not possible.  But in software, it actually is.

I am not even quite sure I know how to manage a team of more than two programmers right now. Opus 4.5, in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, can develop software almost as fast as I can write specs and review code. And it's just plain better at writing code than 60% of my graduating class was back in the day. I have banned at least one person from ever writing a commit message or pull request again, because Claude will explain it better.Now, most people don't know to squeeze that much productivity out of it, most corporate procurement would take 9 months to buy a bucket if it was raining money outside, and it's possible to turn your code into unmaintainable slop at warp speed. And Claude is better at writing code than it is at almost anything else, so the rest of y'all are safe for a while.But if you think that tech writers, or translators, or software developers are the only people who are going to get hit by waves of downsizing, then you're not paying attention.Even if the underlying AI tech stalls out hard and permanently in 2026, there's a wave of change coming, and we are not ready. Nothing in our society, economy or politics is ready to deal with what's coming. And that scares me a bit these days.

Only because it has access to vast amount of sample code to draw a re-combine parts. Did You ever considered emerging technologies, like new languages or frameworks that may be a much better suited for You area but they are new, thus there is no codebase for LLM to draw from?I'm starting to think about a risk of technological stagnation in many areas.

One thing to add is that the LLM doesn't know what it can't see. It just amplifies what is there. Assumed knowledge is quite common with developers and their own code. Or the more common ""it works on my machine"" because something is set outside of the code environment.Sadly other fields are experiencing the same issue of someone outside their field saying AI can straight up replace them.

During the nineties of the last century I was still naive enough to believe that the great improvements in technology, i.e. the widespread availability of powerful word processors and the availability of the Internet for extremely cheap distribution will lead to an improvement in the quality of technical documentation and to easy access to it for everybody.The reverse has happened, the quality of the technical documentation has become worse and worse, with very rare exceptions, and the access to much of what has remained has become very restricted, either by requiring NDAs or by requiring very high prices (e.g. big annual fees for membership to some industry standards organization).A likely explanation for the worse and worse technical documentation is a reduction in the number of professional technical writers.It is very obvious that the current management of most big companies does not understand at all the value of competent technical writers and of good product documentation; not only for their customers and potential customers, but also for their internal R&D teams or customer support teams.I have worked for several decades at many companies, very big and very small, on several continents, but, unfortunately only at one of them the importance of technical documentation was well understood by the management, therefore the hardware and software developers had an adequate amount of time planned for writing documentation in their schedules for product development. Despite the fact that the project schedules at that company appeared to allocate much more time for ""non-productive tasks"" like documentation, than in other places, in reality it was there where the R&D projects were completed the fastest and with the least delays over the initially estimated completion time, one important factor being that every developer understood very well what must be done in the future and what has already been done and why.

I was terrible writer, but we had to write good docs and make it easy for our customers to integrate with our products. So, I prepared the context to our tech writers and they have created nice documentation pages.The cycle was (reasonably takes 1 week, depending on tech writer workload):    1. prepare context
    2. create ticket to tech writers, wait until they respond
    3. discuss messaging over the call
    4. couple days later I get first draft
    5. iterate on draft, then finally publish it

Today its different:    1. I prepare all the context and style guide, then feed them into LLM.
    1.1. context is extracted directly from code by coding agents 
    2. I proofread it and 97% of cases accept it, because it follows the style guide and mostly transforms my context correctly into customer consumable content
    3. Done. less than 20 minutes

Tech writers were doing amazing job of course, but I can get 90-95% quality in 1% of the time spend for that work.

The parts about hallucinations and processes are also a bit dated.

My bet is actually better in some places. Bitter lesson and all that. (at least for 80% of projects, where current human written docs are horrendous. ymmv. artisan projects not included)What I do agree with is that you'll still want someone to hold accountable. But that's just normal business. This has been the case for integrators / 3rd party providers since forever. Every project requiring 3rd party people still had internal folks that were held accountable when things didn't work out. But, you probably won't need 10 people writing docs. You can hold accountable the few that remain.

Many engineers are terrible at documentation, not just because they find it boring or cannot put it into words (that's the part an LLM could actually help with) but because they cannot tell what to document, what is unneeded detail, how best to address the target audience (or what is the profile of the target audience to begin with; something you can tell an LLM but which it cannot find on its own), etc, etc. The Fine Article goes into these nuances; it's the whole point of it.> ""Write a manual for air travel for someone who never flew.

My advise to tech writers would be to get really good at directing and orchestrating AI tools to do the heavy lifting of producing documentation. If you are stuck using content management systems or word processors, consider adopting a more code centric workflow. The AI tools can work with those a lot better. And you can't afford to be doing things manually that an AI does faster and better. Your value is making sure the right documentation gets written and produced correctly; correcting things that need correcting/perfecting. It's not in doing everything manually; you need to cherry pick where your skills still add value.Another bit of insight is that a lot of technical documentation now has AIs as the main consumer. A friend of mine who runs a small SAAS service has been complaining that nobody actually reads his documentation (which is pretty decent) and instead relies on LLMs to do that for them. The more documentation you have, the less people will read all of it. Or any of it.But you still need documentation. It's easier than ever to produce it. The quality standards for that documentation are high and increasing. There are very few excuses for not having great documentation.

Little infrastructure you can take advantage on. Few places you can safely build harbors. Wetter so cold that a lot of equipment simply would fail. So it's not nearly as profitable as it might look. Maybe you can make some decent profit if you run it like the soviet union ran many things, i.e. forced labor with 10s of thousands of people dying.- The US has one military outpost in Greenland, and AFIK they don't need more to a) protect the US from that direction and b) project power to arctic shipping routes and similar. And realistically if this where to actually need some expansion then any past president probably could have come to an reasonable agreement with Greenland. I mean it's land they don't use and can give for some monetary benefit to one of their closest allies while implicitly gaining some added protection, like why would you say no to that. Except maybe the past Trump presidency as he had already been eroding checks and balances then and that is a red flag for trusting that an ally will stay an ally.> Nobody is going to war over this and [..] wants to save face.This is what people also said about:- Hitler starting WW2 (like seriously he said he would start war, neighbors countries where like: ""Nah no way he is just barking"")- Same, but after Hitler had already rearmed Germany and sized some boarder territory (he -> war, other countries -> na, no way he actually want to start another large scale war)- heck even after he invaded Poland many still insisted that there is no way he would go beyond that as that would be just supper dump- a Wall being build around west Berlin to prevent people from entering it (there is a famous citate: ""Nobody intends to build a wall."" (after rumors started that they might want to do that, many people believed them as build a wall would just be too absurd))- during WW2 most Germans (in cities) knew something really bad is happening to Jews, many approached it like ""there is no way he is literally killing all of them"" (even trough he kinda wrote exactly that in his book)- etc. etc.The point is humans are very very prone to make them-self believe that there is no way some very unpleasant possibilities will happen.Also if person who as repeatedly shown to act unreasonable, sometimes outright despotic, with clear autocratic tendencies, who has shown to be fully fine with civilians suffering or dying as consequence of his actions says ""I want to size your country"", and has the military might to do so, you should assume that they want do _exactly that_ (at least in the moment when saying that).Historically speaking claiming that ""nobody wants that, because it's supper dump"" has rarely ended well.Lets hope it wont happen anyway it would likely spiral into WW3 as it's a pretty clear signal for China that the the US has lost most of its allies and Nato is disfunctional and the EU is weaker and more likely to work with or at least unlikely to antagonize them then ever before (in recent times). If not now when else is a better time to size Taiwan. China increasingly doesn't need TSMC, the rest of the world including the US do. China might even profit from it being destroyed in the war...

Something you can already see in Venezuela as we speak: The Trump Administration has essentially blocked countries like Russia and Iran to ship oil from Venezuela.If they capture Greenland and can build a big Naval presence there they are in a great position to confiscate every cargo ship destined to Russian harbors in the north, and close off China's trading route in the Arctic aswell.

OK, great, they've got troops in Greenland.  Now they have to keep them supplied.  How are they going to do that?  Well, either through the air or by sea.Does either have a navy that can do that?  No.  Does either have an air force that can do that against US opposition?  No.So it's really unlikely.  Even if China or Russia were stupid enough to do that, they could never hold it.Now, perhaps the more interesting question:  How likely does Trump think it is?  Does he think it's real, despite the absurd impossibility of it?  Or is he just saying fact-free stuff that he hopes some people will believe?

But are there any signs that they have taken over the military? Iran and Venezuela was something they had in mind for decades. But are there any generals itching to test themselves invading Greenland against European military? They don't have to obey the civilians. Rule of law is a thin veneer that this president stripped clean. Now personal interests of the people in power is what matters. Are there any generals with personal interest to invade Greenland and fight Europe? They obviously can develop some but it should take few years at least, right?

We're big fans of the old adage “go big or go home.” We're even bigger fans of “why go big when you can go ginormous?” (OK, we just made that up.) But there's really no other way to describe the 49-inch Samsung ViewFinity S9 monitor that's $400 off for a limited time at Amazon, now $799 down from $1,199. This ultrawide curved display's 32:9 aspect ratio closely mirrors your own field of view, and the dual QHD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate are truly impressive, but they're also only scratching the surface of this monitor's selling points.

See at Amazon

The ViewFinity S9 gives back some of the desktop real estate it consumes by doubling as a docking station, with built-in ports for connectivity and charging so you can retire your current hub. Picture-in-picture, picture-by-picture, and split screen modes are easily toggled between for multi-device mastery.

The Amazon page calls the Samsung ViewFinity S9 a “business” monitor, and that's totally fair considering how many windows and tabs you can fit into its massive 49-inch field of view. Side-by-side QHD screens packed into one monitor is just begging for multitasking. But if you're looking at the 120Hz refresh rate, the immersive potential of a 49-inch curved monitor with built-in speakers, or the wide array of input ports, and you're not thinking gaming monitor, you're missing out.

The Samsung ViewFinity S9 also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 for a wide field of deep blacks and crisp whites to create amazing contrast and detailed shades. That's easy on your eyes whether you have a dozen spreadsheets open at one time or you're in the middle of an intense gaming session. Also easy on your eyes: TÜV-Certified eye care, including automatic brightness and color temperature optimization and Eye Saver Mode for less flickering and blue light.

The ViewFinity S9's stand allows you to make fine adjustments in height, tilt, and swivel to create the perfect ergonomic conditions for yourself. And if the sheer size and potential features of the ViewFinity S9 are, understandably, a little intimidating at first, Samsung's Easy Setting Box is an amazingly intuitive and simple command center from which you can partition the screen or toggle between viewing modes to fit your own personal preference.

An enormous top-quality monitor upgrades the look of your desktop immediately, and the Samsung ViewFinity S9 also has the bonus feature of acting as a built-in connectivity hub for ideal cable control. With two HDMI IN ports, one DisplayPort IN, a USB-C, USB-B (upstream), USB/service, LAN, USB 3.0, and headphone jack all built in, the ViewFinity S9 is ready to become the command center for all of your productivity and gaming activities.

Amazon's $400-off deal on the 49-inch Samsung ViewFinity S9 curved QHD monitor is a limited-time proposition, so jump on it now before the price jumps from the current $800 back up to its regular $1,200.

Today's PC landscape is changing in ways few expected, and almost nobody wanted. AMD, the eponymous Team Red, is coming into the new year with an odd assortment of chips in tow. Maybe it's enough to know there's likely more in store later this year, but first AMD has to handle the ravages of the ongoing RAM shortage.

In an interview with Gizmodo during CES 2026, AMD's VP in charge of Ryzen, David McAfee, talked to me about the company's full PC gaming suite. I spoke with the exec the day after one of AMD's oddest CES showcases to date, where it revealed a few new chips in existing families, including the Ryzen 7 9850X3D CPU and several more Strix Halo APUs (accelerated processing units)—specifically the Ryzen AI Max+ 388 and 382—which were also built for some future mobile gaming device, perhaps even more handheld PCs. However, those chips are still using older RDNA 3.5 GPUs, meaning they won't have access to AMD's latest upscaling updates that would truly push mobile devices for gaming.

AMD's novel CPUs for lightweight laptops, the Ryzen AI 400 series, didn't get nearly as much time in the limelight as Qualcomm and Intel's competing CPUs. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D has a higher clock speed, which means some of the most hardcore gamers can make use of a few extra frames. McAfee told me directly there won't be a huge difference in performance between the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and this new, overclocked chip. Modern DirectX 12-supported games may not see as big an increase as some “high-framerate” esports titles or older DirectX 9 titles, he added. Everyone else will feel safe sticking with what works, and that seems to be AMD's intent with this latest CPU. The sophomore chip and the new hotness will be sold alongside each other.

Keeping GPU costs low seems to be AMD's entire modus operandi for the start of 2026. What worked last year will work this year, so long as the company can contain the worst excesses of memory price gouging. The entire PC market is suffering under the RAM supply crunch. Sure, you should be able to buy a new Ryzen 7 9850X3D when it eventually goes on sale (we still don't have an idea of its official price), but will self-starters also suffer the 500% markup on DDR5 RAM for the sake of a new PC?

AMD doesn't have a GPU to compete against Nvidia's top-end GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. The best it can do is outcompete Team Green on performance per dollar. The Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT were both great GPUs if you could nab them for close to their suggested retail price. The XT only hit its fabled $600 close to eight months after launch. With memory prices going haywire, consumers have reasons to be concerned that all component prices could increase. Last year, a customer service rep for major AMD GPU maker PowerColor told Reddit users that prices could “kick up” in 2026.

“We have very strategic partnerships over many, many years with all the DRAM manufacturers to make sure that both the amount of supply that we need and the economics of what we're able to buy from them are what we can support in our graphics business,” McAfee told Gizmodo. However, the Ryzen lead admitted that he can't predict the future. He added that AMD was trying to work with the AIC (add-in card) manufacturers to maintain prices close to what AMD suggests. Considering how long the RX 90-series kept above MSRP, that may not be enough to calm gamers' nerves.

“Without the memory at the right price, building graphics cards with our add-in-board partners that hit the right price and market, that's tough math to put together,” McAfee added. “So managing that memory ecosystem very closely is absolutely something that is a core part of what we do.”

While AMD is competing with Nvidia on GPUs, it's also trying to become the fresh face of AI upscaling technology. The RX 90-series introduced FSR 4, a new model of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution technology that boosts game performance by making lower-resolution frames appear like they're running at a higher resolution. Last year, AMD trotted out FSR Redstone as a mid-cycle update to its upscaler. This update added multi-frame interpolation, aka multi-frame generation, to the party. Essentially, this technology takes multiple AI-generated frames and sticks them in between rendered frames, artificially increasing the frame rate.

The wider PC gaming community is far more hesitant to adopt frame generation than AI upscaling. Frame gen necessarily hits at a game's latency, making controls feel floatier than they should. Redstone and Nvidia's latest DLSS 4.5 have worked to reduce the visual glitches from AI-generated frames, but these imperfections still mar the experience. McAfee tried to make it clear AMD was only taking baby steps into multi-frame generation.

“We will proceed very cautiously and listen to the gaming community and the reaction that they have to these multi-frame gen capabilities,” McAfee said. “I think a lot of gamers feel like [frame gen technology has] gone too far in some cases. And so I think that's why you're going to see us step very carefully as we build this out over the next several years.”

We may need to wait a little while longer before we see any new PC or handheld APU sporting RDNA 4, the same GPU architecture as the RX 90 series. Once that happens, we may see Redstone hit the mobile market. Smaller and cheaper devices can make better use of upscaling than $600 graphics cards, something McAfee agreed with.

“The value of frame interpolation and upscaling on a handheld platform is incredibly significant,” he said. “So as we're looking out at what we're going to do in our handheld roadmap in the future, those are absolutely the conversations we're having about… how do we deliver a really high-quality experience and make sure that all of the benefits that go along, both power, smoothness of gameplay, etc., make their way onto those handheld platforms as well?”

Raspberry Pi's first product of 2026 is an update of the 2024 AI HAT+, but this newer version, another collaboration with Hailo, now sees the Hailo 10H AI chip running the show, along with 8GB of onboard RAM. The new AI HAT+ 2 takes the strain of AI workloads away from the Raspberry Pi 5's Arm CPU, but this all comes at a price of $130. With your Raspberry Pi already costing much more than the original $35 — of course, the spec has vastly improved over the years — you could already be hitting the $200 mark for just a Pi and AI HAT+ 2. Does the performance warrant the price? There's only one way to find out!

The retail box follows the same design language as the many other Raspberry Pi product boxes that I have opened. At a glance, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was the same Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ as released previously, and opening the box doesn't help as the boards are very similar. The new AI HAT+ 2 requires the included heatsink. Yes, this heatsink is for the HAT, not the Raspberry Pi 5. Your Pi 5 will also need cooling, and the official Raspberry Pi and Argon low-profile coolers will fit under the HAT. The included plastic standoffs and GPIO header extension work, but the GPIO connection is a little too loose for my liking. The resulting GPIO connections, using DuPoint style connectors, also feel a little too loose.

Connecting the board to the Raspberry Pi 5 is simple. Just unlock the PCIe connection on the Pi 5, push in the ribbon cable, lock it down, and then secure the board to the standoffs and GPIO. There is a cut-out for connecting the official Raspberry Pi Camera and an official display. Connect up your keyboard, mouse, HDMI, Ethernet, and finally power, then boot to the Raspberry Pi desktop, remembering of course to enable PCIe Gen 3 via “raspi-config.” We're using the latest Debian “Trixie” based image and have a custom installation process as our review unit predates the official software repositories. The end-user software experience will be streamlined for release.

Using the provided installation instructions, we ran hailo-ollama and then queried the available and compatible models for the Hailo 10H powering the kit.

Model

Used for

deepseek_r1_ distill_qwen:1.5b

Math, logical reasoning, coding. Qwen: 1.5b distilled using DeepSeek R1 to create a compact LLM.

llama3.2:3b

Chatbots, text summarization, knowledge retrieval and prompt re-writing.

qwen2.5-coder:1.5b

Writing, explaining and fixing code in multiple programming languages.

qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b

General-purpose, natural language, content generation, chatbots.

qwen2:1.5b

General-purpose, used as a base for other models.

In our pre-release software, the models are loaded using hailo-ollama via a carefully crafted curl command. Just change the “model” to one of the five available.

The 8GB of onboard DDR4X RAM means that larger models will generally work better as the Raspberry Pi's own RAM is untouched. So models up to 8GB should load without incident, even on Raspberry Pi 5s with less than 8GB. This opens up cheaper AI projects, technically.

You still need to pay $130 for the AI HAT+ 2, but a $50 1GB, $55 2GB, or $77 4GB Raspberry Pi 5 is now a viable AI platform, negating the need to buy a $105 8GB or the frankly frightening $160 for a 16GB Raspberry Pi 5.

So why the new board? That is down to Large Language Models (LLM), an AI that is trained on huge amounts of text data and is used to understand, process, and respond to human language. The AI HAT+ 2 is mainly aimed at LLMs, whereas the older AI HAT+ is for image-based AI projects. The AI HAT+ 2 demo code supplied by Raspberry Pi leans heavily on creating our own local LLM using qwen2:1.5b but you can also use DeepSeek or Qwen models that are distilled via DeepSeek.

The onboard 8GB of RAM and powerful AI processing chip take the strain off the Raspberry Pi 5's CPU and RAM. We can also use that power for image processing. If you've not got the original AI HAT+, then having good image processing and a viable LLM platform makes the $130 price tag easier to swallow.

The two boards may look similar, but they don't work in the same way. The AI HAT+ was all about image-based AI processing, and the 26 TOPS of the onboard Hailo 8L (13 Tops for the cheaper Hailo8 model)  is very similar in performance to the AI HAT+ 2. Using the rpicam-hello suite of examples, we tested compatibility with the AI HAT+ 2, and we are pleased to say that object identification and pose detection worked as expected. While we have no metrics to show the difference, the performance of the AI HAT+ 2 was smooth, and there were no camera issues. Where there were issues, they were largely software-based. ""HailoRT not ready!"" shows that Hailo's software is playing catch-up to the hardware, which has happened before. Hailo, Raspberry Pi and the community will ultimately fix this gap, but early adopters need to be aware.

Because we cannot directly test the AI HAT+ 2 and the AI HAT+, we need to fallback to testing the AI HAT+ 2 versus the Arm CPU of the Raspberry Pi 5. For this test, we will use the qwen2:1.5b language model and pose some questions relating to general knowledge, then specific programming tasks using Python. Installation of qwen2:1.5b was made via ollama.

Arm CPU Utilization



Hitting 100% on all cores

The AI HAT+ 2 did a decent job of writing quick and concise code, but it was doomed to failure as it never called an application to open the image, rather it read the image and then closed the open image file.

AI HAT+ 2 Response

The Arm CPU response looked decent, but on closer inspection, it was full of errors around using the imported tkinter module and calling “Image.open” when there is no imported Image module. This vibe coding experience produced a long-winded response, but ultimately it was way off the mark and not something that we would rely on as a coding co-pilot or a sounding board for a project.

In our tests, the AI HAT+ 2 was faster than the Raspberry Pi 5's Arm CPU, but more importantly, it ran the code without hogging the CPU. This is great for those who want to integrate AI into a GPIO-based project, like robotics. That said, the model produced inaccurate results. In the case of the coding exercise, the code would appear valid to a layman, but it was completely incorrect. If you are looking to run an LLM on a Pi, then try the Hailo-compatible models and see which one meets your needs. But be warned, the knowledge on which these models have been trained is now outdated, and from our limited testing time, we only saw incorrect responses.

 




Obviously, someone who wants to use AI on a Raspberry Pi, but what type of AI? Offloading the workload from the Arm CPU to the Hailo 10H frees up the CPU for other tasks, such as running a chat server, controlling a robot, reacting to sensors, etc. So those of us who like to build smart GPIO projects will have a field day with the AI HAT+ 2.

If you are just interested in image or vision-based AI projects, the older AI HAT+, Raspberry Pi AI Camera, or the original M.2 AI Kit are all cheaper viable options. If you already have any of these products, stick with them, as right now the AI HAT+ 2 is more money for little to no performance boost. If you haven't got any AI HATs or want to dabble with LLMs, then the AI HAT+ 2 is a viable, if currently flawed, option. Personally, we would run LLMs on the Raspberry Pi 5s Arm CPU until we have the knowledge and use case to warrant purchasing the AI HAT+ 2.

 




AI is the buzzword that isn't going away, and Raspberry Pi's adoption of AI into its product range is an interesting, if polarizing, decision. The AI HAT+ 2 continues the progression of more powerful AI platforms, and for the right type of make,r it will be a considered choice. One day. Right now, this is a solution looking for a problem, and we're sure that the bugs will be worked out, but early adopters will be left wanting more.

For many who just want to dabble with AI on their Raspberry Pi 5, then they can either use smaller models that your RAM can accommodate, or use an online service. For computer vision and image inference projects, you will get similar performance and a cheaper product with the older AI HAT+ or the Raspberry Pi AI Camera. The AI camera is a cheap entry point for learners. For those who want a local LLM in a compact and power-efficient package, the Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 is something that you should research, after learning the skills and developing the project that it can support. It will also give the software time to mature and to make sure that your wallet is ready.

This will not stop ghost guns, but it will at least make them harder to acquire.

New York State Governor Kathy Hochul has introduced new legislation that will force 3D printer manufacturers to stop their machines from printing guns and gun parts. According to 3D Printing Industry, the bill will help reduce the spread of ghost guns — unserialized firearms produced in home shops or unregistered factories — that are difficult to trace. The proliferation of 3D printers and readily available 3D files can allow even someone without experience to print their own gun for less than $200.

“From the iron pipeline to the plastic pipeline, these proposals will keep illegal ghost guns off of New York streets and enhance measures to track and block the production of dangerous and illegal firearms in our state,” the governor said. Aside from mandating 3D printer safeguards, the proposed law will also make sharing and possession of 3D files containing guns or gun components, unless the person handling them is authorized to do so. It also included a provision that requires gun manufacturers to make it difficult to give semi-automatic pistols automatic-fire capabilities using 3D printed parts.

The State government made this proposed legislation after a string of high-profile incidents involving 3D printed guns, including the 2024 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg conceded that this requirement to stop 3D printers from printing firearms and making the sharing of 3D files for guns and their components illegal will not solve the problem of ghost guns.

Nevertheless, he said that these measures would make them more difficult to acquire. “These illegal firearms are being manufactured in homes and used in crimes right now, which is why I have been working with my colleagues in Albany and the private sector over the past several years to stop their proliferation,” Bragg said. “Passing these measures will reduce crime and strengthen public safety for all New Yorkers.”

This proposal is expected to hit opposition, though, especially from pro-gun advocates. One of the arguments against this is that targeting gun manufacturing will not reduce violent crime, and the government should instead focus on societal issues that cause gun violence in the first place.

Oracle is facing a class action lawsuit from a group of disgruntled bondholders who claim they lost money after the company misled them over how much money it needed to borrow to finance its AI infrastructure commitments. Specifically, they say the company's claim that it ""may"" need to borrow more money was false and misleading, because it was already planning to issue another set of bonds. According to Reuters, Oracle sold $18 billion of notes and bonds on September 25, 2025, to support its $300 billion deal with OpenAI. However, investors were surprised when the company released another set of bonds worth $38 billion almost two months later.

“The bond market's reaction to Oracle's additional debt was swift and bracing,” the suit reads. The market saw Oracle's additional debt as an increased credit risk that the company is taking on. Because of this, the original series of bonds and notes have fallen in value and is now trading like debt from companies with lower ratings. The bondholders, led by the Ohio Carpenters' Pension Plan, contend that the statements for the initial bonds said that the company was only considering another set of loans. However, they argue that Oracle already knew at this point that it was going to issue another, much larger, loan to fund its expansion. The plaintiffs said that Oracle and some of its chief executives, as well as the 16 banks that were underwriting the loan, were liable under the Securities Act of 1933.

As experts repeatedly warn about AI bubble fears, Oracle has been borrowing aggressively to fund its AI dreams. When the company launched its initial bond drive for $18 billion in September, the demand was so high that it was four times oversubscribed. But just three months later, investors are now reportedly sitting on $1.3 billion in paper losses. And even though S&P and Moody's still rate Oracle as investment grade, its BBB or Baa2 rating places it just a couple of notches above junk rating. More than that, these rating agencies have put it on the negative watch, meaning there's a chance that they will downgrade the company's rating, depending on the risk that it's taking on.

The massive AI buildout requires billions, if not trillions, of dollars in investment. This is likely not a problem for tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, who have massive war chests and can likely afford to keep pouring money into the infrastructure without breaking a sweat. However, other smaller companies will probably require additional funding — either through bonds and notes, private equity, selling shares, or a mixture of these. More than that, there's also the intricate web of investments, projects, sales, and loans that multiple AI companies have built, so a failure of just one of the companies involved in it could mean a complete collapse for the entire system.

China's great technological decoupling from the West continues apace. The latest broadside from Beijing is aimed at blocking U.S. and Israeli cybersecurity vendors, reportedly over fears that their wares might leak Chinese information to governments or third parties. The report comes from Reuters and cites two unnamed sources ""briefed on the matter."" At this point, there's no telling which Chinese companies or state agencies have been issued this directive, but chances are that the list includes large state-owned corporations and government offices.

The affected stateside vendors are VMWare (Broadcom), Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet. The ban also affects Israel-based Check Point Software. It's not just a ""remote"" ban, either, as all those companies have a physical presence in China and/or Hong Kong.

Although this development is probably not very surprising given how the U.S.-China relations have been going of late with regard to tariffs and technology, it's also part of a much larger plan. China's Xinchuang initiative reportedly targets a 2027 deadline for state-owned companies and offices to replace 100% of foreign software with national alternatives.

The initiative itself is actually quite old, but the past few years saw an escalation in pace and pitch. A 2022 directive amended to the initiative, listed as Document 79, seemingly contains direct orders to replace foreign software in critical areas, including but not limited to office automation, document management, HR systems, CRMs and ERPs, financial management, and core hardware, server, and operating systems. The directive is informally known as ""Delete America"" or ""Delete A"".

This latest move comes in against a backdrop of gigantic Chinese investment in chip-making technology, in a bid to end reliance on U.S.-designed and Taiwan's manufactured-chips. Given how the U.S. has previously blocked the sale of Blackwell chips, and China replied by blocking the imports itself, assuredly in favor of homegrown alternatives, this war is unlikely to end anytime soon.

Among patients with chronic rhinitis, radiofrequency ablation of the posterior nasal nerve with the NEUROMARK system reduced nasal symptoms and improved quality of life more than a sham control procedure.

“The study provides strong and convincing evidence that PNN [posterior nasal nerve] treatment with the NEUROMARK device is highly effective across multiple patient outcomes,” the authors wrote.

Masayoshi Takashima, MD, with Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on January 8 in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology.

Physicians and staff knew which participants received active or sham treatment. Participants were instructed to continue their rhinitis medications during the trial, but the protocol did not otherwise dictate medication use.

This study was supported by Neurent Medical Ltd., which markets the NEUROMARK device. Two authors reported serving as medical advisor consultants for Neurent Medical, and one author reported serving as a medical writing consultant for the company.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types of leukemia. Certain elements associated with CLL, such as immunophenotype findings and nonspecific symptoms, can pose challenges when differentiating it from other diseases.

According to immunophenotype data, CLL has a specific genetic profile of the B-cell antigens CD19 and CD20, coexpressing the T-cell antigen CD5. The only other B-cell lymphoma with a similar coexpression of B and T cells is mantle cell lymphoma as it also expresses CD20 and CD5.Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia generally do not express CD5; however, CD5 might be positive in some cases of hairy cell leukemia.

Learn more about genetic expression of CLL.

Waldenström macroglobulinemia and CLL can both present with anemia and B-related symptoms (such as night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue). However, Waldenström macroglobulinemia can be distinguished from CLL by its manifestation of hyperviscosity syndrome.Hyperviscosity syndrome occurs in up to 30% of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia; in CLL, it is considered a rare complication. Additionally, hyperviscosity in Waldenström macroglobulinemia is typically mediated by immunoglobulin-M, whereas in CLL, it is commonly caused by hyperleukocytosis.

Learn more about the symptoms of CLL.

CLL and SLL are considered different manifestations of the same disease, with both producing mature but dysfunctional B-lymphocytes that characteristically show ""smudge"" cells on peripheral blood smear. Both have a strong genetic component and associations with various environmental exposures as well, though exact etiology is unknown. Presentations of these diseases most often offer distinction between the two. CLL is usually considered the initial phase, showing abnormal cells in the blood. SLL is then diagnosed when the disease progresses to the lymph nodes.

Learn more about CLL and lymph node involvement.

Characteristic histology of CLL cells typically shows ""small, mature lymphocytes with a narrow border of cytoplasm and a dense nucleus lacking discernible nucleoli and having partially aggregated chromatin"" mixed with other normal or atypical cells including prolymphocytes. However, if prolymphocytes rise above 55%, this shifts the diagnosis away from CLL to B-cell PLL.

Learn more about diagnostic considerations for CLL.

The latest guidelines from the iwCLL state that fluorescence in situ hybridization should always be used to test for del(13q), del(11q), del(17p), and add(12) in peripheral blood lymphocytes before beginning treatment for CLL because this can help clinicians distinguish it from other lymphoproliferative diseases. This is currently supported by experts from the Lymphoma Research Foundation.Marrow aspirate and biopsy can be used when clinically indicated such as cases of unclear cytopenia. According to the iwCLL, conventional karyotyping is recommended prior to treatment if ""established methodology is available""; CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are not generally indicated to distinguish it from other lymphoproliferative diseases before treatment.

Gastric cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that is frequently asymptomatic in its earlier stages, contributing to delayed diagnosis. When symptoms arise, they are often nonspecific or easily attributed to benign conditions, which may further postpone endoscopic investigation.

When gastric cancer symptoms do occur, vague epigastric abdominal pain is a frequent complaint. Hematemesis is more typical of advanced disease, not early-stage presentation. Chronic flatulence is a common, nonspecific gastrointestinal symptom typically related to diet, functional bowel disorders, or aerophagia (air swallowing). It is not considered a characteristic presenting feature of early gastric cancer. Weight gain is generally not recognized as a presenting characteristic in cases of early gastric cancer.

Learn more about the presentation of gastric cancer.

Unexplained iron deficiency anemia and unintentional weight loss are among the alarm features that should prompt upper endoscopy evaluation in patients with GERD symptoms. Other alarm features include dysphagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, and persistent vomiting. Bloating, nausea, and persistent heartburn are not typical indicators of potential gastric cancer in patients with GERD.

Learn more about the workup for gastric cancer.

Peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer frequently leads to malignant ascites, which manifests as progressive abdominal distension, bloating, and discomfort. Patients might notice rapidly increasing abdominal girth or difficulty bending or lying flat; as the cancer progresses, ascitic symptoms worsen.

Epigastric pain or burning, belching after meals, and postprandial fullness are nonspecific symptoms and occur across both benign and malignant upper gastrointestinal conditions, making them less predictive of peritoneal involvement.

Learn more about gastric cancer diagnosis.

Malignant gastric outlet obstruction is a late complication of gastric cancer, arising when a distal tumor mechanically impedes gastric emptying. This results in progressive postprandial vomiting, epigastric pain, inability to finish meals, abdominal distension, and eventual malnutrition.

Intermittent hematochezia and chronic diarrhea with constipation are uncommon in this setting. Right upper quadrant colicky pain is more typical of biliary disease (eg, gallstones) than gastric outlet obstruction.

Learn more about gastric cancer complications.

Advanced gastric cancer can induce a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism. Paraneoplastic syndrome may occur in gastric cancer, but it is rare. Melena more often reflects advanced tumor ulceration or invasion, not early disease. Odynophagia is not a specific hallmark of advanced gastric cancer.

Among patients with suspected small-bowel bleeding, those with P1 lesions identified using a modified Saurin classification had an increased risk for rebleeding. Additional independent predictors of rebleeding included the use of antiplatelet drugs and undergoing endoscopic treatment.

“Our findings further support the predictive value of P1 lesions for rebleeding based on endoscopic findings assessed by modified [Saurin classification] and not limited to [small-bowel capsule endoscopy] alone. In other words, even minor findings may be associated with the risk of rebleeding in patients with [suspected small-bowel bleeding],” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sachiyo Onishi, Gifu University School of Medicine Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu City, Japan. It was published online on January 4, 2026, in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.

The retrospective, single-center design limited generalizability. Treatment decisions were made on case-by-case basis, introducing potential selection bias. Variability in timing and performance of endoscopic procedures may also have affected the diagnostic results.

This study received no specific funding. The authors reported having no competing interests.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an aggressive disease that is often discovered after routine or unrelated bloodwork is performed. Recognizing CLL can be difficult because patients can present with a wide range of symptoms.

Most patients with CLL are considered asymptomatic. However, it is estimated that up to 90% of patients with CLL have enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination. Patients might also experience other symptoms such as recurring infections, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, enlarged liver or spleen, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite or early satiety, and night sweats; however, these are generally not as common as enlarged lymph nodes.

Learn more about CLL symptoms.

Diagnosis of CLL requires ≥ 5000 clonal B-lymphocytes per μL of blood persisting for 3 months. This is usually alongside characteristic leukemia cell blood smear findings such as small, mature lymphocytes featuring a narrow cytoplasm border, dense nucleus with “partially aggregated” chromatin, and smudge cells as cell debris. Large cytotoxic lymphocytes from T cells are more associated with granular lymphocytic Leukemia. Cells with limited cytoplasm and unevenly cleaved nuclei are most indicative of mantle cell lymphoma, though this can be present in atypical CLL cases. Prolymphocytes exceeding half of blood lymphocytes is most often linked to B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.

Learn more about CLL diagnostic criteria.

Flow cytometry, along with immunophenotyping of peripheral blood, is the most valuable diagnostic test for CLL, and it is used to diagnose/confirm this disease. Bone marrow biopsy and ultrasonography of the liver and spleen can be implemented (depending on patient presentation) and helpful during diagnosis, but they alone are not typically used to initially diagnose CLL.

Learn more about CLL diagnostic testing.

According to the modified RAI classification, lymphocytosis alone with leukemia cells in blood or marrow is considered low-risk CLL. Lymphocytosis with enlarged nodes and enlarged spleen and/or liver is considered intermediate-risk CLL. Disease-related anemia or thrombocytopenia or low platelet count is considered high-risk CLL.

Learn more about CLL staging.

Data indicate that expression of CD20 is usually dim in typical CLL, whereas CD20 expression is usually bright in mantle cell lymphoma. Further, FMC-7 expression is often negative in typical CLL and positive in mantle cell lymphoma. CD23 expression is strongly linked to typical CLL; mantle cell lymphoma usually does not express CD23.

A genetic risk score (GRS) predicted the risk emotional hunger (EH) in people with obesity and may enable testing of potential therapies. EH is defined as a high score (≥ 7) on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

“Emotional hunger is a real contributor to weight gain, and it's often overlooked or misunderstood in today's obesity care,” Andres Acosta, MD, PhD, cofounder of Phenomix Sciences and obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, said in a communication. “These early findings reinforce where the field is headed: precision obesity care that recognizes the biological, behavioral, and emotional components of the disease.” 

Timothy O'Connor, PhD, chief technology officer at Phenomix, which developed the EH-GRS, presented the findings at the 2026 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Hawaii.

This is a small, “early days” feasibility study.

O'Connor declared being an officer at Phenomix, which developed the EH-GRS.

“For 20 years, my daily life has been defined by 24/7 shifts, including nights and holidays, consistently working overtime,” Francesca Mattiuzzo, MD, an anesthesiologist and intensive care specialist in Rome, Italy, told Medscape News Europe. “This has made my presence at home an exception rather than the rule.”

Mattiuzzo, who is 48 and a mother to two teenagers, is one of many physicians who have backed a campaign by the European Federation of Salaried Doctors (FEMS) to formally recognize medicine as an “arduous occupation.” It is the subject of a conference organized by the federation at the European Parliament on January 27.

Mattiuzzo says her professional life has turned work-life balance into “an exhausting struggle” and that it is “essential” for medical practice to be formally recognized as arduous. Intensive care in particular carries an immense clinical responsibility combined with a relentless pace, she said, and is performed in a persistently tense hospital environment. This exposes physicians to a critical risk for burnout that erodes both physical health and psychological stability.

“After two decades of sleep deprivation and professional stagnation, the constant fear of falling ill — knowing it would unfairly burden my colleagues — and the emotional exhaustion I bring home make this profession a biological sacrifice that is no longer sustainable,” she said.

Formally recognizing her work as arduous would mean acknowledging that “the stress we endure is anything but ordinary; it undermines the physician's well-being and, consequently, the safety of the care we provide.”

Anna Farina, MD, is also an anesthesiologist-intensivist, which she describes as “one of the most beautiful jobs in the world.” However, “in Italy, the personal price to pay is extremely high and the work is not fairly compensated,” she told Medscape News Europe. At 42, with one daughter, she echoes Mattiuzzo's concerns and hopes for appropriate protections.

“Our job is, on one side, extremely physically demanding and should include adequate countermeasures, such as earlier retirement and a reduction in night and holiday shifts. On the other side, it carries a very high psychological burden as we deal directly with human suffering and death,” she said.

“Most of my female colleagues of the same age would like to change their work setting,” she added. Some would like to change their profession altogether. Many suffer from burnout, while others “adapt to very demanding work schedules in order to prove their competence, often at the expense of their private life and family.”

The upcoming FEMS event follows a warning from the WHO last October that working conditions place an “unacceptable burden” on Europe's frontline healthcare workers.

In a WHO survey of more than 90,000 healthcare professionals across the EU, Iceland, and Norway, 28% of doctors said they worked more than 50 hours/wk. One in three doctors and nurses reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression; a third reported exposure to bullying or violent threats at work in the past year; and 10% reported physical violence or sexual harassment.

Health workers who faced violence, consistently long hours, and shift work were more likely to be depressed, anxious, or to have suicidal thoughts. Beyond the individual toll, burnout and mental health problems can have serious consequences for patients, the WHO said.

Between 11% and 34% of health workers, depending on their countries, were thinking about leaving their jobs amid an ongoing worker shortage projected to reach 940,000 by 2030.

Health workers taking sick leave to cope with the mental health toll of their work, or leaving the profession altogether, adds to the pressure on health systems and means patients may face longer wait times and receive worse medical care, the WHO said.

FEMS said that recognizing medical practice as an arduous occupation is “crucial,” not just to protect physicians' health but also to improve recruitment and retention.

Its policy paper notes that doctors face high emotional pressure, long shifts, sleepless nights, and continual exposure to stress due to clinical complexity and organizational challenges. They must also deal with increasing administrative burdens, chronic understaffing, aggressive work environments, and confrontation with suffering and death.

A supporting joint statement by the European Medical Organisations Standing Committee highlighted that doctors' working conditions “are increasingly characterized by physical strain, psychological pressure, organizational stress, and moral and legal responsibility that cumulatively place a significant burden on their health and well-being.”

Doctors bear “heavy and unique responsibilities,” FEMS said. These responsibilities pose a risk to doctors' physical and mental health, yet none of the 14 FEMS member countries currently recognizes doctors' work as arduous in either legal or social security terms. In other jobs with recognized arduous working conditions, protective and compensatory measures offer workplace mitigations.

Alessandra Spedicato, FEMS president, said the campaign stems from both personal and collective evidence. She and many colleagues experience on a daily basis “the fatigue, exhaustion, and wear associated with medical work,” she told Medscape News Europe. Stresses have been steadily increasing due to progressive depletion of healthcare system resources alongside growing demands and expectations of the population, she said. A prime objective of the campaign is to safeguard physicians' health, which is also essential to guarantee continuity and quality of care. Such recognition would “represent a strategic tool to strengthen recruitment and retention of the medical workforce across Europe,” she said. “Younger generations, in particular, place strong emphasis on work-life balance and on sustainable working conditions over the long term.”

In middle-aged adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), having three or more cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) was associated with subtle systematic deficits in cognitive processing speed and executive functions compared with having no CMBs.

""Our findings suggest that the presence of multiple CMBs is associated with subtle, incipient cognitive deficits in middle-aged individuals with T1D. Interventional and follow-up studies are warranted to clarify whether these early microvascular and cognitive symptoms develop further and how they could be prevented,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Iiris Kyläheiko, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on January 02, 2026, in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

As a cross-sectional analysis, it could not determine causal links between markers of cerebral small vessel disease and cognition. Subgroup sizes were limited, especially for CMB location analyses. Moreover, this study lacked an external control group.

The FinnDiane Study was supported by the Folkhälsan Research Foundation, Wilhelm and Else Stockmann Foundation, Medical Society of Finland, and State Funding for University-level Health Research from Helsinki University Hospital. One author reported being a shareholder and co-founder of RokoteNyt Oy, and few authors reported receiving investigator-initiated research grants, serving on advisory boards, and receiving lecture fees from various companies and organisations, including Medscape.

Almost 5 years ago, Canada expanded eligibility for medical assistance in dying (MAiD) to patients without a reasonably foreseeable natural death. This population includes patients with serious and incurable illnesses and those with intolerable psychological suffering. This expansion of eligibility has not been without controversy, and a study in CMAJ describes the approach that clinicians use to assess patients' eligibility for MAiD if their deaths are not reasonably foreseeable.

In Canada's MAiD system, Track 1 encompasses requests from patients whose natural deaths are considered “reasonably foreseeable.” This track allows for simpler safeguards, including the option for a waiver of final consent if capacity is lost, as well as immediate access to MAiD once it has been approved. It applies to patients with serious, incurable conditions (such as terminal cancer) where death is predictable but not necessarily imminent.

In contrast, Track 2 encompasses requests from patients whose natural deaths are not foreseeable. It requires more safeguards, like a 90-day assessment period, unless the patient is at immediate risk of losing the capacity to consent.

The objective of the current study was to describe the clinical decision-making process that assessors use to determine an applicant's eligibility for Track 2. The researchers conducted interviews with 23 healthcare professionals who assess eligibility for MAiD in four Canadian provinces. Of these professionals, 14 were physicians and nine were nurse practitioners.

Sally Thorne, PhD, RN, professor emeritus of nursing at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and a study investigator, outlined the following aspects of these assessments for Medscape News Canada:

“To understand the nature of the suffering that has led to the request, assessors needed to hear from the patient's perspective what the experience of illness or disability had been for them,” Thorne told Medscape News Canada. “They needed to make a determination as to whether the applicant's case best fit the criteria for Track 1 or Track 2.”

A controversial aspect of Track 2 is the assessment of the patient's mental health and his or her ability to request MAiD. Assessors must determine the applicant's mental capacity to make a decision as weighty as a MAiD request, according to the researchers. They must be confident that the decision had been made voluntarily and had not been affected by undue influence from other people or from circumstances that might have restricted their perceived options.

During the 90-day assessment period, the assessors must document previous efforts to seek treatment or support, as well as any difficulties accessing healthcare interventions, the researchers wrote. The assessors also must determine whether any refusals to accept care that had been offered were reasonable, given the applicant's circumstances, experiences, or values.

Critics and disability rights organizations raise concerns about issues such as patient vulnerability, the distinction between treatable suffering and irremediable conditions, and a possible lack of sufficient mental health expertise among assessors.

Practitioners working in the MAiD sector have lost sight of the underlying purpose of MAiD, K. Sonu Gaind, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto in Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. “The entire premise is to provide compassionate relief for somebody when they have intolerable suffering. My concerns about Bill C-7 and the expansion with Track 2 are that we've started providing MAiD for reasons that extend too far and for all sorts of other reasons and other suffering.” Expanding the reasons for which MAiD is provided raises questions about marginalized populations and their psychosocial suffering, Gaind added.

“We all have our vulnerabilities, and those are magnified when we're struggling with anything. With Track 2, although we're saying it's meant for the same reasons, for intolerable suffering of an irremediable medical condition, we've now opened it up so much that we no longer know what we're providing death for,” said Gaind.

While the CMAJ study is presented as an academic paper, said Gaind, the authors appeared to display bias when they wrote, “The work of Track 2 assessors has been further complicated by persistent media misrepresentation of their efforts, which has suggested that assessors are operating outside the bounds of the legislation or providing MAiD to patients without due attention to the social determinants of health or adequate healthcare services.” 

“The references they have cited, which they claim are ‘misrepresentations,' take actual cases from the Ontario Coroners MAiD Review Committee and discuss them,” said Gaind. “The blasé dismissal of the real concerns raised in those references, in those officially documented cases, is highly concerning. It suggests a refusal to even consider whether there might be problems that others have legitimately identified with a system that is providing death. The authors go beyond being dismissive of those concerns; they pejoratively discount and undermine any of those concerns raised by others as ‘mischaracterizations.' I'm not aware of any mischaracterization in the referenced pieces, which raised legitimate concerns shared by many based on documented cases.” 

Concerns associated with Track 2 have prompted the government to postpone MAiD eligibility until March 17, 2027, for patients whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental disorder.

The study was funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Thorne and Gaind reported having no relevant financial relationships.

In patients with coronary artery disease without rheumatoid arthritis (RA), no association was found between anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) seropositivity and mortality. In patients with RA, C-reactive protein (CRP) over time was associated with ACPA seropositivity, and the associations between ACPAs and all-cause mortality and between ACPAs and cardiovascular mortality may have been mediated by CRP.

“[I]n contrast to seronegative RA, in patients with ACPA-positive RA, the ongoing chronic inflammatory process seems to be especially critical in the development of CVD [cardiovascular disease] and is therefore an important therapeutic target to improve long-term outcomes for these seropositive patients with RA,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Veerle F.A.M. Derksen, MSc, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands. It was published online on December 25, 2025, in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The number of ACPA-positive patients with coronary artery disease was limited. Variability in antibody testing methods across cohorts could lead to differences in positivity rates. Population-specific control groups were available only in the LURIC study.

One author reported receiving support from a Dutch Research Council Vidi grant. Another author reported receiving support from the Swedish Rheumatism Association. A third author disclosed receiving grants and personal fees from multiple pharmaceutical companies, including Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, and Sanofi. Abbott, Germany, provided an unrestricted grant for Alinity i anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor immunoglobulin M assays. INOVA supplied diagnostic autoantibody kits free of charge.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Children born to mothers who consume a high-fat, high-sugar diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding face a higher risk of developing fatty liver disease later in life. New research from the University of Oklahoma suggests that risk may be reduced: A study found that supplementing pregnant and lactating mice with a naturally occurring compound produced by healthy gut bacteria significantly lowered rates of fatty liver disease in their offspring as they aged.

The compound, called indole, is naturally made by healthy gut bacteria when they break down tryptophan, an amino acid found in foods such as turkey and nuts. The findings further a promising line of research into preventing a type of fatty liver disease known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). While MASLD affects both adults and children, it tends to progress more rapidly in children and is strongly linked with diabetes.

The prevalence of MASLD in children is about 30% in those with obesity and about 10% in children without obesity. Unfortunately, the risk is higher if a mother is obese or consumes a poor diet. The disease in children is silent and typically isn't discovered until a parent seeks help for their child for liver-related symptoms.""

Jed Friedman, Ph.D., director of the OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center and professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine

Friedman is a lead author of the study, published in the journal eBioMedicine, along with Karen Jonscher, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine. The researchers hypothesized that gut bacteria, known collectively as the microbiome, play an important role in the development of fatty liver disease.

To test that idea, they fed female mice a high-fat, high-sugar (Western-style) diet during pregnancy and lactation. Some of the mice were also given indole. After weaning, the offspring were raised on a normal diet before later being fed a Western-style diet to prompt the development of fatty liver disease.

""Because offspring inherit their microbiome from their mother, a poor maternal diet can shape the infant's microbiome in harmful ways,"" Friedman said.

Among offspring whose mothers received indole, researchers observed several encouraging outcomes. These mice maintained healthier livers, gained less weight, had lower blood sugar levels and smaller fat cells, even after exposure to a Western-style diet later in life. Researchers also saw activation of a protective gut pathway involving the acyl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

In addition, harmful liver fats known as long-chain ceramides were unchanged, while beneficial very long-chain ceramides increased. Perhaps most notably, when gut bacteria from these protected offspring were transferred to other mice that had not been given indole, those mice also showed reduced liver damage – further evidence that the microbiome itself plays a key role in protection.

While the findings are based on animal studies and more research is needed before applying them to humans, the study opens the door to new approaches for reducing the growing burden of MASLD through early prevention.

Except for weight loss, there currently are no approved drugs for the treatment of pediatric MASLD once it takes hold. ""Anything we can do to improve the mother's microbiome may help prevent the development of MASLD in the offspring,"" Jonscher said. ""That would be far better than trying to reverse the disease once it has already progressed.""

One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the clumping of proteins called Tau, which form tangled fibrils in the brain. The more severe the clumping, the more advanced the disease is.

The Tau protein, which has also been linked to many other neurodegenerative diseases, is unstructured in its normal state, but in the pathological state it consists of a well-ordered rigid core surrounded by floppy segments. These disordered segments form a ""fuzzy coat"" that helps determine how Tau interacts with other molecules.

MIT chemists have now shown, for the first time, they can use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to decipher the structure of this fuzzy coat. They hope their findings will aid efforts to develop drugs that interfere with Tau buildup in the brain.

If you want to disaggregate these Tau fibrils with small-molecule drugs, then these drugs have to penetrate this fuzzy coat. That would be an important future endeavor.""

Mei Hong, MIT professor of chemistry and senior author of the new study

MIT graduate student Jia Yi Zhang is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Former MIT postdoc Aurelio Dregni is also an author of the paper.

In a healthy brain, Tau proteins help to stabilize microtubules, which give cells their structure. However, when Tau proteins become misfolded or otherwise altered, they form clumps that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.

Determining the structure of the Tau tangles has been difficult because so much of the protein - about 80 percent - is found in the fuzzy coat, which tends to be highly disordered.

This fuzzy coat surrounds a rigid inner core that is made from folded protein strands known as beta sheets. Hong and her colleagues have previously analyzed the structure of the core in a particular Tau fibril using NMR, which can reveal the structures of molecules by measuring the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei within the molecules.

Until now, most researchers had overlooked Tau's fuzzy coat and focused on the rigid core of the fibrils because those disordered segments change their structures so often that standard structure characterization techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography can't capture them.

However, in the new study, the researchers developed NMR techniques that allowed them to study the entire Tau protein. In one experiment, they were able to magnetize protons within the most rigid amino acids, then measure how long it took for the magnetization to be transferred to the mobile amino acids. This allowed them to track the magnetization as it traveled from rigid regions to floppy segments, and vice versa.

Using this approach, the researchers could estimate the proximity between the rigid and mobile segments. They complemented this experiment by measuring the different degrees of movement of the amino acids in the fuzzy coat.

""We have now developed an NMR-based technology to examine the fuzzy coat of a full-length Tau fibril, allowing us to capture both the dynamic regions and the rigid core,"" Hong says.

For this particular fibril, the researchers showed that the overall structure of the Tau protein, which contains about 10 different domains, somewhat resembles a burrito, with several layers of the fuzzy coat wrapped around the rigid core.

Based on their measurements of protein dynamics, the researchers found that these segments fell into three categories. The rigid core of the fibril was surrounded by protein regions with intermediate mobility, whereas the most dynamic segments were found in the outermost layer.

The most dynamic segments of the fuzzy coat are rich in the amino acid proline. In the protein sequence, these prolines are near the amino acids that form the rigid core, and were previously thought to be partially immobilized. Instead, they are highly mobile, indicating that these positively charged proline-rich regions are repelled by the positive charges of the amino acids that form the rigid core.

This structural model gives insight into how Tau proteins form tangles in the brain, Hong says. Similar to how prions trigger healthy proteins to misfold in the brain, it is believed that misfolded Tau proteins latch onto normal Tau proteins and act as a template that induces them to adopt the abnormal structure.

In principle, these normal Tau proteins could add to the ends of existing short filaments or pile onto the sides. The fact that the fuzzy coat wraps around the rigid core indicates that normal Tau proteins more likely add onto the ends of the filaments to generate longer fibrils.

The researchers now plan to explore whether they can stimulate normal Tau proteins to assemble into the type of fibrils seen in Alzheimer's disease, using misfolded Tau proteins from Alzheimer's patients as a template.

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

New findings indicate television CPR scenes frequently mislead viewers about who needs CPR, where cardiac arrests occur, and how CPR should be performed.

Study: Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Compression-Only CPR on Scripted Television. Image credit: Pixel-Shot/Shutterstock.com

In a recent research letter published in Circulation: Population Health and Outcomes, researchers analyzed depictions of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (COCPR) on scripted television.

Annually, more than 350,000 OHCAs occur, and bystander CPR administration can increase the odds of survival. The American Heart Association (AHA) has introduced public awareness programs to decrease barriers to bystander action, with emphasis on COCPR. However, COCPR prevalence is low, especially in females and Black and Latino individuals.

The reasons for the low prevalence are multifactorial. The lack of depiction of COCPR in scripted television could be one reason. A scoping review found that health content on television could influence the behaviors of viewers. While studies have investigated CPR depictions in medical dramas, there is no examination of on-screen OHCA and COCPR across scripted television more broadly.

In the present descriptive study, researchers examined the depiction of OHCA and COCPR on scripted television. The team searched the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for OHCA and COCPR depictions in television episodes. Non-American, unscripted shows, and those released before 2008, when the AHA endorsed COCPR, were excluded. The search strategy identified 169 episodes.

The researchers assessed whether the character received COCPR for each OHCA and derived sociodemographic variables of the individual experiencing OHCA and COCPR provider(s) from contextual cues, plot dialogue, and actor IMDb pages. Adherence to correct COCPR was defined as checking for scene safety or responsiveness, calling or asking someone to call 911, and beginning chest compressions. Episodes were coded as OHCA if the event was perceived as cardiac arrest, irrespective of medical accuracy.

Overall, OHCA was depicted in 93 episodes, 91 percent of which depicted CPR. Of these, 54 episodes depicted out-of-hospital CPR administration by a layperson likely not trained in basic life support. These 54 episodes, which potentially depicted COCPR, were included in descriptive analyses. Correct COCPR was shown in only 16 episodes, and breaths were given along with compressions in 26 episodes.

Further, the pulse was checked in 23 episodes. The incorrect depictions were not satirical. The primary witnesses to an OHCA were friends, 22 percent, partners, 20 percent, or coworkers or strangers, 18 percent. One-fifth of OHCAs in the sample occurred at home. Most individuals receiving COCPR were White, approximately 65 percent, male, 68 percent, and aged 21–40 years, 44 percent. Similarly, most people performing COCPR were White, 70 percent, male, 64 percent, and aged 21–40 years, 64 percent.

In sum, the study found inaccuracies that may mislead viewers about OHCAs. More than 50 percent of COCPR recipients were aged below 40 years, whereas the real-world average age of COCPR receipt is 61.8 years. Moreover, 80 percent of OHCAs occur at home in real life compared to 20 percent in the sample. Television depictions also commonly featured males and White individuals as both COCPR providers and recipients, which may reflect broader disparities in on-screen roles rather than intentional bias, but could nonetheless influence viewer perceptions and represent an area for future research on implicit bias.

The study's limitations include missing COCPR depictions not captured by the search strategy, use of actor demographics from IMDb, and coder bias. Additionally, the study did not account for the sociodemographic distribution of the audience. Overall, 58 percent of those experiencing an OHCA received COCPR, which is higher than the real-world likelihood, around 40 percent, and may motivate people to act if they witness an OHCA.

However, the frequent portrayal of outdated practices, such as pulse checks, runs counter to current AHA efforts to reduce barriers to bystander action. Because the analysis is observational and descriptive, the findings do not establish causal effects on viewer behavior. The authors note that collaboration between public health agencies and content creators could help align on-screen portrayals with contemporary resuscitation guidance and address disparities in COCPR receipt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI tool helps clinicians quickly understand complex patient medical histories","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260114/AI-tool-helps-clinicians-quickly-understand-complex-patient-medical-histories.aspx","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 02:03:00 GMT","

An AI-guided platform at Penn Medicine allows clinicians to quickly and easily unearth pertinent information from patients' electronic health records that otherwise might have been difficult to find.

Before a patient visit, many doctors have a single, deceptively complicated question: ""Why is this person seeing me?"" 

Patients are complex, so doctors have a lot of homework to do for every person they see. Everyone, from an infant to a centenarian, has a unique medical history that constantly grows with wide-ranging data from things like test results, scans, family histories, prescriptions, treatments, and referrals, all documented and integrated over time in their health records. What led a patient to stepping into their doctor's office could be a combination of all, some, or none of that data.  

Enter Chart Hero, a new generative artificial intelligence-powered, chat-based system created at Penn Medicine's Center for Health Care Transformation and Innovation (CHTI) in partnership with the Penn Medicine Data and Technology Solutions (DTS) team and clinical leaders in the health system. 

Clinicians can ask Chart Hero, which appears like a sidebar in the electronic health record, to help them automatically gather, arrange, synthesize, and assist in the interpretation of all the pertinent information they'd need for a patient they're going to see, and do it in a minute or two with a couple simple queries instead of digging through piles of data in multiple areas of the electronic health record. 

A clinician using Chart Hero is like a paleontologist who can just summon the bones of a Tyrannosaurus, pre-assembled, out of the rock in front of them instead of spending years digging into the side of a cliff.  

""It saves so much time that I would spend very inefficiently searching for an answer to my questions,"" said Tessa Cook, MD, PhD, an associate professor of Radiology and vice chair of Practice Transformation in that department. ""There was a day when it wasn't available, and I thought, 'I have to figure all of this out by myself? Are you kidding?'""  

Yevgeniy ""Eugene"" Gitelman, MD, a clinical associate professor of Hospital Medicine, head of custom software at CHTI and associate chief health information officer, began working on Chart Hero late last year. 

""A doctor reached out to me saying he had to summarize all of these notes and it was a big pain,"" Gitelman said. ""There's just so much data in the charts, and everyone was saying 'Why don't we make it as easy as ChatGPT to find information?'"" 

What Gitelman and his colleagues created is effectively a conversational AI chat that has considerable search abilities while also safeguarding patient information to the exacting standards of HIPAA privacy laws. In addition to building its search and organizational functions, the team also made Chart Hero able to suggest, if asked, potential courses of action for patients that doctors can use their knowledge to review.  

""There's so much documentation happening across different teams, all these different people looking at the same things, but we haven't been easily able to make use of the work that everyone has done,"" Gitelman said. 

The tool has been developed to be as friendly for clinicians to use as possible. That includes making it ""smart"" enough to determine when someone might be confused. 

""You can ask it, 'Who placed this G tube?' and it will tell you who, but also clarify, 'It's actually a J-tube,' which is a different kind of feeding tube,"" Gitelman said. 

When patients have multiple overlapping or similar conditions, the ability to sort through detailed information is also extremely valuable. 

""If a clinician asks, 'What is this patient's oncologic history,' it can break things apart and clarify that the patient has something like two separate cancers and, 'Here is the course and treatment for each one, separately,'"" Gitelman said. 

Other health systems have taken swings at something similar, but Penn Medicine's may be the most comprehensive, functional tool in large part due to a specific advantage it has-a unique system that covers a lot of ground and people across the health system. With data from populations that range from Lancaster through Chester Counties, into Philadelphia, and up north to Princeton and Doylestown, with practices dotted in all the areas in between, the data it was built on is diverse and complex. 

We have most of our offices and hospitals on the same platform, on the same set of pipes that have powered all of the other apps our teams have created for years. Chart Hero is built on data that's diverse and extensive. And when you combine our team's experience with that data advantage, an EHR-embedded product like Chart Hero is going to deliver deeper, more contextualized insights."" 

Srinath Adusumalli, MD, MSHP, MBMI, chief health information officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System and an associate professor of Cardiovascular Medicine

To this point, much of the artificial intelligence employed in medicine has been in the realm of interpreting and assisting with radiology results-catching hard-to-see tumors on CT scans, offering better measurements of organs on MRIs to track disease progression, and the like.  

Much of the AI employed in the realm of large language models also ""lacks clinical context,"" Cook said, not understanding how different medical conditions fit together or how they influence each other. 

But Cook, the radiologist, said Chart Hero is something different. It seems to understand the clinic and bring what is important-and what might escape her otherwise-to the forefront almost immediately.  

""I can just type, 'Why is the patient here for a cardiac MRI?' and get a summary of their cardiac history and work-up to date. Or I can ask, 'Have they had gastric bypass surgery?' Because sometimes it's not obvious from their chart or recent imaging, but it'll sure look like they did on their imaging today, and that's important to know,"" Cook said. ""And Chart Hero can figure that out for me right away. That helps me and the patient."" 

Cook estimated that, some days, using Chart Hero saves her up to two hours that would have otherwise been spent work on her patients' charts 

Adusumalli also saw time savings and values Chart Hero's speed. 

""Just recently, I had a patient schedule at 8:30 a.m. for a 10:00 a.m. visit,"" Adusumalli said. ""But all I had to do was click one button in Chart Hero and then I knew everything I had to know. Otherwise, the nurse I work with would need 30 minutes to pull relevant information, and then I'd be clicking through three or four different tabs, and it'd take me 10 times the amount of work to get what Chart Hero pulled for me."" 

The tool fits into Penn Medicine's wider strategic effort to use technology to simplify patient care and create more time for meaningful patient interactions. As such, Chart Hero slots in comfortably with other initiatives like ambient listening, the AI scribe technology more than 1,200 providers are using across Penn Medicine to automatically take notes during patient visits-so they can focus on listening, not typing.  

""Imagine you're a clinician, seeing a new patient: You want to get up to speed, so you can use Chart Hero to generate a summary, and then that is effectively the seed for the visit,"" Adusumalli said. 

The summary Chart Hero helped generate then guides the visit while ambient listening takes comprehensive notes, adding to that original note.  

""At the end, you can review everything quickly, and you've had a productive visit with a new patient where you're not just tied to your computer,"" Adusumalli said. 

The team envisions Chart Hero or similar tools being two-way in the future: not just to be used by care providers, but the patients, too. They can arrive at their visit with even more clarity about their top concerns. 

Then, Adusumalli envisions, ""the tech melts into the background and we have a natural interaction.""  

""This is technology supporting a visit end-to-end,"" Adusumalli said. ""And it makes it so we can just take care of people.""  

Chart Hero is not yet employed across the entire health system, but its users are growing. In August 2025, there were 10 clinicians testing it. Now, 30 are helping to stress-test it.  

As they work to expand its use, the development team is also working carefully to smooth out some of the challenges they've encountered with implementation. Like many AI systems, there is risk of hallucination, where an AI generates false, incorrect, or misleading information that it presents as fact. The development team is working to eliminate these hallucinations, with the human doctors testing invaluable for discovering and correcting them. 

""To combat errors, we've made it so that the AI ties every statement to chart data and clinicians have one-click access to source material,"" said Damien Leri, senior principal engineer at CHTI. ""A secondary AI audit is also being tested to improve our tool's accuracy."" 

They view Chart Hero as an ongoing project, and human review remains a critical safeguard in validating outputs. 

""We're not just providing tech and walking away,"" said Lauren Hahn, MBA, senior director of product management at CHTI. ""[We ask:] How do we introduce this into clinicians' workflows, as well as potentially redesign care delivery, in a way that is human-centered and easy to approach?""  

She said that the multidisciplinary expertise of the team developing this, along with their experience scaling projects, is important because they know what it takes to make an enduring solution, rather than a one-off. 

""Technology only matters if people are willing to use it and use it over time,"" said Raina Merchant, MD, MSHP, executive director of CHTI and chief transformation officer of Penn Medicine. ""With Chart Hero, our goal isn't just accuracy; it's creating something clinicians reach for because it makes their day easier and helps them take better care of patients. That's the kind of change that is sustainable and lasts.""

UF Health Cancer Institute researchers have discovered a small compound produced naturally by gut bacteria that doubled the response to lung cancer immunotherapy treatment in mice and can now be made into a drug for testing in humans.

The findings, published Dec. 19 in Cell Reports Medicine, could have widespread clinical impact as a combination therapy with commonly used immunotherapy treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors, which release the brakes on a patient's own immune system to target their cancer.

""Across all cancers, only about 20% of patients who receive immune checkpoint inhibitors respond to them - 80% do not - so anything that could boost responsiveness is a blockbuster drug,"" said Rachel Newsome, Ph.D., a postdoctoral associate in the lab of Christian Jobin, Ph.D., and the study's first author. ""We envision this small molecule drug could be given at the same time or before immune checkpoint therapy and boost patient responsiveness by 50% without adding any invasive treatment. Our goal is to naturally boost the activity of immunotherapy, so more people have a positive effect from treatment. We want to empty those cancer center parking lots that are so full right now.""

The study builds on years of work in Jobin's lab looking at the complex relationship between the collection of microorganisms, including bacteria, that live in the gut - known as the gut microbiota - and our health and immune system. The new findings that a drug can be made from a natural molecule in the microbiome represent a groundbreaking expansion of the field of microbiome science.

""We created a pipeline to harvest the therapeutic potential of the microbiota through specific steps to get to an active molecule,"" said Jobin, the Gatorade Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the UF College of Medicine and co-leader of the UF Health Cancer Institute's Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program.

In 2018, funding from the Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance and a collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center gave Jobin's lab access to feces from patients enrolled in a clinical trial testing immune checkpoint inhibitors. Feces enable researchers to study the composition of the gut microbiota. The clinical trial collected feces from patients using a preservative that enabled the storage of live bacteria. When researchers transplanted feces from humans who responded to immunotherapy into mice that did not, the mice responded to the treatment.

The discovery was pivotal: It showed that the gut microbiota plays a key role in determining responses to immunotherapy.

The team then reverse-engineered the complex microbiota into single bacteria. Newsome identified six bacterial strains out of more than 180 that, when given to mice with lung tumors, boosted their response to immunotherapy.

But fecal transplants or oral bacteria administration are difficult to implement on a large scale as therapeutics in humans. Researchers needed to identify how the six bacteria promoted the anti-tumor response. From these bacteria, researchers identified a single metabolite, called Bac429, that stimulated an immune response like the six bacteria.

When we injected Bac429 into the tumors of mice with highly nonresponsive lung cancer, they had 50% less tumor growth after immunotherapy. It's a stark difference.""

Rachel Newsome, Ph.D., first author

Newsome and Jobin are developing drug derivatives of the natural Bac429. They're also working to uncover the exact mechanism. They believe the interaction of the naturally produced molecule with immune cells may occur in the gut, with immune cells then migrating to tumors.

The new study focused on lung cancer, the deadliest cancer that's one of the least responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. But the researchers believe the molecule could work in other cancers.

""Combination therapy is being used more and more in cancer,"" Jobin said. ""One could envision having this molecule attached to an antibody or a lipid nanoparticle like those being pioneered at UF.""

Jobin's lab is also researching how diet, and specifically carbohydrate intake, might affect the molecule's function. That could lead to precise diet interventions to boost cancer treatment responses.

UF is pursuing multiple patent applications related to Newsome and Jobin's work on these microbial-derived molecules. Newsome and Jobin have also formed Bebi Therapeutics Inc., a biotech company born as a ""spinout"" from UF in which Jobin and Newsome hold interest. Funding from Gatorade royalties was critical for the work, which was also funded by the National Cancer Institute, the UF Health Cancer Institute and the UF College of Medicine.

Research-backed strategy produces highly homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates (gsADCs) with consistent DAR and tumor suppression lasting over 50 days after a single dose

A new white paper from BioDlink, From Complexity to Consistency: How CDMOs Can Unlock One-Step, High-Yield and Homogeneous ADC Manufacturing for Next-Gen Oncology, reveals an advancement in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) manufacturing - achieving over 95% conjugation yield in under one hour using a one-step glycoengineering strategy. The approach, based on research by Dr. Wei Huang et al., significantly reduces process complexity, manufacturing time, and analytical burden while enhancing product consistency and therapeutic performance.

With more than 210 ADCs in global clinical development, the field is reaching an inflection point where manufacturing limitations threaten to stall progress. Traditional conjugation processes involve multi-step reactions that span several days and often yield heterogeneous products with inconsistent drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), typically ranging from 0 to 8. This variability increases regulatory uncertainty and risks delays in clinical advancement.



Figure 1. Strategies for synthesis of glycosite-specific ADCs

Key Findings:

High-Yield Conjugation in Record Time: The one-step LacNAc-based glycoengineering platform highlighted in this white paper enables over 95% conjugation yield in under one hour, drastically reducing manufacturing time compared to conventional multi-step ADC workflows.

Consistent Product Quality and Stability: The platform produces highly homogeneous gsADCs with a defined DAR of 2, verified through advanced analytics, and maintains low aggregation rates (10.2–14.6%) under stress conditions  -  supporting tighter CQA control and regulatory confidence.

Extended Therapeutic Response: In vivo studies show that a single dose of gsADCs delivers tumor suppression lasting over 50 days, outperforming heterogeneous ADC formats with higher DARs, offering stronger and longer efficacy in HER2-positive cancer models.



Figure 2. Synthesis of glycosite-specific ADCs using LacNAc-based substrates

As a leading global CDMO, BioDlink empowers biotech innovators through advanced technology platforms and strategic partnerships designed to accelerate and de-risk complex biologics development. Based on the core GL-DisacLink® platform technology developed by the Wei Huang team, BioDlink has achieved major breakthroughs in process scale-up, enabling high-yield, site-specific ADC conjugation in a single enzymatic step. Combined with its proprietary BDKcell™ cell line development system - capable of delivering stable clones in just 14 weeks - BioDlink offers a fully integrated solution that enhances product uniformity, reduces off-target effects, and streamlines workflows.

These innovations allow BioDlink to complete ADC development from DNA synthesis to toxicology-ready material in as little as 7 months and file full IND applications within 11 months. For monoclonal antibodies, the timelines are even faster at 6 and 10 months, respectively. In a globally competitive landscape, BioDlink focuses not on being the lowest-cost provider, but on delivering value through speed, quality, and reliability - building long-term, win-win partnerships that advance next-generation therapies to market.

Griffith University researchers may have unlocked the secret to treating sepsis, with a Phase II clinical trial in China successfully concluding with promising results.

The sepsis drug candidate, a carbohydrate-based drug called STC3141, was co-developed by Distinguished Professor Mark von Itzstein AO and his team from Griffith's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, and Professor Christopher Parish and his team at The Australian National University.

""The trial met the key endpoints to indicate the drug candidate was successful in reducing sepsis in humans,"" Professor von Itzstein said.

STC3141 was administered as an infusion via a cannula and counteracted a significant biological molecule release phenomenon which occurred in the body during the course of sepsis.

The small-molecule experimental drug was a carbohydrate-based molecule and could treat sepsis by reversing organ damage.

Sepsis was known to affect millions of hospitalised patients across the world each year and occurred when the body's immune response to an infection attacked and injured its own tissues and organs.

When sepsis is not recognised early and managed promptly, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death.""

Distinguished Professor Mark von Itzstein AO

The trial, conducted by Grand Pharmaceutical Group Limited (Grand Pharma), involved 180 patients with sepsis, one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide.

Currently, there is no specific anti-sepsis therapy available, and sepsis is considered a clinical unmet need.

Professor von Itzstein said Grand Pharma would now look to progress to a Phase III trial to continue testing the efficacy of the novel treatment.

""It's hoped we could see the treatment reach the market in a handful years, potentially saving millions of lives,"" he said.

Executive Director of the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, Professor Paul Clarke, said: ""I am thrilled to see the results of the trial which ultimately aims to save lives.""

""The Institute and its researchers collectively work on translational research to deliver real and immediate impacts both in Australia, and globally to transform lives.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Does night shift work increase osteoporosis risk?","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260115/Does-night-shift-work-increase-osteoporosis-risk.aspx","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:28:00 GMT","

Analysis of more than 270,000 UK adults shows that working through the night, especially on a long-term basis, is linked to weaker bones and higher fracture risk, highlighting an overlooked occupational health concern.

Study: Association between night shift work and risk of osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related pathological fracture. Image credit: Pixel-Shot/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Frontiers in Public Health examined the association between night shift work and osteoporosis (OP) and its related fracture risks. In comparison to day workers, those engaged in usual or permanent night shift work, and to a lesser extent, individuals with past night shift exposure, are associated with a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a widespread systemic skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone density and structural deterioration that makes bones weak, brittle, and susceptible to fractures. Since this condition may develop without any symptoms, it is considered a “silent disease”. In most cases, OP occurs in the hip, spine, or wrist.

Several factors accelerate bone degradation, including age-related bone loss and hormonal shifts, particularly the decline in estrogen during menopause. In addition, genetic predisposition, low body mass index (BMI), prolonged use of certain medications, and lifestyle choices including smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity all elevate risk.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), more than half of U.S. adults aged 50 and older have OP or are at increased risk due to declining bone mass. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) emphasizes that effective primary prevention strategies, such as physical activity, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, orthopedic medications, can significantly reduce OP incidence by mitigating bone mineral density loss. Given this burden, identifying novel risk factors for osteoporosis remains a critical research priority.

Human physiological functions are regulated by an inherent circadian rhythm that optimizes biological processes in alignment with daily environmental and behavioral patterns. Shift work, defined as employment outside conventional daytime hours, significantly disrupts circadian rhythms and sleep cycles. Night shift work is typically defined as working at least three hours between midnight and 6 a.m.

Working in variable shifts has significantly increased in developed countries. For instance, previous research estimates that approximately 21 % of EU and 29 % of US employees are engaged in shift work.

Multiple studies have shown that prolonged and frequent night shift work can disrupt metabolic functions and hormonal secretion, thereby increasing susceptibility to chronic diseases. While research links night shifts to obesity, aging issues, and heart disease, the connection to OP remains less well established.

The current study recruited employed or self-employed participants with night shift exposure from the UK Biobank, which contains over 500,000 individuals aged approximately 40 to 69 years. Any participant with pre-existing osteoporosis was excluded.

At baseline, participants reported their work schedules and were classified as day workers, working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., or shift workers, working in the afternoon, evening, night, or on a mixed-shift rotation. Based on frequency responses, they were further grouped as day workers, shift but never or rarely night shifts, some night shifts, or usual or permanent night shifts.

The lifetime employment data were used to assess whether the duration, total years, and frequency, average number of night shifts per month, of night shift work correlate with OP risk, the primary outcome. In addition, this study assessed whether night shift work interacts with genetic predisposition to influence OP susceptibility. Researchers also evaluated the association between night shift work and OP-related pathological fractures, the secondary outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the hazard ratios (HR) for the association between current night shift work and incident osteoporosis.

After screening, 276,774 participants with 5,906 OP events were analyzed: day workers (82.7 %), shift workers rarely doing nights (8.5 %), some night shifts (4.9 %), and usual or permanent night shifts (3.8 %). Night shift workers were more likely to be male, younger, less educated, with longer work hours, greater socio-economic disadvantage, non-European ethnicity, higher BMI, elevated diabetes prevalence, shorter sleep, and later chronotypes.

Cox models showed that higher night shift exposure categories were generally associated with increased OP risk, with usual night shift workers at the highest risk. Multivariable models confirmed this trend, although the strongest and most statistically robust association was observed among usual or permanent night shift workers. Restricting analyses to OP incidents occurring two or more years after baseline strengthened the association. Usual night shift work also increased OP-related pathological fracture risk, with an HR of approximately 1.9.

Analysis of rotating night shifts before baseline included 75,120 participants, of whom 806 had OP. When lifetime exposure was assessed by total duration, cumulative years of night shift work were generally positively associated with OP odds. In the age-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted model, participants working night shifts for less than five years had a higher OP likelihood than never workers.

Multivariable adjustment suggested a higher risk with longer exposure durations, although estimates for more than 10 years of night shift work were modest and not statistically significant. When lifetime exposure was assessed by frequency, working an average of 3–8 night shifts per month showed the clearest increase in OP risk compared with never workers, highlighting a non-linear pattern of risk.

Sensitivity analyses adjusting for missing values, chronic diseases, cancer, sleep factors, outdoor time, supplements, and female-specific variables did not materially modify these associations, supporting the robustness of the observed night shift, OP relationship. Stratified analyses found no significant interactions between sex, BMI, sleep chronotype, sleep duration, or other AAOS confounders and night shift status, current or lifetime, on OP risk, indicating that the associations were broadly consistent across these subgroups.

Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) was positively correlated with OP risk, indicating a higher risk with higher PRS. No significant interactions between genetic susceptibility and night shift variables were found for OP risk.

This study demonstrates a significant positive association between usual or long-term night shift work and increased risk of osteoporosis and OP-related pathological fractures, independent of genetic susceptibility. As an observational analysis, the findings indicate association rather than causation, but they nonetheless highlight the potential value of targeted bone health screening and preventive interventions among night shift workers.

Although the relative risk was elevated, the absolute risk of osteoporosis for any individual worker remained low. These results suggest that occupational health policies could consider incorporating regular bone density monitoring and lifestyle modifications to help mitigate osteoporosis risk in this vulnerable population.

The versatile talent has entered the picture.

The United States Women's National Team is set for a busy year, with an eye on the back-to-back gauntlet of the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games. The time for experimentation is slowly drawing to a close, as the tested depth chart will be trimmed down into a roster of the best available options. Jameese Joseph has entered the competition at an interesting juncture, having received her first senior call-up and made her debut during the previous camp. The 23-year-old Chicago Stars midfielder-forward is an emerging talent in the National Women's Soccer League and provides a combination of production and diligent industriousness.

Born in Beltsville, Maryland, Joseph competed at the club level with Bethesda SC and was “one of the top scorers in the Elite Clubs National League.” She also played with Good Counsel High School and contributed 30 goals and seven assists in 15 matches as a senior. Ranked a three-star recruit by Top Drawer Soccer and named to the High School All-American Game, the forward committed to North Carolina State University.

“Jameese is one of those natural creative players on the ball who you must give freedom to,” said the program's former head coach, Tim Santoro. “Her attacking instincts are very good and her dribbling is fun to watch. Add to that athleticism and ability to score goals, and she has potential to be special at the next level.”

As a freshman, Joseph started in all 23 matches and contributed three goals and three assists, being named to the 2019 Atlantic Coast Conference All-Freshman Team and United Soccer Coaches All-Region Third Team. She contributed one goal and two assists in the COVID-shortened spring season, followed by nine goals and two assists in 20 fixtures during the following fall, receiving Second-Team All-ACC and USC Atlantic All-Region First Team honors. Her senior campaign included eight goals and two assists in 20 starts and earned her a spot on the Third Team All-ACC. With an extra year of eligibility, her time in Raleigh concluded with three goals and one assist in 17 showings, once again receiving Third Team All-ACC.

Entering the professional ranks, Joseph was selected by the then-Chicago Red Stars (now Chicago Stars FC) with the 15th pick of the 2024 NWSL Draft and signed a three-year contract after ”showing a readiness to compete at the level and contribute.” “Coming in with a lot of personality,” she quickly entered the rotation and converted her first goal in a 3-0 victory over San Diego Wave, becoming a “mainstay” due to her “willingness to be bold and make mistakes.” Her debut campaign that showed “a ton of potential” ended with four goals and three assists in 27 appearances across all competitions, meriting her club's Rookie of the Year and Grit Award.

Last year, Joseph was firmly entrenched in the lineup from opening day and contributed four goals and two assists in 21 appearances, performing as “one of the Stars' most important attackers” despite dealing with a medium-term lower leg injury. Midway through the calendar, the club signed her to a contract extension through 2028 with a “mutual option for 2029,” believing in her potential to “become one of the best players in the league.” Unfortunately, Chicago endured a dismal campaign and finished the schedule at the bottom of the table, with her performances noted as “one of the few positives to follow over the last two seasons.”

Joseph was able to bounce back from her injury and arguably returned stronger. “My teammates really helped me mature and really see the game as a bigger picture, as well as the coaching staff,” she told local media. “I try to take advice from all of them and apply it to my game. I would say I'm a fast learner, and I like to learn and adapt to things. Whatever my teammates and whatever the coaches tell me, I try to apply it to my game as best as I can to help the team. Just listening and learning, for me, is what I took and what I was able to do while I was out and injured and just watching the game and seeing how I could potentially play when I came back.”

At the international level, Joseph participated in an Under-14 training session for the United States in 2016, followed by an invitation with the Under-20 team in 2022. Emma Hayes included her in four different Under-23 sessions in 2025. She received her first senior call-up last November and picked up her debut cap in the first friendly against Italy, coming off the bench for 13 minutes in the 3-0 victory; Goal rated her performance at a six out of ten. Her name was listed for the January camp that concludes with matches against Paraguay and Chile.

Standing at five feet, seven inches tall, Joseph is a forward, winger, and midfielder who puts in a solid defensive shift with over five ball recoveries per 90 minutes, picks her passes judiciously, and challenges opponents off the dribble. She has “another level of athleticism to go with her skill,” and Busy Watching Women's Soccer praised her decision-making that was on display with the USWNT. With intense pressure, weaving runs, and lightning-fast breaks on the counter, her contributions can shift the tenor of proceedings in an instant and introduce an element of chaos against the run of play.

“Though often humble and reserved in team media availability, Joseph is expressive on the pitch,” penned Lesley Ryder for Gal Pal Sports. “She makes creative runs to beat defenders, and fights for every loose ball in her grasp. She plays in a way that may not always show up statistically, at least not yet, but her tenacity in the press allows her to be a magnet in the midfield, and her instincts tend to bring her to the right place, at the right time.”

Joseph is still developing and determining her best role in the professional game, having suffered through a dismal 2025 season in Chicago. Despite a down year at the club level, her play has attracted the interest of Emma Hayes, which indicates a potential future with the USWNT. With two major competitions on the approaching horizon, there are limited opportunities to work her way into the roster, but she has the talent to play a role in this cycle or the next.

Former FC Bayern defender Chris Richards earned a nice award.

Former Bayern Munich prospect and current Crystal Palace center-back Chris Richards was voted U.S. Soccer's Player of the Year:

U.S. Men's National Team defender Chris Richards has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year after an outstanding year in which he started 11 of 12 matches for which he was available for the USMNT and all six matches leading to the 2025 Gold Cup Final, a tournament in which he recorded two goals and earned a spot on the Best XI.

For Richards, it was a big honor and came as a shock as he found out on ESPN's Pat McAfee Show:

“It means a lot to me to join a very prestigious list of players. This has been a big year, and we have an even bigger year coming up. This shows how well we've done as a team and the momentum we are building towards the World Cup,” Richards said.

“It was sick. I see Pat all the time on College GameDay. It was cool for him to announce this on his show and to give a shoutout,” Richards added. “It just shows how much the game is growing in the U.S., how much respect there is for the sport, and how much the excitement is building for the World Cup this summer.”

There was never really a doubt that Richards would be a successful professional, but the timing of his arrival at Bayern Munich just happened to coincide with the squad being extremely deep, talented, and experienced on the backline. As such, he moved on and has lived up the lofty potential he brough with him from Alabama to Bavaria.

ATLANTA (Jan. 15, 2026) – U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, presented by Henkel, after making major strides at the international and club level. The Florida native captained the U.S. U-20 Men's National Team to the quarterfinals of the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, scoring five goals in the competition to become just the second U.S. player to claim the Golden Boot as the leading scorer of the tournament. After starring at MLS club Inter Miami, Cremaschi currently plays on loan with Serie A side Parma.

Of the five finalists for Young Male Player of the Year, Cremaschi took 38.9 percent of the weighted vote, followed by Cavan Sullivan (34.8 percent) and Mathis Albert (12.3 percent).

“This award means a lot to me,” Cremaschi said. “It's a representation of how my year went with my clubs and the National Team. This is an amazing accomplishment, but it also speaks to all the people around me that keep me going as a player. I want to thank my family, teammates and everyone that made this award possible. My U-20 teammates gave me the confidence I needed to be the player and leader I needed to be at the World Cup. That is a group of guys I will never forget. I also want to thank Marko Mitrovic – a coach I've had at many different levels with the National Team – for his belief and guidance along the way. Finally, I'm so grateful to my family, for their support and love.”

Votes for U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year Awards are collected from National Team coaches, USMNT players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, professional league head coaches and sporting directors, select media members and former players and administrators.

The 2025 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, presented by Henkel, provides the winner with a $10,000 donation toward a charity of the recipient's choice. Cremaschi chose the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST), a premier research organization that is also the largest non-governmental funder of Angelman Syndrome research in the world. Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting the nervous system, affecting one in every 15,000 people, including Benjamin Cremaschi's cousin.

“We congratulate Benjamin on this well-deserved recognition and celebrate the example he is setting for young athletes,” said Jennifer Schiavone, Henkel Vice President, Corporate Communications, Americas. “Henkel is honored to be the presenting sponsor of this year's awards and the first to provide charitable donations in the names of these young players.”

“I want to thank Henkel for this generous donation to the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics,” Cremaschi said. “When they told me there was a donation to the charity of my choice if I won this award, my cousin Martin was obviously the first person I thought of because of the struggles he experiences and the things my uncle and aunt go through. FAST is an organization that does amazing work to drive forward research and development programs for those living with Angelman syndrome and I'm proud to help contribute to their effort.”

The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team returned to the U-20 World Cup after a quarterfinal finish in 2023, with Cremaschi captaining the U.S. throughout the tournament. The midfielder started every game for the USA in Chile, leading the Americans to the quarterfinals for the fifth consecutive tournament. In the team's historic 9-1 group stage victory over New Caledonia, Cremaschi proved to be the key player registering a hat trick in addition to notching two assists. The midfielder added to his goal tally with a brace in a 3-0 Round of 16 victory over 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup runners-up Italy. After scoring five goals in the tournament, Cremaschi set a U.S. U-20 MNT record for most goals scored in a single tournament on the way to winning the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot.

After making his full senior international debut in September 2023, Cremaschi has continued to integrate himself into the U.S. setup including competing with the U.S. Men's Olympic Team for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris as the youngest member of the team. Following strong performances with the Olympic team and Inter Miami, Cremaschi earned his first call-up under USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino last January, starting both friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica.

At club level, Cremaschi was an integral part of the Inter Miami setup, playing 22 games with 16 starts. During the 2025 season, Cremaschi registered one goal and four assists for a team that would go on to win the 2025 MLS Cup. The midfielder's strong showings led to European interest, with Italian Serie A club Parma signing Cremaschi on loan during the summer transfer window, where he has appeared in three matches, including a start in the Coppa Italia.

Cremaschi is the 28th player to be voted the U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, an award a player can only win once. Future two-time World Cup player Josh Wolff was the inaugural winner back in 1998, with the prize also claimed by future World Cup players Ben Olsen (1999), Landon Donovan (2000), DaMarcus Beasley (2001), Bobby Convey (2002), Eddie Johnson (2004), Benny Feilhaber (2005), Jozy Altidore (2006), Michael Bradley (2007), DeAndre Yedlin (2014), Christian Pulisic (2016), Josh Sargent (2017), Sergiño Dest (2019), Gio Reyna (2020) and Yunus Musah (2022).","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Goodman: The best soccer player in the U.S. is from Alabama","https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2026/01/goodman-the-best-soccer-player-in-the-us-is-from-alabama.html","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:10:00 GMT","

This is an opinion column.

Alabama's own Chris Richards, the international soccer star, was named U.S. Soccer Male Player Of the Year on Wednesday.

Naturally, this gives me confidence that the United States will win the World Cup this summer. With Sweet Home Alabama now leading the United States Men's National Team, it's fair to assume that this will be the toughest group of Americans for an international test of strength and character since Rocky IV.

The World Cup is in June. The U.S. is in Group D for the round-robin portion of the international competition. So far Group D is the U.S., Paraguay and Australia. That group's fourth and final team will come from Europe after a playoff between Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.

I have enormous levels of respect for all of those countries. I've known a bunch of rugged dudes from Paraguay and Australia. Slovakia just sounds scary. Let's be real, though. If this is the World Cup when Alabama steps to the line, then I don't like the world's chances.

Richards is from the Birmingham area. He grew up in Hoover. He's a center-back for the USMNT and a starting defender for Crystal Palace in the Premier League. They love Richards in South London. At only 25 years old, he's already a Palace legend after leading the team to its first FA Cup championship in the club's 120 years of history.

The FA Cup is the United Kingdom's all-divisions tournament. Crystal Palace winning it all is like Indiana winning the national championship in college football. This season, Palace was playing well until Richards injured his ankle in November. Since then, not so much.

Coincidence? Absolutely not.

But Richards should be back soon from his injury, and he's going to be ready for the World Cup. He received his award from U.S. Soccer during an interview on ESPN with Pat McAfee. It was a special moment since Richards, being from Alabama, is such a big college football fan.

“It was sick,” Richards said. “I see Pat all the time on College GameDay.”

McAfee knows his soccer, too. He asked Richards about leading the U.S. into the World Cup.

“It means the world to me,” Richards said. “People are going to say it's a lot of pressure, but pressure builds diamonds. With this team, with this country, we're Americans — we like to win, we like to scrap, we like to fight.

“That's what we're going to do in the summer and hopefully by the end of it we're holding a big trophy.”

The USMNT's opening match of the World Cup is June 12 against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. The championship final is July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The USMNT has never played in the championship of the men's World Cup, but the Yanks have also never been led by an international soccer star from Alabama.

I've known Richards for years. He's nails. His dad played basketball at Birmingham-Southern, but it was pretty clear at an early age that Richards had a bright future on the pitch. German powerhouse Bayern Munich signed Richards when he was only 18 years old. He transferred to Palace in 2022 and now he's on his way to being one of the top defenders in the world.

People might think I'm joking about the U.S. having a chance to win the World Cup. I'm not. Sometimes you just gotta believe in fantastical stuff. The Miracle on Ice comes to mind and Mary Lou Retton's perfect 10 on a bad knee to win Olympic Gold. Those two moments happened on home soil, and the U.S. is hosting this summer's World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.

Southern grit is exactly what this team needs. I've been saying it for years. The U.S. got pretty soft after the Clint Dempsey days. The USMNT didn't even make the World Cup in 2018. What a disaster. What an embarrassment. It's like the team's style of play got too cute. Since then, interest in the USMNT has taken a dive. 

Let the Brazilians play the beautiful game. The U.S. will win with its courage and edge. That's why Richards needs to be named the team's permanent captain before the World Cup, and I suspect that he will.

It's time for a resurgence. It's time to reignite the fire and build this team with some Birmingham steel.

In addition to Richards, there's a chance that another Birmingham-area player could also crack the starting lineup for the World Cup. Tanner Tessman, who is the godson of Dabo Swinney, is another Alabama brawler expected to make the team. Tessman plays in France and is having a great season with Lyon. 

Could you imagine? Two guys in the World Cup who have eaten Milo's burgers, ribs from Dreamland and gazed upon Vulcan's well-sculpted physique?

I'm not sure the world's ready for that kind of barbecue smoke.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","🇯🇲🐍 One Love, one club, one World Cup? Andre Blake hoping for 'dream come true' 2026 & beyond","https://getconcacafed.substack.com/p/one-love-one-club-one-world-cup-andre","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:40:32 GMT","

From the outside looking in, 2025 was a ‘nearly' year for Andre Blake.

The goalkeeper helped the Philadelphia Union to the Supporters' Shield with an MLS-low mark of 35 goals conceded as a team in the regular season. But the Union were bumped out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals - and Blake missed a number of matches with injury or international duty.

He backstopped Jamaica in the final round of World Cup qualification, allowing just three goals. But Jamaica fell short of earning an automatic place in the 2026 field.

But Blake doesn't see it like that, opting to put the near-misses aside and focus on what was achieved. He lifted a trophy. He had a good season. The World Cup dream is still alive.

“In perspective, 2025 was a great year for me,” he told me last week. “For both club and country, there's definitely been challenging times in 2025. So for me, it's just important to take whatever I need to take from 25 and just flush whatever I need to flush and understand that it's 2026. 

“It's a new year, and it's a new opportunity.”

The biggest opportunity for Blake is the World Cup. Jamaica will play in the inter-confederation playoff, looking to beat New Caledonia, then DR Congo to return to the Men's World Cup for the first time since Jamaica's debut in 1998.

Blake and his teammates may have thought they would be able to get to the tournament in North America without the playoff. Jamaica controlled its destiny heading into the final two matches of qualification, but two points in the last two games saw Curacao leapfrog Jamaica into the automatic qualification place.

“We still have a chance,” Blake said. “Obviously, it's not going to be easy, but we kind of put ourselves in this position, and we're going to have to go out there and fight for our lives to get to where we want to be.”

Had the Reggae Boyz held on to a one-goal edge in their penultimate match of qualification, an away game in Trinidad and Tobago, they would've needed only a stalemate on the final day. But a Kevin Molino goal in the 85th minute meant settling for a point in Port of Spain - and ceding the draw scenario to Curacao.

Blake held The Blue Wave at bay in the finale, making four saves. He could do little, however, to help his teammates find a goal that would've made the difference. 

“It was a devastating moment for me in Kingston. I feel like the entire country was at the game,” Blake said. “The atmosphere was there, the energy was there. The only thing missing from that game was us scoring a goal or two to win the game.”

After the match, Steve McClaren resigned as Jamaica manager. “Once we got back to the locker room, he came in and he just, at that moment, announced that he was going to step away,” Blake recalls.

The Jamaica Football Federation has opted to turn to much more familiar faces. Rudolph Speid, a long-time coach based in Jamaica, is the interim head coach with Miguel Coley and Michael Donaldson named as assistants and Aaron Lawrence, who went to the 1998 World Cup with Jamaica, as goalkeeper coach.

The hope is that group of leaders familiar with Jamaica, plus an experienced squad captained by Blake, will be able to strip things back to basics and lead a charge past an underdog from Oceania and a DR Congo team that is favored to go through thanks to its staunch defense.

“We have the pieces for sure. We just haven't been able to bring it together,” Blake said. “For me, the most important thing is, you know, we don't need the best players. We need the right players. As soon as we're able to create that system of who we want to be, and you find players to really fit the system, I think we're going to be really successful once we can get those things right.”

There is no guarantee that happens in March, or that it ever happens in Blake's playing career. Yet, this is how Blake has operated for years. He has seen coaches come and go both for the Union and for the Jamaica national team. He listens, puts on his gloves and runs back out between the sticks.

The 35-year-old continues to put up great numbers and has an additional year on his contract with the Union, the only pro team for which the UCONN product ever has suited up.

The idea of being a one-club man appeals to Blake, even as it becomes increasingly difficult to pull that off in the modern soccer industry.

“Right now I'm Philly for life,” he said. “I've been enjoying my time at the club, the fans show appreciation. My family is comfortable. So that's most important for me. So, I don't know what the future holds, but as long as I continue to be happy and I continue to produce on the field, then I'm all good.”

Replicating last year's dominant MLS campaign may be difficult. The Union traded center back Jakob Glesnes to the LA Galaxy and sold left back Kai Wagner to Birmingham City, meaning Blake will be without a pair of players who made up his typical back four last season.

He hopes the institutional knowledge around the club can help cover those significant gaps as a new defense starts to work in front of him.

“We've created a strong system in Philadelphia where players come in, and it's a smooth transition for players to fit right in,” Blake said. “Over the years we would have lost big time players, and a lot of questions would pop up as to how good we would be losing all those players. But, you know, we have always found ways to still compete and do well. 

“Hopefully, this year can be no different. Obviously, we've lost some big time players, some big shoes to fill. But I'm optimistic that the club would be able to find adequate replacements that can just slot right into the system.”

The 35-year-old Blake said some of the responsibility for the smoothing of those transitions is on him along with fellow veteran Alejandro Bedoya. While he speaks softly off the field, on it he is often barking instructions, communicating with defenders and chatting with the officiating crew.

Yet, it is one the field where he hopes his play speaks the loudest this year - turning those nearly moments into opportunities fulfilled.

“It would be a dream come true for me” Blake says of making the World Cup. “It would bring so much joy to the people of Jamaica, so much inspiration for the younger generation that's coming up.

“We have a fantastic opportunity to make everybody so proud, so happy. It's every footballer's dream to represent their country and to play in the World Cup. We have an opportunity to make that dream a reality.”



Brilliant piece on Blake's mindset through adversity. The mental fortitude to reframe near-misses as building blocks rather than failures is what separates elite athletes from good ones. I rememer watching that Curacao qualifier live and the stadium energy was palpable even through the screen, makes it that much tougher when the result doesn't materialize. If Jamaica can channel that system-based philosophy he mentions into the playoff matches, they've got a real shot at pulling through.

Nominations are being accepted for the 2026 Sports Business Awards. Submit today! Deadline 1/26.

FIFA said that it has “received more than 500 million ticket requests for this year's World Cup,” according to the AP. The organization said that outside the host U.S., Mexico and Canada, the “most requests were made by fans residing in Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.” FIFA added that it will “notify people about their ticket applications no earlier than Feb. 5 and will allocate them randomly for matches in which demand exceeds availability” (AP, 1/14). REUTERS' Angelica Medina noted each application “was validated by unique credit card data,” with fans submitting “an average of 15 million ticket requests per day” (REUTERS, 1/14). 

OVERFLOWING: THE ATHLETIC's Henry Bushnell noted the month-long application window opened shortly after December's World Cup draw and schedule release and allowed fans to “apply for tickets to specific matches, in specific categories, at specific prices.” FIFA will “now conduct random draws for each of the World Cup's 104 matches and award tickets to the selected applicants in February.” The 500-plus million requests -- which “likely represent demand for more than 1 billion tickets, with each request being for 1-4 tickets” -- suggest the World Cup as a whole is “oversubscribed.” In anticipation of that secondary-market demand, some of the more than 500 million requests have “likely come from scalpers” -- people who will purchase tickets and then resell them at a profit. It is “unclear how thoroughly, if at all, FIFA has attempted to block those scalpers from the ticket lottery.” It is “also unclear if FIFA will award all of its remaining tickets to the millions of people who applied over the past month, or if it will withhold some tickets for one last sales phase in the spring” (THE ATHLETIC, 1/14).

The 2026 FIFA World Cup faces several controversies, from the ""absurd"" $40,000 price tags to foreign World Cup nations calling to cancel a popular Washington tourist event. Now, #BoycottWorldCup is trending on social media, with since-debunked reports that nearly 17,000 fans canceled their tickets overnight due to recent policies under President Donald Trump's administration.

And just as this U.S. travel boycott intensifies, international FIFA fans now brace for a new U.S. visa ban on 75 countries. Many fear that this might block their plans to attend the World Cup. This visa ban was announced today, the same day FIFA revealed a record-breaking number of global requests for World Cup tickets. Here is a closer look at these events that are sending FIFA fans into a panic (and why they shouldn't).

On Saturday (Jan. 10), Jordanian news source Roya News reported that FIFA had scheduled a meeting for next week after 16,800 people (0.0005% of ticket requests) canceled their 2026 World Cup tickets. Today, FIFA clarified that these reports were ""false,"" telling WFAA that they have ""no validity at all.""

World Cup tickets are also non-refundable and non-transferable, except through FIFA's official resale platform, where resale administration fees apply. Despite this clarification, #BoycottWorldCup continues to make noise on social media, reflecting global concerns over the U.S. political climate.

""We need to boycott the FIFA World Cup for all games held in the USA,"" someone wrote in a Facebook group with nearly 400,000 members. ""We should also tell all foreign tourists to not visit the US right now. The United States is a monster right now and there is no need for others to feed it.""

Among the leading causes of the boycott are safety concerns, the Trump administration's expanded travel bans, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. TheTravel previously reported on the White House hinting that foreign World Cup attendees could be targeted by immigration raids.

In a new memo, the U.S. Department of State states that it is pausing immigrant visa processing for 75 countries starting Jan. 21 in an effort to strengthen its screening of applicants deemed likely to become a ""public charge."" First reported by Fox News today, the announcement immediately caused anxiety among international soccer fans.

FIFA giants, like Brazil and Colombia, are among the impacted nations. But the good news is that this U.S. visa processing freeze will not affect World Cup visitors since it only applies to immigration visas, not temporary tourist or business visas.

FIFA fans, however, must note that certain countries must now pay a $250 visa integrity fee for tourist visas. This applies to travelers from countries not in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), like China, India, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, and the Philippines, along with most of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Tourists from VWP countries, such as most of Europe, Australia, Japan, as well as citizens of Canada and Bermuda, remain exempt.

The anxious sentiments surrounding the 2026 World Cup do not seem to reflect the global demand for tickets. Today, FIFA also revealed that it had received a record-breaking 500 million ticket requests, with high interest from countries including Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina, and Colombia.

Even the high prices could not stop these fans. During this 33-day application window, FIFA received applications from fans in all 211 FIFA member nations for the Colombia vs. Portugal match in Miami. Back in December, FIFA also confirmed that the total prize pool for the 2026 World Cup was an unprecedented $727 million, a 50% increase from the $440 million in Qatar 2022.

The 2026 World Cup winner will receive a record-breaking $50 million jackpot. The U.S. alone is expected to see a historic windfall from this event, which is projected to contribute up to $17.2 billion to the country's GDP, $30.5 billion in gross output, and 185,000 full-time jobs, according to a 2025 study by FIFA and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

With major events coming to the U.S. in 2026 including the FIFA World Cup and the 250th U.S. birthday celebrations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is looking to the skies to enhance security. 

DHS launched a new office dedicated to quickly buying and deploying drone technology.

The office is called the DHS Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Its mission is to oversee strategic investments in drone and counter-drone technologies that can outpace evolving threats and tactics.

“Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “This will help us continue to secure the border and cripple the cartels, protect our infrastructure, and keep Americans safe as they attend festivities and events during a historic year of America's 250th birthday and FIFA 2026.”

The office is already operational and is in the process of finalizing a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies. 

“The new Program Executive Office will be taking the threat of hostile drones head-on and innovating ways drones can keep us safe from other threats on the ground, equipping the Department with the technology and expertise we need to keep us Americans safe,” said a DHS news release. 

DHS is also fielding proposals for a $1.5 billion contract to facilitate the procurement of drone technologies for use by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement.  

DHS says it has conducted over 1,500 missions to protect the U.S. from illicit drone activities since 2018. 

And the office is just the latest piece of the administration's focus on drone security. 

The administration committed $500 million through the initial counter-drone program in October. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded $250 million in grants to the 11 World Cup host states and the National Capital Region in December.

FIFA says it received more than 500 million ticket requests for the 2026 World Cup during its month-long Random Selection Draw application window, highlighting unprecedented global demand for the first-ever 48-team tournament across the United States, Mexico and Canada. The window ran from Dec. 11 through Jan. 13 following December's World Cup draw and schedule release.

FIFA confirmed applications were submitted from fans living in all 211 member associations, with host nations the United States, Mexico and Canada among the top applicant countries, alongside Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. 

The most requested match during this phase was Colombia vs. Portugal in Miami on June 27. Other highly sought-after fixtures included Mexico vs. Korea Republic in Guadalajara, the World Cup final in New Jersey on July 19, the tournament opener between Mexico and South Africa in Mexico City, and a Round of 32 match in Toronto on July 2 that is expected to feature either Portugal or Colombia.

The scale of demand is striking even in context. FIFA has already sold roughly two million tickets during presales held before the full schedule was announced and is believed to have approximately four to five million tickets remaining across the 104-match tournament.  With each application covering between one and four tickets, the 500-million-plus requests likely represent interest in well over one billion individual tickets. 

While FIFA has pointed to the overwhelming demand as validation of its pricing strategy, ticket costs have drawn sustained criticism from supporters, particularly in North America. Prices across all stages of the tournament are significantly higher than previous World Cups, deterring some fans while pushing others toward the secondary market. According to the Athletic, resale platforms such as StubHub and Vivid Seats currently list many matches well above face value, though prices could fluctuate - especially for less prestigious group-stage fixtures - as the tournament approaches. 

FIFA acknowledged it conducted validation checks during the application process, stating that each request was tied to unique credit card data and subject to household limits. Fans will begin receiving notification emails no earlier than Feb. 5, with applications categorized as successful, partially successful, or unsuccessful. Those who miss out will have another opportunity when FIFA opens its last-minute sales phase closer to the tournament, with tickets sold on a first-come, first-served basis.

FIFA has also emphasized that its official ticketing platform and resale marketplace remain the only authorized channels for purchases.

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot is facing fresh scrutiny over his treatment of Federico Chiesa, with the winger's former mentor branding the Dutchman's selection policy a ""mystery."" As the Italian international closes in on a sensational return to Juventus this month, questions are being asked about why a player perfectly suited to the Premier League was left in the cold at Anfield.

The brief and largely forgettable Premier League chapter of Chiesa's career appears to be drawing to a premature close. Less than 18 months on since arriving on Merseyside with a reputation as one of Europe's most explosive wingers, the 28-year-old is reportedly in negotiations to return to Serie A. While Liverpool continue their campaign under Slot, the imminent departure of the Italian forward has sparked a debate regarding his management. Maurizio Romei, the president and coach of Settignanese, the club where Chiesa took his very first footballing steps, has publicly questioned Slot's refusal to utilise a player he believes was tailor-made for English football, but has managed just four starts in his 21 appearances in all competitions this season.

Speaking to TuttoMercatoWeb, Romei expressed his bewilderment at how the situation at Anfield has unravelled. Having recently celebrated a historic milestone of 6,000 matches on the touchline across a 50-year career, the veteran coach has watched Chiesa's development from a child to a European champion. For Romei, the lack of opportunities afforded to Chiesa by Slot is baffling, particularly given the player's professional conduct and tactical attributes.

Romei did not hold back in his assessment of Chiesa's time in England. While acknowledging the fierce competition for places in Liverpool's attack, particularly from Mohamed Salah, he insisted that Chiesa's omission from the side went beyond simple squad rotation. He argued that the open, high-intensity nature of the Premier League should have been the perfect stage for Chiesa's direct running and pace, making his bench-warming role all the more confusing.

""I hoped he would have much more space, also because English football suits him well,"" Romei explained. ""There is more space there and they are less cautious. I watch all the Premier League matches and I say it for this reason. But they didn't use him much, beyond the small injuries he may have had. He, by the way, performed very, very well.""

The veteran coach labelled the situation a ""mystery,"" highlighting that there were no behavioural issues or rifts behind the scenes. ""The attackers are there at Liverpool, starting with Salah. I didn't really understand it,"" Romei admitted. ""Chiesa didn't make enemies, quite the opposite: you saw the hugs he received when he scored. I heard all the statements: he always speaks well of the coach. The fans love him, in fact. It's a mystery.""

A return to Turin seems inevitable for Chiesa. Reports from Italy confirm that these are ""hot hours"" for the transfer, with Juventus and Liverpool currently in contact to finalise a deal. The Bianconeri are eager to bring their former star back to the Allianz Stadium to bolster the squad available to Luciano Spalletti, who is reportedly keen to work with the winger at club level.

Romei believes that while Napoli would also be a suitable destination, a return to Juventus makes the most sense due to Chiesa's familiarity with the environment. After a difficult spell abroad, returning to a place where he understands the culture and expectations could be the catalyst for a revival.

""I think that if he decided to return to Serie A, the two clubs he could go to would be Juventus and Napoli, considering the level and team needs,"" Romei stated. ""It remains to be understood that perhaps he would be more useful to Napoli than to the Bianconeri, but it must be said that he knows the whole Juve environment well. And perhaps for this reason, he might be more inclined to return to Turin.""

One of the key takeaways from Romei's defence of his former pupil is the emphasis on Chiesa's attitude. Despite being frozen out by Slot, the player has maintained a dignified silence, refusing to disrupt the dressing room or criticise the manager in the media. Romei pointed to the visible affection from teammates and fans during his rare cameo appearances as proof that the issue lay in the technical area, not with the player himself.

This professionalism will be a key asset for Juventus. They are not signing a disruptive figure, but a hungry professional desperate to prove that his English nightmare was a result of circumstances rather than a decline in ability. Romei's comments suggest that Chiesa has been a victim of Slot's rigid system rather than his own shortcomings, a sentiment that will offer hope to Juventus fans that they are re-signing the electric forward of old, rather than a damaged asset.

With the World Cup playoffs looming, Chiesa knows he needs regular minutes to force his way back into the Italy setup. In this timeline, the Azzurri are managed by Gennaro Gattuso, a coach who values grit and determination.

Romei is convinced that a move to Juventus is a direct play to secure his spot in the national team for the crucial qualifiers. He believes that Gattuso is ready to call upon Chiesa, provided he is playing and match-fit.

""Surely,"" Romei replied when asked if the move was linked to the World Cup playoffs. ""Even staying in this situation at Liverpool, Gattuso, in my opinion, would call him. He has already called him, it is he [Chiesa] who didn't want to go, he didn't want to risk it because he wasn't ready, in my opinion. There weren't even too many hopes of qualification, after all.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Morgan Rogers tipped to make sensational £80m transfer move to Premier League powerhouse as Aston Villa legend thinks even Man Utd could tempt England star despite enduring another terrible season","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/morgan-rogers-tipped-80m-transfer-premier-league-powerhouse-aston-villa-man-utd-england/bltcf7347edf461650c","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:22:25 GMT","

Morgan Rogers is being tipped to complete a stunning £80 million ($107m) transfer to a Premier League powerhouse at some point in the not too distant future. Former Villans striker Stan Collymore has explained to GOAL why the England international will likely be on the move in upcoming windows and which teams will be leading the chase for his signature.

Rogers has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence since first being acquired by Manchester City in 2019. He was playing League One football on loan at Lincoln in 2020-21, but made his senior England bow in November 2024 and is now hoping to make Thomas Tuchel's plans for this summer's World Cup.

The talented 23-year-old appears destined to get that call, as he competes with Real Madrid superstar Jude Bellingham for the right to fill a No.10 berth with the Three Lions, and continues to see his stock soar at club level. A move from Middlesbrough to Villa which could be worth £15m ($20m) was completed in February 2024.

Morgan has illuminated Premier League and Champions League stages since then, leading to inevitable exit talk being generated. He is now tied to a contract at Villa through to 2031, but those terms are merely protecting a prized asset and keeping his asking price high.

Collymore concedes that a big-money sale could be sanctioned. Speaking to GOAL via BetWright betting, the ex-Villans frontman said when asked if Rogers is destined to join Real Madrid, Chelsea or City: “I worry as a Villa fan that when an opportunity has arisen for him to go, he goes. He's had a couple of loan moves when he was at Manchester City. He then decided to go and play in the Championship. A lot of players now will hang around like a bad smell in the hope that they get on the bench at a Premier League club, training with the squad, and that they will get in at some point. He didn't, he decided to go into the Championship and plough his own furrow. Villa took him and he's been nothing short of sensational.

“In terms of the World Cup squad, I still don't think he'll start ahead of Jude Bellingham but I do think he will be pushing for a start at the World Cup. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he has big parts to play in games and wouldn't be at all surprised if Villa are fielding offers of 70, 80, plus add-ons, plus players going the other way because Villa obviously need players because of PSR compliance. I wouldn't be surprised if he is one of the big summer targets.

“The reasons why are very simple. You have to look at the moment, Villa need bodies in midfield, they made an offer to Atletico Madrid for Conor Gallagher. Everything was agreed and Spurs came in at the last minute and said we can give him another two-and-a-half years on top of what Villa were offering and give you more money. Therein lies the problem, in PSR.”

Collymore added on where the powerful playmaker could end up and why: “Morgan Rogers will look at the situation and say at the end of the season - I saw an interview with him a few days ago and it was top four or FA Cup? He said ‘FA Cup because I want to win a trophy, I haven't won one yet'. I think he is very much an old school player that will go where he feels that he will get the best chance to win trophies.

“If all of a sudden PSR changes in the summer, Villa can spend whatever they like and they are playing Champions League football - which at the moment is looking likely-ish, although I do think they can be reeled in by Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs because the bodies that they have got - if they were to get in the top four and win the FA Cup, then he could say ‘there is nothing really to go for, I have won a trophy at a progressive club, with a manager that loves me, I'm top man'. Maybe he could be given the captaincy, something like that.

“If they get into the top four and Villa don't win the cup, which is as likely as not, I think there will be three or four of the big boys that will be hovering around and would think nothing of paying 75-80 million and give you a couple of Chelsea rejects, Liverpool rejects, Man United rejects.

“Villa, firstly have a track record - you've seen what they have done with Victor Lindelof - of making those kind of players better. Those kind of clubs would be happy to get them off the wage sheet and you can mess around with PSR by doing so.

“I think Morgan Rogers is ambitious enough to want to go to a Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United. I think it would be only those three clubs. I don't see Liverpool needing that kind of upgrade at the moment. I could certainly see a Manchester City, where of course he started, a Manchester United, that are always spending money, Arsenal even - alongside a Declan Rice, that would be pretty awesome if they were champions - and a Chelsea that always seem to have the money to spend. I could see it happening.

“But in terms of him starting games at the World Cup, like with Morgan Gibbs-White if he were to get into the squad, I think Jude Bellingham is No.1 pick and England would need to have two or three poor games at the World Cup for anybody else to start alongside Declan Rice.”

Rogers has taken in 99 appearances for Villa, scoring 25 goals along the way. He is up to 12 caps for England, with the target being found for the first time at international level against Wales, and has already generated speculation regarding supposed interest from Real Madrid and Chelsea.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United and Atletico Madrid are set for a heavyweight transfer tussle over Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes, with the Spanish giants desperate to find a successor for Conor Gallagher. The England international completed his £35 million switch to Tottenham this week, leaving a gaping hole in Diego Simeone's engine room that the Brazilian ace has been identified to fill.

The January transfer window has sparked into life with a high-profile domino effect that spans from London to Madrid and could end in the West Midlands. Following Gallagher's confirmed departure from Atletico Madrid to join Tottenham, the Spanish club have immediately turned their attention to finding a replacement. Their primary target is combative midfielder Gomes, The Daily Mail reports, but they face stiff competition from Premier League giants United, who have been tracking the Brazilian for months.

The departure of Gallagher has left Simeone short of energy in the middle of the park, and Atletico have pinpointed Gomes as the ideal candidate to replicate that intensity. However, the path to his signature is fraught with complications, not least the player's own stated preference for English football and the significant valuation placed on his head by his current employers. With Napoli also lurking in the background, a bidding war could be imminent for one of the few shining lights in Wolves' difficult season.

While Atletico have the funds and the immediate vacancy, United may hold the upper hand in the long-term race for Gomes due to the player's personal preferences. Marca reports that the Red Devils are ready to fight Atletico for the signature, and recent comments from Gomes himself indicate a strong desire to remain in the Premier League.

Despite interest from Serie A leaders Napoli, who reportedly reached an agreement with the player's entourage earlier this week, Gomes has publicly committed himself to the fight at Molineux. ""The affection from the fans is incredible, and I really want to give that back,"" Gomes said recently. ""I will give my life on the pitch so the team can finish the season safe from relegation.""

These words have been interpreted as a boost for United. The Brazilian's love for the intensity and culture of English football suggests he would favour a move to Old Trafford over a switch to La Liga or Serie A. United have had Gomes on their radar since the start of the winter market, and with the player settled in England, they may feel confident of persuading him to stay in the country, even if a summer move appears more likely than a January swoop.

The stance of Wolves remains the biggest hurdle for any suitor. Under manager Rob Edwards, the team has endured a torrid campaign, currently sitting bottom of the table with just one win and a daunting 14 points adrift of safety. Losing their most tenacious midfielder in the middle of a survival scrap would be seen as raising the white flag.

Consequently, Wolves are expected to play hardball. They are aware that Gomes is one of their few saleable assets who could command a huge fee given the interest in him and the fact his contract has over four years left on it, but his importance to the team's faint survival hopes cannot be overstated. Most Premier League suitors, including United, are reportedly content to wait until the summer. The logic is cynical but sound: if Wolves are relegated to the Championship, they will be forced to sell, potentially allowing clubs to strike a better deal than the £40m-plus currently being quoted.

Atletico, however, do not have the luxury of patience. With the Champions League knockout stages approaching and a top-four battle in La Liga to navigate, they need a midfielder now.

The situation leaves Gomes at a crossroads. On one hand, he has the immediate opportunity to join a European giant in Atletico Madrid and play Champions League football under Simeone. On the other, he has the prospect of fighting to save Wolves before potentially earning a dream move to United in the summer.

For now, the player remains focused on the pitch, having made 24 appearances this season in a struggling side. But with the transfer window open and money burning a hole in Atletico's pocket following the Gallagher sale, the resolve of both the player and his club will be tested in the coming days. Whether it is a January panic buy or a summer saga, the battle for Gomes is well and truly on.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'I need to sit down with my family and decide'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/andrew-robertson-opens-door-liverpool-exit-wants-to-play-losing-place-milos-kerkez/blt4a9de5d871d359e4","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:56:41 GMT","

Andy Robertson has cast serious doubt over his Liverpool future, admitting he needs to ""sit down with my family and decide"" his next move as his contract ticks down. The Scotland captain, who has lost his starting spot to Milos Kerkez this season, insisted he is ""a player who wants to play"" and hinted that his reduced role under Arne Slot could force him to look elsewhere after almost nine trophy-laden years at Anfield.

Robertson has publicly opened the door to a potential exit this summer, acknowledging that his lack of game time is a major factor as he approaches the end of his contract in the summer. The 31-year-old, a cornerstone of the Jurgen Klopp era, has found himself on the periphery of the first team this season following the £40 million arrival of Kerkez from Bournemouth. With just five months remaining on his current deal, Robertson finds himself at a career crossroads.

Despite his deep affection for the club where he has won every major honour available, the left-back was candid about his frustration with life on the bench. While confirming he would ideally like to stay, he stressed that no decision has been made and that the reality of his situation requires a pragmatic conversation with his loved ones.

""Yes, but it's a difficult question,"" Robertson admitted when asked if he wanted to extend his stay on Merseyside. ""I've got five months left and we need to see what the option is to stay or if there's options to go and things like that. I need to sit down with my family and decide.""

The primary driver behind Robertson's uncertainty is his dramatic drop in playing time. Since joining from Hull City for a bargain £8m in 2017, the Scot has been virtually undroppable, amassing 362 appearances for the Reds. However, the current campaign has painted a different picture. Robertson has started just four Premier League games this season, with 22-year-old Hungarian international Kerkez firmly establishing himself as the first-choice left-back.

Robertson's competitive nature remains undimmed, and he was eager to point out that sitting on the bench does not sit well with him. ""I can focus on the last eight and a half years. I think Jurgen Klopp left me out for one game and I was raging. So I'm a player who wants to play,"" he explained. ""I've played through injuries. I've played when I'm not 100% fit. I've played when I've only been 50/40/30% fit for this club and my country. I always want to be on the grass and playing and obviously now that's not happening, so that's what is different.""

While clearly agitated by his lack of minutes, Robertson has tried to adapt to his new reality as a squad player and mentor. Following the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold last summer, Robertson's seniority was recognised with the vice-captaincy. He insists he is finding ""enjoyment"" in this different role but warned that any professional footballer who is content with being a substitute has the ""wrong attitude.""

""At the end of the day, footballers want to play and if anyone is sat happy on the bench, then they don't belong at any football club,"" Robertson stated firmly. ""That's always my argument, you should always want to push to be in the team. If you're happy to sit on the bench, then I don't think you have the right attitude.

""I think I've played well in the games I've played this season. Maybe I've not played as much as I would have liked, but it's nothing I've been surprised by. Let's see what happens.""

Robertson confirmed that discussions regarding his future have taken place with senior figures at the club, though he chose to keep the specifics private. Despite the uncertainty, he maintained that his relationship with the Liverpool executives remains ""excellent,"" built on mutual respect and a history of shared success.

""I've given absolutely everything for the club for the last eight and a half years and the club have been very good to me - they've rewarded me with good contracts when I have been playing well,"" he noted. ""Nobody can deny what I have given to this club. I've given everything day in and day out and put in some performances which I think have been good.""

He also allowed himself a moment of levity regarding his incredible value for money over the years. ""My relationship with the people higher up in the club has always been excellent since the day I came in. Signing me for £8m and then doing what I have done helps that, which I remind people of all the time!""

The decision facing Robertson is not just about club football but his career legacy. Having successfully captained Scotland to World Cup qualification after a ""stressful summer,"" the defender is now looking to ensure the final years of his prime are spent on the pitch rather than watching from the sidelines.

""I wanted to qualify for the World Cup and thankfully we've managed to do that. I need to see what myself and my family wants going forward,"" he said","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Sportico have released their annual highest-paid athletes list, with Cristiano Ronaldo sitting at the top of that chart. The Portuguese GOAT earned double what eternal rival Lionel Messi pulled in over the course of 2025, with the Al-Nassr forward making $260 million (£194m). There are 13 football players in the top 100, with Brazilian icon Neymar tumbling down the standings.

Ronaldo - who boasts record-shattering numbers of followers on social media, which allow him to bump up his earnings off the pitch - tops the Sportico list for the third straight year. His contract with Saudi Pro League employers is said to be worth $200m (£149m) over the course of 12 months. He pulls in a further $60m (£45m) from other ventures.

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner CR7 has earned at least $100m (£74m) across nine consecutive years, with this the third occasion in which he has surged beyond $200m. He boasts several lucrative endorsement partnerships, including deals with Nike, Herbalife, Binance, Perplexity, Yili and Therabody. His total follower count online has eclipsed 1 billion.

Argentine icon Messi - who works closely with adidas, among others - sits third on the Sportico chart. He does, however, pull in half of what Ronaldo earns, with the World Cup winner generating $130m (£97m) of earning power across 2025. He has signed a new contract with MLS Cup winners Inter Miami through 2028.

Ronaldo is also working on fresh terms at Al-Nassr, with a historic agreement there being extended through to the summer of 2027. It has been suggested that the evergreen striker, who is already 40 years of age, could play on beyond that point. Both he and Messi are being tipped to grace this summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Neymar, who is Brazil's all-time leading scorer, should also be at that event. He needs to prove his fitness to Selecao boss Carlo Ancelotti, but has signed a new contract with boyhood club Santos and has been playing with a smile again after enduring much-publicised injury issues.

He retraced steps to his homeland early in 2025. Having seen a deal with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal terminated, Neymar is earning considerably less in his native South America. With that in mind, he has slipped out of Sportico's top six and down to No.30 - with his numbers nearly $50m (£37m) down on what they were a year ago.

Overall, the top 100 earned $6.05 billion (£4.5bn) - with that figure down 2.1% on last year. The cutoff point on the men's list was $37.9m (£28.2m), while tennis superstar Coco Gauff topped the women's chart as the highest-paid female athlete on $37.5m (£28m).

Mexican boxing sensation Canelo Alvarez splits Ronaldo and Messi on the men's list, having agreed a lucrative deal with Saudi promoters. NBA players represent 40 per cent of the top 100, as LeBron James leads the way once more - with the LA Lakers icon earning $80m (£60m) off the court. He has been the top-earning basketball star in 12 of the last 13 seasons - with only Steph Curry breaking that sequence in 2024-25.

The NFL sits behind the NBA with 22 players inside the top 100. Kansas City Chiefs talisman Patrick Mahomes heads that list, with fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen and Justin Herbert following closely behind.

Football has 13 members of the top 100 and five inside the top 20. Karim Benzema, who also plies his trade in the Saudi Pro League, sits sixth. Real Madrid ‘Galactico' Kylian Mbappe is just outside the top 10, while prolific Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is 18th.

Midfielder 'considering his future' amid PSG interest after Enzo Maresca exit","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/enzo-fernandez-leave-chelsea-midfielder-future-psg-interest-enzo-maresca-exit/blt2d13daf081a257f5","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:31:46 GMT","

Enzo Fernandez is reporting “considering his future” at Chelsea following the departure of Enzo Maresca as manager. The Blues took the decision to part with the Italian tactician on New Year's Day, with Liam Rosenior now calling the shots at Stamford Bridge. It is being suggested that World Cup winner Fernandez could be lured away from west London, with Paris Saint-Germain among his many suitors.

Reports in France suggest that Argentina international Fernandez is “weighing up his options”. He is asking questions of the direction in which Chelsea are heading after parting ways with Maresca - having seen him deliver Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies in 2025.

Rosenior is untested in Premier League management and has a lot to prove when it comes to filling the most prominent of posts in England. His cause would be hindered considerably if Fernandez were to move on.

The all-action midfielder joined Chelsea in a British transfer record £107 million ($144m) deal in 2023. He endured a slow start to his time with the Blues, but has grown into an on-field leader - with the captain's armband often being passed in his direction.

More goals have also been added to his game, with the 24-year-old already up to eight efforts this season - as he looks to reach double figures for the first time since leaving River Plate in his homeland.

Fernandez is seemingly prepared to consider another fresh start as he had enjoyed a productive working relationship with former boss Maresca. He admitted to being left “sad” at seeing the Italian move on.

He posted on social media: “Mister, thank you for everything shared and experienced during this stage, I learned a lot and I value every advice and experience. Wishing you and your coaching staff, Willy, Dani, Robi, Marcos and Mickey, all the best. We won two titles together that I will never forget. Much success to you and hopefully our paths will cross again in the future. A big hug.”

L'Equipe claims that PSG are prepared to offer Fernandez a way out of Stamford Bridge. He is said to have become a top target for the Ligue 1 giants as they seek to build around Portuguese playmaker Vitinha.

Questions have been asked of Joao Neves and Fabian Ruiz in 2025-26, despite both playing starring roles for PSG last season as they claimed a historic Champions League crown. Upgrades are being sought in the French capital.

L'Equipe says that Fernandez is “considering his future” after becoming aware of the interest from Paris. No formal approach has been made as yet, with PSG prepared to be patient. They are said to view Fernandez as a “longer term target”, with no bid about to be lodged during the January transfer window of 2026.

PSG are reported to be of the opinion that a number of players in their squad have “grown too comfortable due to a lack of genuine competition for first-team places”. The plan is to address that situation as quickly as possible.

A source close to a PSG player has told L'Equipe: “Not bringing in more competition is a mistake. They should have brought in guys who are eager to prove themselves. Right now, we're seeing players who are playing more casually. The dip in form is in their desire. In the counter-pressing, you can tell it's not quite the same team anymore. There's a lack of ambition to earn their place, players who are too comfortable.”

Fernandez remains tied to a long-term contract at Chelsea through to 2031. It would take a big offer to free him from that agreement, with the expectation being that another nine-figure sum would need to change hands.

PSG are not short of spending power, with no player seemingly out of their reach, and it could be that they test Chelsea's resolve in the summer - once Fernandez has lined up alongside Lionel Messi and Co in Argentina's World Cup title defence.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester City got the first advantage in the first leg of the  Carabao Cup semifinal as they took down Newcastle United at St. James Park. Goals from Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki were enough to secure an important away victory for the Citizens.

Pep Guardiola's side seems to be rediscovering their form again, notably following the arrival of Semeny0 from Bournemouth a few days ago. After scoring on his debut in the FA Cup clash against Exeter City, now the Ghanaian strike again for his new club.

Semenyo opened the scoring for Man City on 53 minutes and could've got his second but was controversially disallowed by the VAR decision. Nevertheless, the visitor did manage to get their second, thanks to Cherki's strike deep in added time.

Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner are in the same half of the Australian Open draw, which was revealed Thursday in Melbourne. The record 10-time champion Djokovic and two-time defending titlist Sinner could meet in a blockbuster semi-final at the season's first major.


Sinner leads Djokovic 6-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, which the Serbian once led 4-1. The 24-year-old Italian beat Djokovic in the 2024 Australian Open semi-finals en route to his maiden major crown. A rematch looms in the distance this fortnight.

Carlos Alcaraz, World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is aiming to capture his seventh major crown and complete a Career Grand Slam. The Spaniard is in the same half as rival Alexander Zverev. The 22-year-old begins against home hope Adam Walton.

Djokovic, 38, is aiming for his 25th major crown, which would break his tie with Margaret Court for most major singles titles in tennis history. Sinner, seeded second, is chasing a three-peat at Melbourne Park and his fifth major title overall. The Serbian starts his campaign against Pedro Martinez while Sinner faces French lefty Hugo Gaston in the opening round.

Sinner made an appearance ahead of the draw ceremony and spoke about his outlook for the tournament.

“The draw is very difficult, it doesn't matter who you play,"" said Sinner, who boasts a 22-4 tournament record. ""We are the best players in the world and the way is very, very long and very far. We will go day by day.”You May Also Like: 2026 Australian Open prize money

The 24-year-old also discussed his partnership with Aussie coach Darren Cahill.

“We had a nice talk at the end of the year and it's great to share at least one more season with him,"" Sinner said. ""He gives so much calmness and I feel very safe with him in the corner and not only me, but also the rest of the team. It's great, especially playing here, playing in Australia with one Australian team member.”
Two of the most interesting first-round matches are sixth seed Alex de Minaur against former No. 6 Matteo Berrettini and Zverev's clash with hefty-serving Gabriel Diallo. De Minaur and Berrettini spit their hard-court meetings in 2025, with the Italian improving to 3-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Zverev and Diallo will meet for the first time.
Fan favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis announced his withdrawal shortly before the draw ceremony.

Thanasi Kokkinakis announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open singles event on Thursday.

“Unfortunately after speaking with my team and doctors I have made the decision to pull out of the @AustralianOpen singles,” Kokkinakis wrote on Instagram Stories. “After an incredibly tough year this was the event I was looking forward to the most but I'm not ready yet. I'm doing everything I can every day to be back to 100%.”

Kokkinakis played his first singles match in nearly a year last week at the Adelaide International, where he defeated Sebastian Korda in a final-set tie-break.


But throughout the match, the Australian struggled with his right shoulder on the back of pectoral surgery last February. He withdrew from Adelaide on Wednesday.

The 29-year-old hopes to compete in doubles at Melbourne Park. He won the title with Nick Kyrgios in 2022.

“We will still try and step out for the doubles and have some fun,” Kokkinakis wrote. “Thank you to everyone who supports me.”

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina continued his push for a maiden ATP Tour title on Thursday evening at the Adelaide International, where he powered into the semi-finals. 

The 26-year-old Spaniard carved a series of stunning angles and winners to defeat reigning Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot 7-6(4), 6-2. Davidovich Fokina, who has reached five ATP Tour finals — including two in which he held championship points in 2025 — is rising to the occasion in Adelaide, where he is competing as the top seed for the first time in his career.
“I knew his serve was amazing,” Davidovich Fokina said of Vacherot, who hit 15 aces according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I tried my best to return his serve… It was like playing against [John] Isner. The key was to be focused and I [have] improved my level every game.”

Into his 12th semi-final, Davidovich Fokina will face fourth seed Ugo Humbert, who fired 32 winners en route to dispatching qualifier Alexander Shevchenko 6-0, 6-3 in just 57 minutes.
Earlier, second seed Tommy Paul continued his impressive form in Adelaide by defeating Aussie Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 6-2 to reach his third semi-final at the ATP 250 event. Paul, the former No. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, missed the final three months of the 2025 season due to a lingering foot injury and returned last week in Brisbane, where he fell to big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round.
“I'm just happy to be back out here. It was a long end of the year for me, and to be back in Australia playing great tennis, I'm really happy,” said Paul, who also reached the Australian Open semi-finals in 2023. “All the tournaments in Australia, they do a good job of keeping most of the courts the same speed, and they seem to match up with my game.”






Paul will next face Tomas Machac, who beat Jaume Munar 6-4, 6-4 to advance to his first semi-final since winning his only ATP Tour title in Acapulco last February. The eighth-seeded Czech takes a 2-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his clash with Paul, who won their most recent meeting in Rome last year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Who qualified for the 2026 Australian Open?","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/australian-open-2026-qualifying-final","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:23:35 GMT","

A wave of rising talent secured places in the Australian Open main draw on Thursday, winning their final-round qualifying matches at Melbourne Park.

Norway's Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, American Nishesh Basavareddy and Spain's Rafael Jodar — all of whom competed at the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF — successfully navigated qualifying. They were joined by 19-year-old Rei Sakamoto, the 2024 Australian Open boys' champion.

Budkov Kjaer, who describes fellow Norwegian Casper Ruud as a “big brother figure,” defeated Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-2, 6-3 to earn his maiden main-draw appearance at a Grand Slam. Last year, the Norwegian claimed a Tour-leading four ATP Challenger titles before reaching the semi-finals in Jeddah.

“We're setting the bar good for the next generation,” said Budkov Kjaer, who will join Jeddah champion Learner Tien in the main draw. “I saw that four out of the eight that played Next Gen are through to the main draw. It's great to see us youngsters doing big stuff on the biggest stages. We are maybe a bit more hungry than the older ones, but it's great to see your friends doing well.”

Jodar will also make his Grand Slam main-draw debut after advancing through qualifying on his first attempt. The Spaniard, who turned professional in December following two years at the University of Virginia, defeated former Next Gen ATP Finals competitor Luca Van Assche 6-3, 0-6, 6-1 on Thursday.

Sakamoto, who did not drop a set across his three qualifying matches, said: “In preseason, I made qualifying for the main draw a goal, so it feels good,” said Sakamoto. “I think the surface suits me pretty well. I like my serve to bounce higher and have an advantage with the serve, it makes it easier to build. I like the crowd and environment here, it makes me feel comfortable.”

Basavareddy, now working with Daniil Medvedev's former coach Gilles Cervara, will appear in a Grand Slam main draw for the third consecutive time. The 20-year-old showed resilience throughout qualifying, saving two match points to beat Sebastian Ofner in the second round before rallying past George Loffhagen 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 on Thursday.





Alexander Blockx, a finalist in Jeddah and winner of last week's ATP Challenger in Canberra, entered the final qualifying round on a seven-match winning streak. However, the Belgian was forced to retire due to a back injury in the third set against Australia's Jason Kubler.

Dane Sweeny was the only other Australian to advance through qualifying. The 24-year-old defeated Stefano Travaglia 7-6(6), 7-6(3) to reach the main draw of a major for the first time since the 2024 Australian Open.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Federer talks Alcaraz-Sinner & ‘one of the most important points in my career' on AO return","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-australian-open-2026-press-conference","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 07:40:39 GMT","

 Even in a career as packed with highlights as Roger Federer's, some moments still stand out. 

 The Swiss icon was a six-time champion at the Australian Open, where on Thursday he spoke to media ahead of his appearance at the opening ceremony of the 2026 edition of the hard-court major. Yet for a number of reasons, Federer identifies his fifth title in Melbourne as the one that stands out the most. 

 “I guess it has to be 2017 just because of the way it ended in the finals against Rafa.” recalled Federer, who was aged 35 and had not played a tour-level match for six months when he arrived at that year's Australian Open. “It was surreal. I came here with no expectations... I was maybe going to be happy with the quarters. I think Seve [Luthi], my coach secretly, Ivan [Ljubicic], believing I could do it. I was like more, ‘Yeah, no, not at 17 in the world, not having played in six months, all that'. 

 “I played really well at the Hopman Cup. Came here feeling good. Still I knew I had a tough draw, had to go through some big guys to get anywhere close to winning. I think just the way the finals played out kind of makes it maybe one of the best special ones I've ever had in my career.” 

 Federer overcame his great rival Rafael Nadal in a five-set championship-match thriller to cap his 2017 run at Melbourne Park. The match included a 26-shot rally, with Nadal serving at 3-4, deuce in the fifth set, which Federer claimed with a stunning forehand down the line. It was a shot that has lived long in the memory of tennis fans. 

 “I've seen it many, many times,” said Federer, who also won the Melbourne crown in 2004, 2006-07, 2010 and 2018. “All my friends send it to me. It's on the algorithm of people I know. It [keeps] on coming through. It's a nice point, maybe one of the most important ones I've had in my playing career. What a match, what a celebration, what a moment.” 



 A new Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry that has etched itself into the tennis landscape in a similar manner to Federer vs. Nadal is the one between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The pair has won the past eight major singles titles between them and contested the final three Grand Slam title clashes of 2025, including a remarkable five-set battle at Roland Garros during which Alcaraz saved three championship points in the third set before triumphing. 

 “The rivalry with Alcaraz and Sinner is a great one,” said Federer. “They play incredible tennis. I think that French Open final was unreal. I think the game, not that it needed it, but it was great that we had it. I feel like for a second, for a moment, the world stood still in the sporting world and watched towards Paris, what was going on in that epic fifth set because it could have ended much, much sooner obviously for Jannik. 

 “Then all of a sudden it ended up in this most crazy fashion. Maybe one of the greatest games we've ever had in our sport. It's good we still live off that momentum. Then they backed it up by playing against each other in all those other finals. Everybody is trying to keep up and they're trying to pull away. What we've seen in terms of their progression in the last years, it's been wonderful. I practised with those guys a little bit. They're incredible ball strikers. There's obviously more to come.”

 The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner arrives at the Australian Open this year as the two-time defending champion. Meanwhile World No. 1 Alcaraz has the chance to become the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam (winning all four major titles) if he can lift his maiden trophy at Melbourne Park. 

 “[Carlos] knows about it. It's like Rory [McIlroy] going for the Masters. Those things are tough,” said Federer, when asked about Alcaraz's prospects. “At the end of the day, the momentum shifts after the first round. Then it's point-for-point mentality. It's true, in order to complete the career Grand Slam already now would be crazy. 

 “So let's see if he is able to do 'crazy' this week. I hope he does because for the game, again, that would be an unbelievable, special moment. He has another hundred and whatever players that say, ‘We don't agree with those plans'. They might try to stop him.”

After three straight three-set matches this week, Victoria Mboko ended Madison Keys' title defense to reach the Adelaide semifinals, with Mirra Andreeva also advancing later in the day

Victoria Mboko's steady start to the season continued Thursday at the Adelaide International, where the 19-year-old Canadian ended Madison Keys' title defense with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 victory at the WTA 500 event on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

The win was Mboko's third three-set match in as many outings this week and sent her into the latter stages of the tournament after more than two hours on court against the reigning champion.

Adelaide: Scores | Draws | Order of play

From a set and a break ahead, things grew complicated for Mboko against Keys, who also won the Adelaide title in 2022. But the reigning Australian Open champion lost steam in the final set, and Mboko secured the second Top 10 victory of her young career in 1 hour, 53 minutes.

The Canadian won five straight games after Keys held serve to open the final set. Mboko benefited from an uneven performance by the defending champion, who committed 41 unforced errors and -- despite serving nine aces -- faced 12 break points and was broken six times.

""I know she won this tournament last year, and of course, Australian Open, and I knew coming into this match that it would be a big fight,"" Mboko said afterward. 

""I think there was one moment in the second set where she hit three return winners off my serve, so that was pretty humbling. She is where she is for a reason, and I think to play these kind of players, you have to get used to receiving those kinds of balls. It was great tennis from her, and I'm glad I got it done.""

The eighth seed will now slide into favored position in the semifinals as she seeks her third career final, all of which have come since her breakout run on home soil in Montreal last August. In the first round at that tournament, she beat Australia's Kimberly Birrell -- and the pair will play again this time with the unseeded Birrell now benefitting from home-crowd advantage.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

The 27-year-old Gold Coast resident advanced to her first career WTA 500-level semifinal with her own three-set triumph -- a 5-7 6-1, 7-5 epic against Romania's Jaqueline Cristian that lasted 3 hours and 4 minutes.

The World No. 107, who has reached two WTA 250 titles in her career to date, regrouped after losing a 5-2 lead in the first set to break new ground at this level, and won the last three games of the match as well. 

""I just kept telling myself to keep trying and fighting for every point,"" Birrell said afterward. ""When I came back out for the second set, I just told myself that I'll get those opportunities again if I kept fighting.""

The top-half semifinal will pit former doubles partners Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider against each other. The pair, silver medalists at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, both advanced in straight sets. No. 9 seed Shnaider defeated No. 6 seed Emma Navarro 6-3, 6-3, while No. 3 seed Andreeva needed just 67 minutes to dismiss Maya Joint 6-2, 6-0.

After losing six of eight matches against opponents on home soil between August 2024 and the end of 2025, Andreeva has already recorded two wins over Australian players in Australia in 2026. Following her three-set victory over Olivia Gadecki in Brisbane last week, the 18-year-old was dominant against 19-year-old Joint in their first professional meeting. (Andreeva won their only junior encounter, on clay, in 2022.)

Joint's bold play in saving four break points to hold in the opening game hinted at a tight contest -- but instead, Andreeva steadily increased the pressure. Constructing points with corner-to-corner precision, her accuracy contrasted with Joint's 24 unforced errors, many coming off the backhand wing.

Andreeva defeated Shnaider 6-2, 6-3 in their only previous meeting, in the first round of Brisbane in 2023.

Notable wild cards:

Keys won her first career Grand Slam in Melbourne a year ago, defeating Sabalenka in the final 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. En route to the championship, she had to withstand three Grand Slam champions in Sabalenka, Swiatek in the semifinal and Rybakina in the quarterfinal. 

The Australian Open run capped off a terrific summer Down Under as she won the Adelaide International the week before. Ultimately, her 16-match win streak that started in Adelaide did not end until the semifinals at Indian Wells in March.

Tennis Australia recently announced a record prize pool of AUD $111.5 million (USD $74.9 million), which is a 16% increase from last year's tournament and the most in the tournament's history. All singles and doubles players will receive a minimum 10% increase.

Four previous Australian Open champions are in the 2026 field. Coco Gauff and Mirra Andreeva could be headed to a quarterfinal showdown, while Madison Keys might have to go through Jessica Pegula and Amanda Anisimova in the fourth round and quarterfinals.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- The 2026 Australian Open draw is set. 

Eleven Grand Slam winners are in the mix, including four previous Australian Open champions. Among them, Madison Keys returns to Melbourne Park after winning her first Grand Slam last year. She defeated Aryna Sabalenka, who has reached the final each of the past three editions, and won titles in 2023 and 2024. 

The season's first Grand Slam closes out a spectacular summer of tennis Down Under and the Australian swing on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. Here is a breakdown of each quarter, the key first-round matches to watch and the potential quarterfinal matchups:

Full draw

[17] Victoria Mboko vs. [WC] Emerson Jones: Mboko, the WTA Newcomer of the Year in 2025, will open her debut at the Australian Open against Aussie fan favorite, Jones. The former junior No. 1, Jones received her second straight wild card for the Australian Open -- she lost to Elena Rybakina in the first-round of 2025. Mboko will be seeded for the second straight Grand Slam after she won the WTA 1000 in Montreal last summer. This will be their first meeting against one another.

[29] Iva Jovic vs. Katie Volynets: Entering her first Grand Slam as a seeded player, Jovic looks build off her strong 2025 season where she won a WTA 500 title in Guadalajara. Last week, she reached the semifinals in Auckland, falling to eventual champion Elina Svitolina. Jovic will face American compatriot Volynets, and this will be their first time sharing the court.

Other notable first-round matches: [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [WC] Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah (WC); [SR] Mananchaya Sawangkaew vs. [28] Emma Raducanu

Our top 8 for #AO26 👀Will one of them take home the crown? 🏆 pic.twitter.com/c3IK3kjCLt

[1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [20] Marta Kostyuk: We saw this matchup recently in the Brisbane International final, where Sabalenka won 6-4, 6-3 to win back-to-back titles in Queensland. If Brisbane is any indicator, then the way both players performed throughout the tournament could see this be a top quarterfinal matchup. Kostyuk upset Amanda Anisimova, Mirra Andreeva and Jessica Pegula en route to the Brisbane final, while Sabalenka dominated the field with all straight-set victories. Kostyuk has only made on Grand Slam quarterfinal -- the 2024 Australian Open.

Barbora Krejcikova vs. [23] Diana Shnaider: Two-time Grand Slam champion Krejcikova looks to climb her way back into the form she once had as former World No. 2, and will face Shnaider to begin her Australian Open campaign. Shnaider has performed well in Adelaide with wins over Katerina Siniakova and 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. This will be their first matchup on the WTA Tour. 

Olga Danilovic vs. [WC] Venus Williams: Williams, seven-time Grand Slam champion and two-time finalist at the Australian Open, will make her return to Melbourne Park for the first time in five years. Williams, 45, played at the WTA 250 tournaments in Auckland and Hobart to start the season. The reason this matchup with Danilovic -- who is currently in the quarterfinals in Hobart -- is intriguing is because the winner could likely face Coco Gauff in the second round. Gauff notably defeated Williams at Wimbledon in 2019 and the Australian Open in 2020 as she was a rising star in the sport.

Other notable first-round matches: [12] Elina Svitolina vs. Cristina Bucsa; Magda Linette vs. [15] Emma Navarro; [3] Coco Gauff vs. Kamilla Rakhimova; Donna Vekic vs. [8] Mirra Andreeva

[3] Coco Gauff vs. [8] Mirra Andreeva: This would be a spectacular quarterfinal matchup, featuring two of the sport's younger stars. Gauff, the 2025 Roland Garros champion, has proven she can always rise to the occasion, and holds a 4-0 advantage over Andreeva. Andreeva, just 18 years old, sits inside the top 10 and is ready to make that breakthrough to a Grand Slam title. The two haven't played in a Grand Slam since 2023, but last played in Madrid last May, a tournament Gauff ultimately won. 

[22] Leylah Fernandez vs. Janice Tjen: Fernandez had a strong 2025 season, winning titles in Washington D.C. and Osaka. The 2021 US Open finalist's best finish at a Slam since was the quarterfinals at Roland Garros in 2022. For the first time, she'll face Tjen, Indonesia's rising star who climbed from outside the top 400 to outside the top 50 in 2025, spearheaded by titles in Chennai and the Jinan WTA 125.

Oleksandra Oliynykova vs. [9] Madison Keys: Keys begins her quest to defend her 2025 Australian Open title against a new opponent in Oliynykova, who is making her tour-level main-draw debut. Keys' path back to Grand Slam glory could feature Jessica Pegula in the Round of 16 and Amanda Anisimova in the quarterfinals. 

Other notable first-round matches: Emiliana Arango vs. McCartney Kessler; [13] Linda Noskova vs. Darja Semenistaja; [27] Sofia Kenin vs. Peyton Stearns; [WC] Zarina Diyas vs. [25] Paula Badosa; [SR] Karolina Pliskova vs. [Q] Sloane Stephens

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

[4] Amanda Anisimova vs. [6] Jessica Pegula: An all-American battle for a spot in the Australian Open semifinals would be a very entertaining matchup. Both players still covet that first Grand Slam title, and each have been on the doorstep. Anisimova fell in the Wimbledon and US Open singles finals last year while Pegula lost to Sabalenka in the 2024 final. Pegula holds the head-to-head 3-0, but they have not faced since Toronto 2024.

Tereza Valentova vs. [30] Maya Joint: Joint, 19, whose family lives in Melbourne, will be seeded at a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. With titles in Rabat and Eastbourne last season, she became the Australian No. 1. After difficult matches at the United Cup, she's currently in the quarterfinals in Adelaide. Joint faces 18-year-old Valentova -- who won a pair of 125 titles in Portugal and Italy last season, and made her first tour-level final in Osaka -- for the first time in an all-teenage affair.

Katie Boulter vs. [10] Belinda Bencic: Bencic could not have asked for a better start to her 2026 season. Despite Switzerland's loss to Poland in the United Cup final, Bencic finished 9-1 throughout the tournament and 5-1 in singles, including a win over Iga Swiatek, who she could meet in the Australian Open quarterfinals. She returned back into the top 10, and has the most momentum heading into the tournament alongside Sabalenka. Bencic has played Boulter just once, a win in Estonia in 2022. 

Other notable first-round matches: [16] Naomi Osaka vs. Antonia Ruzic; [5] Elena Rybakina vs. Kaja Juvan; Sorana Cirstea vs. Eva Lys; Daria Kasatkina vs. [Q] Nikola Bartunkova, [Q] Yuan Yue vs. [2] Iga Swiatek

[5] Elena Rybakina vs. [2] Iga Swiatek: A frequent rivalry on the WTA Tour, Rybakina and Swiatek have faced 11 times with Swiatek holding the edge 6-5. However at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Rybakina earned her first win against Swiatek after four straight losses.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Wild card Preston stuns top seed Raducanu in Hobart for career-best win","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4434970/wild-card-preston-stuns-top-seed-raducanu-in-hobart-for-career-best-win","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:41:19 GMT","

Wild card Taylah Preston scored the first Top 30 win of her career and advanced to her first tour-level semifinal with a straight-sets upset of top seed Emma Raducanu at the Hobart International.

Australian wild card Taylah Preston thrilled her home fans at the Hobart International by outhitting No. 1 seed Emma Raducanu 6-2, 6-4 to reach the first semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz of her career.

The 20-year-old, ranked No. 204, had only won one tour-level match prior to this week -- at San Diego 2024 -- but backed up her earlier upsets of No. 5 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Rebecca Sramkova to notch her first career Top 30 victory over Raducanu, ranked No. 29.

""I don't really know what to say,"" said Preston after slamming a forehand winner to seal her first match point. ""I'm just really happy that I'm through to the next round and get to play here again in front of everyone.""

Preston's success in Hobart comes after several months of rebuilding her form on the ITF World Tennis Tour. The San Diego win two years ago, over Magdalena Frech, had seemed to presage a breakthrough that year. At the age of 18, Preston also stretched Caroline Garcia to three sets in Adelaide, reached her first WTA 125 final in Puerto Vallarta and rose to a career high of No. 134. But by last September, she had fallen back to No. 266. She spent the autumn grinding through Australian ITF events, picking up W35 titles in Wagga Wagga, Darwin and Brisbane.

Against Raducanu, Preston found a top-notch level of clean, aggressive ball-striking, firing 21 winners to the former US Open champion's nine. On Wednesday, Raducanu had been rejuvenated by an overnight postponement, coming from 4-2 down in the second set to defeat Camila Osorio in her first-round match. But following a lengthy rain delay at 2-1 to Preston on Thursday, the opposite occurred. On resumption, Raducanu leaked forehand errors to drop serve twice, while Preston notched two love holds.

Raducanu cleaned up her errors in the second set, and went up a break as Preston wobbled for the first time, dumping a sitter forehand into the net down break point. But the Briton missed a point to go up 4-1 with a double break, and in the subsequent game Preston smacked a series of glorious winners on the line to level at 3-3.

The highest-quality passage of play saw Raducanu and Preston exchange two more service breaks. But when Raducanu served to stay in the match down 5-4, she let a 40-0 lead slip. Another forehand error gave Preston match point, which she converted with relish.

The home player will bid to keep her fairytale run going against either No. 3 seed Iva Jovic, who defeated No. 8 seed Magda Linette 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-2 in a marathon contest that ended after midnight local time. Jovic first served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, only for Linette to make a valiant comeback and force a decider. But the 33-year-old Pole, who had played five sets the previous day across her two match wins, faded in the third set.

Jovic, 18, advances to her second semifinal in as many weeks, having lost to eventual champion Elina Svitolina at that stage in Auckland.

Former finalist Cocciaretto returns to semifinals

Earlier, Elisabetta Cocciaretto looked unstoppable for long stretches of her Hobart quarterfinal against Anna Bondar. Except for the four times Mother Nature forced play to stop, including once before the match even began on an overcast Thursday afternoon.

Fittingly, four was also the number of games Bondar managed to win, as Cocciaretto overpowered her from start to finish in a 6-2, 6-2 victory that concluded nearly three hours past its scheduled start time.

The win sends the 24-year-old Italian to her first hard-court semifinal since 2023, when she reached the final here in Hobart. She is now 9-3 at the event in her career.

It also marked the second straight meeting between the two players disrupted by weather. And as frustrating as Thursday's delays were for fans, they were nothing compared to the chaos that was their previous encounter.

“Actually, with Anna, we played the semifinal three years ago in Lausanne, and we took nine hours to finish the match for the rain, I swear,” Cocciaretto said in her on-court interview. “So today was quite better, actually. But I mean, outdoors, it's always like this.

“We try to stay focused, to play our best and to give the best on the court.”

Cocciaretto won that match in Lausanne as well, though in far tighter fashion -- 6-7(3), 7-6(6), 7-5 in 3 hours and 34 minutes of actual playing time.

There was no such drama this time around, as Cocciaretto broke Bondar in the opening game as part of a 4-0 start. The rest of the set was choppy, with three rain delays in quick succession, but she eventually closed it out in two hours despite only 40 minutes of on-court action.

The former Hobart finalist finished the set with 11 winners to just five unforced errors and carried that form into the second set. She ended the match with 24 winners and 13 unforced errors, while breaking Bondar four times, twice in each set.

But it was the third break that gave her a 3-2 lead in the second set, sparking a run of four straight games to end the match.

Cocciaretto will face Antonia Ruzic in the semifinals after the 22-year-old Croat defeated Olga Danilovic 6-3, 6-3 to reach the first WTA semifinal of her career. Ruzic and Cocciaretto met three times in 2025, with Ruzic holding a 2-1 head-to-head advantage -- including both of their hard-court encounters.

The six-time champion will compete on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since his 2022 retirement.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 15, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 15, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Roger Federer will bid a proper farewell to the Australian Open ahead of the 2026 tournament on Saturday, competing alongside ATP legends Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, and Pat Rafter for a “Battle of the world No. 1s” doubles match that kicks off the event's inaugural Opening Ceremony.The six-time champion, who famously coined the “Happy Slam” nickname for the Australian Open, will be back on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since 2020, having officially retired from the sport at the 2022 Laver Cup.“I'm nervous, I'm excited, I'm happy I'm here,” Federer said in a press conference moderated by former ATP doubles No. 1 Todd Woodbridge. “I'm happy there's a moment for the crowd, for me personally, but also being on the court with Lleyton that I shared so much with, Pat that I always loved playing against, even though I never beat him. I always loved Pat. He was one of my favorite players. Then Andre, I was fortunate enough to play against him maybe 10 times or so. Just being together with those guys is going to make me feel better, as well.“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.”

“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.”

At 44 years old, Federer has been inching back into the tennis spotlight, competing in a celebrity doubles match at last fall's Rolex Shanghai Masters and teasing a potential “Legends” tour involving himself and longtime rival Rafael Nadal.“It's hard to make it a priority in the schedule when you have four children and so many other things going on,” said Federer, who for now prefers competing in doubles rather than singles. “I'm happy I'm super still active, busy, doing loads of sports. Tennis is part of that.”Federer took a stroll down memory lane during the press conference, recalling a particularly iconic point that helped him win the 2017 Australian Open, but confessed that nostalgia for his playing days isn't as strong as some might assume.“If I would have won half of what I've done, I'd be equally proud sitting here because I achieved way more than I ever thought I would,” said Federer. “The run, the time that I've had, it what stands out to me. It's been so much fun.”

Ranked outside the Top 1000, the former US Open champion won three straight matches for the first time since 2024.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 15, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Sloane Stephens will be the first to tell you that ebbs and flows are natural parts of a tennis career.“In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. “That's a part of life and a part of the journey.”But even Stephens, a 32-year-old former Grand Slam champion currently ranked No. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American.

“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American.

That journey took the 2017 US Open winner off tour for much of the last 12 months as she dealt with a persistent foot injury. Playing just six matches in 2025, Stephens watched tennis from the literal sidelines as an analyst for various networks, watching the game evolve—but remain recognizable—in her absence.“When you don't play a lot, there's a little lull. You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home. Then, I was able to translate that into a match.”After starting the 2026 season with a three-set defeat at the ASB Classic, Stephens—along with her mom, aunt, and coach Kamau Murray—traveled to Melbourne early to compete in qualifying for the first time since 2011. For reference, the last time Stephens didn't gain direct acceptance into a Grand Slam main draw, the Harry Potter and Twilight film series were still in theaters.“I think I was the only Grand Slam champion to be in qualies, which was interesting,” Stephens said with a still-formidable side eye. “I was like, ‘Oh God! A lot of pressure.' I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.”

She figured it out with few issues over three rounds, rallying from a set down to defeat Australian Olivia Gadecki on Wednesday and holding off a late surge to solve No. 2 seed Lucia Bronzetti to guarantee a 14th main-draw appearance in Melbourne.“It was weird to be in qualies and wonder how it even worked,” mused Stephens. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today. There were so many things I didn't know, but I was like, ‘I'm just gonna play.' It's strange but it's fun. You go out there, do the best you can. A lot of times in my career, I haven't been afraid to put myself out there, win or lose. Sometimes you get rewarded and sometimes you don't.”Where past years have been rife with stress, the 2013 semifinalist is taking a different approach on the court and behind the scenes, vlogging her trip to Melbourne in a rare peek behind the curtain into Stephens' off-court life.“I would have never shown anything like that ever in life,” Stephens laughed. “It's just another way to have fun and experience things, and not be so serious. Being on the other side and doing TV and stuff, I can see how fans would want to see those kinds of moments.“Definitely one of the goals this year is just to have more fun and to enjoy it. I want my family, friends and everyone to be able to experience it.”

As mom Sybil texted near the small interview scrum, Stephens showed off her Free People Movement tennis dress, a lacey yellow ensemble evocative of Ted Tinling's iconic designs.“This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies. “Maria Sakkari asked me if it was even a tennis dress and I was like, ‘Yeah girl. Let me show you!' Free People Movement, they're growing and they're like the cool kids in town.”Win or lose, that's a role Stephens has inhabited flawlessly in over a decade on tour. Determined to play through this comeback with no regrets, she appears ready to take that casual confidence back to the Grand Slam stage this weekend.

In the final set, Mboko did not face a break point while claiming half of her return points to pull away from the reigning Australian Open title holder.“She hits a pretty strong ball, and all I was thinking in that moment was just to try to stay low and try to redirect as much as I could, and try to either make her miss first or have a good opportunity to take control,” Mboko assessed during a press conference Thursday.The world No. 17, who captured her maiden WTA title on home soil last August at the 1000-level event in Montreal, is seeking her third trophy following a winning conclusion to 2025 in Hong Kong.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

F1.com looks back at the drivers and teams whose success brought an end to the previous dominance of some of their competitors.

McLaren will enter 2026 fresh off the back of winning their second consecutive Teams' Championship, a title that they wrapped up with a whopping 364-point advantage over second-placed Mercedes.

On the Drivers' title side, meanwhile, Lando Norris toppled Max Verstappen to bring an end to the Dutchman's four-year reign as World Champion – but will another team and driver combination get in the way of McLaren's ascent in the season ahead?

Those hoping to do just that might want to take inspiration from the following cases in F1 history, where a new championship victor stopped a previous dynasty in its tracks…

Ferrari had been on a dominant run from the mid-1970s onwards; seemingly reinvigorated by the arrival of Niki Lauda in 1974, the Scuderia went on to score back-to-back Teams' Championships between 1975 and 1977. Lauda also claimed two Drivers' titles, just missing out in 1976 following his horror accident at the Nurburgring.

However, over at Lotus – a squad that had previously used innovative designs to their advantage, having collected three Teams' titles during the early 1970s with the revolutionary Lotus 72 – Colin Chapman was working on a new car that would utilise the benefits of ground effect.

This was the Lotus 78, which made its debut in 1977. While the outfit had to settle for second place in that season's championship, they hit their stride in 1978 – a year that also saw the arrival of the 78's successor, the Lotus 79 – and clinched their first Teams' crown since 1973.

They also ended a six-year wait for another Drivers' title, with Mario Andretti scoring five wins en route to what would prove to be his sole championship in Formula 1.

Should McLaren win a third consecutive Teams' Championship in 2026, it would mark the outfit's strongest run since they clinched four in a row between 1988 and 1991. Indeed, the squad had outlined their prowess going back as far as 1984, collecting a total of seven Drivers' titles and six Teams' in that eight-year period.

Williams had snatched two Teams' wins from their rivals in 1986 and 1987, as well as taking the World Championship with Nelson Piquet in the latter. But after slipping backwards in the fight towards the end of the decade, it looked like the squad's fortunes might be about to change when a certain Adrian Newey joined as Chief Designer in 1991 to working along incumbent Technical Director Patrick Head.

The combination proved to be an effective one, with the FW14 car bringing the team numerous wins in 1991. While it was not enough to take the championship away from McLaren on that occasion, the 1992-spec FW14B – which harnessed groundbreaking technology such as active suspension – proved to be a dominant force.

Nigel Mansell notched up nine victories to seal his first and only Drivers' title, and Williams ended McLaren's run of Teams' Championships, kickstarting a strong era for the Grove-based outfit that would see them collect further accolades into the 1990s.

That aforementioned run for Williams resulted in four more Teams' titles and three Drivers' Championships between 1993 and 1997. Over at McLaren, the squad were busy trying to rebuild after being knocked off their perch – and part of this attempt involved enticing Adrian Newey away from their rivals.

Joining ahead of the 1997 campaign, Newey's arrival was too late to influence that year's car – but the Briton instead focused his efforts on the 1998 challenger, preparing to adapt to new regulations that would see the cars' widths reduced and grooved tyres used.

The resultant MP4-13 looked to have aced this task, allowing Mika Hakkinen to clinch a maiden World Championship while the squad wrapped up their first Teams' crown in seven years. Williams, meanwhile, suffered a winless campaign, an unwanted milestone they had not experienced since 1988.

Hakkinen would go on to win another title in 1999, while Ferrari were triumphant in the Teams' battle – a sign of things to come, with the Scuderia subsequently embarking on a dynasty of their own alongside Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004. Until…

After a record-breaking run of five consecutive World Championships – and six Teams' titles – the task of challenging Schumacher and Ferrari seemed a lofty one. However, amid the introduction of new technical regulations, Fernando Alonso and Renault kickstarted a sea change in 2005.

Along with alterations to the rules on aerodynamics, tyre changes during pit stops were banned – and, in the era of the so-called ‘tyre war' between Bridgestone and Michelin, this favoured the teams running the latter's more durable rubber while seemingly putting the three outfits using the former – that being Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi – at a disadvantage.

The result was that the previously dominant Schumacher and Ferrari saw their fortunes change in 2005, with the German scoring just one win – at the infamous six-car United States Grand Prix – en route to third place in the Drivers' Championship.

Alonso, meanwhile, collected seven victories to beat McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen to the title by 21 points – making him the youngest-ever champion at the time – before following this up with a second World Championship in 2006.

Following the success of Alonso and Renault, a different name experienced title glory in 2007 (Kimi Raikkonen), 2008 (Lewis Hamilton) and 2009 (Jenson Button) before another dynasty took hold when Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull became a seemingly unstoppable force, scoring every Drivers' and Teams' Championship between 2010 and 2013.

However, change was again afoot amid the arrival of the turbo-hybrid era. Mercedes, like other teams, did not arrive at pre-season testing ahead of the 2014 campaign with their car where they wanted it to be – but in the days and weeks that followed, the Silver Arrows started to mark themselves out as favourites, experiencing better reliability than many of their rivals.

That promise soon translated into real pace when the campaign got underway, with Mercedes triumphant across the opening six races as an intra-team battle started to play out between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. And while Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was the only other man to take a win that season, Vettel did not appear as comfortable with the RB10 and failed to stand on the top step.

There were no such troubles for the Silver Arrows, whose dominance during that campaign – one in which Hamilton ultimately beat Rosberg to the crown – led to a run of seven back-to-back Drivers' Championships and eight consecutive Teams' titles for the Brackley-based outfit.

While the 2021 season did not signal a complete changing of the guard, it very much shone a light on the growing threat posed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen – a name that would remain at the top for the next few years.

Following his breakthrough victory at Barcelona in 2016, Verstappen had been steadily adding to that tally across the seasons that followed. But it was not until 2021 that the Dutchman became a serious title contender for the first time, going head-to-head in an epic battle with reigning champion Hamilton.

A dramatic conclusion to that campaign saw Verstappen claim his debut title – but the introduction of new ground effect regulations in 2022 meant that the pecking order was uncertain when the Red Bull man prepared to defend his crown.

As it was, the Milton Keynes-based outfit looked to have aced the new rules, resulting in them becoming the first squad other than Mercedes to win the Teams' Championship since they themselves had last been victorious in 2013. Verstappen, meanwhile, chalked up consecutive Drivers' titles through to 2024 – before another change occurred with the 2025 season…

While Verstappen had secured his fourth championship in 2024, the triumph had not come quite as easily as during his incredibly dominant 2023 campaign. This was in part due to the continued resurgence of McLaren, who returned to the top step of the podium in 2024 for the first time since their one-off Monza win with Daniel Ricciardo in 2021.

Following that victory at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix – which also marked Lando Norris' first F1 win – the papaya squad increasingly became a thorn in Red Bull's side, with both Norris and team mate Oscar Piastri adding to the wins tally and giving McLaren the Teams' Championship. Remarkably, the squad had not previously achieved this accolade since 1998.

With Verstappen largely left to lead Red Bull's charge alone, the combined force of Norris and Piastri at McLaren became even more unstoppable in 2025, helping the outfit to wrap up a second Teams' Championship with six rounds still to spare.

The Drivers' title, however, was a slightly different story, as Verstappen launched a stunning comeback during the second half of the season to take the fight down to the wire against the papaya cars. Despite the Dutchman's best efforts, it was ultimately Norris who succeeded to seal a maiden World Championship – but, amid a wave of new technical regulations in 2026, can the Briton and his team maintain their run of form into the campaign ahead? Time will tell…

In contrast to the Golden Globes, which featured few political comments from winners and presenters onstage, Tuesday night's New York ceremony saw speakers get political, with the 'Cover-Up' filmmaker talking about the ""schizophrenic"" nature of such ceremonies against the backdrop of tragic, contentious events in the U.S. and abroad.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


	While the 2026 Golden Globes was light on political commentary, apart from some barbed remarks in host Nikki Glaser's monologue, just days later, at the National Board of Review awards gala in New York, winners used their time onstage to speak about the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, Iran's deadly crackdown on protesters and even Nicolás Maduro being removed from power in Venezuela.


Sinners writer-director Ryan Coogler, being honored for best original screenplay, was arguably the highest profile winner to directly address Good's death. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week as she was moving her car in an incident that a number of political figures and commentators have characterized as murder. Trump administration officials have said the officer was acting in self-defense and accused Good of “domestic terrorism.” Good's death has led to protests in Minnesota and beyond.

	Coogler, who had been previously honored by the National Board of Review for his 2013 directorial debut Fruitvale Station, alluded to that film as he began his speech, indicating he was distracted by the news.


	“I was young and naive, and I thought the movie was going to change the world and make it so you didn't see people executed by civil servants on camera anymore. I was proven wrong again and again. And it's tough to be here and not think about Minnesota,” he said, recalling people he knew from the state. “My heart is broken. I can't be here and not think about Renee.”

	











	Coogler went on to deliver an emotional speech in which he recalled making the film for his late Uncle James, who he said he wasn't with when he died and was instead doing post-production on a film, and how he was inspired to start writing by his college professor Rosemary Graham, who attended the ceremony with him.


	Filmmakers Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus, on hand to accept the best documentary award for their Seymour Hersh film Cover-Up, also spoke about Good's death, with Obenhaus wearing an “ICE Out” pin like the ones donned by a handful of stars at the Globes.


	Poitras also addressed the “schizophrenic” nature of this awards season as these gala ceremonies are taking place against the backdrop of tragic, contentious news in the U.S. and overseas.


	“I think it's kind of schizophrenic, but I think we have to use the platform to talk about the reason we made the film, which is that the essential right of press freedom in this country, we can't take it for granted, because it's not a given that we will have it, and these rights are being stripped away,” Poitras told The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Tuesday night's event. “When we see what happened to Renee Good, being killed in cold blood for a protected right of protest is terrifying. So why am I here tonight? Is to say that to you and to say that to cameras and use the platform wisely.”


	And she shared that she was “surprised” that the Globes didn't feature more people talking about these serious incidents.

	











	“I was surprised that there wasn't more noting of what a really terrifying moment we're in, given both the regime change that's happened and the killing of a protester in broad daylight.” Poitras told THR. “I think we should be talking about those things.”


	Obenhaus added that their film has “met its moment” in a way that they hadn't anticipated when they started working on it.


	“The message of the film is about what's going on right now and the suppression of journalism,” he said. “It's always been the case but not to the degree that there's this much suppression of free expression.”


	Poitras added, “One thing that I feel is important to say and it's something that Sy [Hersh] has said throughout his career. We do have a right. Press freedom is an enshrined right in this country. So when you see journalists that don't speak maybe as freely as they think or when you see something like 60 Minutes withdrawing a news program because of government pressure, that is the press hurting the press.”


	Onstage she added, “Journalism is not repeating government narratives. We all know that the CIA is capable of regime change, kidnapping, stealing resources. That's really not news, and it should not be presented as that. It's illegal, and it should be presented in the long historical context in which these actions are happening.”


	And Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, on hand to accept the best international film award for It Was Just an Accident, spoke strongly about the violent crackdown on protesters in his native country.

	











	“The Islamic Republic has caused a bloodbath to delay its collapse,” Panahi said through a translator. “Bodies are piling up on bodies, and those who have survived are searching for signs of their loved ones through mountains of corpses. Today, the real scene is not on screens, but on the streets of Iran. This is no longer a metaphor. This is not a story. This is not a film. This is a reality written with bullets day after day.”


	“In accepting this award, I consider it my duty to call on artists and members of the global film community to speak out and not remain silent,” he continued. “Use any voice and any platform you have. Call your governments, call on your governments to confront this human catastrophe rather than turn a blind eye. Do not let blood dry in the darkness of amnesia.”


	Multiple recipients expressed their support for Panahi from the stage, with Train Dreams writer-director Clint Bentley seemingly departing from his best adapted screenplay speech midway through, saying “I had a fucking thing I was going to say.”


	“When the world is kind of burning down and it can feel very frivolous at times,” he added. “I just want to say thank you most of all to Mr. Panahi for reminding us for what we can do with the medium and what it can be and why it can be worth doing.”


	The National Board of Review winners, announced in early December, like most awards ceremonies so far this season, were dominated by One Battle After Another, which won best picture, director (Paul Thomas Anderson), actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), supporting actor (Benicio del Toro) and breakthrough performance (Chase Infiniti).

	











	Other winners included Rose Byrne (best actress for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (best supporting actress for Sentimental Value). The ceremony, hosted by Willie Geist, took place at New York's Cipriani 42nd St.

The new feature from Polish filmmaker Łukasz Ronduda, loosely based on the life of young artist Patryk Różycki, world premieres in the Big Screen Competition at the Rotterdam film festival, IFFR.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Two young artists engage in their first serious relationship, and it is full of raw emotion and intense physicality. But they struggle to find a language for a real connection. Tell Me What You Feel, the new feature from Polish director and curator at the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw Łukasz Ronduda (Heart of Love, All Our Fears, Rave), world premieres in the Big Screen Competition of the 55th edition of the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) on Jan. 31. He wrote the screenplay with Agata K. Koschmieder.

	











	Like his past narrative movies, Tell Me What You Feel, revolves around artists. In this case, they are Maria and Patryk, played by Izabella Dudziak and Jan Sałasiński, respectively. Patryk struggles to sell his paintings, while Maria, who has a well-off background, created Tear Dealer, an art project that lets poor people trade their tears, collected in vials, for money.

	Through the two, Ronduda traces the struggles and aspirations of a generation hoping to be different from the past and actually being different. Loosely based on the experience of real-life young Polish artist Patryk Różycki and a female artist, the film explores modern love and relationships, including our time of “vulnerable masculinity,” as the filmmaker tells THR.


	“Patryk is based on a real person, so is Maria. And the Tear Dealer project is real, too,” Ronduda shares. “But of course, the film is a synthesis. I am making fiction movies, so Tell Me What You Feel is a synthesis – creative fiction based on real inspirations.”

	











Tell Me What You Feel was produced by Natalia Grzegorzek at Koskino, in co-production with Documentary and Feature Film Studios (WFDiF), Silesia Film, EC1-Łódź and Fixafilm. It was co-financed by the Polish Film Institute.


	“My film portrays contemporary, young Poles, who, by being deeply aware of their emotions and mental health, are bringing about a great social change,” notes a director's statement. “However, their over-therapeutization significantly affects the way they build relationships. I wanted to take a closer look at this modern love, characterized by psychological awareness on one hand and confusion on the other.”


	Concludes the filmmaker: “I am also interested in how this focus on emotions gives an illusion of removing social and economic borders between lovers. Moreover, the film explores the topic of a new ‘vulnerable' masculinity, open to emotions, tears, and feelings.”


THR can now exclusively reveal the first trailer for the movie that teases some of the awkwardness of love and sex that not only Polish audiences are likely to recognize. Check out the Tell Me What You Feel trailer below.

The actor starred in Eastwood's 2009 film 'Invictus.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Matt Damon is recalling his first on-set experience with Clint Eastwood in the director's chair.


	During a recent appearance on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, the Oscar winner said he quickly learned the legendary filmmaker's directing style when he got shut down on his first day of filming 2009's Invictus for asking to film another take. Eastwood is known for giving actors limited takes while filming.




	“So I was playing a South African rugby player, and that's a really tough accent to do,” Damon remembered, adding that he “spent six months” working with a dialect coach to perfect the accent of his character, Francois Pienaar. “[The coach] would come in from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, we would work on this accent. … It was a lot of work and fun and great.”

	“And I showed up [on set] and I am ready and it's my chance to work with one of my heroes,” The Odyssey actor continued. “The very first take, I did it… There are a number of ways I'm thinking of doing the scene and he just goes, ‘Cut, print, move on.' I go, ‘Hang on, hang on, hang on, boss. I want to, you know, I want to do another one. That was the first one!' He goes, ‘Why? You wanna waste everybody's time?' And I went, ‘No, I guess we're moving on.' And it was one take.”


Invictus was Damon's first time working with Eastwood, and his performance ultimately earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He collaborated with the director again on Eastwood's 2010 film Hereafter.

	











	Damon clarified that there was still “kindness” in Eastwood's tone when he rejected his request for more takes, adding that he's “a lovely guy.”


	“His whole mentality was… your crew will go to the ends of the Earth for you as long as you're not taxing them on every shot,” Damon explained. “When we need to get in there, we get in there. For the most part, professional actors are going to show up with something good and we keep the momentum.”

At the height of his reign, the 'Game of Thrones' author gets candid about his efforts to rule his expanding media empire, his buzzy new show 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,' and the long-delayed saga he's still determined to finish — if he can.


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	In 2015, George R.R. Martin confessed to having two worries that would define his future and forever change the world of fantasy entertainment.


	We were having breakfast in San Francisco before HBO's premiere event for Game of Thrones season five. Martin had been professionally writing sci-fi and fantasy fiction since his acclaimed debut novel, 1977's Dying of the Light, and had attempted a stint as a staff writer on TV shows in Los Angeles in the 1980s before launching his bestselling A Song of Ice and Fire novels, which served as the basis for Thrones. His books took high fantasy tropes and combined them with a tale inspired by the brutal, R-rated history of politics and warfare in medieval Europe.

	Along the way, Martin had become a celebrity figure with a distinctive look, with his bushy white beard, fisherman's cap, glasses and suspenders — like some 1920s steampunk Santa. Between bites of eggs Benedict, Martin said he couldn't believe he was being parodied on South Park and Saturday Night Live. In just a few short years, Martin had become the country's most recognizable author aside from Stephen King. It was an extraordinary accomplishment for the son of a New Jersey longshoreman who got his start by selling monster stories to schoolmates for a dime apiece.


	Martin told me his first concern was that HBO might never make another series based on the world of Thrones. He had “material for 100 other shows,” he said, but HBO executives weren't yet interested in doing spinoffs. Martin didn't want to be a one-hit wonder in Hollywood. He hoped his fantasy creation would evolve into a franchise that kept it alive for generations.

	











	Martin's second worry was one he'd had since 2011, when Thrones premiered and his last Ice and Fire novel, A Dance With Dragons, was published. He still needed to write two more books, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring, to finish his saga, and the clock was ticking. The HBO show's storylines were about to surpass the narrative in his books.


	“I have to finish the next book,” Martin fretted. “The actual writing [is getting] harder. I'm rewriting. I'm struggling. Maybe I'm overoptimistic about how quickly I can write these things. I'm trying to cut back on anything that I can to clear my decks and get this done …”


	Martin takes a seat in his bar in Santa Fe. The tavern is called Milk of the Poppy, a nod to the opiate tonic in Thrones, yet it's not officially based on the show. “I sold Westeros to Warner Bros. in 2007,” he points out.


	The bar is located next to his Beastly Books bookstore, which is next to his Jean Cocteau Cinema movie theater, which is a stone's throw away from a train painted to look like a dragon offering day-trip adventures. Locals regularly stop Martin and thank him for all that he's done for the city (the author is estimated to be worth around $120 million, though he lives a rather humble lifestyle).


	In many ways, Martin looks the same as ever. He's sharp and engaging. His voice is vibrant. Yet his beard has thinned and he has a tougher time walking. He's also lost weight, but contrary to morbid online speculation, this isn't due to any health issues.

	











	“I never thought I'd live to be 77,” Martin says. “I'm old, so I have some old-people stuff. My lower back hurts sometimes. I don't like to stand around. But I feel OK. Maybe you should make that your headline: ‘George R.R. Martin Is Not Dying.'”


	Martin's concern about the survival of his Westeros kingdom has proved groundless. The first Thrones spinoff — the prequel House of the Dragon, based on Martin's book Fire & Blood — has been a hit for HBO and will debut its third season this year. Another prequel about to premiere, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, is based on Martin's Dunk and Egg novellas. There are multiple other Westeros-based tales in development at HBO, while a London West End stage play, The Iron Throne, will soon dramatize the story of King Robert's Rebellion.


	Martin's also launched popular ventures beyond his best-known franchise. He's an executive producer on AMC's acclaimed Navajo Tribal Police drama Dark Winds and collaborated on the hit fantasy game Elden Ring. He's a founding investor in Meow Wolf, the innovative immersive art experience that launched in Santa Fe in 2016 and has since expanded to four other cities.


	Martin wanted to build an empire — and did. Yet “productive” is the last word any Thrones fan would use to describe him. The author's worry that he wouldn't be able to finish Winter has borne out to a staggering degree. His tortured inability to “finish the book, George!” — as online hordes regularly chide — is almost as impressive, in its way, as his success at doing everything else.

	











	But first, we discuss the new show, which has a scrappy, low-key vibe compared to GoT or Dragon. The action is almost entirely set at a jousting tournament in a rural backwater of Westeros and follows the penniless knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his diminutive 10-year-old squire (Dexter Sol Ansell) as they enter the tourney to improve their fortunes. Across six episodes, the likable duo tangle with an array of powerful rival lords. “Dunk and Egg both face great Shakespearean jeopardy in Westeros, but there's a lot of humor and heart along the way, too,” says HBO drama programming head Francesca Orsi. 


	“The show is meant to be a very different type,” says Martin, who serves as co-creator and exec producer. “It turned out very well, and I'm very happy with season one. The casting was a home run. [Showrunner Ira Parker] is terrific and seems to have the same priorities I do — he's trying to do something that's very true to the characters.”


	The show came about, Martin says, because HBO was looking for a project “where we could get the budget a little under control.” (Dragon costs about $20 million an episode, and the network previously shortened Dragon‘s second season to push an expensive battle sequence into season three.)


	“This doesn't have any dragons or big battles,” says Martin. “It has a field and a lot of tents and some horses.”


	When the project was announced two years ago, HBO's press release suggested the series would serve as Martin's return to screenwriting. But he still hasn't written an episode of TV since season four of Thrones. “There has always been the possibility of me writing on the show,” he says. “But then things happen and suddenly I have other priorities.”

	











	Martin is nonetheless highly creatively involved. On Knight and Dragon, Martin initially convened a writing summit in Santa Fe to help figure out the series. “I bring the showrunner together with four or five writers that I know — some are TV writers, some are fantasy novelists — who really know the world and we assemble for a week,” he says. Parker called the summit “one of the most fun, creative weeks I've ever had in my whole career” and notes that while writing episodes, “George was there every step of the way. He's been lovely. I think of him as a friend now.”


	With a production and scope that's quite modest compared to Thrones and Dragon, Parker admits to worrying about whether fans will embrace it (early reviews, at least, are quite positive, with our critic calling the show “smaller, smarter, funnier” than its predecessors.). 


	“At the end of the day, we are Game of Thrones without all the stuff,” Parker says. “We have one of the ingredients — two unusual characters like Arya and the Hound, or Brienne and Podrick — who are paired together and having conversions. I hope that's what [made Thrones work]. It's a big part of what it was for me.” 


	Season one is faithful to Martin's debut Dunk and Egg tale, The Hedge Knight, and season two, which already has been greenlit, will be based on his novella The Sworn Sword.

	











	There is, however, one potential problem for the show's future. “The big issue is that I have only written three novellas, and I have a lot more stories about Dunk and Egg in my fucking head,” Martin says, looking a bit shamefaced. “I've got to get them down on paper. I began writing two at various points in the past year. One is set in Winterfell and one set in the Riverlands …”


Oh, George, I say. Not again …


	All of Martin's books, shows, events and businesses come with their own set of distractions, which get added to a pile and compete for his attention. Some involve working with writers on not-yet-announced potential Thrones projects.


	One previously reported idea is based on Dragon‘s seafaring character the Sea Snake. This development has quietly shifted from a live-action project to animated to keep costs down. Another is based on King Aegon Targaryen's conquest of Westeros and is being developed by HBO as a possible drama series and by the Warner Bros. film team as a mammoth Dune-sized feature film.


	But one idea is an offspring of the most intriguing of all the post-Thrones pitches — the scrapped Jon Snow sequel. Martin long has resisted sequels to Thrones because the ending of his Ice and Fire books is not going to align with the show and he wants to avoid further canonizing Thrones‘ controversial ending — even though he hasn't written his own yet. “[The book's ending is] going to be significantly different,” Martin says. “Some characters who are alive in my book are going to be dead in the show, and vice versa.”

	











	Martin figured Jon (played by Kit Harington in Thrones) would be the safest character for a sequel since he was exiled to north of the Wall in the series finale, and picking up his story wouldn't need to include revealing what happened to the other major characters down south.


THR broke the news of the development in 2022 but held back story details to protect against spoilers. Harington, working with two writers from his drama series Gunpowder, was interested in mapping out a tale of Snow living alone as a broken man with PTSD. Having chased off his direwolf Ghost and thrown away his sword Longclaw, Jon spent his time building cabins and burning them back down again. Harington also wanted Jon to die and to avoid being a hero.


	The story echoed, in some respects, Harington's personal struggles — entering rehab following an intense shooting experience on Thrones. (“I went through some mental health difficulties,” the actor has said. “I think it was directly due to the nature of the show.”)


	HBO found the “broken Jon Snow” idea too much of a bummer and eventually pushed it aside. Yet in recent days, sources say a new writer (Quoc Dang Tran from Drops of God) has come aboard to revive the sequel idea. While the story is still being fleshed out, one possibility is shifting the drama to the Mediterranean-like land of Essos and adding another hugely popular legacy character — Arya Stark (who was played by Maisie Williams in Thrones). 

	











	This is very early development, however, and HBO is naturally being quite cautious about handling this one. “We are very interested and excited by the prospect of a sequel but also keenly aware of how high the bar of execution needs to be,” one insider says. No actors are yet on board, and signing Harington, in particular, would likely prove quite difficult. Just recently, the actor declared he doesn't “want to go anywhere near” Jon Snow again.


	Martin says he cannot confirm or comment on projects in development. None of the titles is as sensitive, however, as Martin discussing a show that everybody already knows about: House of the Dragon.


	“I have an ego,” Martin once said.


	Having interviewed Martin nearly a dozen times over the years, this quote always stuck with me because nearly all creatives have an ego — often massive ones — but they're rarely so forthright about it. Whereas Martin always comes across bluntly honest and unafraid to be vulnerable. He can also get a very frustrated at perceived rudeness or slights. Warner Bros. may legally own Westeros, but the world is still Martin's creation, and he understandably wants to feel respected and involved.


	Martin has made something else consistently clear: He believes book adaptations — not just his own — should be as faithful as possible. Martin is childless and has said he considers his characters to be his children. If another writer wants to make a major change to one of his brood — or remove one from a story altogether — he wants to know why, and the reason should make sense.


Knight showrunner Parker says he suspects Martin leaning on HBO and showrunners to respect his vision is one reason “why these shows have done so well” and that the author has “been nothing but a benefit.” 

	











	“In my very first meeting with George, before I officially had the job, I promised I wouldn't put anything in that he didn't want — but it's never come to that,” Parker says. “He's pushed back on a lot of things. I just explain the reason why I want to do something and then he would explain his reasons why I'm an idiot.” 


	It's always been a bit unclear precisely how much authority Martin has over his HBO projects (sometimes it seems fuzzy to Martin, as well). When HBO's Orsi is asked about Martin's level of control, she replies, “We always value his input in terms of the writers we're hiring, the arenas we're tackling for new spinoffs and the development of each project across the GoT universe. But building, producing, and running a series is a massive undertaking. We while we care deeply about George's and our showrunners' perspectives, we ultimately make decisions that make the best show.”


	I ask Martin carefully: I know you can't say much about this, but I was wondering how your relationship with Dragon showrunner Ryan Condal got so rocky?


	“It's worse than rocky,” Martin says, looking miserable. “It's abysmal.”


	Without getting into spoilers, Martin's gripes about Dragon stem from disputes over changes to his book's characters that impact key plot points.


	“I hired Ryan,” Martin says. “I thought Ryan and I were partners. And we were all through the first season. I would read early drafts of the scripts. I would give notes. He would change some things. It was working really well — I thought.”


	When Ryan came to loggerheads with original Dragon co-showrunner Miguel Sapochnik, Ryan asked for Martin's support in their dispute, and got it (Sapochnik left the show after season one).

	











	“Then we got into season two, and he basically stopped listening to me,” Martin says. “I would give notes, and nothing would happen. Sometimes he would explain why he wasn't doing it. Other times, he would tell me, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, I'll think about that.' It got worse and worse, and I began to get more and more annoyed. Finally, it got to a point where I was told by HBO that I should submit all my notes to them and they would give Ryan our combined notes.”


	One night in 2024, while the second season was airing, Martin wrote a blog post, “Beware the Butterflies,” which publicly revealed some of his gripes. When he woke the next morning, it was as if Martin had unleashed his own Red Wedding. An upset HBO exec had called Martin's manager, who phoned Martin's assistant, who took down the post — but not before entertainment sites (including THR) picked up Martin's comments. “I would've put it back up, but then I would've looked like an idiot,” he says. “And 80 percent of it was praise, but that's not what people focused on.”


	Still, the post was meant to be just part one of six detailing the author's issues with Dragon.


	Martin says he can't say anything beyond this. But sources say Martin and Condal's relationship deteriorated further and came to a head during a Zoom call with the show's producers and some HBO executives. The purpose of the call was for Condal to present his vision for season three. After Condal spoke, Martin detailed his many objections and allegedly declared, “This is not my story any longer.”

	











	Condal didn't comment for this profile but pointed to a statement he gave to EW last year: “I made every effort to include George in the adaptation process. I really did. … But at some point, he just became unwilling to acknowledge the practical issues at hand in a reasonable way .. I just have to keep marching forward for the sake of the crew, the cast, and for HBO, because that's my job … I can only hope that George and I can rediscover that harmony someday.” 


	After their contentious Zoom call, HBO asked Martin to step back from Dragon altogether. A few months later, the author was brought back aboard. “I can't talk about it,” Martin says.


	“George and Ryan had a disagreement on the direction of season three,” an HBO insider says. “At that point, it was clear that the process and communication with them was broken and needed a reset. So there was naturally a period where everyone took a step back for a while until we could figure out a new way forward.”


	In August, Martin was on an author panel at WorldCon when a fan asked a stunningly rude question. Martin typically enjoys such events. He likes communing with fellow creatives and meeting fans. He'll do book signings for hours, autographing a thousand copies. Martin notes fans are always exceedingly nice when he meets them in person.


	The WorldCon panel was taking audience questions when somebody asked Martin if he would let another writer finish The Winds of Winter because “you're not going to be around for much longer.”


	The audience booed. Martin felt like he'd been slapped. When he looked online to see the reaction, he was dismayed to find some fans saying he deserved it. “They say, ‘He lied to us, he is going to die soon, look how old he is,' ” Martin says. Even now, months later, the author looks rattled. “I really didn't need that shit,” he says. “Nobody needs that shit.”

	











	Martin recently has endured losing a wave of fellow novelists whom he counted as close friends. “Howard Waldrop, Gardner Dozois, Victor Milán, John J. Miller, Edward Bryant …” Martin lists. “They're all gone, one after another.”


	Last year, Martin sat down with one of his idols, Robert Redford, who was a fellow executive producer on Dark Winds. Redford came out of acting retirement to film a brief cameo in the show with Martin. In the scene, the two are sitting at a chessboard, and Redford ad-libbed a line: “George, the whole world is waiting, make a move.” It was a meta joke about how long it's taken Martin to finish Winter. Then Redford died, too. His chess scene with Martin — like something out of The Seventh Seal — was his final performance. “Which just seems so fucking weird,” Martin says.


	Martin's masterpiece is arguably A Storm of Swords. The book, published in 2000, was adapted into seasons three and four of Thrones. It's a brilliant, twisty novel, spanning more than 1,000 pages and reads like Martin was channeling a river of fire. Somehow, Martin wrote Swords in a single year. Winter has taken him 14 and counting. “I look back at that book too,” Martin admits. “And I don't know how I did it.”


	Martin says he has around 1,100 manuscript pages finished. He's also said the number for a while. He long has blamed the endless distractions that have come from shifting from a full-time author to a producer and celebrity. The success of Thrones was both the best thing that could have happened to Martin and the worst thing that could have happened to the greatest story he ever wrote.

	











	The roots of Ice and Fire extend back to Martin's childhood. As a kid, he kept pet turtles. When they mysteriously began dying off, he invented stories about how the turtles were feudal rivals who were secretly killing one another in sinister plots. Then when he worked on shows like Beauty and the Beast and a revival of The Twilight Zone, Martin chafed against the censorious, low-budget nature of '80s TV, decrying “bullshit changes, sheer cowardice, [producers] afraid of anything that was too strong [and] anything that anyone might be ‘offended' by.” He deliberately wrote Ice and Fire to be so sprawling and epic that it would be “unfilmable.” The result has sold more than 100 million copies.


	Today, Martin works on Winter at his old house, which serves as his office (he recently moved his primary residence to another Santa Fe property), typing away on a DOS computer that's not connected to the internet.


	Here's what happens when he sits down to write: “I will open the last chapter I was working on and I'll say, ‘Oh fuck, this is not very good.' And I'll go in and I'll rewrite it. Or I'll decide, ‘This Tyrion chapter is not coming along, let me write a Jon Snow chapter.' If I'm not interrupted though, what happens — at least in the past — is sooner or later, I do get into it.”


	One issue is narrative complexity. The fourth Ice and Fire book, A Feast for Crows, introduced several new characters and major storylines to an already highly intricate tale. Martin was soon switching perspectives between 21 rival viewpoint characters, each with their own dedicated series of chapters. (When Thrones reached the same narrative juncture, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss decided to largely stick with characters who were already established — yet still famously struggled to pull off a final stretch that fans felt was satisfying).

	











	When the pandemic hit, Martin tried going to a literal cabin in the woods to finish Winter. That was a prolific stretch, he says, resulting in many new chapters. But it took him away from his longtime partner, Parris McBride (they met in the 1970s and tied the knot in 2011), and even Martin's forced-isolation effort ran into creative troubles. “I wrote a Tyrion chapter I just loved,” he recalls. “Then I looked at it and said: ‘I can't do this, it will change the whole book. I'll make this into a series of dreams. No! That doesn't work either …'”


	I ask Martin if he's ever considered simply giving up on the book. It's your life, George, I say. You don't have to spend it working on something if you find it torturous.


	“I would hate that,” Martin says. “It would feel like a total failure to me. I want to finish.” 


	Handing the project to another writer — which some fans have lobbied for him to do — isn't going to happen, Martin says. There is also no secret contingency plan for somebody else to take over if Martin gets struck by lightning. “If that happens, my work won't be finished,” he says. “It'll be like The Mystery of Edwin Drood” — referring to Charles Dickens' unfinished final novel.


	How much further does he have to go? Martin is vague. “If I wound up doing everything in my head, this could be the longest book in the series.”


	After asking Martin repeatedly about Winds — seemingly more than he'd like — the author did what he does best. He tells a story.


	In 1975, Martin met Dune author Frank Herbert at a book convention and they shared a drink. The meeting was “near the end of Herbert's life,” Martin says. Herbert had written many acclaimed novels, but all fans seemed to want was more Dune. Herbert's publisher had just offered him a modest advance for a story he wanted to write, or six times that number for another Dune novel.

	











	“He didn't like Dune anymore and he didn't want to write any more Dune books,” Martin says. “But he felt locked in by the success of Dune, so he kept writing them.”


	Martin finishes … and waits.


	I ask: Do you relate to how Herbert felt?


	“I'm not necessarily tired of the world [of Ice and Fire],” he says. “I love the world and the world-building. But, yes, I do.”


	Martin is waiting in front of his bookstore for a car that will take him home. When you walk into the store, the first several bookcases are full of Martin's published works — which is more than you probably realize, especially when you add the dozens of anthologies he's edited (like his popular Wildcards series). The shelf space devoted to the Ice and Fire books is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rather small.


	A couple of fans had just presented Martin with a gorgeous custom-made dragon's head cane. He thanked them and they had a chat. I wonder how he feels about being given a cane but don't ask.


	Martin's thoughts turn, unprompted, to the end of Ice and Fire. It becomes clear that the details of his story's conclusion, like so much of the saga, remains uncertain.


	“I was going to kill more people,” he muses. “Not the ones they killed [in the show]. They made it more of a happy ending. I don't see a happy ending for Tyrion. His whole arc has been tragic from the first. I was going to have Sansa die, but she's been so appealing in the show, maybe I'll let her live …”


	His assistant's car is coming. I ask what he's doing for Christmas.

	











	“I don't know,” Martin says. “I think I'll stay home. I have to write more Dunk and Egg. There's supposed to be another Fire and Blood book, too. I do think if I can just get some of these other things off my back, I could finish The Winds of Winter pretty soon. It's been made clear to me that Winds is the priority, but … I don't know. Sometimes I'm not in the mood for that.”


	He sighs. “I'm so far behind on everything.”

Disco, Occasionally': Here's When It Arrives","https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/harry-styles-new-album-kiss-all-the-time-release-date-1236154587/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:15:00 GMT","

The singer last dropped an album in 2022.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	You know it's not the same as it was. At long last, Harry Styles has announced his musical comeback, revealing plans for a new album titled Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally coming this spring.


	As announced Thursday (Jan. 15), the pop star's fourth studio album will drop March 6. It features 12 tracks and was produced by Kid Harpoon, who has worked on all of Styles previous albums.


	The singer shared the news on Instagram along with the album's cover art, which features him in a wooded area at night beneath a disco ball levitating in the air. He wears jeans, a T-shirt and funky glasses, while the LP's title is displayed in bright pink and blue lettering in the top right.

	











	Fans had been expecting word on the new music front for a few days leading up to the announcement, having discovered a mysterious website connected to Styles with the domain “WeBelongTogether.co” and featuring a copyright message at the bottom from Sony Music Entertainment. The site had featured a full-page clip of a crowd enjoying a concert and prompted visitors to text the phrase “We belong together” to a phone number owned by “HSHQ.”




	The site now displays a clock with “Kiss” displayed where 11 numbers should be and “Disco” in the 9 o'clock position.


	Weeks before the website's initial launch, Styles had seemingly randomly dropped a video of himself performing his “Forever, Forever” instrumental on piano at his final Love on Tour concert in Reggio Emilia, Italy, which ended with the written message, “We belong together.”


	It's been a while since the One Direction alum last introduced a new album era. His most recent full-length, Harry's House — which was also preceded by a cryptic website launch — debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2022 and later won album of the year at the Grammys. Its lead single, “As It Was,” spent 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, shattering Styles' previous personal best one-week run at the top of the chart with “Watermelon Sugar” in 2020.


	The British musician's next album will mark his fourth full-length. Before Harry's House, Styles released his self-titled debut in 2017 and followed it up with sophomore effort Fine Line in 2019. Both of his first two albums also entered the U.S. albums chart at No. 1.

Rocky season is here.

	Michael Saponara



	The wait for A$AP Rocky's DON'T BE DUMB album is finally over, as the rapper revealed the project's tracklist on Wednesday (Jan. 14). 


	With Rocky's fourth LP set to arrive on Friday (Jan. 16), the Mob frontman posted the track list to the album, which boasts 15 tracks in total and one listed skit. Previously released singles “Helicopter” and “Punk Rocky” are also on the album.


	Unfortunately, there aren't any featured artists listed, so the surprises will wait for special guests until release day. “DONTBEDUMB OFFICIAL TRACKLIST!!! EXCLUSIVE @ONEQUINCE SHIRTHEADS VINYL AVAILABLE NOW,” Rocky wrote when revealing the track list with various posters and vinyl editions.

	











	Per a press release, the Harlem native has already sold over 130,000 units ahead of the project landing on DSPs.


	Pusha T, Three 6 Mafia and Hit-Boy showed Rocky love in his comment section. “FLAMES,” King Push chimed in. “FIRE ROLL OUT MANE,” Three 6 wrote.


“Punk Rocky” arrived earlier in January, accompanied by a chaotic music video starring Winona Ryder, which was followed by “Helicopter.” According to a press release, Rocky showcases six alter-egos across the album. 


	It's Rocky's first album since 2018's TESTING, which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. It's unclear if he plans to tour the album, but Rocky's booked to headline Governors Ball 2026 in New York City on June 7.

	The trend of turning dystopian drama series into reality competition continues.


Amazon has handed a greenlight to Fallout Shelter, a series based on its Ella Purnell-fronted drama. The project comes from Studio Lambert, the company behind Netflix's Squid Game: The Challenge, a reality series based on the streamer's hit Korean series.


	The ten-part series is based on the eponymous video game extension, which came out in 2015. Set inside Vault-Tec's bomb-proof vaults, Fallout Shelter sees a group of contestants take part in “escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads” as they chase a cash prize.

	











	It comes as the second season of the drama series, which comes from Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, is in the middle of its run, having premiered in December.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The drama, which also stars the likes of Walton Goggins and Kyle MacLachlan, is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them. It scored an early season three renewal.


	Studio Lambert is producing Fallout Shelter with Nolan and Joy's Kilter Films, in association with Amazon MGM Studios and Bethesda Game Studios.


	Executive producers include Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, Jack Burgess, Toni Ireland, Stephen Yemoh, Stephen Lovelock and Amina Badresingh for Studio Lambert with Abi Lambrinos as executive in charge of production; Nolan, Joy and Athena Wickham for Kilter Films and James Altman and Todd Howard for Bethesda Game Studios.

EXCLUSIVE: Nik Dodani (Atypical) has attached to star in The Charm Offensive, a feature adaptation of the international bestseller by Alison Cochrun on which Marginal MediaWorks is partnering with award-winning producers Alex Liu and Leo Neri (A Sexplanation).


	The project is described as Heated Rivalry meets The Devil Wears Prada, set in the world of a Bachelor-like reality show in which an awkward, tech billionaire joins a popular dating show to reform his image and find true love, but unexpectedly ends up falling for one of the show's producers, played by Dodani.

	Published in 2021, Cochrun's novel went viral with over 10,000 posts on TikTok, inspiring scores of fan art, and has been translated into eight languages. The screenplay, written by Erin Williams and Shawn K. Jain, was one of six selected for the 2024 Desi List, a collaboration with the Black List, compiling the year's best unproduced scripts by South Asian writers.

	Producer Liu told us, “I came across The Charm Offensive as a staff pick in a small-town rural library and read it straight through in one sitting. What struck me wasn't just how good it was—but also where it was being embraced. It turns out audiences are drawn to an endearing love story with a liberal dose of smuttiness. Who knew?”


	Sanjay M. Sharma, founder and CEO of Marginal, said: “We're thrilled to join this dynamic, commercial, and culturally relevant project. Both the novel and the screenplay have a propulsive quality that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more. It's a very fun and heartwarming romantic comedy, at a time when audience demand for authentic, messy and funny LGBTQ stories couldn't be stronger.”

	











	Dodani added, “No matter how bad things get in the world, it's a comfort to know we're always going to have more gay shit to watch. I loved the novel when it was published, and Erin and Shawn's script is such a fun read. I've been waiting for the role that would finally get me into the gym…”


	Breaking out with a supporting role in Netflix's Atypical, Dodani is an actor, comedian, writer, and director who has also recently been seen starring in Craig Johnson's HBO Max Original The Parenting, opposite Lisa Kudrow, Brian Cox, Edie Falco, Parker Posey, and Brandon Flynn. As a writer-director, his debut short film Blue Boy had its world premiere at the 2024 Busan International Film Festival, where it won the Queer Camellia Award for Best Queer Short. He is repped by Paradigm and Gang, Tyre, Ramer.


	Screenwriters Williams and Jain met at Jeff Sagansky's Harvardwood Writing Program. Williams has written two TV pilots while Jain has also achieved success as an actor, appearing in Apple TV's WeCrashed and Peacock's Girls5eva.


	Liu and Neri's previous film, the documentary A Sexplanation, was a New York Times Critics' Pick and won a dozen film festival and industry awards.


	Founded in 2017, indie studio Marginal has produced 13 features in just over four years. Most recently, their first documentary feature, The Rose: Come Back to Me, was a runner-up for the Audience Award at Tribeca 2025 and was acquired by CJ Group. Cypher, a thriller starring Interscope recording artist Tierra Whack, won the Jury Prize in U.S. Narrative Fiction at the Tribeca Festival in 2023. Marginal's film She Taught Love premiered at the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival and was named Best Independent Film of 2024 by the African American Film Critics' Association. The company's entry into global sports came with Imported, a doc set in the world of international basketball that premiered on Hulu and Disney+ worldwide in last August. Pic was produced with Improbable Media, the media venture co-founded by NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo and former basketball star and ESPN analyst Jay Williams.

Co-Business Editor


	A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled today that Paramount has not identified any “irreparable harm” to itself as a Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder that would justify expedited disclosure as it pursues a hostile tender offer for the media giant.


	“Paramount as a stockholder must suffer cognizable, irreparable harm. It has not identified any,” Chancellor Morgant T. Zurn said from the bench at the conclusion of a hearing this morning.


	In a statement after the decision, Paramount said the ruling “was based on Paramount's standing and does not pertain to the merits of Paramount's claim.”

	











	In a dueling statement, WBD said “the lawsuit by Paramount Skydance was yet another unserious attempt to distract and the Judge saw right through it.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







Paramount sued for expedited disclosure from WBD related to the board's recommendation to shareholders not to tender their stock to Paramount. The David Ellison company insisted on urgency given a Jan. 21 deadline — set by Paramount itself — for stockholders to tender their shares as it seeks to derail WBD's agreement with Netflix.


	The tender deadline was extended once and Paramount's counsel acknowledged at the hearing today that it will be extended again but did not note the new date. The tender is not binding right now.


	Specifically, Paramount wants details concerning the valuation of the Discovery Global spinoff, which it says is key information shareholders need to decide which offer is better and whether to tender their shares. 

	











	Warner said it will be providing more robust disclosure in its upcoming Netflix merger proxy statement and that Paramount does not get to set that timeline.


	The legal issue, clarified Chancellor Zurn, is whether Paramount itself, specifically as a Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder, would suffer harm if disclosures are not expedited. 


	“Paramount itself is not making any decision based” on Warner Bros. Discovery disclosures, the judge said. “Paramount itself was not misled.” Paramount has other means to obtain the information besides an expedited proceeding and “must decide whether and how to improve its odds of success.”


	Paramount's statement said “WBD shareholders need the information on the WBD Board's evaluation of the Global Networks stub equity and the “risk adjustments” performed on Paramount's offer to make an informed decision. WBD shareholders should ask why their Board is working so hard to hide this information. Paramount continues to urge WBD to make these disclosures so that WBD shareholders can make an informed decision.”


	Said WBD: “We are pleased a Delaware Court agreed with our belief and rejected the notion that this lawsuit needed special treatment and may have other serious flaws. Despite its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.”


	During the hearing, WBD attorney Ryan McLeod Of Watchtell Lipton argued that Paramount “seeks the court's help to win control of Warner Bros. Discovery, which Paramount had every opportunity to do during a very lengthy sales process. Paramount had more time than any other bidder, during which time Paramount received more feedback than any other bidder. Paramount's harm is risk that Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders will not tender their shares immediately for a deal that may not close for 18 months.”


	“The value of Global Networks is the delta between the two transactions,” countered Paramount attorney Michael Barlow of Quinn Emanuel. “Our goal is to get more information to the stockholders as quickly as possible.” He said Para “fully intends to extend the tender offer. We stand fully behind it.” But, meanwhile, the WBD board should not be allowed “to extend a breach of fiduciary duty.”


	Alongside its foray into Delaware court, Paramount plans to propose an alternate slate of directors for a vote at WBD's annual meeting, meaning a proxy fight. The window to start that process opens in about three weeks.


	Paramount is offering $30 a share in cash for all of WBD. The Netflix deal is a mix of $23.25 a share in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock for the plum studios and streaming assets. Linear television would be spun off to WBD shareholders as a new publicly traded company, Discovery Global. 


Netflix is considering shifting its offer to all-cash.

	First came Barbenheimer, next up Dunesday?


	At least that's what Robert Downey Jr. & Timothée Chalamet would like to will into being when Dune: Part Three and Avengers: Doomsday premiere on December 18.


	The actors appeared on stage together in LA on Wednesday for a special screening of Chalamet's A24 movie Marty Supreme. 


	Downey Jr. told the audience: “We both have films opening on December 18, and we decided to coin it … We're thinking Dunesday.'” The moniker got a laugh in the room, with Downey Jr. adding: “We'll see if we're still friends by then.”

Robert Downey Jr. and Timothée Chalamet on ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY' and ‘DUNE: PART 3' releasing on the same day:“We both have films opening on December 18th, and we decided to coin a name for it. We're thinking ‘DUNESDAY.'”(via @timotheenation) pic.twitter.com/FtnyR3c2Kz


	The idea is that the two blockbusters can give each other a leg-up so that they can later bask in the reflected glory of box office success.

	It worked for Barbie and Oppenheimer, which combined to gross close to $2.5B worldwide when they were released in 2023 and birthed the Barbenheimer phenomenon. 


	Other double-releases since then have similarly attempted to capture the zeitgeist, albeit with less success. The most notable example was perhaps Glicked, combining Wicked and Gladiator II.


	Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.8B at the global box office. Dune: Part Two grossed $715M worldwide

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Justin and Hailey Bieber lawyer up against TikTokker over ‘abusive marriage' allegations","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/15/celebrity-news/justin-and-hailey-bieber-lawyer-up-against-tiktoker-over-abusive-marriage-allegations/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:13:00 GMT","














Justin and Hailey Bieber lawyered up against the TikTokker who claimed they had an “abusive marriage” fueled by the singer's alleged “drug addiction.”

The couple's lawyer, Evan Spiegel, sent social media user Julie Theis a cease-and-desist claiming she “fabricated' her story about their marriage, per TMZ.

In the letter obtained by the outlet, Spiegel writes that the psychologist has allegedly spread “outrageous false, fabricated and defamatory statements [she] made and disseminated online” via TikTok.

He also claimed she manufactured “a false defamatory narrative concerning our clients and their marriage that were published and widely disseminated,” noting that her “conduct is wrongful, highly damaging, actionable, and exposes [her] to substantial liability.”

Advertisement

Spiegel went on to demand that she “immediately” take down the videos in question, as well as stop posting that the Biebers are in an abusive relationship. If she doesn't, the couple would have no choice, “but to protect their rights and remedies against you.”

The attorney concluded his letter by reminding Theis she “[acts] at [her] own peril” and to “govern [herself] accordingly.”

The influencer then took to social media to talk about the cease-and-desist letter, which she claims was sent to “silence and intimidate” her. She went on to defend her initial videos, saying that she was merely sharing her opinion, which she's “legally” entitled to.

“Being offended by the opinions people have does not entitle you to people's voices,” she said in the video, further calling the letter “elitist” and a “temper tantrum of the rich.”

The TikTokker pointed out that her videos are “clearly opinion-based commentary about relationship dynamics and power.”

She also shared several clips targeted at Hailey, including one of her lounging by the beach with the caption, “Girl whatever.” 

In another clip, Theis mouthed along to the audio of the infamous fight between “Real Housewives of Orange County” stars Vicki Gunvalson and Tamra Judge, who scream about their opinions.

To really send her message home, she then resurfaced a 2019 Instagram post written by the “Daisy” singer, where he admitted to using hard drugs from the age of 19 and “[abusing] all of [his] relationships,” becoming “resentful, disrespectful to women” and “angry.”

Although she tried to give Justin, 31, the benefit of the doubt by saying he could have changed his ways, she then reflected on his comments towards Hailey when she landed the cover of Vogue.

In May 2025, he admitted via Instagram to telling his wife of almost eight years that she would never land the cover — however, she managed to prove him wrong.

Theis also spoke to TMZ after getting the letter, saying she's concerned the Biebers are trying to silence her free speech, explaining that she's allowed to express her opinions without legal intimidation.

Advertisement

“It's extremely elitist to try to silence opinions just because you disagree. Disagreement is not defamation,” she told the outlet, adding that she's allegedly been receiving death threats since the start of this drama.

Page Six has reached out to Hailey and Justin's reps and lawyers for comment, but did not receive any at the time of publication. 

Advertisement

The Biebers' drama with Theis started when she alleged Hailey, 29, is a “tolerant codependent” wife who accepts “abuse” in her marriage in a video about relationships.

Hailey was then accused of resharing the video to her own social media account before she was forced to take to social media to shut down the narrative.

“I know you guys who live on the internet are really bored, but I didn't repost any video speaking on my relationship,” she wrote via her Instagram Stories Saturday.

“Have a beautiful Saturday!”

The model and Justin — who are parents to son Jack Blues, 1 — have been married since 2018. However, they've been forced to continuously shut down split rumors that have run rampant over the years.

The “Baby” crooner's rep, however, shut down the “exhausting and pitiful” allegations, telling TMZ, “People are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive.”

The spokesperson also insisted that Justin and Hailey were in a good place after welcoming their son.

At the time, a source also defended the Grammy winner's recent appearances, explaining he had been spending endless hours in the recording studio while simultaneously caring for his son.

Vanessa and Kai Trump were spotted dressed to the nines for Tiger Woods' massive 50th birthday bash. 

The lavish soirée — said to be taking place at luxury Florida resort The Breakers on Wednesday — counted Vanessa, 48, and Kai, 18, among the high-profile guests. 

In exclusive snapshots obtained by Page Six, the ex-wife of Donald Trump, Jr. rocked a form-fitting black spaghetti strap frock with a corset lace up in the back for the occasion, pairing the look with red platform heels.

Her daughter Kai, meanwhile, donned a red silk floor-length cutout gown and a cast on her left arm — she recently announced via Instagram that she had surgery on her wrist. 

Both wore their hair in sleek straight styles. 

The mother-daughter duo were snapped entering the upscale party, where they fêted the 82-time PGA Tour winner on his milestone birthday.

In another photo, the University of Miami student strapped a small handbag over her casted arm while making her way inside. 

Snapshots from inside the bash showed suited waiters balancing plates of food as guests mingled. 

Kai and Vanessa were also seen making their way — with a crowd of guests — into a room for the party while showing off their respective formalwear. 

The birthday guest of honor, Woods, was also snapped at the event wearing a traditional black tuxedo.

Kai also modeled her eye-catching red dress alongside her mother in an Instagram post Wednesday evening — in one photo, she also posed solo ahead of the athlete's big event.

Per Front Office Sports, guests were told to “wear a touch of red” in honor of the golf great's “Sunday Red” tradition — which saw him wearing red polo shirts on each final day of competition and later inspired his own clothing label. 

The outlet also reported ahead of the event that “Livin on a Prayer” rocker Jon Bon Jovi was expected to perform for roughly 300 guests, and that the menu is reportedly inspired by the golf icon's Augusta National Gold Club Masters Champion Dinners.

The event is reportedly hosted by Woods' TGR Foundation, and it will also be “the official launch of the nonprofit's 30th anniversary campaign,” per the outlet. 

“We definitely could have made it bigger,” TGR Foundation CEO Cyndi Court told Front Office Sports. 

“But we also wanted it to be intimate so that we could celebrate people that throughout the years have made tremendous commitments to Tiger's vision of what could be possible in the future.”

Kai has enjoyed other high-profile golf-themed events in the past year — she also notably attended the Ryder Cup with her grandfather, President Donald Trump, in September 2025.

Kendall Jenner's new $23 million mansion is every equestrian's dream.

The supermodel's sprawling estate — located about 91 miles northwest of Los Angeles in Montecito, Calif. — has on-site horse stables and a riding arena, per photos obtained by Page Six.

Aerial shots of the property also show a training facility decked out with training gear, including jump fences.

Jenner's equestrian getaway is privately nestled behind trees and bushes.

The “Kardashians” star, 30, purchased the home last February, and it also features six small houses on the six-acre property.

She is often spotted riding horses and has been practicing since she was a child.

“I'm a horse girl, literally. I grew up riding horses,” Jenner gushed during a 2019 interview with the Cut. 

“So for my whole entire life I would beg my parents to please get me a pony.” 

“I wasn't just some little girl who was like, ‘I need a pony for no reason.' It was my life. I ate, breathed, and slept horses. And I wanted one so bad,” she continued.

The reality star was eventually gifted a horse at the age of 12.

Jenner revealed that she also competes in horse shows under a pseudonym during a Season 7 episode of “The Kardashians.” 

The Victoria's Secret model, meanwhile, gave a small glimpse of her ranch while showcasing her Christmas decorations in December.

The festive photos showed her house with a Christmas tree nestled by a window and a garland over her fireplace.

The home showcased Jenner's minimalist style, with another room painted black, featuring a wooden table and a vase full of flowers.

The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star also owns a “top secret” estate in Wyoming, she told Architectural Digest.

Harries are living in a “daydream.”

Harry Styles announced Thursday that he will be releasing his fourth record called “Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally.”

The latest addition to his discography — which featured a glittering disco ball during a sunrise — will be out March 6.

Styles was also featured on the cover as he pulled off a pair of sunglasses while wearing a simple blue t-shirt and jeans.

Fans were convinced of Styles' return to music after a cryptic new website, webelongtogether.co, popped up on Jan. 12. Though it made no mention of Styles, fans deduced that the clip of a packed concert crowd featured on the website was from Styles' “Forever, Forever” music video that he dropped as a surprise on Dec. 27.

During the final seconds of the music video, the phrase “we belong together” in all capital letters flashed across the screen.

Page Six exclusively reported on Jan. 12 that Styles landed his second Madison Square Garden residency and will return to the stage later this year.

It's not yet clear how many shows he'll do at the iconic arena, but we're told he'll be there for a significant chunk of time.

In August and September 2022, Styles had a historic 15-night, sold-out residency as part of his “Love On Tour” series.

He's since taken a three-year hiatus from performing.

Fans have eagerly been awaiting new music from Styles after he released “Harry's House” in 2022. “Harry's House” featured hits like “As It Was,” “Late Night Talking” and more.

The album also won Album of the Year at the 2023 Grammys, beating out Beyoncé, Adele and Bad Bunny.

Meanwhile, Styles and Zoë Kravitz, 37, still appear to be going strong after being first linked together in August 2025 when they were snapped strolling through Rome together.

They were again spotted in Rome ahead of Thanksgiving, holding hands during a walk.

When last we checked in on Prime Video's God Of War TV show (back in late 2024), the video game adaptation seemed to be going through some divine growing pains: Prime had just gotten done tossing out both its existing scripts and its existing showrunners, and was reportedly starting the mythical violence epic on a brand new footing. Since then, the series has found a new helmer—in the form of Battlestar Galactica‘s Ronald D. Moore, who's serving as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series—as well as a new version of its titular God Of War, Kratos, with news today that Ryan Hurst has been cast in the role of the very big, very angry god.

This is slightly confusing, in so far as Hurst has already played a god of war in the God Of War video games, but not the god of war of the title. That is, he starred in the Norse-set God Of War Ragnarok as Thor, who serves as a rival and enemy to Kratos, who was played in that game by Stargate SG-1 actor Christopher Judge. Prime Video has now executed what we can only think of as a bit of a sneaky god swap with the show, casting Hurst—whose credits include prominent roles in Remember The Titans, Sons Of Anarchy, and The Walking Dead—as Kratos himself.

A logline for the series, released alongside news of Hurst's casting, makes clear what audiences have been mostly expecting ever since the show began being rumored back in 2022: The new series will largely follow the plots of 2018's God Of War and 2022's Ragnarok, which see Kratos—who killed his way across the entire Greek pantheon of gods in the old God Of War games from the PlayStation 2 era—in a slightly calmer place, struggling to come to terms with his relationship with 10-year-old son Atreus in the wake of his wife's death. (No word yet on who'll be playing Atreus; he was played by professional actor/skateboarder Sunny Suljic in the games.) We also don't know when the series will actually come out—although Prime Video is confident enough that it'll be a big ol' hit when it finally does that it's already given the show a two-season order.

Jodie Foster so rarely stars in movies these days that it's a pleasure to see her in A Private Life. But it's even more enjoyable to simply watch her listen. She does that a lot in French filmmaker Rebecca Zlotowski's classy, curious whodunit, in which she plays Lilian, an American psychiatrist who has lived in Paris for many years. Lilian's job is to listen to her clients, but after one of them dies under odd circumstances, she decides to become an amateur sleuth to investigate what really happened. A Private Life is as much a thriller as it is a character study, also making room for a romantic drama and even elements of dark comedy. It's an unwieldy mix, but Foster's quiet, observant character forms its strong center. She keeps you wondering what Lilian is thinking when she's not talking.

The client in question is Paula (Virginie Efira), a mother and wife who has been in treatment with Lilian for almost a decade. Suddenly, though, Paula misses three straight sessions, which leaves Lilian concerned. Eventually, Paula's daughter Valérie (Luàna Bajrami) delivers the bad news: Paula died by suicide, overdosing on the medication Lilian prescribed her. Lilian is shocked—Paula had never shown signs of suicidal ideation—and after meeting the chilly Valérie and Paula's volcanic husband Simon (Mathieu Amalric), she starts to suspect that Paula didn't take her own life. Perhaps one of Paula's family members murdered her?

It's a wild hypothesis, but Zlotowski takes Lilian's hunch seriously, daringly striking a tricky tonal balance that allows the movie to be both a fun caper and a melancholy meditation. As a result, A Private Life offers plenty of fizzy pleasures alongside somber reflections on the passage of time and the regrets you have to live with. 

The filmmaker's previous movie was 2022's Other People's Children, which starred Efira as a single middle-aged teacher taking another chance on love, and Zlotowski again invests in a complicated, solitary heroine. Fluent in French but still something of a proud outsider—during one amusing interlude, she curses her fellow Parisians for just how damn French they are—Lilian lives a modest, somewhat fastidious existence. Obsessively recording each of her therapy sessions on old-school minidiscs that she carefully catalogs, Lilian has an adult son, Julien (Vincent Lacoste), and grandson she rarely sees. As for her ophthalmologist ex-husband, Gabriel (Daniel Auteuil), Lilian only pays him a visit once she notices that her eyes are leaking—she's not crying, but her eyes keep watering like she is. A Private Life is far from the first film about a shrink who discovers that she understands much less about human behavior than she realizes, but Foster's graceful, muted performance keeps hinting at the depths of discontent that reside uncharted within Lilian, just waiting to reach the surface.

As Lilian begins to pursue her belief that Paula was killed, she recruits Gabriel to be a Watson to her Holmes, and soon the former lovers are back in each other's orbit for the first time in too long. Lord knows the spark between them is still there—an initial drunken reunion at a restaurant leads to them going to bed—and Foster and Auteuil exude a wonderfully sexy, grown-up chemistry. A Private Life may be about a heinous crime, but the film unspools like a date-night confection for the arthouse crowd. 

But for all its hints of urban sophistication, this good-looking yet flimsy movie can be awfully silly, with Zlotowski introducing airport-novel gimmicks into the script she co-wrote—most notably, a scene in which Lilian meets a hypnotist, which results in a hokey fantasy sequence that may or may not hold a key to Paula's death. One senses that Zlotowski relishes weaving in these obviously cheesy elements, inviting the audience to savor a little hokum delivered with a straight face by Foster and a distinguished international cast. 

It doesn't take a master detective to deduce that, ultimately, A Private Life isn't so concerned with the mystery's outcome. In truth, Paula's death is one gigantic MacGuffin meant to awaken something in Lilian, a dedicated psychiatrist who only slowly comes to recognize that she has fallen into a stupor. Admittedly, there's an undeniable glibness to crafting a whodunit involving a murdered woman who ends up being grist for a diverting, superficial yarn. Nonetheless, working with frequent cinematographer George Lechaptois, Zlotowski frames Foster as an enigmatic figure of impossible cool, placing her in an apartment building with incredible winding staircases and dressing her in flowing scarves and chic sunglasses. The two-time Oscar-winner does the rest, playing Lilian as someone who is always at a slight remove. Perhaps that's something Lilian has learned in her work—as much as a psychiatrist cares about her patients, she needs to maintain some distance—but over time it appears to have affected her personal life as well. 

At its core, A Private Life is built around a cliché—the intellectually imposing individual who must open up—but Foster makes the trope alluring. As a performer, she has often essayed characters battling self-doubt on the way to proving themselves. Recently turned 63, Foster is now perfectly positioned to play accomplished women with more life behind them than in front. When we first meet Lilian, though, she doesn't want to face that reality—it's easier to listen to her clients than to the voices inside her demanding to be heard. A Private Life‘s mystery may underwhelm, but Lilian manages to solve something far more important. Foster cracks that case elegantly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Pathologic 3 weaves gameplay and narrative as tightly as blood and bone","https://www.avclub.com/pathologic-3-story-criticism","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:05:14 GMT","

Daniil Dankovshy is a doctor. Well, a researcher to be exact, an outsider to Pathologic 3's town who has come to trace a rumor of immortality. He arrives only to find his potential subject dead and the town awash in a catastrophic plague. In Pathologic 2, you also play as a doctor—a surgeon, returning to his hometown after years away at medical school. Where Daniil is a total foreigner, Artemy is neither at home nor a stranger. He is mixed race, and every point of the game charts his comfort and discomfort with the indigenous people of the Steppe. Some welcome him, others don't. These two people, these two bodies, interface with the world differently. Though both these games start with similar premises, inhabiting their protagonists reveals just how different they are. In its wedding of mechanical complexity and narrative justification, Pathologic 3 undoes oft-touted binaries of story and play.

Pathologic 3 (available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S) presents itself as a sequel, but it's better described as a parallel experience to its predecessors. In the first Pathologic, you could play as three different characters: the Bachelor (Daniil Dankovsky), the Changeling (Clara), and the Haruspex (Artemy Burakh). Each offered a different perspective on the events at hand, and different mechanics to engage with it. Just as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead offers a tilted view on the events of Hamlet, Pathologic gives three perspectives from which to chart its script. The proceedings appear different depending on where on the stage you are standing.

Due to a combination of budget constraints and slow sales, Pathologic 2 lacked multiple playthroughs. You could only play as Artemy (outside of a short DLC chapter called The Marble Nest); further playthroughs were going to be paid DLC. Thereby, Pathologic 3 is both sequel and fulfillment of that lost promise. If there is a Pathologic 4, I presume you will play as the Changeling.

It is easy to understand each of these characters as clean opposing elements. The Changeling is a full mystic, an unsteady healer with powers she does not fully understand. The Bachelor is all rationality, a head full of facts and a bag full of tools to inscribe those facts upon the world. The Haruspex stands at the intersection of them both, a shaman surgeon with scalpel and potion. Yet, these clean inscriptions of body, mind, and spirit flatten all three. The Changeling is as smug as either of them, constantly chiding them for their inability to see as she does. Just as the Bachelor might push away the “irrationality” of the Steppe and its children, the Changeling finds science all too confining. Ultimately, the Haruspex's split nature cannot last forever. Pathologic 2's unforgettable final choice enshrines him as either a chosen actor of the steppe or a medically trained surgeon forever.

The Bachelor is also a split being, psychologically torn between mania and apathy. While the apparatus of medical care is more directly scientific in his hands, embodying the Bachelor is frightful and emotional. Kicking over a trash can will either grant the motivation to continue on or tip him into madness. You can regulate the Bachelor's emotional state with potions and medications, yet a heated conversation can fully alter his mood, no matter how many shots of morphine you take beforehand. This system creates the impression of moods needing to be harnessed. Mania makes him speedy and quick; apathy turns him docile and slow. Both a steadiness of hand and a frantic mind have their uses. It is only a question of “when” and “how much.”

The approach is still more scientific than Artemy's. While the Haruspex focuses on individual cures and individual lives, the Bachelor creates policies for the town writ large like curfews and quarantines. The Haruspex can sense which of the town's key characters carry the plague, but the Bachelor must diagnose individual cases. While Pathologic 2 is very much like a survival horror game, 3 is more of a interlocking puzzle. Unlike Artemy, the Bachelor needs no food or water. Resources come more readily to him.

This is not to say Pathologic 3 has no resource management, just that it is a little less fleshed out than in its predecessor. Rather than trading for meat and bread, the Bachelor trades for medications and machinery. His “prototype” machine scatters the plague-causing fog with the clean efficiency of a gunshot, while the Haruspex must wander plague districts alone, enduring the mists with sheer force of will. Pathologic 2 was about treating one man's body, cultivating it so that it would survive. Pathologic 3 is about treating the mind, keeping it sane, honing it for the quandaries ahead.

Even combat is more a social negotiation than a desperate struggle for survival in Pathologic 3. No one is scared of Artemy, and they'll attack him no matter what weapon he brandishes, but a doctor from the city like Daniil Dankovsky can disperse crowds with a gunshot in the air. It is the accumulation of details like this that makes Pathologic 3 feel so different from its predecessors—and that's before discussing its most dramatic change.

In Pathologic 2, Artemy moved through linear time. For him, no death was permanent, even if every one narrowed his capabilities. In contrast, The Bachelor flits through both time and space. With some restrictions, he is able to travel between each of the game's 12 days. However, to fly from timeline to timeline costs “Amalgam,” a resource gained by smashing mirrors and achieving goals. Each death also removes “Amalgam,” and if the Bachelor dies without any at hand, he dies forever. If Pathologic 2 is a test of endurance, then Pathologic 3 is a test of cleverness. Evading death as much as possible is quite different than outwitting it.

As a trio of games, Pathologic knots together narrative and play, weaving them so that there is practically no distinction. For lack of a better term, these games are literary. They are florid and flowery, twisting their prose between the branches of an ever-growing tree. Yet they are also grueling, demanding a careful understanding of interlocked systems and a quick-handed pursuit of your goals. These games care about all the forms their rhetoric takes. Between the inertial force genre conventions and capitalistic pressure, it is hard to make games that feel this unified, this whole and considered, but Pathologic 3 is evidence that it's possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A haunted vacuum will break your heart in A Useful Ghost","https://www.avclub.com/a-useful-ghost-review","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:51:02 GMT","

Absurd inanimate object cinema is having a moment. Forget the simplistic joke of killer-tire movie Rubber; the forthcoming indie comedy By Design, the Sundance film from last year where Juliette Lewis “swaps bodies” with a chair, and the Thai fantasy-dramedy A Useful Ghost, where a woman's ghost haunts a vacuum cleaner in order to reconnect with her husband, offer an emotional depth beyond their surreal, spit-take premises. In the latter, debut filmmaker Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke blends Quentin Dupieux's confrontational strangeness, Julio Torres' melancholy whimsy, and Apichatpong Weerasethakul‘s heartfelt supernaturalism into a hilarious, affecting, surprisingly political fable.

Couched in a similarly fantastical and appliance-based frame/love story between a man with a new vacuum (Wisarut Homhuan) and the hunky repairman (Wanlop Rungkumjad) who comes to fix it, the main plot of A Useful Ghost concerns March (Wisarut Himmarat) and his late wife Nat (Davika Hoorne). Recounted as a fable born of a haunted electronics factory—where lax workplace safety standards have led to an influx of semi-vengeful spirits from recently deceased employees—the rekindled affection between March and Nat is just as likely to touch on matters of class politics as it is on the medical consequences of copulating with the business end of a vacuum hose. When Nat's ghost makes her way into a canister vacuum while March is touring the factory, he's sure it's a miracle. For everyone else, it's an episode of My Strange Addiction. 

Shot with a stark, deadpan matter-of-factness, A Useful Ghost‘s style lends itself to goofy reveals played straight. Each time March is caught getting intimate with the machine housing his wife's soul, it's as if American Pie‘s pie-fucking scene carried with it the melancholy of our shared looming deaths. “Guy sticking his dick in a suction device” is a time-honored sex comedy gag, but rarely does the device eventually assume the form of said guy's lost love. Even less common is when the device—thanks to her newfound foothold back in the corporeal plane—becomes more and more visible to the living, getting involved in a plot of cascading exorcisms that reflect the whitewashing of history and the systematic elimination of political undesirables.

In A Useful Ghost, spirits stick around because they're still tied to a living being's memory. This becomes a rich jumping-off point for the story's larger ideas about the haves and the have-nots. The plight of a ghostly underclass—replete with ghost class traitors who collaborate with their fleshy overlords—springs naturally from the idea of a haunted factory, and those in charge are quick to target the minds of the living in order to erase the unflattering remnants of the dead. Military leaders, heads of state, and economic powerhouses all have skeletons in their closets—or dead bodies in the history books that lead back to them. For these unscrupulous Thai figures, ghostbusting-as-cover-up becomes an attractive option. And Nat, a pragmatic specter if nothing else, is quite literally a tool to be used to this end.

As A Useful Ghost sprawls out into more esoteric and ambitious sci-fi, it loses some of the quaint clarity of its focused premise, but Boonbunchachoke's deft wielding of tones is as impressive as his ability to connect this outlandish idea to real-world evils. The relationship between Himmarat's pliable March and Hoorne's steely-eyed, savvy Nat evolves and expands just as A Useful Ghost skillfully mines insight from its initially silly imagery. It's ridiculous to watch a man make out with an upholstery attachment, but it's immediately sobering to watch a haunted vacuum make moral compromises in hope of achieving a better life. Dreamy and striking, A Useful Ghost is far more than its novelty value—and even that doesn't suck.

Reese Witherspoon joined a growing list of celebrities who have warned fans about scammers impersonating her to “manipulate” her fans.

I would never manipulate you. Please check for verification. ❤️

Witherspoon sent a strong warning to her fans after a widespread scam has made her followers vulnerable.

“Hey, this is important. I want to just tell you what I've been dealing with for the past 24 hours,” Witherspoon said in a Wednesday, January 14, TikTok video. “There are multiple people on TikTok and Instagram impersonating me, and they go into people's DMs, and they try to build a relationship. They try to extract personal information, plan meet-up times. I want you to know this is not me.”

The “Sweet Home Alabama” actress, 49, was visibly upset by the fraudsters, as she begged fans to be careful and vigilant.

“It's so upsetting that people would use my name to manipulate people. But I want you to know that I would never ever manipulate you. I would never reach out to you for money, for private information, to create a meet-up time,” she continued. “So please look at these accounts that are doing this and make sure they're verified. This is not just me, this is happening across the board, but it's really upsetting to me that this is happening on such a large scale. So, please be careful out there and please know I would never never reach out to you to manipulate you or to take anything from you, okay?”

Unfortunately, Witherspoon is not the first celebrity to be impersonated by fraudsters. 

Hallmark stars Tyler Hynes, Jonathan Bennett, Tamera Mowry, and BJ Britt, among others, shared a joint statement in October warning fans of online scammers. 

“Hi friends! We care deeply about our fans and we have something very important to tell you,” the group began in a video shared via Instagram at the time. “There's a growing industry-wide problem across social media. Fake (social media) accounts are impersonating actors, reaching out to fans directly with misleading messages.” 

They continued, “It's very important that you know. It's important that you know we will never contact you personally to ask for financial help, donations, or to meet up. If you receive a message like this, it's a scam.”

The group urged viewers to block the suspicious accounts and report them to the platforms. 

The video, which was shared to the official Hallmark Instagram page, added the caption, “We love our Hallmark family — and that means doing our part to raise awareness around scammers, some who are impersonating Hallmark stars. Learn how to spot the signs and protect yourself.”

The woman who claimed a deeply personal connection to music legend Freddie Mercury as his secret daughter has died at 48, following a long and private battle with rare spinal cancer.

As per a report in The Independent, known publicly as Bibi and previously identified only as “B,” she died peacefully after years of illness. Her husband, Thomas, confirmed her passing.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said she left behind two sons, aged 9 and 7. The family lived in France. “B is now with her beloved and loving father in the world of thoughts,” Thomas said. “Her ashes were scattered to the wind over the Alps.”

Bibi's story entered the public eye in 2025 with the release of Love, Freddie, a book by author and journalist Lesley-Ann Jones.

In the book, Bibi claimed she was conceived during a brief relationship between Mercury and a friend's wife in 1976. As per Metro UK, she said she later confirmed her paternity through DNA testing, decades after Mercury's death.

Published in September 2025, the book was reportedly drawn from 17 volumes of personal journals that Bibi said Mercury gave her in 1991, shortly before his death. Mercury died later that year at age 45 from complications related to AIDS.

In one of her final public reflections, Bibi spoke candidly about the emotional weight of growing up with her father's legacy.

“I didn't want to share my Dad with the whole world,” she wrote, as per her emotional statement published by The Metro UK in August 2025. “After his death, I had to learn to live with the attacks against him, the misrepresentations of him, and with the feeling that my Dad now belonged to everyone.”

She added, “I cried and mourned my Dad, while fans all around the world mourned Freddie. When you are 15 years old, it's not easy. I had to become an adult without him, and live all the structuring moments and events without his support.”

The claims prompted widespread debate and skepticism among those closest to Mercury, including members of his inner circle. Mercury's longtime companion and former fiancée, Mary Austin, publicly denied having any knowledge of a secret child.

“The truth is that I am simply not the guardian of such a secret,” Austin said, as reported by The Guardian. “I've never known of any child, or of any diaries. If Freddie had indeed had a child without me knowing anything about it, that would be astonishing to me.”

Austin also said Mercury never spoke about wanting to start a family and believed that his parents would have embraced a child had one existed.

Despite the skepticism surrounding Bibi's claims, author Lesley-Ann Jones said her motivations were deeply personal rather than driven by publicity.

“I am devastated by the loss of this woman who became my close friend,” Jones said, as reported by The Independent. “She had come to me with a selfless aim: to brush aside all those who have had free rein with Freddie's story for 32 years, to challenge their lies and their rewriting of his life, and to deliver the truth.”

Bibi also claimed Mercury referred to her affectionately as his “trésor,” French for treasure, and his “little froggie.” She also claimed that Queen songs, including “Bijou” and “Don't Try So Hard,” were written about her.

In the days following her death, Bibi has been remembered by those closest to her as a devoted mother who carried a complex, deeply personal story tied to one of music's most iconic figures.

Freddy didn't have any kids his cats were his kids. He may have had s#x with a woman (Mary) but didn't produce any babies. Freddy was gay and didn't want any kids. If he did he would have had one or a couple with Mary but he never did.

How do you know what makes you the expert do you have ESP … People always have something to say when they know nothing but what they think and that means nothing with out proof so it is nothing but conjecture you know nothing you just think

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Candace Cameron Bure Bravely Opens Up About Marriage 'Lows' in Relatable, Honest Confession","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/candace-cameron-bure-valeri-marriage/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:57:21 GMT","

Former Hallmark star Candace Cameron Bure recently opened up about the hardships she's faced in her marriage to Valeri Bure.

“Val and I next year will be 30 years married, and it's definitely been a roller-coaster,” Cameron Bure told co-host Madi Prewett during the Tuesday, January 13, episode of “The Candace Cameron Bure Podcast” when asked if she's ever felt “stuck.”

The “Christmas Under Wraps” actress revealed there have been “lots of highs and there's been some really low lows” throughout her relationship with her husband. “And I know that during some of those low times, I wouldn't even say it's low,” she said. “You're just kind of, like, sitting in the shallow of the valley. Where you're like, ‘This isn't the best, but that's just life.' We'll just kind of go through it.”

“You just feel stuck, and yet, for us, we didn't have either the confidence or just the straight-up courage to be honest enough with each other to say the really hard things because I know they're gonna hurt your feelings and I know you're gonna hurt my feelings by hearing it, by saying it. Those have been stuck moments in my life, and then sometimes you got to reach the pit to get pulled out of it and kind of hit the bottom of that. I know that we can feel stuck. We want to get unstuck,” she continued.

Cameron Bure said she has felt “that nagging feeling, and you just know that something's just not right, but you can't quite put your finger on it.”

“You know that you want your life to change, but you don't know where to start,” Cameron Bure explained. “You don't even know what to look for and what move to start making, and then when you do have a family, you have a husband, have kids, it's like, again, I just know that something isn't right in my life, and I want to move it over on a different track, but how do I start, and how do I get my family on that track?”

In the past, Cameron Bure has explained how her son Lev helped her and her husband overcome some of the challenges in their marriage. 

“Val and I went through a really, really rough season in our marriage,” Cameron Bure admitted during a July 2025 episode of her podcast. “And we were like, ‘I don't know, don't think … we're gonna make it through.' But at one point, Lev preached, like, a 45-minute sermon on marriage to us. Just had his Bible open on the couch and just talked about it.”

“And I'll never forget, 'cause he said, ‘You know, I know I haven't been married. I'm just a young kid,'” Cameron Bure said. “‘And so it's probably hard to take marriage advice from someone this young [who] never experienced it before. But I don't need to be married to know what the word of God says.'”

Cameron Bure said Lev “was such a calm voice that had so much wisdom behind it,” reiterating to her and Bure that they “raised some pretty good kids.”

According to Us Weekly, Cameron Bure and the Winter Olympics medalist were originally set up by her “Full House” co-star Dave Coulier. “[Lori Loughlin and I] were looking at these two cute men on the ice, and I was like, ‘I wanna meet that one, the blonde one,' which was Val,” Cameron Bure recalled during a 2014 interview. “We went on a date the very next day, and in less than a year we were engaged.”

The pair tied the knot on June 22, 1996, and they expanded their family with kids Natasha, Lev, and Maksim.

There's nothing brave about her. The fact that this brainwashed clown still gets a platform to spew her garbo is inexcusable.

I completely agree.   As a devout Christian, I so resent pretend ones like her who use the religion to judge and spew bigotry.

No sympathy for a bigot like her.

Please, Hallmark–stop articles about her.  She does not embody Hallmark or Christian values.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How Tommy Lee Jones Tried to Save His Daughter Victoria Before She Passed","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/tommy-lee-jones-daughter-victoria/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 02:27:58 GMT","

Tommy Lee Jones, 79, reportedly made a big legal move to try to protect his daughter, Victoria Jones, before her untimely death on Jan. 1, when she was found unresponsive at the Fairmont San Francisco Hotel. 

According to court records obtained by People, the Oscar Award winner filed to place Victoria on a conservatorship, which requires the person to follow a set of rules based on their personal and care needs, decided by their appointed guardian, regardless of their age.

In the docket entries from Marin County Superior Court, Jones filed a petition on Aug. 7, 2023, to place a temporary conservatorship over Victoria, who was 31 years old at the time.

People reported that the court index reveals how the “Black Moon Rising” actor submitted a “Petition for Appointment of Temporary Conservator of the Person.”

With that, Jones included supporting declarations. He also submitted an ex parte application, meaning the person who is filed against does not need to be aware of the filing on the grounds of an emergency situation.

Within days, a judge approved the request and appointed a professional temporary conservator to oversee Victoria's personal care. Further docket entries revealed that the conservatorship was later extended on a short-term basis.

The docket didn't specify the circumstances that led Jones to file for a conservatorship. Medical and hospital records, as well as the contents of the court-submitted declarations, were also unavailable, as such documents are, in most cases, confidential in conservatorship filings.

After Victoria's death at the age of 34, TMZ obtained Broadcastify dispatch audio from the 911 call placed to authorities. The audio said that a “code 3 for the overdose, color change” was ordered.

Since her tragic passing on New Year's Day, Jones has been seen in public, appearing downcast as he walked with his wife, Dawn Laurel-Jones, in San Antonio, Texas, nearly two weeks later.

Having made attempts to protect Victoria from her unexpected fate, the “Men in Black” actor is said to be handling her death the best he can. A source close to the family told Daily Mail that Jones is “not himself right now,” adding, “Tommy is heartbroken. For a tough guy and one that usually has it all together, the stress of losing a child has clearly hit him like a ton of bricks.”

Amy Schumer is using her platform to rally support for the family of late musician John Forté, following his sudden death at age 50. In a heartfelt message shared with fans, Schumer urged anyone who had posted tributes to Forté to also share his GoFundMe link, stressing that his family needs immediate help.

Schumer called on fans to turn their tributes into action, urging anyone who posted about John to share his GoFundMe link and help support his two young children, including covering funeral costs. 

She revealed she has donated $20,000 and encouraged others to give generously in honor of what she described as “one of the most incredible humans and artists who ever lived.”

“If you posted about John, please consider adding his go fund me link to your page. His amazing friends include @mslaurynhill @wyclefjean and on and on. He has 2 young kids that need help and even to cover funeral costs. I have donated 20k all together. Let's dig deep and give what we can in memory of one of the most incredible humans and artists who ever lived.”

Schumer had earlier shared her shock and grief upon learning of Forté's passing, drawing attention to the GoFundMe campaign created to support his children.

“Woke up to the news of the prolific and beautiful @john_forte passing away yesterday. Please look out for a go fund me link for his family. 2 young kids. Link to gofundme here and in bio: https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-john-fortes-children”

Her posts quickly amplified efforts to raise funds for Forté's family, helping connect fans and fellow artists to come together and offer support during a tough time.

Forté was widely admired for his contributions to music and for the generosity he consistently showed within his community. Martha's Vineyard Times reported that he took immense pride in being a father and found deep joy in raising his children.

Friends and collaborators have remembered Forté for his empathy and warmth, qualities that defined him as much as his artistic work. 

Schumer's messages highlighted the deeply personal side of his life, reminding fans that, beyond the music, he was a devoted parent whose family now feels his loss most deeply.

As tributes continue to arrive from across the entertainment and music worlds, Schumer's appeal has helped channel shared grief into meaningful action. Her message underscored that honoring Forté's legacy means standing beside the people he loved most.

In the days since his death, Forté has been remembered not only as a prolific and influential artist, but as a devoted father whose absence has left an immeasurable loss for his children, friends and the community that surrounded him.

There's no shortage of acclaimed movies at film festivals that fail to find distribution. We remind people of just how many there are every season. But, as of late, the enterprising producers behind some of these titles have found more creative ways to get their movies out to the public. 

One such movie, “Ricky,” is doing just that.

“Ricky,” director Rashad Frett's film that won the Sundance Directing Award at last year's Sundance, is going the self-distribution route and will be released theatrically on March 20, 2026, IndieWire can reveal exclusively. Though the producers of “Ricky” are partnering with Blue Harbor Entertainment to help facilitate the release, with the film opening in select cities, it is a true independent release with the filmmakers retaining the movie's rights.

Today, they're launching a Kickstarter campaign to help support its release effort, offering the chance for audiences to gift tickets to at-risk organizations and communities. Find the fundraiser here, and watch the first trailer for the film above.

“Ricky” had plenty of enthusiasm and interest coming out of Sundance. IndieWire's review out of the festival called first-time director Frett a “major force” to watch. And though it attracted some distribution offers, Steelo Brim, a producer on “Ricky,” told IndieWire that none of the options were quite right. It's a project that he and his partners put their “heart and soul” into, and they didn't want to see its rights tied up for the next 20 years.

“None of them felt right or like they had our best interests at heart. We wanted our voice and messaging to be as pure or real to the independent audience,” Brim told IndieWire. “I know we're in a super blessed position to be able to independently release. I think about getting creative around it, and looking at the industry and the current landscape, and I feel like we have to get creative in the industry if we want to stay alive, not just with our camera and scripts, but with how we distribute and how we market and how we get our art out to the masses. Because if we don't do that, then independent film will die.”

“Ricky” stars Stephan James (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Sheryl Lee Ralph (“Abbott Elementary”), and Titus Welliver, and it's a film about a 30-year-old ex-offender now navigating life after 15 years in incarceration. The film explores the threat of recidivism and how few resources the title character is offered after he leaves prison despite having spent his entire adult life there, making finding stability even more difficult and out of reach. 

 










“This all-too-familiar premise might lend itself to melodrama, but ‘Ricky' emerges as a marvelously understated examination of one man's struggle to achieve stability,” IndieWire's review reads. “Frett and Lin Que Ayoung's nuanced script mines rich specifics from the tropes of its story, as the film delves into Hartford's Caribbean American community with the same attention to detail that it explores post-prison life and the threat of recidivism.”

Brim says that given the film's subject matter, “Ricky” has a very specific audience that needed to be targeted to inner cities and other at-risk communities, and it would be much more impactful there than at an art house theater in Oklahoma.

“We were with a whole different company and committed to them, and we realized in our early stages that a copy and pasting of a traditional marketing strategy or plan wouldn't be enough for this film,” Brim said. “I wanted to make sure that this film could touch the right people in the right communities that are impacted most by the judicial system or our imprisonment system.”

In order to reach that group, the Kickstarter will give backers who donate tickets the chance to participate in virtual Q&As with Frett and Que Ayoung, receive signed posters, and will have their names added to the credits. Backers can also host private virtual screenings or provide access directly to other organizations, as well as buy out an entire theater for audiences who wouldn't otherwise get to see the film. Brim is working with Kickstarter and Fandango to make sure funds are allocated evenly across markets, and the more pre-sales the film receives, the longer it can hope to remain in theaters.

 










“Ricky” is opening in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Oakland, Atlanta, Memphis, Houston, Kansas City, Detroit, Chicago, and other cities.

James, at IndieWire's Sundance Studio last year, described why “Ricky” was so timely and important, especially for audiences who may be in a similar situation as his character.

“Ms. Ralph has a line in the film where she says ‘He's been out for 21 days, and he'll be lucky to make it to 30,'” James said. “And that line really hit home for me, because every day is a victory in itself. Every day that you can just survive another day and have the opportunity to get work, to normalize your life. People don't realize the daily obstacles that people in that position really have to go through.”

“This film resonates far beyond incarceration,” Frett added in a statement. “Whether someone has lived that experience or simply recognizes their own struggle in Ricky's journey, our goal is to spark real conversations about re-entry, resilience, and the human cost of starting over. At the same time, we want to shine a light on the state of independent filmmaking itself — an art form at risk in today's industry. That's why we chose to take the film's future into our own hands and put audiences at the center of this journey.”

 










The film is produced by Steelo Brim, DC Wade, Josh Peters, Pierre Coleman, Simon Taufique, and Mark Steele, in association with Ossetra Films. James and Bay Mills Studios are executive producers on the project. Blue Harbor Entertainment, which launched in 2023, is handling all U.S. rights for “Ricky.”

2025 was the year of Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” but 2026 is all about The Bride.

Maggie Gyllenhaal‘s sophomore directorial effort, which reimagines “The Bride of Frankenstein” with a punk rock twist and an A-list cast that includes Jessie Buckley as the eponymous Bride and Christian Bale as Frankenstein's monster, was always destined to be one of the most anticipated films of the year. Then factor in an ensemble including Peter Sarsgaard, Annette Bening, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Penélope Cruz, and the fact that Warner Bros. seems to be on an unstoppable winning streak, and suddenly you have a can't-miss movie event on your hands.

During a virtual press conference on Tuesday, January 13, Gyllenhaal explained how her vision for the film stemmed from the visceral impact that star Elsa Lanchester left on audiences in the 1935 film “The Bride of Frankenstein” despite having a relatively small amount of screen time.

“Elsa Lanchester, the original Bride of Frankenstein, just has this impact. The way she looks. … Something about her is formidable. And then I watched the movie, which I hadn't seen, and I realized she doesn't speak,” Gyllenhaal said. “What I thought was really interesting was here's this movie called The Bride of Frankenstein, which is really not in any way about The Bride of Frankenstein, and yet Elsa Lanchester makes this impact, even though she's in the movie for three minutes and doesn't speak. Why? Well, because she's kinda badass.”

 










The director also explained that her film attempts to fill some of the narrative gaps in the original “Bride of Frankenstein,” namely what she sees as a lack of agency for the titular character. 

“In many iterations, Frankenstein is a monster of course, who does monstrous, awful things, but he's also beautiful, human, kind and so lonely. So his ask for a mate, which is part of the book, which is part of the mythology, is really understandable,” she said. “But at the same time, what about the mate? He's asking to have someone brought back from the dead to be his girlfriend. Well, what about her? And that's what this movie, I think, really gets into. What if she comes back and she has her own needs and her own agenda and her own wants and her own terrors.”

Warner Bros. will release “The Bride” in theaters on Friday, March 6. Watch the film's newest trailer below.

The oft-cited story of how Kate Hudson came to play Claire Sardina in “Song Sung Blue” is a good one. As it goes, her eventual co-star Hugh Jackman saw Hudson performing and chatting on “CBS Sunday Morning” in 2024, where the actress and Oscar nominee was promoting her soon-to-be-released solo album, “Glorious.” Jackman, who was already on board to star as Mike Sardina in Craig Brewer's fact-based film, was so taken by Hudson's energy (and singing!) that he immediately texted Brewer that he had found their Claire.

The real story of how Hudson found her way to the role is a bit more complicated. It's not just about the film itself (a crowdpleaser with real drama, plus a ton of Neil Diamond songs), but Hudson's own path through Hollywood, her long-burning desire to mount a singing career in tandem with her acting, and a years-ago decision to start pursuing the stuff she had long felt was unavailable to her.

Speaking to IndieWire via Zoom during the busy days between the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, Hudson is just what you'd expect: warm, chatty, effusive, insightful, and smart. She's easy to talk to, open to all sorts of questions, and reflective in a way that never feels harsh. And she is reflective.

 










While the role of Claire (aka “Thunder” in the Sardinas' Neil Diamond cover act, “Thunder and Lightning”) found its way to her, Hudson said she was “always” hopeful for acting parts that could include singing. The big barrier? Herself.

“One of my fears was like, ‘Oh, I'm going to make a record, and I'm going to put some music out, and then it's like, therefore, I'm not acting anymore,'” she said. “Back in the ‘Almost Famous' days, you didn't cross [into another type of entertainment] because it was like, if you failed, it was a failure in everything. So don't break what's not broken. It made me timid to put anything out there like that. … After COVID, I was like, I'm really waiting for someone else to get permission to do a movie that is a big musical, and then I could come in from the back door and do my album, because then it would be a little bit easier to sort of cross.”

The early days of the pandemic gave Hudson, like many people, lots of time to think about her life and what she wanted from it, what she hadn't done yet, and how she might change things around when the world opened back up.

“Even bigger than just music, it was like I just had this whole existential crisis, which I think most of the world did, where you're like, ‘What does my life mean?'” she said. “I knew I was happy with my family life, and that is so important to me, and it's always been my priority, but my creative output is something that is my fuel. It's my passion. And I was not satisfied with it. It was like, no, if I died tomorrow, I haven't put everything out on the table.”

 










Hudson forged ahead, not even needing a little follow-up query as to why she wasn't putting everything out on the table. She's thought about this a lot. She's comfortable with it. She owns it.

“If I'm not putting everything out on the table, it's because I'm afraid to,” she said. “Some of that is my fear of being on stage. I had a massive fear of singing on stage. I've always had people want to invite me into music, and I was always just too afraid to do it. Once I did the album, it was exercising new muscles, like finding my feet on a live stage or [thinking about] who am I in my most vulnerable state, which is sharing my music, not playing a character. What is it to be on a stage to try to entertain, but have it come from the most honest place? These were all things I'd never done.”

The response to Hudson's musical career “was so warm and so lovely” that she realized she really didn't have anything to fear. “And then it changed my life,” she said. “It didn't feel like something was missing anymore. And then this movie came along, and it was like, oh, it's almost like, energetically, those are the things that start to happen when you make different choices for yourself.”

Hudson, ever family-oriented, is also quick to note the impact of these choices on her three kids. “If I know that my kids know what I'm scared of, and I'm not actually facing it and doing it, then that's how I'm modeling what it is to be a creative person,” she said. “I have incredibly creative kids that I want to see make huge mistakes because they take big risks.”

 










Family and legacy and gifts come up a lot in conversation with Hudson. She's never tried to rebuff her nepo baby status. She's happily grown up in the industry. If she's celebrating something, her family is there, too. At the New York City premiere party for “Song Sung Blue” in December, her mother Goldie Hawn and stepfather Kurt Russell seemed to be in every room I walked through. Her fiance, Danny Fujikawa, beamed at the stage when she, Jackman, Brewer, and the real Claire Sardina sang some Neil Diamond songs early in the evening. Eldest son Ryder Robinson mixed and mingled with the crowd.

And, as we talked more, Hudson reached even further back in her life and lineage to try to explain just how deeply rooted her musical passions are. “Music is so funny because, for me, it's my Hudson side. The Italian Hudsons, our family folklore is all musical,” she said. “All my Sicilian grannies were all incredibly musical. As someone who wasn't raised by my dad, didn't know him very well, it was something that was very isolating for me. I had to teach myself, I had to learn it myself, it wasn't like I had a family of musicians. I sat in my room and had to discover my own musical heroes. I'd sit at the piano, and I'd write music, and I'd write lyrics in my room.”

 










Hudson said she didn't realize any of this until she later connected with her father, Bill Hudson, who was a musician and actor and even had his own band with his two brothers. “I didn't realize it was my dad until I got older,” she said. ‘Oh, I have the Hudson thing. Right!' It was in me the whole time.”

“Song Sung Blue” follows the incredible true story of another musical family. When the film opens, Hudson's Claire Stingl is a Patsy Cline impersonator, Jackman's Mike Sardina is a Don Ho impersonator, and the pair meet cute at the Wisconsin State Fair, where they are both performing. Claire suggests to Mike he might consider the works of Neil Diamond for a new show, and soon enough, the pair are singing some of his most beloved anthems together, and falling in love while doing so.

That the duo eventually formed the popular tribute duo Lightning and Thunder, got married, enjoyed some so good! so good! so good! times, and then some so bad! so bad! so genuinely very heartbreakingly bad! times has been covered before. Greg Kohs' 2008 documentary of the same name captivated Brewer years ago, and it serves as a wonderful basis for his fictionalized film. It's also the same place Hudson first “met” Claire Stingl Sardina.

“I feel like I met her in my mind. I watched that documentary so much, I felt like I knew her intimately, and I was very emotional when she came to set,” Hudson said of finally meeting the real Sardina. “I'm sitting there with my hair, and she has her hair, and I've got my [prosthetic] leg on at times, and she has her real one,” she said with a laugh. “I think it must have felt like a bit out of body for her, because I don't think a thing like this was ever something that she would've thought would've happened in her life. She was just the best and everybody came out and cheered for her when she came on set. She was just so happy.”

 










The process of singing as Claire was one that delighted Hudson. Asked about how she did it, she lights up even more. This is the nerdy stuff she loves to chat about, a long-awaited marriage of her acting and her singing.

“There's certain things, certain notes and stuff, that you can't manipulate,” she said. “There's some people who are real vocal technicians, I don't see myself like that, that can really manipulate their voice and stuff. I'm a much more instinctual singer. Honestly, I'm really more of a background vocalist in this. When I'm singing with Hugh, it's really more about how I can support him. And then when I'm doing the Patsy Cline songs, it's just trying to get some sense of enough of Patsy to where it sounds like it feels like I'm impersonating that. That's like an ear thing, I guess. You have to be able to hear it, and then you listen back and you cringe a couple times and redo it a thousand times and then hopefully get it right.”

The response to the film, which came out over the Christmas holiday after an AFI Fest premiere, has been strong. So has Hudson's work in it, which has netted her both a Golden Globe and an Actor nomination, and will likely bring her back into the Oscar fray. All that aside, Hudson really delights in how the film is making people feel.
 










“It's a reminder of the films that people who love filmmaking have kind of missed, stories that feel super-honest, super-connected, nostalgic, make you think about your own life, that hit on themes that are about family and real love and relationships and that aren't cynical,” she said. “It sort of walks this great line of going to very dark places, but also remaining entertaining and gentle enough for people to feel like we can get through anything, that the human spirit is incredibly resilient, and that with very dark moments and tragedies, there is light and there is hope.”

The lessons of Claire's life have stuck with Hudson. You really can make the life you want. It will be hard, it will be painful, but it's not something to be afraid of. 

“I'm seeing people's reactions [after they see the film], and they come up to me, it's like it hits something deeper in them emotionally,” the actress said. “It makes them think about their own life, the people they love, how short life really is, what does it all mean? It makes you love the life that you know that you're the narrator of. It's like, wait, I can love this life. No matter what it's presented to me, I can choose to love it and live it to its fullest. I haven't seen something like that in a long time. And, every once in a while, if you get to have an experience like this in your career? I don't take a second of that for granted.”

Here's the recipe for a good Coke Wave mixtape: First, add one French Montana, but make sure he's spitting with the hunger of a Bronx hustler ready to bet every last wad of cash in his jeans on a rap battle. Then, carefully fold in Harlemite Max B and add a healthy dash of Grand Cru Remy Martin. While he'll surely heat up with bars indebted to the styles of Biggie, Jay-Z, and Tupac, that extra dash of sauce will have him singing melodies like he's giving a drunken Motown audition in another lifetime. Finally, marinate their sleazy bars and catchy hooks in beats that transform 20th-century classics—the kind heard at retirement home parties—into headknocking bangers. Soon, you'll have Max B pouring his heart into a melodic street rap ballad that channels the soul of a '60s Marlena Shaw record, while Frenchy cooly raps about moving bricks over a Dark Side of the Moon flip.

All this propelled the deliriously fun and hard-nosed duo to the crest of New York rap in the late 2000s, before the wave crashed with Max B's incarceration in 2009. Coke Wave 3.5: Narcos, the second album Max B has released since he walked free in November, reignites the infectious dynamic between Max and French but doesn't surf on legacy. It captures what made one of New York hip-hop's greatest link-ups so captivating, but also calls into question why they would break away from the distinct “wavy” strain of rap they claimed in the first place.

The duo's chemistry shines on standouts like “Whippin That Wave,” where they flow effortlessly (and shamelessly) over DJ Clue's 1998 “Queensfinest” instrumental for Nas with the same confidence shown on Coke Wave 2's “Wave Thang”—a harder take on Dre and Snoop's classic for Uptown dudes with four Pelle Pelle jackets in their closets. But when they attempt to flex over a sample of KC & the Sunshine Band's disco classic “That's The Way (I Like It)” on “Ever Since U Left Me,” they lose sync with one another and rap aimlessly on a beat that sounds like cliché fashion catwalk music.

French Montana has long approached hip-hop like an A&R hunting for the next hit; it's a skill he honed years before he scored a chart-topping Afrobeats-inspired single largely carried by Swae Lee's vocals. But back in the aughts, when he was inserting himself into his own Cocaine City DVDs, he knew how to hold his ground beside a killer freestyle by Uptown rapper Al-Doe or raw footage of Dipset getting jumped at Rucker Park. On this tape French finds himself back in that DVD-mixtape era pocket on “Heaven,” but he loses it on “Make America Wavy Again (MAWA),” where he attempts to engineer a tri-state nightclub banger that fizzles faster than a $500 bottle of Champagne. And while a Murda Beatz trap beat may have worked for French and Drake a decade ago on their hit “No Shopping,” it leaves his brother Max stumbling on “The Race.”

Outside of a handful of moments when this duo seamlessly clicks together again, the album's highs arrive when Max proves that his once-mythic return is worth celebrating, and not just with a hashtag or a shoutout from the rappers he's influenced. Sure, the Dame Grease-produced “I Don't Know,” one of this album's best songs, is essentially a re-run of “DJ Saved My Life” from his 2009 Quarantine mixtape. But it doesn't come off like an awkward bid to recapture past magic, like when Eminem's 2024 single “Houdini” interpolated the “Without Me”-era Slim Shady persona that's no longer authentic to him. Max B just sounds like he's picking up where he left off with his confidence intact.

It's great that Coke Wave 3.5 exists, and even better that it doesn't sound like Max and French forgot about their illustrious past, the way 2019's fleeting Coke Wave 4 did. But what's most refreshing is witnessing Max B finally get the opportunity to grow his trademark sound beyond prison walls. His chance arrives on the potent “Sunday School,” where he sings about his first love and his life journey with a level of introspection only hinted at in older cuts like “Lord Is Tryna Tell You Somethin.” Building on the risqué soulfulness of records like “Sexy Love,” it feels like the kind of song the late A$AP Yams dreamed of when he vowed to hire Biggaveli to perform at his own wedding one day. Over 15 years after their original Coke Wave run, French Montana and Max B's music has traveled far beyond New York's hip-hop faithful. Their efforts to chase that broader audience on Coke Wave 3.5 don't always land, but the album's best moments reaffirm what evangelized them in the first place.

In the five years that they've been active, it sometimes seems as if Purelink are dissolving right before our eyes. They've never again released anything quite as corporeal or propulsive as their debut EP, which paired visceral dub techno with rolling drum'n'bass. On their 2023 debut album, Signs, glitchy drums crackled in a pastel haze, and last year's Faith was even more ethereal; the trio's individual identities melted together under cover of amorphous arrangements that suggested fogbanks, blizzards, and other zero-visibility conditions.

Anyone who has seen Purelink live, however, knows how much physical heft they're capable of conjuring—a bold, bassy throb that sets bodies in motion even in the absence of obvious dance-music signifiers. Their sets may begin in the muggy tropics of their recorded work, but they turn into full-on affairs. A new live cassette stakes out a position somewhere in the middle of Purelink's opposing tendencies, balancing their ambient inclinations with heavyweight bass and some surprisingly forceful rhythms.

Rather than replicating a particular show in its entirety, Live is collaged together out of discrete moments from the trio's 2024 U.S. tour. That means that its structure doesn't really replicate the forward motion of their shows; instead, it wanders a little, more like a mixtape, but that sensation of drift is also part of its charm.

Side A begins with nearly eight minutes of shape-shifting ambience—fuzzed-out chords, rapid-fire trills, the clatter of what sound like small objects being jostled together. The mood is emotionally ambiguous, and adaptable to your own state of mind—chilled or faintly chilling, depending. Things soon intensify with the entrance of thudding kick-drum patterns, while convoluted delay chains beckon down dubby rabbit holes.

The A-side's untitled selections are said to be versions of Signs tracks as well as remixes of songs by friends and peers, but given the gaseous sprawl and blunted mood, it would be hard to identify anything with much certainty. As tracks morph from skeletal dub techno to scratchy IDM, certain sounds repeat themselves: a faraway whistle, like a train in the distance; a quick metallic oscillation, like a coin spinning on a countertop. But there's no knowing where a given sound comes from; is that a contact-miked yo-yo, an electric toothbrush, a cello (all devices they've described using in the studio)?

The B-side gathers a selection of unreleased material, and much of it unexpectedly songful. It's still ambient, still built atop minimalist drum patterns, still swathed in seemingly endless reverb and delay. But this time, the dub basslines are more pronounced, and some of the group's instruments assume sharper focus: electric guitar and bass, piano, even what I think might be a saxophone. Many of these tracks show a considerable debt to the atmospheric post-rock of the Kranky label, and even to Tortoise—both reminders of Purelink's own Chicago roots.

In these more melodic moments, Live suggests as-yet-unexplored directions for Purelink. The horizontal boom-bap of the B-side's conclusion is a particularly intriguing proposition. But the album's most unexpected moment comes three quarters of the way through the A-side. On initial listens, I wasn't sure what I was hearing; it sounded like weeping, which seemed an odd and disturbing choice for such otherwise laid-back music. Only on subsequent repeats did I realize that the sound is actually the slowed-down laughter of someone absolutely losing their mind. Listen closely, and a short story reveals itself: “Come on, guys,” pleads a different slowed-down voice, sounding peeved. “You can't be smoking a J on your way to a school soccer game!” The laughing voices—the J-smokers, presumably—offer their apologies before collapsing back into breathless giggles. (“Smoking a J,” one of them snickers, barely able to contain her amusement at the reprimand.) I have no idea what the backstory of this exchange might be, or what it has to do with Purelink. But in the context of Live, it's a reminder that, however skilled they may be at reducing their music to an abstract blur, they've also got some delightful surprises up their sleeve.

A new documentary on Robert Christgau, The Last Critic, will premiere at SXSW Film Festival this March. Randy Newman, Boots Riley, and Village Voice writer-turned-novelist Colson Whitehead have signed up to tell the story of the self-appointed Dean of American Rock Critics. Naturally, having penned “I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick,” Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore also chips in to help immortalize his onetime foe.

Matty Wishnow directed the doc, which features music from Newman, Yo la Tengo, the Feelies, and Gina Birch. A murderer's row of critics also contributed, including Greil Marcus, Ann Powers, Rob Sheffield, Amanda Petrusich, and Kelefa Sanneh. A synopsis on the film's Instagram page notes that Christgau, whose work “has inspired & infuriated readers for sixty years, is still at it in his eighties—grading records, interrogating commas & listening to absolutely everything (except metal & prog).” Its SXSW premiere will be in the Documentary Feature Competition.

7.9

Genre:

Rock

Label:

self-released

Reviewed:

January 15, 2026

If political art becomes more timely post-release, it's usually because the injustices it addresses began long before they rose to broader public consciousness. When Slut Intent introduced themselves as Minneapolis' newest “hardcore girl band” mere days into 2024, Renee Good was still alive and all four cops convicted in George Floyd's murder were locked in prison. The band's first song, “Peppa Pig,” dropped that March, but its howls of derision about cruelty and betrayal ring even clearer today. That's doubly true of Slutworld; the quintet's debut is a raging slab of punk that's powerful on its own and hits like a baseball bat when swung in defense against the people who would try to pin you, your loved ones, and your neighbors to the ground.

Slut Intent know two things to be true: Community is everything, and when the time comes, you probably have to fend for yourself. On Slutworld, all five members—singer Katy Kelly, guitarists Elena Bittner and Kailyn Grider, bassist Astrid Pulse, and drummer Cara Hagstrom-Skalnek—make a deafening thrash, refusing to stay still or silent in the face of hostility. They can talk your ear off about Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and the murder mysteries of The Traitors as readily as they can the blood-stained hands of billionaires in “Slut Internet” or the dire fight for bodily autonomy in “Bonkers Even.” Kelly pins rape apologists against the wall and forces them to own up on “Acrylics,” where a single melodic hardcore breakdown sends a shiver down your spine. Slut Intent never hesitate to illustrate their brute force in the music.

On “Glitch,” Kelly confronts masked intruders as they storm the city with impunity, clocking how their actions fan the flames. “So desperate to retain/Power and control/But you'll never feel safe/'Cause it's not your home,” she spits in their faces. The syncopated drum hits that arrive in the song's dropout offer her a fleeting second to catch her breath before charging back. “We brought the matches/To a world you filled with gasoline,” she sneers over the album's harshest metalcore guitars.

Slutworld is visceral not just in its indignation, but its visualized threats, the majority of which take an “eye for an eye” approach. As the taste of spite coats her mouth in “Slut Internet,” Kelly spits out a warning: “If they're going to balance every human need on a knife's edge/They should remember it cuts both ways.” If the cops shove civilian faces into the scalding pavement, ignore their screams, and watch blood trickle down their cheek, Kelly promises her tormentor that she'll do the same to them. “You took my life and now I'll take yours,” she screams on “Mr. Chariot” as her bandmates pummel a hardcore beat into the dirt. With tired breaths, she tacks on a guttural “Fuck!” Revenge is exhausting work.

It's clear Slut Intent believe that the world is beyond fucked, but it's not unfixable, particularly if your bucket of cleaning supplies happens to come with a lighter and a balaclava, too. “Girls Night” sets the scene: crowds clamoring on executives' rolled-sod lawns, setting fire to weaponized police cars, scrapping the invented rules that keep power unchecked. There's nothing to lose when you can't afford to pay the bills. Slut Intent chose this track, their bluntest call to action, to conclude Slutworld. “The songs unheard/Will bring us something better,” Kelly promises those with muffled voices. With that, she swings the microphone their way and cranks the volume.

Ed Sheeran brought “Drive” to Jimmy Kimmel Live with a little help from his friends. The singer was joined by Dave Grohl, John Mayer, Blake Slatkin, Rami Jaffee, and Pino Palladino for a rousing performance of the track, written for the Brad Pitt film F1. 


	The all-star group showcased the rock track with clips from the movie playing behind them on dual screens. Mayer accompanied Sheeran on guitar while Grohl took on the drums. Two back-up singers also joined for the harmonies. 


	“Drive” appeared on F1 the Album, which arrived alongside the film's release in June. It featured feature 17 tracks, including contributions from Sheeran, Doja Cat, Burna Boy, Raye, Tate McRae, Don Toliver, Madison Beer, Rosé, Tiësto, and Chris Stapleton. Sheeran teased his track ahead of the release, noting that he had “a lot of fun making” the song alongside Grohl and Mayer. 


	Sheeran's most recent studio album, Play, arrived in September.  The LP was recorded in all the different locations the singer-songwriter visited and completed in Goa, India. “Play was an album that was made as a direct response to the darkest period of my life,” Sheeran shared in a statement. “Coming out of all of that I just wanted to create joy and technicolour, and explore cultures in the countries I was touring.”

Play marked the first installment in a new series of albums from Sheeran. It will be followed by Rewind, Fast-Forward, and Stop, continuing the tradition he started with Plus, Multiply, Divide, Subtract, and Equals.












	In November, the singer debuted a Netflix special, One Shot With Ed Sheeran, shot with Adolescence director Philip Barantini. The short film shows the singer walking through New York City in real time, playing his songs on subway cars and various spots around the city, and leaving a trail of stunned fans in his wake.

Blackpink will release their new mini album, Deadline, on Feb. 27 via YG Entertainment. The album shares its name with the group's current world tour. 


Deadline marks Blackpink's third mini album following 2018's Square Up and 2019's Kill This Love. Their most recent full-length album, Born Pink, arrived in 2022. The group teased the release in a short video on social media, although they have not confirmed the track list as of yet. 


	The mini album will presumably include “Jump,” Blackpink's comeback single, released in July. For the single, the quartet of Jisoo, Jenny, Rosé, and Lisa enlisted an army of songwriters — TEDDY, Diplo, 24, Zikai, Claudia Valentina, Jumpa, Malachiii, and Jesse Bluu. The track was produced by Diplo, 24, Boaz Van De Beatz , Zecca, and Ape Drums.

	President Donald Trump's promise that “help is on its way” for anti-government protesters in Iran appears to be increasingly at odds with realities on the ground, and the administration's desire for an easy foreign policy win — or regime change in Tehran — remains elusive.


	As large-scale protests have gained momentum in Iran amid a near-total information blackout, fragmentary evidence indicates the demonstrations have been crushed in a bloody crackdown by Iran's security forces.


	“The low estimate for the number of people killed is 2,000. The high estimate today [Jan. 14] is 15,000,” says Farzan Sabet, a researcher focused on the Middle East at the Global Governance Center, who runs the blog Iran Wonk. “They're also lining up to do mass executions.”


	Amid rumors that American military strikes were imminent, Trump told journalists Wednesday that “We have been informed by very important sources on the other side that the killing has stopped and executions won't take place,” later adding: “I hope it's true. Who knows.”

	











	Whether this means the U.S. has ruled out military action for now is unclear. Unpredictability is a feature, not a bug, of this administration's foreign policy. Trump previously pulled a bait-and-switch on Iran in June last year, promising a week-long window for diplomacy, only to carry out “Operation Midnight Hammer” against the country's nuclear program hours later.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The protests, which began weeks ago over deteriorating living conditions and economic hardship, grew in size after outside voices endorsed the demonstrations.

	











	On Jan. 6, Reza Pahlavi — the son of the former shah of Iran, who lives in the United States as a dissident-in-exile — released an Instagram post declaring his support for the protests. “Despite the regime's ongoing violent crackdown, you are resisting, and it is inspiring,” Pahlavi said, calling on demonstrators to gather on the following Thursday and Friday and start chanting at 8pm. “Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.”

	The video electrified many Iranians.


	“I started getting messages, both from people inside Iran and also students who have family who are from Iran, or are here with family. And they were like, ‘Did you see this video? It's got 15 million views.' I'm like, ‘OK, I'll go check it later,'” Sabet tells Rolling Stone. “When I checked later, it was at 80 million views.”


	By Thursday, the regime cut internet and phone services across the country. Protesters who had originally been motivated by high inflation were now taking to the streets across Iran chanting “Jâvid Shâh,” or “Long live the Shah,” and “Death to Khamenei,” the most significant direct challenge to the legitimacy of clerical rule in decades. 


	Trump's social media post on Jan. 2 promising to take action if protesters were harmed also encouraged turnout. “I think that was a big deal. And his capture of [Venezuelan President Nicolás] Maduro reiterated the credibility of President Trump's words,” Sabet says.


	By the weekend, the regime had unleashed the army, police, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — the military branch charged with the protection of Iran's government — as well as its volunteer paramilitaries, known as Basij.


	Handfuls of photos and video clips have leaked out via Starlink satellite-internet terminals or have been hand-carried into neighboring countries. They document heavy and sustained gunfire in city streets, security forces firing on protesters, and rows upon rows of body bags.

	“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” Trump wrote on Tuesday, Jan. 13, after thousands had already been killed.


	Yet the military assets required for a U.S. intervention aimed at stopping Iran's security apparatus were simply not available in the area when Trump first made his pledge in early January. There are no carrier strike groups currently within operational distance of Iran, and until early Wednesday there had been no significant build-up of American forces in the region. Open-source researchers observed multiple aerial refuelling aircraft taking to the sky Wednesday, a possible indication of military action.

	











	“Some of the messages I've been hearing from Iran is a sense of betrayal by President Trump,” Sabet says. “They thought they were going out there with him behind their backs.”


	It is an open question what Washington expects to accomplish with the resources on hand. Administration insiders previously told the press that the White House is considering a range of non-kinetic options, including boosting anti-government media online, attacking Iranian targets with cyberweapons, or increasing sanctions, as well as limited military strikes aimed at critical targets.


	The U.S. does maintain a number of fighter aircraft and naval vessels in the region — notably at Al-Udeid Airbase in Qatar and a naval base in Bahrain — which are capable of launching cruise-missile and stand-off munitions strikes. But destroying Iran's security forces, dismantling its political and military leadership, and bringing down the regime will likely require a significant commitment in military resources.


	“It's not a one-off,” says Victoria Taylor, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran. “Any effort to bring the regime down through military force would require what is best described as a sustained campaign.”


	It's not clear whether Trump is willing to commit to such an action.


	“One of the challenges within the administration is there are very different camps in terms of a willingness and readiness to use force,” Taylor says. “Clearly, there are hawkish elements within the administration who are ready to pursue a much more muscular foreign policy — I'd count Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio among those. But we also know that there are strong voices in favor of restraint, like Vice President [J.D.] Vance.”


	Amid the lack of a clearly articulated goal or strategy for Iran, some experts are skeptical Washington can achieve its desired results.


	“There is no violent shortcut to an outcome where the United States and Israel will be happy,” says Ali Vaez, the Iran program director at the International Crisis Group. He observes that while Trump could use non-kinetic options to escalate pressure on the regime, “they won't check the box of ‘spectacular' it seems he so often opts for, and might not produce a significant result.”


	A series of limited strikes, similar to the airstrikes on Iran's nuclear program last summer, may give Trump a PR victory. But they are unlikely to destroy the regime or protect the lives of protesters.

	











	“There's certainly a risk that the lesson learned from Venezuela and from the 12-Day War [when Israel and the U.S. attacked Iran in June 2025] is that U.S. military power is so overwhelming that we are capable of achieving our goals quickly without putting boots on the ground, and without casualties,” Taylor says. “The difficulty in Iran is really that even if the U.S. were able to topple the regime, I am skeptical that we will be able to control the follow-on to a desired outcome.”


	Nevertheless, the protests and the crackdown indicate structural weakness in the Iranian regime, which has portrayed the strife as part of a plot coordinated by Israel. But the sheer scale of the protests belies that they are simply the work of foreign agents. Significant protests in the past which began over social or economic grievances have spiraled into direct challenges to the government, known as “the System” in Persian, which is viewed as oppressive and backwards by many young Iranians.


	“The regime is able to suppress, but it is not able to address the underlying causes,” Vaez says. “So all it's doing is buying time until the next round of confrontation with civil society, and these are becoming more frequent and more violent every time.”


	Sabet sees the current crisis as part of a much larger pattern, whose threads can be traced back through nearly a decade of internal protests and crackdowns. “The underlying assumption for me is a trend line where people understand that this system can't meet their needs,” he says.


	“Why are people constantly coming into the streets and killing security forces, and getting killed in huge numbers? Why is there a mass murder happening in the streets right now if reform works?” he asks.


	The reason that Pahlavi's post went viral and added fuel to the flames of protest, Sabet says, was revealed in conversations he had with acquaintances: “They were like, ‘Yeah, listen, we didn't have an alternative before. Here's an alternative, right?' At least it's trying to provide a vision of some kind of a positive future, or hope for the future.”


	Still, the influence of Pahlavi — and Trump — is limited.


	“Although the stock of the former shah's son has improved over the past few months, he is by no means universally seen as the opposition leader,” Vaez notes. “And in any case, he doesn't have any ground organization.”


	Sabet adds: “If there's a year of mass executions and crackdowns, it might be enough to put a stake in Pahlavi's ambitions.” Still, while it's hard to see the U.S. bringing down the regime quickly, Sabet says “a few well-considered actions on the cyber and non-kinetic side, or also on the kinetic and military side, could have an enormous effect” in encouraging another cycle of protest. “This situation is so unstable and fluid that nothing would surprise me.”

	











	Vaez simply does not see the U.S. determining the final outcome for the regime that has ruled a country of 92 million people for nearly 50 years.

	“This is an Iranian affair. Outsiders are mere bystanders,” he says.


	Nevertheless, Trump views his previous military adventures in Iran — the killing of IRGC commander Major General Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the strike against Tehran's nuclear program last year — as unequivocal successes, and “bystander” is rarely a role he embraces.

Teyana Taylor stopped by The Tonight Show on the heels of her big Golden Globe win for One Battle After Another. Not only did Taylor perform her song “Hard Part” with Lucky Daye, but she also sat down with host Jimmy Fallon to discuss the Globes experience, including her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio‘s viral moment. 


	Fallon played a clip of DiCaprio from the night, in which he was filmed animatedly speaking to someone about KPop Demon Hunters. The video has circulated wildly since Sunday and Taylor noted that some people, including herself, have assumed he was speaking to her. 


	“He is so funny,” Fallon said. “Who is he talking to? Can you tell us?”


	“Okay, look, yesterday I thought I broke the Da Vinci Code, right?” Taylor replied. “They was like, ‘Yeah, so he was talking to Teyana.' Now, KPop Demon Hunters won and my kids' favorite song is ‘Golden,' so I was really excited.” 

Something has activated Leonardo DiCaprio during this commercial break pic.twitter.com/TWPf1S9OMw


	Because of that she assumed DiCaprio was caught on camera talking to her. “But then I watched it and they were doing, like, the lip-read thing,” she added. “And I had to call Leo. I knew exactly what K-Pop was because Chase [Infiniti] taught me. So I was like, ‘You can't be talking to me. Were you talking to me? Because I already told people you was talking to me.'”

	She confirmed, “So, apparently, he had two KPop Demon Hunter conversations that night. So KPop Demon Hunters was just in his mouth all night… So I had a little friendly jealousy.” Ultimately, though, she said DiCaprio doesn't “even remember who he was talking to.”

	Taylor also discussed her acceptance speech, which was one of the top moments of the night. She noted that she cut an entire paragraph from her planned speech because she was nervous about running out of time. “I was trying to beat the embarrassment,” she said. “I was like, ‘If this music starts playing on me, I am going to melt on this stage.'”


	Taylor joined forces with Lucky Daye to perform “Hard Part,” which appears on her Grammy-nominated album Escape Room. The album, which dropped in August, marked her fourth studio effort and her first since retiring from music in 2020. In a review, Rolling Stone called the LP “Taylor's most vulnerable work yet,” adding that it “chronicles the process of navigating grief, trauma, acceptance, and new beginnings.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Why One State's UAP Legislation Could Reduce Pilot Stigma","https://www.flyingmag.com/new-jersey-uap-legislation-pilot-stigma/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:30:00 GMT","

New Jersey could be the first U.S. state to fund a center dedicated to the study of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

The U.S. government a few years ago began using UAP in place of “unidentified flying object” to reflect that sightings reported by pilots may not be objects at all, since they are unidentified. But according to Ryan Graves, executive director of the nonprofit UAP advocacy group Americans for Safe Aerospace (ASA), most pilots do not report sightings because they fear professional repercussions. ASA earlier this month published a white paper exploring the topic.

Graves in 2023 testified to the House Oversight committee about a pair of UAP he said he encountered in 2014, while stationed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as an F-18 pilot for the U.S. Navy.

“The stigma hasn't changed much since my 2023 testimony,” Graves told FLYING. “Pilots still face three main barriers: professional risk, institutional dismissal, and lack of clarity on where to report…Airlines don't want their pilots associated with UFO stories, and the FAA historically hasn't had a clear process for handling these reports.”

Because of that, “pilots make a calculation—is it worth the professional risk to report something I can't explain?” Graves asked. “Usually, they decide it isn't.”

That could change this year. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday signed legislation that allocates $3.5 million annually across two state aviation safety programs. About $2.5 million per year will be available as grant money for universities that want to establish the country's first state-funded UAP research center.

“Universities could develop sensor networks, analyze pilot encounter data, establish standardized collection protocols—the kind of rigorous scientific methodology this subject has lacked,” Graves said.

The remaining $1 million in annual funding will go toward an air traffic control (ATC) loan redemption program. ATCs who live in New Jersey and began working for the FAA at an “approved site” after Monday, the bill's effective date, are eligible for up to $100,000 over four years to cover the cost of their training. Approved sites include not just airports but the facilities that support them, such as terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities or air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs).

Graves said that provision will also help improve visibility around UAP.

“It addresses the workforce shortage that impacts aviation safety broadly, including our ability to track and respond to unusual aerial activity,” he said.

ASA, which backed the legislation, estimated that the funding could support an initial cohort of 18 to 20 controllers. Unused funds will roll over into subsequent years.

Per his biography, Graves was the first active duty U.S. military pilot to publicly share regular UAP sightings. The former F-18 commander made two deployments across his decadelong service and later studied military autonomy technology for BAE Systems' FAST Labs.

Graves cofounded ASA in 2023, establishing the nation's first pilot-led advocacy group dedicated to UAP. The nonprofit advocates for more robust reporting mechanisms and greater government transparency around the subject.

“If pilots are encountering objects they can't identify at frequency, and we believe they are, that represents a significant gap in our safety data,” Graves said. “Every near-miss, every unexplained radar contact, every encounter that goes unreported is information we're losing about potential hazards. Government officials are finally starting to acknowledge this, but there's still disconnect on urgency.”

In the House, Graves described his 2014 sightings—video of which was shared by the Pentagon in 2020 as part of a larger UAP-related release—as “dark gray or black cubes…inside of a clear sphere, where the apex or tips of the cubes were touching the inside of that sphere.”

He said the episode was “not rare or isolated.” Another pilot, Graves recounted, told him about an incident during which an object similar to the one he described flew within 50 feet of two fighters.

Graves also testified that there was no way to report the sightings. He estimated that 95 percent of UAP incidents go unreported. Since there is no official channel to report UAP, pilots instead turn to resources such as the FAA and NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), which was designed to field reports of conventional hazards like mechanical issues or bird strikes.

“When pilots do try to report through these systems, the data often goes nowhere meaningful,” Graves said.

It is only fitting that New Jersey, whose residents reported a spate of unidentified drone sightings in late 2024, could lead the way. Federal officials in December determined that out of thousands of reports, most were “cases of mistaken identity”—birds, aircraft, or even drones that were legally authorized.

However, officials did confirm that unidentified drones were spotted over military installations. In at least one case, the reported presence of the aircraft thwarted an attempt to airlift a crash victim to the hospital.

The episode frustrated New Jersey lawmakers, who said they lacked the resources to adequately track unusual activity. But the state's universities can now apply for the $2.5 million in grant money, which will become available in the next six months.

“It normalizes this as serious safety and scientific work, not career-threatening fringe belief,” Graves said.

Preference will be given for institutions located in the state's most populous counties. As in the ATC loan redemption program, unused funds will carry over to subsequent years. ASA plans to work with universities to identify prime candidates, assist with applications, and provide consulting on research methodologies, access to reports, guidance on infrastructure, and more.

Applicants must be participating or plan to participate in the FAA's Uncrewed Aircraft System Collegiate Training Initiative (UAS-CTI). These universities already have sensor networks, tracking algorithms, and technical capabilities that Graves said could support UAP research.

“Both fields deal with the same fundamental challenge: identifying and characterizing objects in our airspace,” he said. “It's leveraging existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch.”

ASA contends that a larger, multistate network would provide distributed coverage, regional expertise, and increased transparency around UAP reporting. It is offering consultations, professional testimony, state-specific UAP data, and other resources for states that are interested in creating their own research centers. Already, Graves said, many are looking to New Jersey's bill as a “template” that could be replicated.

“We need research efforts across multiple regions with different geographic, atmospheric, and aerospace characteristics,” Graves said.

In the former Navy pilot's view, though, only a federal system can adequately track UAP reports. ASA has its own reporting platform, “but we're a nonprofit filling a gap that should be a government function,” he said.

ASA helped craft the Safe Airspace for Americans Act, which was introduced in the House in September. The legislation would create an official FAA channel for commercial pilots, air traffic controllers, flight attendants, and other aviation professionals to report UAP without jeopardizing their medical or airman certificate.

“It's exactly what pilots have been asking for—a confidential, official pathway that doesn't threaten their careers,” Graves said.

If you've ever squinted up on a clear Illinois night sky and wondered whether that flickering light you just saw was more than a plane, planet, or shooting star, you're not the only one. In 2025, residents across our state filed dozens of UFO reports, and their stories are a wild mix of the believable, the kind-of-believable, and the “wait, what?”

According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), Illinois had 34 reported UFO sightings in 2025 through mid‑year, with observers describing everything from oddly-shaped objects to strange orbs and lights.

Keep in mind that organizations like NUFORC compile reports as they come in, and many sightings from late 2025 may not be tallied publicly yet. The state's full year total for 2025 isn't finalized. More reports and more patterns will likely emerge as additional sightings get recorded and processed.

So what are Illinois folks actually reporting? Here are some examples from Northern Illinois in 2025, as cataloged on the NUFORC database:

Jan. 23, 2025 (Chicago): Triangle‑shaped object that appeared to change shape and light patterns.

Feb. 10, 2025 (Carol Stream): White oval‑shaped light seen at the front door and captured on Ring camera.

Apr. 8, 2025 (Gurnee): Orb‑shaped craft seen about 300 feet away through a bedroom window.

Apr. 22, 2025 (Arlington Heights): Two lights moving in the sky, one bright and large, one smaller and dimmer.

May 24, 2025 (Chicago): Tumbling cylinder with bright reflections or lights.

May 29, 2025 (Worth): Diamond‑shaped object too bright to be a star, with an image captured by the witness.

That's part of what makes UFO reporting so fascinating for those who believe or want to believe.

But before you start prepping for close encounters, the fun reality is that while the term “UFO” technically means unidentified flying object, it doesn't automatically mean alien spacecraft.

Many of these sightings end up being explained as drones, satellites, weather balloons, bright planets seen from unusual angles, or other perfectly ordinary objects that look strange at night. In fact, UFO organizations estimate only a small fraction of sightings merit deeper investigation, and most of those get credible explanations over time.","{'href': 'https://1440wrok.com', 'title': 'WROK 1440 AM / 96.1 FM'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","Why One State's UAP Legislation Could Reduce Pilot Stigma","https://www.flyingmag.com/new-jersey-uap-legislation-pilot-stigma/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:30:00 GMT","

New Jersey could be the first U.S. state to fund a center dedicated to the study of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

The U.S. government a few years ago began using UAP in place of “unidentified flying object” to reflect that sightings reported by pilots may not be objects at all, since they are unidentified. But according to Ryan Graves, executive director of the nonprofit UAP advocacy group Americans for Safe Aerospace (ASA), most pilots do not report sightings because they fear professional repercussions. ASA earlier this month published a white paper exploring the topic.

Graves in 2023 testified to the House Oversight committee about a pair of UAP he said he encountered in 2014, while stationed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as an F-18 pilot for the U.S. Navy.

“The stigma hasn't changed much since my 2023 testimony,” Graves told FLYING. “Pilots still face three main barriers: professional risk, institutional dismissal, and lack of clarity on where to report…Airlines don't want their pilots associated with UFO stories, and the FAA historically hasn't had a clear process for handling these reports.”

Because of that, “pilots make a calculation—is it worth the professional risk to report something I can't explain?” Graves asked. “Usually, they decide it isn't.”

	Filmmaker boards Dana Abraham project for Champ & Pepper, eyeing fall 2026 production


								By 

	Naman Ramachandran



Fawzia Mirza, the award-winning director of “The Queen of My Dreams,” has been tapped to helm “Bhoot,” an English-language South Asian paranormal thriller from Toronto-based Champ & Pepper and multi-hyphenate Dana Abraham.


	The film, written by and co-starring Abraham (“Orphan Black: Echoes”), is eyeing a fall 2026 production start, with casting announcements expected throughout the new year. Champ & Pepper, a marketing agency known for handling global campaigns for major studio releases, is making its first major push into original film production with the project.

	“Bhoot” centers on Aru Saha, a young South Asian woman grappling with grief, guilt and generational pressure who arrives with her brother Das and their parents in an ostensibly perfect town concealing a supernatural secret drawn from South Asian folklore. The psychological horror aims to blend emotional family drama with genre elements. 




			Popular on Variety		







	Abraham is producing under his Red Hill Creative banner alongside Champ & Pepper's Jeff Pestell and Glenn Karpel. Ella Wahlstedt of Quarterlife Pictures also serves as producer, having developed the screenplay with Abraham from its inception.


	“‘Bhoot' is about what haunts us internally – the guilt we inherit, the grief we bury, and the courage it takes to confront both,” said Abraham. “Having Fawzia join us elevates this film in ways I couldn't imagine. Her voice, vision, and authenticity in championing South Asian stories makes her the perfect filmmaking partner as Champ & Pepper and I build something bold, terrifying, and emotionally resonant. With their decades of global marketing experience and deep studio relationships, we're preparing for a strategic rollout long before the cameras roll.”

	











	Mirza's feature directorial debut, “The Queen of My Dreams,” world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and screened at SXSW among dozens of festivals before its theatrical release. The film recently earned a GLAAD Award nomination for outstanding feature and received two Canadian Screen Awards and the Directors Guild of Canada award for best feature, among other honors.


	The director most recently wrapped production on Tubi and Webtoon Productions feature “Kissing Is the Easy Part” and will return to direct Season 2 of Hulu comedy series “Deli Boys.”


	“I've been searching for a genre/thriller project to direct. Horror is as visceral as comedy. As evocative as love. As real as romance. Genre is all about the feeling. Dana's script delivers on all of those emotions. It was an easy ‘Yes!'” Mirza said.


	“Champ & Pepper is excited to continue our evolution of supporting film through content creation and marketing-first strategies,” added Pestell, president of Champ & Pepper. “Moving into development and production is a natural next step for us and we are thrilled to be partnering with Dana and Red Hill on ‘Bhoot.' Having a director like Fawzia on board only makes this even more thrilling.”


	Abraham is currently entering production on sports-comedy series “Strikers,” set to begin filming this spring. He has previously written, produced and starred in three feature films.


	“Bhoot,” which will feature a fully South Asian principal cast, is being positioned for strategic studio and streamer partnerships across North America and international markets beginning in 2027.


	Mirza is represented by IAG, Alexander Stegmaier and Granderson Des Rochers.

Paranormal Activity | ★★★★☆ | Ambassador's Theatre

Given the endless churn of lacklustre sequels, it's easy to forget just how scary the original Paranormal Activity was. A found footage successor to The Blair Witch Project, it brought the same flavour of supernatural horror into a chillingly recognisable domestic setting that could be your own home. Through word of mouth and smart marketing, hype spread like a virus, making Paranormal Activity one of the most profitable films ever made, turning a $15,000 budget into a worldwide box office of almost $200 million.

Nearly two decades later, it arrives on the London stage (following stints in Leeds, Chicago and Los Angeles) with a new – but familiar – story written by Levi Holloway and directed by Punchdrunk alumnus Felix Barrett.

As is the way with this franchise, we gaze voyeuristically as a young couple settle into a new home. Fresh off the boat from Chicago, James and Lou seek a fresh start in London after an undisclosed trauma involving the latter's mental health. The set is a cross section of their house, an open-plan living room and kitchen connected to three upstairs rooms by way of a shadowy staircase. Windows on either side cast eerie shadows as cars cruise by outside.

The strength of the play lies in its simplicity. Knowing this is a ghost story, your eyes are forever drawn to the darkened, unoccupied rooms away from the action, gloomy negative spaces that allow your mind to fill in the blanks. 

Stay ahead with our three daily briefings delivering all the key market moves, top business and political stories, and incisive analysis straight to your inbox.

The scares are – to begin with at least – restrained and genuinely unsettling: unexplained knocking at the door, a thud in an empty room, a mysterious shadow. As things ratchet up, sound is used to brilliant effect – crackling lights, jolts of static from the TV – and the inevitable jump scares are few enough to feel well-earned.

There are nods to the found footage origins of Paranormal Activity, with screens to the left and right of the stalls (and presumably in the cheaper seats, too) showing night-vision surveillance footage of the house. This feels a bit underdeveloped – there's something creepy about glancing sideways at this distorted version of reality, the cameras cutting as they follow the couple through the house, but they're not incorporated into the story in any meaningful way. In a post-Jamie Lloyd world in which splicing pre-recorded footage into apparently ‘live' video is practically de rigueur, this feels like a missed opportunity.

The acting is competent without ever threatening to be great. James (Patrick Heusinger) is a fairly standard ‘brash American abroad', painted in the broadest possible brush strokes. Until the final act he exists largely as a foil to his more introspective wife, resetting the tension with dumb jokes and false bravado. Lou (Melissa James) is a little more interesting, questioning whether she's being haunted or is simply losing her mind (and wondering which is worse). Neither is given much in the way of challenging dialogue. 

The real stars of the show are the team behind the set-piece scares. One in particular, which I will not spoil, is brilliantly executed, drawing gasps of amazement as much as fear. This is horror meets magic and I for one am here for it.

The horror genre is having quite a moment on the stage, perhaps owing to the celebrity-fuelled success of 2.22 A Ghost Story. Last week saw the release of the brilliantly self-contained A Ghost in Your Ear at the Hampstead Theatre, which played out in a single sound-recording studio. Paranormal Activity shows that formula can be upscaled without losing any of the frightening immediacy.

BERKELEY, Calif. - What does it take to detect a radio signal sent by extraterrestrial life to Earth? Two decades of work involving radio telescopes stationed on opposite sides of the world, a supercomputer in Germany, and two million volunteer computers worldwide.

Maybe. 

A team of UC Berkeley scientists has painstakingly analyzed billions of radio signals received over fifteen years and have zeroed in on 100 that are most likely to be sent by extraterrestrial intelligence. 

The project -- called SETI@home after the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence -- sought to scan a third of the sky visible from Earth to isolate a certain type of radio signals: those belonging to a narrow bandwidth, with most of their power concentrated at a small range of frequencies. Scientists believe these characteristics could indicate that they are sent by an extraterrestrial life form.  

It took two decades for the project to arrive at its conclusion, but as a result, a dataset of 12 billion radio signals has been winnowed down to the 100 that are likeliest to have been sent by an extraterrestrial life form. 

The results of this project were published in two papers in The Astronomical Journal in 2025. 

SETI@home was conceived in 1995, when David Anderson, a computational scientist and computer science professor at UC Berkeley was researching ""distributed computing.""  This technique entails distributing large computational tasks into smaller tasks across a large network of computers, significantly cutting down the costs for researchers. 

""1995 was a time when home computers were getting connected to the internet,"" said Anderson, ""and it was also a time when home computers were getting pretty fast.""

Tonight -- a strange sight in the skies over Oregon--pilots report seeing several UFOs. Coming up -- hear how they describe those objects in calls to the control tower. Plus -- a California couple killed while on vacation in Mexico. What we're learning about the shooting -- as investigators search for a motive.

When a graduate student suggested using distributed computing to analyze radio signals received by radio telescopes to scan for extraterrestrial intelligence, Anderson teamed up with UC Berkeley astronomers Erik Korpela and Dan Werthimer to work on the project. 

The intention was to look for extraterrestrial life outside the solar system that might be sending radio signals to Earth to draw attention to themselves. 

First, the three scientists found a suitable SETI research project at UC Berkeley that had access to data from the radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. 

Then they developed the SETI@home software, which volunteers worldwide could download on their own computers. 

Like a screensaver, this software was designed to work in the background. It would analyze the radio signals from Arecibo and identify those that adhered to certain parameters that scientists think are consistent with a signal that intelligent extraterrestrial life might send.  

The software was launched in 1999, and the response was unexpected -- within a year, 2 million people had downloaded the software. Anderson said that they only started receiving good quality data in 2006, after an upgrade to the Arecibo telescope. 

Between 2006 and 2020, the telescope scanned a third of the sky visible from Earth multiple times, supplying the home computers with enough data to compile a list of 12 billion signals that fit the criteria that the team was looking for.

Expecting this avalanche of data and the need to filter it further, in 2016, Anderson, Korpela, and Werthimer started working on specialized algorithms to eliminate the spurious signals generated by interference from Earth's radio, TV stations, and aircraft radar systems. 

For that, they used the supercomputer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hanover, Germany. Running the algorithms on the supercomputer only took two days, said Anderson, but the whole process took two whole years. 

""We had to do that hundreds of times, because... it was all very experimental,"" he said. ""Nobody had ever done anything like this before, so we started off with some algorithms that did not work very well. It was all trial and error.""

Once this second round of sorting and ranking was complete, the first being done by home computers, Korpela and Wertheimer examined the top thousand candidates manually, and further thinned the list to the top 100 viable signals. 

Now, the sources of these 100 signals are being observed through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China -- 15 minutes for each point of origin -- to test if the signals are repeated. 

Anderson said that so far, the sources of half of the 100 signals have been observed, and they haven't returned a hit.  Chances of the remaining half yielding a hit are slim, but he believes that SETI@home has been groundbreaking in the scope of the signals it analyzed and the precise algorithms it produced to eliminate radio interference. 

Above all, he sees the project as a successful demonstration of how distributed computing can democratize science. 

""The [computing] power of SETI@home would cost hundreds of millions of dollars if you bought it on the Amazon cloud. Volunteer computing makes it possible to do that kind of science for a lot less money,"" he said.

""My personal hope is that... companies like OpenAI and Google that are able to spend a billion dollars to build new data centers will not have a monopoly on AI if we can figure out a way to use volunteer computing to train large language models. That could be a game changer for AI!""

For a project which has never been formally addressed by anyone at Marvel Studios, the rumored Midnight Sons film certainly has quite an archive of potential information. From rumored writers to directors and cast members, the big screen team-up flick has allegedly been in development since 2022 and its potential to be a hit is undeniable.

Werewolf By Night helmer Michael Giacchino‘s was originally floated as a potential before Fede Álvarez‘s name popped up on the radar in 2024. Alvarez's name seemed to be attached to a screenplay being drafted by Logan scribe Michael Green and it seemed as though the studio was hoping to fast track the project. While it's possible the studio had originally planned to get the supernatural squad together before the end of the Multiverse Saga, the deployment of the Time Ripper to accelerate the end of uneven Saga through the removal of scheduled films could have delayed its announcement and arrival.

The potential project found itself in the headlines again this week following a report that Marvel had finally moved on from its long-delayed Blade reboot  in favor of introducing Mahershala Ali‘s Daywalker in Midnight Sons. Now, an interesting rumor has followed that news down the pipeline.

An Ali and Oscar Isaac-led project would carry some cache and the supporting cast, should the rumor be accurate, would be among the studio's most impressive–and that's without knowing who they'd cast as whichever Ghost Rider is supposed to be on the squad.

For what it's worth, in the comics, the Children of Midnight have typically had 9 members, meaning there's room for one more surprise on the supernatural squad's lineup as they potentially take on Mia Goth's Lilith while also dealing with the machinations of Mephisto!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","5 literary conspiracy theories — debunked","https://bigthink.com/books/5-literary-conspiracy-theories-debunked/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:30:00 GMT","

The literary world is no safe haven from wild conspiracy theories. It has its own supposed cover-ups, extraterrestrials, and cryptids lurking in the bookish backwoods. These conspiracy theories aren't typically harmful and can even offer some fun lore to draw you into the reading. Like all conspiracy theories, though, they distort our understanding of reality and history, and they can sometimes extend beyond the page to have far-reaching consequences.

Perhaps the most common literary conspiracies involve questions of authorship: the belief that a writer didn't actually create the works credited to them. And it's understandable why readers sometimes doubt the authenticity of the name on the cover.

For one, many authors use pseudonyms. Mary Ann Evans adopted the pen name “George Eliot” because she believed male novelists were taken more seriously; Stephen King became “Richard Bachman” because he was too prolific for the standard publishing cycle; and Benjamin Franklin pretended to be the dowager “Silence Dogood” to prank his brother James. 

For another, some attributions are more a matter of convention than provable reality. Scholars can't say with certainty that Homer existed, and even if he did, it remains an open question how much of The Iliad and The Odyssey can be attributed to him or the oral tradition that followed. Similar questions can be raised about the Chinese philosophers Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu. (No relation. Tzu is an honorific roughly translating to “master.”)

These facts leave plenty of space for wild speculation, even about modern authors with well-documented lives. Rumors claim that Thomas Pynchon is a pseudonym for the reclusive J.D. Salinger, or that Truman Capote wrote To Kill a Mockingbird while using his childhood friend Harper Lee as an authorial front. Both claims are false.

But without question, the most sweeping conspiracies over authorship surround none other than the Bard himself.

“There is an extraordinary — seemingly an insatiable — urge on the part of quite a number of people to believe that the plays of William Shakespeare were written by someone other than William Shakespeare,” the journalist and author Bill Bryson writes in his book on the playwright. “The number of published books suggesting — or more often insisting — as much is estimated now to be well over five thousand.”

Doubts over Shakespeare's authorship gained traction in the mid-19th century with Delia Bacon. Like many before and after, Delia praised Shakespeare's plays for their insights and rich language, but this adoration led her to believe that such artistry could not have been achieved by a man of such modest beginnings. She reasoned that the plays must have been written by an educated, world-traveled elite who then credited them to a lowly actor and theater manager — likely to distance himself from their true, subversive intent.

To prove her theory, Delia sailed to England, but instead of sifting through archives or reading primary sources like a historian, she combed the plays for “hidden meanings” and sought inspiration by “absorbing [the] atmospheres” of notable sites. Vibes scholarship, basically.

She came to believe that Shakespeare's plays were written by Francis Bacon — again, no relation — with the help of a cadre of co-conspirators, including the poet Edmund Spenser and Sir Walter Raleigh. While Delia enjoyed fleeting support from literary figures such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, her unsubstantiated claims were largely ridiculed.

That didn't stop others from advancing their own anti-Stratfordian theories. Suspects have included James I, William Stanley, Anne Hathaway, Edward de Vere, and Christopher Marlowe — never mind that the last two died years before all of Shakespeare's plays were finished.

The inconvenience for all of these lay theories is the same that plagued Delia's guesswork: They lack truly credible evidence. Meanwhile, scholars and historians have uncovered ample evidence to vouch for Shakespeare's claim to the quill, including official court records that attribute specific plays to him.

Bryson sums it up nicely: “These people must have been incredibly gifted — to create, in their spare time, the greatest literature ever produced in English, in a voice patently not their own, in a manner so cunning that they fooled virtually everyone during their own lifetimes and for four hundred years afterward.”

While some conspiracy theories deny that certain authors lived the writerly life, others insist they led a double life in the shadows. No, we're not talking about a pedestrian affair or unpopular political affiliation. These conjectures aim to add chapters of secret identities and deadly rendezvous to an author's biography.

Again, it's understandable as some authors have, in fact, led double lives. To research his first novel, Harlan Ellison went undercover as a member of a street gang. George Orwell was outed as an informant for the Foreign Office's covert propaganda unit, providing the department with a list of potential communists he called his “fellow-travellers.” And during World War II, children's author Roald Dahl engaged in espionage while serving as a diplomat to the U.S.

Christopher Marlowe may also have been recruited into the spy game by Sir Francis Walsingham around 1585. Scholars can't say for certain one way or the other — unless you're Dahl, spying typically works that way — but the idea did inspire a well-reviewed mystery, “A Tip for the Hangman.”

But the wildest double life attributed to an author belongs to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. You may know him better as Lewis Carroll or, in the case of this conspiracy theory, Jack the Ripper.

Despite leaving a bloody trail of carnage throughout London's Whitechapel district in 1888 and taunting authorities with letters full of bravado, Jack the Ripper has never been identified. A lineup of doctors, lawyers, butchers, and criminals has been floated as culprits, but who better to throw off the police than a former deacon who excelled at the sciences, entertained children, and worked as a university lecturer?

That must have been what Richard Wallace thought when he accused Carroll and Thomas Vere Bayne of being the true Whitechapel murderers in his books The Agony of Lewis Carroll (1990) and Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend (1996). 

Wallace's theory hinges on the author's love of riddles and wordplay. According to it, Carroll hid confessions of his foul deeds inside his work as anagrams. For instance, Wallace claims that the famous opening lines of Carroll's poem “The Jabberwocky” conceal a sneaky confession. Here's Carroll's poem:

“'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: / All mimsy were the borogoves, / And the mome raths outgrabe.”

And here's Wallace's decrypted version: 

“Bet I beat my glands til, With hand-sword I slay the evil gender. A slimey theme; borrow gloves, And masturbate the hog more!”

If you think that's a stretch, so did Karoline Leach, author of In the Shadow of the Dreamchild (1999). The book aims to dispel the many myths surrounding Carroll, and in it, Leach analyzes Wallace's theory. She concludes that Carroll perpetrating such messy wordplay is more unbelievable than the idea of him moonlighting as a Victorian Dexter. She specifically notes that in one instance, Wallace had to substitute letters to make his anagrams work at all. 

Leach went on to demonstrate the ridiculousness of Wallace's evidence by applying his methodology to the opening line of A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh. Here's Milne:

“Here is Edward Bear coming downstairs now.”

And here's Leach's “decryption”:

“Stab red red women! CR is downing whores AA.” (“CR” obviously being a deranged Christopher Robin.)

Wallace's theories fall apart without the anagrams, as well. In the Retrospect Journal, Kayla Greer points out that physical evidence of Carroll and Vere Bayne's involvement is nonexistent, and Carroll was only in the right part of London for a few of the murders.

“By Wallace's methodology,” Greer adds, “one could equally ‘prove' that Charles Dickens, Alfred Tennyson, or any prolific Victorian author was Jack the Ripper.”

When a death is sudden, unexpected, and high-profile, it opens the doors to conspiratorial thinking. And literary history has plenty of mysterious deaths for theorists to choose from.

Some speculate that Albert Camus's death in a car accident in 1960 was no accident, but a KGB hit in response to his criticisms of the Soviet government. Geoffrey Chaucer died of unknown causes in 1400, but that lack of evidence hasn't stopped people from suspecting murder by order of King Henry IV. And Christopher Marlowe pops up again to secure the conspiracy hat trick. Marlowe was stabbed to death during a bar fight over a game of backgammon, but some claim the brawl covered up an assassination aimed at silencing him and protecting high members of the government. (Remember, he might have been a spy.) Others say it was faked to help him escape his enemies.

Meanwhile, Edgar Allan Poe's death was not unlike something you'd find in one of his stories. On October 3, 1849,  Poe was found in a gutter near a tavern after having been missing for five days. He was delirious and wearing someone else's haggard clothes. After four incoherent days in the hospital, where he called out for a “Reynolds” who was never identified, he died at the age of 40.

Adding to the mystery, Poe's death certificate and none of his medical records still exist. We only know that the attending physician, John Moran, said the cause of death was phrenitis (swelling of the brain). This generic diagnosis and the mysterious circumstances have led to many conjectures over the true cause. These have included rabies, substance abuse, carbon monoxide poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, a brain tumor, and murder.

The assumption that Poe died due to his love of the bottle has since been proven unlikely. While Poe had a reputation as a substance abuser who often became belligerent, this popular opinion was largely shaped by a slanderous obituary in the New York Tribune. Its writer, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, held a grudge against Poe and, despite becoming Poe's literary executor, slandered the author's name for years after his death.

It didn't help that Joseph E. Snodgrass, an editor with medical training who helped with Poe after he was found, was a member of the temperance movement and used Poe as a strawman during lectures to highlight the dangers of drinking.

In actuality, Poe swore off alcohol after overcoming an illness and being told by his doctor that another drink would likely kill him. While it isn't unheard of for an alcoholic to fall off the wagon, samples of Poe's hair were tested in 2006 and showed low levels of lead (back in the day, the toxic metal made its way into wines and other alcoholic beverages as a sweetener or through contact with leaded glassware). While Poe's hair showed levels many times higher than what is normal today, the results suggest he wasn't drinking heavily toward the end of his life.

Books can also exude a fog of mystery, and literary hoaxes are penned to take advantage of this fact. While such hoaxes alone don't often reach the heights of a full-blown conspiracy theory — more on that below — they can nonetheless misguide readers into accepting them as evidence of deep-state deception. 

Examples include The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, which claim to be lost books of the Hebrew Bible containing magical incantations, but which first appeared in anonymous pamphlets in the 1800s. A century later, the West German magazine Stern purchased what its editors believed were 60 volumes of Adolf Hitler's personal diaries; they were actually forgeries created by the conman Konrad Kujau. 

Yet one of the oddest literary hoaxes in recent memory has to be the Simon Necronomicon. Odd because it's no secret that the Necronomicon is made-up. The author H.P. Lovecraft devised the book as a plot device in his famous Cthulhu Mythos. In these horror stories, this magic tome is said to contain the history of the Old Ones — powerful, often evil cosmic beings — as well as unspeakable, arcane knowledge. 

Lovecraft wrote his stories with an eye toward verisimilitude, and those featuring the Necronomicon are no different. He composed a centuries-long history for the book, even including a list of the academic institutions said to house extant copies. He would also reference it alongside “real” grimoires and alchemical texts, such as The Book of Dzyan (circa 1900) and Turba Philosophorum (circa 900).

His efforts were convincing enough that some readers came to believe the book actually existed. Libraries known for their collections of ancient manuscripts, including the Vatican Library, have received information requests for it, and after Lovecraft's death, books sporting the name began appearing in occult bookstores. Many of these are obvious and playful homages to Lovecraft's work, but others claim to be the real deal. The Simon Necronomicon stands with the latter.

Originally published in 1977, this Necronomicon is attributed simply to a “Simon,” though the actual author is likely the occultist Peter Levenda. In the introduction, Simon claims to have been given a Greek translation of a real Necronomicon by a mysterious monk and later verified its curses, incantations, and spells to predate most known religions.

But according to Gabriel McKee, librarian for collections and services at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, the book is actually “a mishmash of recontextualized Sumerian and Babylonian texts peppered with added references to fictional deities created by Lovecraft and the orientalist magical system of Aleister Crowley.” The translations aren't even original. Simon plagiarized them from academic sources, throwing in a handful of Cthulhus and Yog-Sothoths for good measure.

“The Simon Necronomicon reads its ancient sources through a combination of medieval demonology, 19th-century Theosophy, and 20th-century pulp fiction,” McKee writes.

The book didn't gain much traction beyond occult enthusiasts and edgy teenager cliques, but it did attract some popular attention during the trial of Rod Ferrell. In 1996, Ferrell and a group of friends murdered the parents of Heather Wendorf and then stole the family's Ford Explorer. When the police apprehended the teens, they found copies of the Simon Necronomicon and The Witches' Bible in the car.

Testimony at the trial revealed that Ferrell believed he was a vampire and his friends had formed a small cultish group named the “Vampire Clan.” His elaborate fantasy world, likely a mental escape from his otherwise harsh life, was constructed from extensive reading of not only occult works but also ancient prophetic and apocalyptic literature.

“The general public knows just enough about the history of the ancient Near East for it to view it as a place of mystery and strangeness,” McKee writes. “We actually know quite a lot about ancient Near Eastern cultures and their religious practices […], but historical fabrications expect and depend on ignorance. The more we learn, and the better we communicate that knowledge, the more tools we will have for opposing misconstructed history.”

While hoaxes and literary conspiracies can be provocative, they seldom have consequences more far-reaching than filling online listicles or breaking awkward silences at parties. But much like inspiring a vampire cult, they can sometimes motivate violent action. The Turner Diaries — a novel depicting an apocalyptic race war that has gained a reputation as the “bible of the racist right” — inspired Timothy McVeigh's 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building.

Hoaxes and lay theories can also be actively weaponized to inspire violent action and conspiratorial worldviews. Hate propaganda can manipulate emotions, twist facts, and propagate outright lies, and as far as this use of writing goes, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion has to take the cake. It's a bloody, disgusting cake, but it takes it.

The Protocols is a fake document purporting to be the minutes of a meeting of Jewish leaders. During this fictitious meeting, members plan how they will take over the world and bring down Christianity. (Hot tip: Don't take down the minutes of your global criminal conspiracies. The paper trail always comes back on you.) 

While the origin of The Protocols is unknown, a Czarist official in Moscow named Sergei Nilus was one of the first to publish the hoax in 1905. He edited and released several versions afterward, each time adding a new account of how he happened upon it. 

Since its initial dissemination, the document has been used to “prove” that a group of Jewish elites is conspiring for world domination. For instance, after the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the Bolshevik Party's rise to power, it was used to explain how “International Jewry” was to blame for communism, hence the term “Judeo-Bolshevism.” In fact, one reason there are so many variations of The Protocols is that they were adopted and adapted over the years by different antisemitic groups and narratives — each time being tweaked to fit that particular group's grievances.

The Protocols spread like wildfire during the first half of the 20th century, circulating worldwide and inspiring other books and hateful rhetoric. The role it played in the rise of the Nazi Party and Hitler's own writing is well-documented. Henry Ford's antisemitic volumes, The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem (1920), were based on and included elements from it.

For more than 100 years, The Protocols has been used as a way to scapegoat, slander, and justify the murder of Jews, all despite being disproven as early as the 1920s. In his book The Myth of the Jewish Menace in World Affairs (1921), British diplomat and journalist Lucien Wolf debunked the hate propaganda, even noting how parts of The Protocols were plagiarized from a German novel in which the literal devil supports the Jews.

In the preface to his book, Wolf calls out his fellow Englishmen for spreading such disinformation: 

“I confess to a feeling of shame at having to write this pamphlet at all. That reputable newspapers in this country should be seeking to transplant here the seeds of Prussian anti-Semitism, and that they should employ for this purpose devices so questionable and a literature so melodramatically silly, cannot but cause a sense of humiliation to any self-respecting Englishman.”

Like Delia Bacon's unwillingness to accept the simple answer that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays, adherents of The Protocols allow their pre-existing biases to shape their worldview. Rather than letting the evidence influence their belief, the belief bends and distorts reality to a point where all evidence must fit within it or be discarded. Unlike Bacon's story, however, The Protocols show that literary conspiracy theories aren't guaranteed to remain on the fringe.

A new software package detailed by Chinese scientists promises to tell what time it is on the moon, accounting for effects of relativity.

Did you ever wonder what time it is on the moon? A software package developed by researchers in China can finally tell you.

The model, built by a team from the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing and the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, was detailed in a paper published in December 2025 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The new lunar timekeeping method promises to remain accurate over a 1,000-year time span.

But why create a distinct lunar clock in the first place? For the answer, we turn — as we so often do — to Albert Einstein.

Because the moon has less gravity than Earth does, time passes slightly differently there. This effect was first predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. For every 24 hours that pass here on terra firma, the moon gains about 56 microseconds, according to NASA.

While small, this discrepancy adds up over prolonged periods — a fact that could pose major issues for future crewed moon missions, like NASA's Artemis initiative or Russia and China's joint International Lunar Research Station. (Mars is an even bigger challenge, with clocks there ticking about 477 microseconds faster per Earth day.)

Astronauts living and working on the moon will need to be able to coordinate video calls, data sharing, and navigation with their Earthbound colleagues — hence the need for an algorithm that can reliably convert Earth time to moon time. In 2024, researchers introduced the idea of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL), an equation that resolves this relativistic time dilation based on the distance from a particular point on the moon relative to Earth's gravitational field.

""This is not just about telling time — it's about navigation, communication, and safety,"" Sergei Kopeikin, an astronomer at the University of Missouri and co-author of the TCL paper, told Live Science in an email.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The new system from the team in China builds on Kopeikin's original algorithm. It essentially calculates a version of the TCL equation very quickly while considering some additional factors, like Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), an International Astronomical Union standard. The researchers dubbed the system ""lunar time ephemeris,"" or LTE440.

Kopeikin called LTE440 ""a solid piece of engineering."" It shows that China is serious about moving forward with its ambitious moon program. However, he noted that NASA is still developing its own lunar time system, called Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC). The agency aims to finalize the system, which will be anchored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for maximum interoperability across time zones, by the end of this year.

—Scientists finally find explanation for lopsided cloud that follows Earth's moon through space

—We were wrong about how the moon's largest and oldest crater formed — and that's great news for NASA's next lunar landing

—Scientists scan famous 'Earthrise' crater on mission to find alien life in our solar system

Likewise, the European Space Agency is currently fielding applications for its own moon clock. These systems may use LTE440 as a benchmark to cross-check space agencies' calculations, but it remains to be seen whether the Chinese system will become the international standard.

Ultimately, the moon's time standard needs to be coordinated across countries, or else we risk plunging lunar research into chaos. ""If we fail,"" Kopeikin said, ""we risk a 'time zone war' in space.""

            Tess Coward, a 27-year-old PR professional based in New York City, woke up feeling under the weather on Wednesday. But without the ability to make phone calls or receive text messages, she couldn't get in touch with her doctor or log into the provider's patient portal.
    


            Coward is one of thousands left without cell service on Wednesday when a major Verizon outage prevented customers who were on the go from texting, accessing the internet or placing phone calls across the United States. The problem lasted for hours and was resolved shortly before 10:30 p.m. Eastern Wednesday evening.
    


            Verizon has not yet revealed the cause behind the outage, but it said on Thursday morning that it will credit customers $20.
    


            The disruption was yet another sign of how vulnerable American society is to Internet outages, coming after a massive Amazon Web Services issue took down large swaths of the web in October. In February 2024, AT&T's network went down for nearly an entire day.
    


            Coward said she was unable to contact her doctor until Thursday morning,
    


            “If I needed anything in that moment, I couldn't get it,” she told CNN in an interview. “And I know that's how a lot of people felt.”
    


            Health care systems will typically send a text message with a code to patients to verify their identity when logging in. But Coward couldn't receive those messages because she was impacted by the outage.
    


            Coward said her feelings grew from physically unwell to anxious.
    


            “I feel like people are feeling it emotionally a lot more than I think Verizon would care to notice,” she said.
    


            Her experience echoes others shared on social media feeds, which were littered with  stories from frustrated subscribers who couldn't find their way without Google Maps. Many reported their phones being stuck in SOS mode or losing access to service.
    


            Network outages can be particularly frustrating for gig-economy workers, including Uber drivers and DoorDashers, who rely on working cell signals for their livelihoods.
    


            New York City Emergency Management said on Wednesday that it was monitoring the situation and coordinating with utility providers and other partners to “asses any potential effects on city agencies & essential services.”
    


            Verizon has not revealed how many consumers were impacted. But Downdetector, a website that aggregates and analyzes user-submitted outage reports at major online services, said more than 178,000 reports were filed within a 15-minute window at the outage's peak. It also said it received 1 million issue reports within a 24-hour period.
    


            Verizon hasn't said why the service disruption occurred. But software issues can sometimes cause outages like these, according to Susan Welsh de Grimaldo, a Gartner analyst covering the communications industry. Networks have become increasingly reliant on software, which she says can present some “points of weakness and challenges.”
    


            While updates can improve the network and consumer experience, they also mean “more frequent configuration changes” and updates, some of which are automated, she said.
    


            A software issue temporarily disrupted service for AT&T consumers in 2024, for example. And the AWS disruption from October came down to a bug that occurred when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously during an update.
    


            “And so, if just some small thing is off, it can cause an issue, and it can trigger through the system in multiple locations,” she said, adding that there are often outages consumers don't notice because they're addressed early enough.
    


            For Coward, Wednesday's outage isn't enough to motivate her to switch carriers. But another one might.
    


            “In today's age, you rely so much on your phone without even realizing,” she said. “It's hard to think that might not always be a possibility.”

Saks Global estimated its assets and liabilities both fall within a range of US$1-billion to US$10-billion, according to court filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.Brendan McDermid/Reuters

The U.S. department store company that was split off from Hudson's Bay Co. a little over one year ago – just weeks before Canada's oldest retailer began insolvency proceedings – has now filed for bankruptcy protection, compounding a retail industry catastrophe that has ravaged some of the sector's biggest names.

Saks Global Holdings LLC, which owns luxury retailers Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, was created in December of 2024 when company HBC LP acquired Neiman in a US$2.65-billion deal. At the time, HBC spun off its American assets into Saks Global, a separate entity from Hudson's Bay, which filed for court protection from its creditors last March and was forced to liquidate all its stores across Canada.

But under the continued stewardship of executive chairman Richard Baker – also the executive chairman of Hudson's Bay – Saks Global struggled with the significant debt it took on in the Neiman deal. The stores fell significantly behind on payments to vendors, a common sign of trouble in the retail industry. 

Late on Tuesday, Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection. Then, on Wednesday, the company announced it had secured a US$1.75-billion financing package from its senior bondholders and lenders.

The fall of Hudson's Bay: How Richard Baker presided over the failure of a retail icon

As part of that announcement Wednesday, Saks also said that Mr. Baker had stepped down as executive chairman and chief executive officer. He had held the latter title for less than two weeks, since the departure of former CEO Marc Metrick.

“We all saw this coming for a long, long time,” said Joseph Sarachek, a bankruptcy attorney who represents several vendors collectively owed millions of dollars by Saks. “They had too much debt, and not enough sales to service that debt.” 

Saks Global estimated its assets and liabilities both fall within a range of US$1-billion to US$10-billion, according to court filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.

Mr. Baker's takeover of Neiman Marcus – which had previously gone through bankruptcy proceedings during the COVID-19 pandemic – united the three most prominent names in U.S. luxury department stores.

But the deal weighed Saks down with debt at a time when department store customer traffic was already in decline. Luxury brands that previously depended on such retailers have increasingly been building their own stores and embracing e-commerce, after years of seeing it as a déclassé environment that would damage their brands.

Some of the industry's top luxury names have racked up significant unpaid bills from Saks, including Chanel Ltd.; LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, and Christian Louboutin.ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images

“Ultimately, it didn't make any sense, because both companies were struggling,” David Swartz, a senior equity analyst who covers the department store industry with Morningstar Inc., said of the merger. “You don't take two unhealthy retailers, put them together and create a healthy retailer.”

Some of the industry's top luxury names have racked up significant unpaid bills from Saks. They include Chanel Ltd., which has a US$136-million claim; LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, which is owed roughly US$26-million; Christian Louboutin, which has a claim of US$21.6-million; and Brunello Cucinelli SpA, owed US$21.3-million, according to court filings.

Once suppliers stop being paid, some inevitably cut shipments to stores – further thinning out the product selection and hurting customer perceptions of the brand, a situation Mr. Swartz called a “death spiral” for any retailer.

On Dec. 30, Saks Global missed an interest payment of more than US$100-million that was owed to the bondholders. In a bid to generate cash, the company sold real estate – its Neiman Marcus store in Beverly Hills – a strategy the parent company has employed before. In 2023, after falling behind on payments to suppliers, HBC completed a series of real estate transactions worth US$340-million to fund its retail operations.

The Saks bankruptcy proceedings are designed to allow the company to come up with a plan to restructure its operations. The financing package includes $1-billion in debtor-in-possession financing from the bondholders, allowing stores to remain open while the company pursues “ongoing transformation” of the business amid U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings. Another US$500-million from the bondholder group will be available once Saks emerges from bankruptcy protection, expected later this year, according to the company. A further US$240-million in liquidity comes from the company's asset-based lenders.

Opinion: Hudson's Bay was a ‘zombie firm.' Canada is full of them and they all need to die

“There's no question the department-store genre was in a slow, miserable decline. The decline was countered, poorly, by consolidation,” said Mark Cohen, former CEO of Sears Canada and former long-time director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. Mr. Cohen believes Mr. Baker mismanaged the companies, monetizing real estate assets while the retail operations were allowed to decline.

“Did the Bay have to go down the drain? The answer is no. What the businesses required was strategy and skill to accommodate the fact that competition surrounded them,” he said. 

The top 30 creditors in the Saks bankruptcy that have the largest unsecured claims – meaning they fall behind the company's major lenders, whose secured debt must be paid back first – are owed just over US$700-million in total, according to court documents. That is the largest amount owed to a top 30 list that Mr. Sarachek said he had ever seen in a retail bankruptcy, and it does not include many suppliers that are deeply affected by the bankruptcy case. 

“I asked what happens if they don't get paid,” he said of one client, who is owed roughly US$600,000 and relies on Saks for the majority of their sales. “She said, ‘I go out of business.'”

“Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in,” said Chuck Schumer.

Vice President JD Vance broke a tied Senate vote to block advancement of a war powers resolution that would have stopped President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Senate Republicans used a procedural maneuver Wednesday night to halt debate on the Vietnam War-era statute that gives Congress a check on the president's deployments abroad. 

Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri flipped on their previous votes to advance the resolution, splitting support at 50-50 — and delivering a victory to Trump, who had strongly criticized Republican senators who earlier defected from the administration.

Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted to keep the effort alive in the Senate. Paul is the only Republican co-sponsor of the bill. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was the leading Democratic co-sponsor.

Young said while he “strongly” believes Congress must be involved in any decisions about the commitment of U.S. troops, administration officials assured him that is not the state of play in Venezuela.

“After numerous conversations with senior national security officials, I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela. I've also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,” Young said in a written statement after he cast his vote.

The vote came less than a week after Young and Hawley were among the  five Senate Republicans who broke with party ranks to move the resolution across an initial procedural hurdle — a rare rebuke of Trump from some in his own party.

Trump pointedly attacked the five GOP senators after they voted, writing on his Truth Social platform that the lawmakers “should never be elected to office again.” 

Senate Republicans argued a resolution to rein in Trump's military actions against Venezuela is not relevant because “there's no troops there, there is nothing to terminate,” as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim Risch said on the floor ahead of the vote.

“Now, I know some of my colleagues will argue that a vote for this resolution is a prospective statement about limiting future action in Venezuela. That's not what it says. They argue, ‘we still have ships in the Caribbean, and clearly the president is ready to invade again,' they say. But again, that is not what the resolution says. … No language in this resolution addresses future action,” said Risch, R-Idaho, who moved to table the measure.

The vote came 11 days after U.S. special forces apprehended Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their bedroom during a surprise overnight raid. The couple was wanted by U.S. authorities on federal drug and conspiracy charges.

The vote also comes after a monthslong bombing campaign on small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in which U.S. strikes killed more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists,” according to U.S. Southern Command.

Within an hour before senators voted to block any advancement of the war powers resolution, Trump posted on social media that he “had a very good call” Thursday morning with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez.

“We are making tremendous progress, as we help Venezuela stabilize and recover. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security. This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump wrote on his own platform, Truth Social.

Trump hosted oil executives at the White House Friday for a meeting on potential investment in Venezuela's oil industry. Prior to the meeting, the president announced the South American nation had already agreed to give the U.S. between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil. Trump said he would control the money made from the sale.

Paul and Democratic sponsors of the war powers resolution vehemently disagreed with the GOP statements about the U.S. presence in and around Venezuela.

“You don't have to be a great expert in military affairs to know that we are heavily engaged,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, ahead of the vote.

“Donald Trump says we're not engaged in hostilities? Tell that to the 16,000 U.S. service members currently deployed in the Caribbean. Tell that to our service members on the Ford carrier strike force. Look at the Marine expeditionary unit operating in the region,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in before one mistake ignites a larger, more unstable conflict.”

Kaine likened the Republicans' procedural move to “a parliamentary gag rule on discussion of this military operation.”

“If this cause and if this legal basis were so righteous and so lawful, the administration and its supporters would not be so afraid to have this debate before the public and the United States Senate,” Kaine said on the floor ahead of the vote.

Paul said the administration's claim that Venezuela is not an official war is “an absurdity.”

“The invasion of another country, blockading of a country and removing another country's leader, to my mind, clearly, is war,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote.

U.S. Southern Command declined to confirm Wednesday the exact number of troops and warships present in the region.

Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said more than 100 were killed in the raid, according to numerous media outlets that posted a video of his statement. The Cuban government announced on Facebook 32 of its citizens were among the dead.

Seven U.S. troops were injured in the incursion, according to the Pentagon. Five returned to work within days after the attack, while two were still recovering as of Jan. 8. Pentagon officials declined to comment further on their conditions Wednesday.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

MOSCOW, January 15. /TASS/. The West doesn't give Iran's political system the credit it deserves, as it has proven resilient through both internal crises and external pressures, a German journalist and director of the publishing house Multipolar Press, Constantin von Hoffmeister told TASS in an interview.

""Western narratives often portray the Iranian government as fragile, unpopular, and close to collapse. These narratives repeat themselves year after year. Their persistence should itself provoke doubt,"" the expert said.

The journalist stressed that ""a system that survives war with Iraq, decades of sanctions, assassinations of its scientists, cyberattacks, and constant pressure is not fragile. It is resilient.""

According to von Hoffmeister, this does not mean there is no social tension, but it shows that hardships actually strengthen the state system's resilience.

""The United States and Israel know this. That is why they hesitate. An open attempt to overthrow the Iranian system risks unifying society around the state. External threats strengthen internal discipline. This has been proven repeatedly,"" the expert added.

Unrest in Iran began on December 29, sparked by street protests over the sharp decline in the rial's value. The protests quickly spread to most major cities. Authorities reported that approximately 40 law enforcement officers were killed during the unrest. Since January 8, armed terrorists have appeared among the demonstrators, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a statement. The country's authorities have accused Israel and the United States of orchestrating the riots. US President Donald Trump had previously warned that he was seriously considering the possibility of using force against the Islamic Republic.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Three House members claim they're being targeted for saying that troops don't need to comply with illegal orders

Three House Democrats confirmed on Wednesday they have been approached by federal prosecutors investigating their participation in a November video about military duty, widening the circle of legislators being targeted by the Trump administration.

Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania disclosed that the US attorney's office for the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, had requested interviews about the 90-second video in which they said troops don't need to comply with illegal orders.

“Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn't like,” Crow said in a statement. “Now he's pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable. I won't be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country.”

Goodlander framed the government's response as alarming and instructive.

“No matter the threats, I am not backing down,” she said in a video posted on X. “It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the president, our commander in chief, to threaten violence against me, and to weaponize the Department of Justice.”

Goodlander added that she once served in the Department of Justice and she knew “that federal prosecutors have more control over the life and liberty of the American people than any other peacetime force”.

The announcements bring the number of lawmakers who have publicly confirmed contact with federal prosecutors to five, after the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin's revelation on Tuesday that she was under investigation. The Pentagon secretary, Pete Hegseth, formally censured the Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a retired navy captain, in January and launched administrative proceedings that could result in rank reduction and pension cuts. Kelly has responded with litigation, arguing the Pentagon's actions violate constitutional protections.

The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence. In it, they reminded service members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey illegal commands – a principle regularly taught in military training.

Trump said the message was “seditious” and floated the possibility of capital punishment, though he subsequently walked back the death penalty reference while insisting the lawmakers remained in serious jeopardy. Everyone in the video – which also included the Pennsylvania representative Chris Deluzio – have now been contacted by either the FBI or federal prosecutors regarding their message to service members.

“By sending the FBI and now DoJ after Rep Deluzio and the other members of Congress who stated the law in a recent video, it's obvious that this administration is engaged in a harassment campaign against their political rivals,” Deluzio spokesperson Zoe Bluffstone said. “Congressman Deluzio won't be intimidated and will keep doing the job he was elected to do.”

Houlahan suggested the investigation's true motivation was stifling political speech. “The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn't want anyone to hear,” she told NBC News in a statement.

The federal targeting represents an extraordinary use of prosecutorial power against sitting legislators for protected political speech. According to Crow's office, Pirro's office reached out last week seeking an interview about the video.

Government watchdog groups have condemned the investigations as authoritarian overreach. David Janovsky, acting director of the constitution project at the project on government oversight, described the prosecutions as an assault on constitutional principles. “A sitting president attempting to prosecute his political opponents just for saying something he disagrees with is a hallmark of authoritarianism,” he said in a statement.

The lawmakers had encountered an earlier round of federal interest in November, when FBI agents approached congressional security officials seeking interviews. Four of the House members responded with a joint statement accusing Trump of deploying the bureau “as a tool to intimidate and harass” the lawmakers.

In her own video statement about the investigation on Tuesday, Slotkin accused Trump of following a familiar authoritarian pattern. “To be clear, this is the president's playbook,” she said. “Truth doesn't matter. Facts don't matter, and anyone who disagrees with him becomes an enemy, and he then weaponizes the federal government against them.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Protests continue across state and governor urges peace one week after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good

Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota in response to protests in Minneapolis against federal immigration enforcement operations, as Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, overnight urged demonstrators in Minneapolis to be peaceful amid escalating tensions.

In a post on Truth Social on Thursday morning, Trump said he would institute the Insurrection Act and “quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place” in Minnesota if the “corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE”.

Later on Thursday morning, Walz put out a statement: “I am making a direct appeal to the president: let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are. And an appeal to Minnesotans: I know this is scary. We can – we must – speak out loudly, urgently but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.”

Trump's warning on Thursday that he might invoke the Insurrection Act came as, overnight, Walz urged people in Minneapolis to protest peacefully after it was reported on Wednesday evening that a federal officer had shot a man in the leg during an immigration enforcement operation on the north side of the city.

The incident sparked protests in Minneapolis on Wednesday night, as the city remains on edge just one week after a federal immigration officer there shot and killed Renee Nicole Good.

“State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis,” Walz wrote on X overnight. “I know you're angry. I'm angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don't give him what he wants.”

The Guardian reported that several hundred protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday night. At a news conference later, the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O'Hara, said that protesters had been “engaging in unlawful behavior” and urged people to leave the area.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said that the shooting occurred on Wednesday as “federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela”. The DHS alleged that the man resisted and attacked an officer, and said that two other individuals emerged from a “nearby apartment and also attacked” the officer, who, the department said “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. The federal government's account could not immediately be verified.

The city of Minneapolis has said that the man who was shot was taken to a local hospital with “apparent non-life-threatening injuries”.

On Wednesday evening, Walz delivered remarks on the ongoing federal presence in Minnesota, in which he said that “news reports simply don't do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities”.

Walz said that between 2,000 and 3,000 armed federal agents had been deployed across the state and claimed that the ICE agents, whom he described as “armed”, “masked” and “undertrained”, were “going door to door ordering people to point out where their neighbors of color live”.

“They're pulling over people indiscriminately, including US citizens, and demanding to see their papers,” Walz said.

“Just plain grabbing Minnesotans and shoving them into unmarked vans, kidnapping innocent people with no warning and no due process,” he added.

“Let's be very, very clear,” Walz said. “This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

During his remarks, Walz called on Trump and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, to “end this occupation”.

“You've done enough,” he said.

On Thursday, Noem told reporters that she had “no plans to pull out of Minnesota” and describes the conditions on the ground in Minnesota “as violent, and a violation of the law in many places”.

Noem also said she discussed the Insurrection Act with Trump on Thursday morning, and that Trump “certainly has the constitutional authority to utilize that”.

“If anything doesn't change with Governor Walz, I don't anticipate the streets getting any safer or more peaceful,” Noem added.

Asked about what it would take for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act during the White House press briefing on Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said: “That's only a question, frankly, the president can answer,” adding that Trump's statement on Truth Social on Thursday morning “spoke very loud and clear to Democrats across this country, elected officials who are using their platforms to encourage violence against federal law enforcement officers”.

Earlier this week, multiple federal prosecutors in Minnesota and Washington DC resigned over the Trump administration's handling of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Good. Six attorneys from the US attorney's office in Minnesota quit on Tuesday, reportedly over the justice department's reluctance to investigate the ICE agent who fatally shot Good. A justice department spokesperson confirmed the resignations in a statement to the Guardian but denied they were related to the Minneapolis shooting.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota announced on Thursday afternoon that it had filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of three community members, alleging that immigration agents violated their constitutional rights.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Countries such as Canada may have no choice but to realign themselves if U.S. President Donald Trump intends to dictate from his office, based on his 'morality,' which smaller nations will be granted sovereignty and which won't.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

Last week, after the United States sent troops into Caracas to capture Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan dictator, the Trump administration made some shocking boasts about American power in the 21st century.

U.S. President Donald Trump said that the international laws meant to prevent powerful nations from preying on weaker ones are irrelevant to him, and that the only thing that constrains his use of dominant military force is “my own morality.”

One of his chief advisers, Stephen Miller, was just as blunt. “We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties,” he said. “But we live in a world, in the real world […] that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.”

This “might is right” posturing was not unexpected, given that the Trump administration had announced it late last year in its National Security Strategy. But to see it suddenly in action was still jarring. An emboldened Mr. Trump followed up the Caracas coup by renewing his threat to take Greenland, without ruling out military force.

As this space has said, the Trump administration's claim that power, not law, provides legitimacy does indeed date back to ancient times – the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, to be exact, when Athens told the island state of Melos to surrender or face annihilation. 

Editorial: A history lesson on the future of living beside the U.S.

The Athenian general and historian Thucydides famously summed up Athens' attitude when he wrote that “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

But is it true, as Mr. Miller claims, that it is an “iron law” that the world is governed by strength and power, and that international laws are mere niceties?

On the contrary, history teaches us that countries that forgo the legitimacy and stability gained from respect for the rule of law often do not last long. Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany and Hitler's Thousand Year Reich: they were all built on fear and seemingly overwhelming military power. But they didn't last long once a coalition, reacting to their aggression, got rolling. 

Today, a big reason the U.S. is in a position of economic dominance is the rules-based liberal order it helped to create after the Second World War.

Mr. Trump and his advisers are now pretending that never happened and are returning to an era of unchecked power that has repeatedly been rejected as unworkable, but only after great catastrophes.

Editorial: In a national emergency, Canada does not have a moment to lose

One historic instance of that was the Congress of Vienna in 1815. An attempt to rebalance power in Europe after the disastrous Napoleonic Wars, it is criticized for cementing the powers of the great kingdoms of that era, but it is also praised for bringing a century of relative peace to the continent, and for its recognition that diplomacy, not dominance, creates stability and prosperity.

The real lesson of history, Napoleon included, is that unchecked might makes right for only a short period of time. Countries that rely on force alone for legitimacy can quickly become overextended and isolated.

Already, America's allies are questioning the reliability of an administration that blithely boasts that no one can stop it from seizing Greenland, as Mr. Miller did. 

They are also, by necessity, beginning to explore ways to limit their reliance on the American market. This week, for instance, Prime Minister Mark Carney is in China hoping to reset trade relations with Beijing.

Countries such as Canada may have no choice but to realign themselves if Mr. Trump intends to dictate from his office, based on his “morality,” which smaller nations will be granted sovereignty and which won't, and on what bullying terms that sovereignty will be permitted. 

In regurgitating its own version of the tired contention that “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,” the U.S. is also overlooking an important fact: the Athenians sacked Melos, but lost the war with Sparta. 

It's worth remembering, too, that Napoleon, for all his military brilliance, only held sway over Europe for 15 years and died alone in exile.

He and other would-be strongmen found out that, given time, the iron law of might corrodes. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump and his administration may well be planting the seeds of American decline.

The Insurrection Act empowers the president to deploy the US military domestically to suppress civil unrest.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

On Thursday morning, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a federal law that allows presidents to deploy the U.S. military domestically under certain circumstances, purportedly to help enforce local law enforcement amid civil unrest.

Trump baselessly claimed that military presence is necessary in Minnesota's Twin Cities to quell protests against his administration's deployment of thousands of federal immigration agents and their violent raids of immigrant communities. His threat comes a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renée Nicole Good, who was attempting to drive away as agents surrounded her car.

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 

The Insurrection Act gives presidents broad military authority over whatever geographical area they deem necessary. The act reads, in part, that: 

Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.

It's likely that, if Trump does invoke the act, state and local officials in Minnesota will file a lawsuit seeking to block the action, citing the fact that laws can still be enforced in the cities and that the “ordinary course of judicial proceedings” is not being interfered with. A challenge purporting that Trump's invocation of the act is politically motivated could also be brought forward. 

But a legal challenge on any basis would face an uphill battle, as the Insurrection Act does not itself have an explicit oversight provision. 

Meanwhile, there is myriad video evidence demonstrating instances of federal immigration officials attacking demonstrators in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and other parts of the country without provocation.

On Wednesday night, just a week after the killing of Renée Nicole Good, federal agents in Minneapolis shot a man in the leg, prompting residents to turn out in droves to protest the agency.

“There is still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a press conference following the shooting. “We have ICE agents throughout our city and throughout our state who along with Border Patrol are creating chaos.”

Public Citizen, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting consumer rights and democracy, blasted Trump for threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act.

“This rarely used federal law would allow him to deploy the U.S. military or federalize the National Guard against the American people,” the group said in a Bluesky post. “His authoritarianism is out of control.”

Alejandra Caraballo, a Harvard Law clinical instructor and a frequent critic of the administration's abuses of power, recognized that Trump's threat could itself be a means to compel obedience from local officials. 

“The city is already under occupation by federal forces,” and the threat of the Insurrection Act could be Trump's attempting to “scar[e] local electeds into cracking down for him and having preemptive compliance,” Caraballo said. 

Polling shows deep opposition to Trump using the military to carry out his policies, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll in October showing that nearly 6 in 10 Americans (58 percent) believe a president should deploy troops to areas of the U.S. only when there is an external threat. 

More recent polling shows stark opposition to Trump's immigration policies in general. A CNN/SSRS survey published this week finds that 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration, and 52 percent believe his administration's mass deportation efforts have gone too far. 

Furthermore, only 31 percent say ICE is making American cities safer, while 51 percent say the agency is making cities less safe, the poll found.

HONG KONG (AP) — Taiwan-based TSMC, the world's largest computer chipmaker, plans to increase its capital spending by as much as nearly 40% this year after it reported a 35% jump in its net profit for the latest quarter thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence, the company said Thursday.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a major supplier to companies including Nvidia and Apple, reported a net profit of 506 billion new Taiwan dollars ($16 billion) for the October-December quarter, a 35% surge from a year earlier, better than analysts' estimates.

TSMC said Thursday that its revenue in the last quarter increased 21% from a year earlier to more than 1.046 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($33 billion).

TSMC said it plans to boost its capital expenditure budget to $52 billion-$56 billion for 2026, up from about $40 billion last year.

The company's Taiwan-listed shares have jumped 59% over the past 12 months, reflecting its strong position in the AI-driven market.

Other tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet are spending big on investments in AI infrastructure.

“We expect our business to be supported by continuous strong demand for our leading edge process technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC's chief financial officer, said in a conference call. He said spending would be “significantly higher” in the next three years.

Asked about concerns over an AI bubble -- as critics point to ballooning investments which might not pay off -- TSMC chairman and CEO C. C. Wei said he is confident that the growing demand from customers is real.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“I'm also very nervous about it, you bet,” said Wei. “AI is real. Not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life.”




With a market capitalization -- total outstanding shares times share price -- of approximately $1.4 trillion, TSMC is currently more valuable than Samsung Electronics and Alibaba. It is Asia's most valuable listed company.

Alphabet, Google's parent, passed the $4 trillion market capitalization mark this month, the fourth Big Tech company to hit that mark after Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, although worries about an AI bubble had led to occasional sell-offs.

TSMC has pledged around $165 billion of investments in the U.S. and said Thursday it's speeding up construction of new plants in Arizona, looking to create a fabrication plant cluster and meet strong demand from clients.

A primary beneficiary of AI, given its dominant share in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, TSMC's outlook remains optimistic, analysts from Morningstar said in a recent report.

“It (TSMC) is immune from market share shifts as almost every AI company relies on TSMC to make chips ranging from application-specific integrated circuits to GPUs (graphics processing units),” the Morningstar analysts said. “This reliance translates into strong pricing power.”

TSMC also has strong buffers with a “robust backlog from deep-pocketed customers,” they said, even if there are any short-term drops in demand.

The nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy appeared increasingly smothered Thursday, a week on from authorities shutting the country off from the world and escalating a bloody crackdown that activists say killed at least 2,615 people.

President Donald Trump says he's heard from “very important sources” on the other side” that planned executions in Iran were stopped. Asked if military strikes were off the table, Trump said: “No, we're going to watch and see what the process is.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy appeared increasingly smothered Thursday, a week after authorities shut the country off from the world and escalated a bloody crackdown that activists say has killed at least 2,637 people.

The prospect of U.S. retaliation for the protesters' deaths still hung over the region, though President Donald Trump signaled a possible de-escalation, saying the killing appeared to be ending. The White House stressed that “all options remain on the table.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. announced new sanctions on Iranian officials accused of suppressing the protests, which began late last month over the country's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency. The Group of Seven industrialized democracies and the European Union said they too were looking at new sanctions to ratchet up the pressure on Iran's theocratic government.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Iran for Thursday afternoon at the request of the United States.

In Iran's capital, Tehran, witnesses said recent mornings showed no new signs of bonfires lit the night before or debris in the streets. The sound of gunfire, which had been intense for several nights, has also faded.

Iranian state media has announced wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls “terrorists” while also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, which offer the only way to get videos and images out to the internet.




“Since Jan. 8, we saw a full-fledged war, and anybody who was in the gathering since then is a criminal,” said Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi, according to a report Wednesday from the judiciary's Mizan news agency.

Iranian state media broadcast a roster of damage from the protests, which it called a “terrorist operation,” including damage to hundreds of stores and public buildings, scores of cars and ambulances and several “heritage sites.” including mosques and shrines.

China's foreign ministry said Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told his Chinese counterpart that the situation in the country was now stable.

But as Iran tries to assert control at home, it has signaled worries about threats from abroad, including the United States, which has threatened military action over the killing of peaceful demonstrators. Tensions soared after Trump's comment Tuesday that “help is on its way” to Iranian protesters.

The Islamic Republic shut down its airspace for hours early Thursday without explanation, something it has done in previous rounds of attacks between it and Israel, as well as during the 12-day war in June. The U.S. moved some personnel from Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base while warning diplomats in Kuwait to stay away from military bases where American troops are stationed. Britain closed its Tehran embassy and withdrew British staff from Iran.

The Israeli military said it had raised the level of readiness for possible missile attacks, though guidelines for Israeli civilians, including the size of gatherings and whether people needed to stay within a certain distance of a shelter, were unchanged.

The Iranian airspace closure lasted for over four hours, according to pilot guidance issued by Iran, which lies on a key east-west flight route. International carriers diverted north and south around Iran, but after one extension, the closure appeared to have expired, and several domestic flights were in the air just after 7 a.m.

Even before the closure, several international airlines had reduced or suspended services to Iran, “and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said the website SafeAirspace, which provides information on conflict areas and air travel. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defense, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”

In the past, Iran has misidentified a commercial aircraft as a hostile target. In 2020, Iranian air defense shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 with two surface-to-air missiles, killing all 176 people on board.

Videos of demonstrations have stopped coming out of Iran, likely signaling the slowdown of their pace under the heavy security force presence in major cities. In the meantime, protests against Iran have been held around the world as global attention has focused on the crackdown.

Trump made a series of statements that left unclear what action, if any, the U.S. would take. A day after threatening action, he said Wednesday that he had it on good authority that the executions would be halted. On Thursday, he hailed as “good news” reports that a protester's death sentence had been lifted.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that 800 executions had been scheduled to take place. She said the president and his team had communicated to Iranian officials that there would be “grave consequences” if more protesters were killed.

“All options remain on the table for the president,” she said.

Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, urged the U.S. to find a solution through negotiation.

Asked by Fox News what he would say to Trump, Araghchi said: “My message is: Between war and diplomacy, diplomacy is a better way, although we don't have any positive experience from the United States. But still diplomacy is much better than war.”

Activists warned that hangings of detainees could come soon, though Araghchi said “there is no plan for hanging.”

The apparent lowering of the temperature followed lobbying by Middle Eastern governments, which urged the Trump administration not to strike Iran out of fear that an attack could explode into all-out war.

Among those hit with U.S. sanctions Thursday was the secretary of Iran's Supreme Council for National Security, whom the Treasury Department accuses of being one of the first officials to call for violence against protesters. The Group of Seven, of which the U.S. is a member, also warned they could impose more sanctions if Iran's crackdown continues.

European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc was looking at strengthening sanctions “to push forward that this regime comes to an end and that there is change.”

The clampdown on the demonstrations has killed at least 2,637, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The figure reported Thursday is an increase of 22 from the figure a day earlier, and the organization says the number will likely continue to climb. The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The U.S.-based agency, founded 20 years ago, has been accurate throughout multiple years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities.

With communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the group's toll. The Iranian government has not provided casualty figures.

Donald Trump is determined to maintain Republicans' threadbare House majority this fall and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when Democrats won control of the chamber in midterm elections and went on to impeach him twice. 

This time, Trump is involved in candidate recruiting, dispensing strategic advice and promising he will not let history repeat. But a number of moving pieces and unanswered questions remain.

Democrats, buoyed by the results of several 2025 elections, are more than eager for the president to be the GOP front man, though they also must improve their stock with voters and attract growing numbers of independents. Ongoing redistricting battles, spurred on by Trump, could affect the eventual outcome. As Trump tries not to repeat 2018, he also is fighting midterm trends that have gone against a president's party for generations.

While House control is at the center of the midterms, which party holds the majority will be settled by a small share of the chamber's 435 seats. Democrats are targeting nearly 40 Republican-held districts, while Republicans are aiming for a few dozen seats held by Democrats. 

Here are some key questions and data to explain the fight ahead. 




The party in the White House rarely gains seats or even holds ground in the midterms. Sometimes the losses are steep, especially in the first midterms of a presidency. Second-term presidents struggle, too. 

“It's an amazing phenomenon,” Trump acknowledged at a recent House Republican retreat.

The 2026 dynamics do not compare perfectly with the past: Trump is neither a traditional new president nor a traditional second-term president because he is in a second but nonconsecutive term. 




Regardless, since 1932, the sitting president's party has lost an average of 26 House seats, and only three times has the president's party gained seats. The last time it happened was 2002: Republicans picked up seats in the first national elections after the 9/11 attacks that made George W. Bush a wartime president at the time of the midterms.

Every other president since 1992, including Trump in 2018, has seen House control shift to the opposition in the first midterm after flipping control of the Oval Office. 

Another dynamic may be a factor this year: Dozens of House members have announced they are not running for reelection, putting a record number of seats up for grabs at this point in the midterm election cycle.

Democrats romped in November, winning elections across the country. In House special elections last year, Democrats outperformed their 2024 presidential election results, often by double digits. They also flipped Republican-held legislative seats nationwide.




Off-year elections are not perfect predictors of midterm results. But it is notable that Democrats saw the same trends in 2017 before their 2018 midterm victories during Trump's first term. Republicans had similar strong performances in 2009, the first year of Barack Obama's presidency, before the GOP wave of 2010.

Trump and House Republicans are going all-in together, regardless of his job approval ratings. 

Georgia Rep. Brian Jack, the Republicans' chief candidate recruiter, said many GOP recruits got into their races because they are “very inspired by President Trump” and that voters will see nominees “talking about the president's successes.”

Jack said Republicans cannot afford to distance themselves from the president. Yet Trump's approval was just 40% in January, according to recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, a number that has remained consistently low throughout his second term. That could make it harder to excite core Republicans and reach independents at the same time. 




Past presidents' approval rating in the lead-up to midterms has largely correlated with their party's performance, according to Gallup polling. For example, Bill Clinton's approval rating was on the decline heading into the “Republican Revolution” of 1994. He rebounded substantially four years later when House Democrats gained seats. 

Another dynamic that could be good news for Democrats this fall: A new Gallup survey found that 45% of U.S. adults now identify as independents. Those adults appear, increasingly, to be driven by their unhappiness with the party in power, according to Gallup's analysis.

Pocketbook issues promise to be at the forefront of this fall's campaigns.

In a December AP-NORC poll that asked adults an open-ended question about what issues they want the government to focus on this year, 4 in 10 people mentioned health care costs. That put the issue about even with immigration. About one-third cited cost-of-living in general. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults wanted the federal government to focus on housing costs.




Democrats are hammering affordability on everything from groceries to health care. They argue that Trump won in 2024 because of inflation but that he has not fixed the problem. Trump has referred to the affordability “hoax” but also nodded to political and economic realities: He has urged Republicans to reach a deal on health insurance premium subsidies and he is promising populist action on housing costs. 

Trump wants Republicans to sell the sweeping domestic policy law passed last summer as a tax cut for working-class voters. Democrats note that tax advantages in the law, which passed with only GOP support, are tilted to wealthier Americans while the law cuts health care and other programs. 

Despite national narratives, Republicans and Democrats insist candidates still matter, especially in swing districts.

“It's really district-by-district,” said Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood, a chief candidate recruiter for Democrats. “It's not just going to be a narrative of ‘the suburbs reject Trump' or something like that.”

Certainly, national mood matters, Underwood said. If voters' broad opinions shift back in Trump's favor on the economy, for example, Republicans stand to do better. But a party with the broad trends in its favor still must have a credible candidate that voters in a competitive district see as plausibly representing them. 

That's why Democrats were especially sorry to see Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate who represents most of small-town and rural Maine, forgo reelection, while Republicans expect to nominate former two-term Gov. Paul LePage. Golden represents one of 13 Democratic-held districts that Trump won in 2024. 

Democrats are excited about candidates such as Elaine Luria, a military veteran and former congresswoman. She is trying to reclaim a Virginia swing district that has not changed substantially since she won it in 2018. 

Republicans began this Congress with a 220-215 advantage. But Trump pushed GOP-led states to draw new maps that would increase the number of congressional districts where Republicans have an advantage. Democratic-led states responded with their own plans. Notably, the redistricting back-and-forth was led by the two largest states, GOP-run Texas and Democratic-led California. 




Altogether, Republicans appear to have increased their odds by a handful of districts. But several states are either still considering new maps or their revisions are being challenged in court. 

If the Supreme Court guts a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, some states controlled by Republicans could theoretically move quickly to eliminate Democratic advantages in districts where nonwhite voters have sway. 

In short, the national map is up in the air. 

The final version could help Republicans keep a majority. Or Republicans could succeed in increasing the number of GOP-friendly districts yet still lose House control because voter discontent flips enough districts anyway. In that case, the gerrymandering would simply mean a smaller new majority for Democrats.

President Donald Trump emphasizes Greenland's role in national security.

As President Donald Trump turns up the volume on his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark, two new national polls put a spotlight on the fact that most Americans oppose taking over the massive and crucially strategic island that lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.

Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would oppose military action to take over Greenland.

That includes 95% of Democrats, 94% of Independents, and even more than two-thirds (68%) of Republicans surveyed by Quinnipiac late last week through Monday.

Three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN poll conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland. Ninety-four percent of Democrats and eight in 10 Independents said they would oppose such a move, with Republicans split 50%-50%.

Meanwhile, by a 55%-37% margin, voters questioned in the Quinnipiac survey said they opposed any U.S. effort to try and buy Greenland.

But there's a stark political divide on this question, with the vast majority of Democrats and nearly six in 10 Independents opposed to buying Greenland, and more than two-thirds of Republicans supporting such efforts.

""The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of national security,"" the president argued in a social media post Wednesday.

And the president emphasized that ""anything less"" than U.S. control of Greenland is ""unacceptable.""

Trump's push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland is causing tension with Denmark and other NATO allies who insist that the semiautonomous Danish territory should determine its own future. 

Trump officials are openly considering all options, including military force, to take Greenland, spurring bipartisan opposition from some in Congress.

Former NSC Senior Director Michael Allen joins 'Fox & Friends' to react to claims from President Donald Trump that violent unrest in Iran is beginning to quell amid mass protests and U.S. military pressure.

Pro-regime demonstrators in Iran chanted ""death to America"" and held signs calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump, images from Iranian state television showed Thursday.

The footage came from an event held at Tehran University and organized by the government. Several protesters held photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while some brought makeshift signs featuring photos of Trump after the failed assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania.

Multiple of those signs featured Arabic text translating to ""This time there will be no error.""

Another sign showed the same photo with a caption in English, ""The arrow doesn't always miss.""

The protest event comes as the Iranian regime contends with widespread unrest thanks to the country's economic crisis.

Humanitarian groups estimate that Iranian forces have killed over 2,000 protesters, though the true number could be far higher.

Iran appeared to reopen its airspace on Thursday after a sudden overnight closure disrupted flights across the region.

The overnight closure lasted around five hours after a Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, was issued, according to the aviation risk-monitoring site Safe Airspace. 

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he was informed the killing of protesters in Iran was ""stopping.""

""We have been notified and really strongly, but we'll find out what that all means. But, we've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping,"" he said.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said on Wednesday that nationwide protests continued into the 18th day as authorities maintained a near-total internet shutdown.

The group's aggregated figures showed 617 protest gatherings in 187 cities across the country, the arrest of at least 18,470 people and the confirmed deaths of 2,615 individuals.

HRANA said 2,435 of those killed were protesters, including 13 children under the age of 18.

Trump has threatened action against the regime, warning Tehran in multiple Truth Social posts to stop killing its people.

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) blasted President Donald Trump‘s ambitions to seize Greenland as “ill-advised threats” that would be “an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm.”

As Trump continues to discuss his hopes of obtaining Greenland from NATO ally Denmark, McConnell ripped the idea in his Senate floor speech on Wednesday. McConnell warned that “close ties with our northernmost allies are what make America's extensive reach in the Arctic actually possible” and cautioned against the administration disrupting this relationship.

“Unless and until the president can demonstrate otherwise, then the proposition at hand today is pretty straightforward, incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in U.S. access to the Arctic,” McConnell said.

He warned that “all of the good progress the president has made in” encouraging allies to increase their spending on defense “would be for nothing if his administration's ill-advised threats about Greenland were to shatter the trust of our allies.”

McConnell cautioned that “following through on this provocation would be more disastrous for the president's legacy than withdrawing from Afghanistan was for” former President Joe Biden, a withdrawal widely criticized 

“This is about more than Greenland. It's about more than America's relationship with its highly capable Nordic allies. It's about whether the United States intends to face a constellation of strategic adversaries with capable friends or commit an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm to choose to go it alone,” McConnell said.

McConnell's comments came hours before Trump fielded questions from reporters on his ambitions regarding Greenland, including a question from one reporter asking Trump if he would leave NATO to acquire Greenland.

“I wouldn't be telling you what I'm willing to do. Certainly, I'm not going to give up options. But it's very important. Greenland is very important for national security, including of Denmark. And the problem is, there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do,” Trump said. 

Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with diplomats from Denmark and Greenland at the White House on Wednesday. Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Lars Løkke Rasmussen told reporters after the meeting that there is “definitely a new security situation in the Arctic” but said the two delegations disagree on the future of Greenland.

“The big difference is whether that must lead to a situation where the U.S. must acquire Greenland, and that is absolutely not necessary,” Rasmussen said.

When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The answer could hinge on a Supreme Court ruling from 1890 — and another from 2025.

The Twin Cities, and much of the nation, are still reeling from ICE agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Renee Good last week. The local resistance to the federal immigration forces deployed in and around Minneapolis has grown, and the Trump administration's rhetoric against Good and the protesters around Minneapolis has heated up. On Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send the US military to the cities to crush the activists.

Meanwhile, a question still hangs over the crisis: Will Ross face any legal accountability for killing Good? Vice President JD Vance insists that Ross has “absolute immunity” for his actions, and the Justice Department is declining to investigate him. But others wonder if the state of Minnesota can prosecute Ross for the killing. The short answer, at the moment, is maybe.

Today, Explained cohost Noel King spoke with Vox's senior legal correspondent Ian Millhiser about the state of the competing federal and state investigations into Good's death, what the Supreme Court has said about this issue, and whether the Trump administration's immunity claims about ICE officers have any merit.

There's much more in the full podcast. So listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

A woman in Minnesota is dead and there is video of her killing at the hands of an ICE agent. The first response from many thinking Americans was: There will be a legal way of dealing with what happened here. There will be accountability. Why is that our response?

The whole point of legal accountability is to deter people from doing bad things. This isn't the only reason I don't break into my neighbor's home, but one reason I don't break into my neighbor's home is I know that if I do, I will be arrested.

This is a question that the Supreme Court has been wrestling with for quite some time, is when do we want law enforcement officers to feel like if they behave badly, they will fear legal consequences?

All right, let's talk about the investigation in Minneapolis at this point. What do we know?

We know it's pretty splintered. Normally the way something like this would work is that federal law enforcement officers would work with the state police in order to determine what happened and if any criminal charges need to be brought. So there's several reasons why the federal investigation [into the Good shooting] is looking like it's not serious. One is that they appear to have kicked the state police out of the investigation. The state is no longer allowed to cooperate with the federal government. The federal government apparently is not sharing information with state police. And that's a big red flag.

On top of that, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said that he doesn't think a civil rights investigation into the shooting itself is warranted. And on top of that, six prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Minnesota resigned in protest, because apparently the US attorney wanted the investigation to focus on Becca Good, the wife of the victim.

So, you know, it really looks like this federal investigation is not just a sham, but potentially something worse, because they may be looking to harass the widow here. And that leaves open the question of whether the state government is going to be able to conduct a thorough investigation without federal cooperation.

Minnesota itself seems to be indicating that it wants to conduct an investigation. They have requested that people “who have information or who have video or photos of the event to submit that information.”

But it's unclear just how effective the state's investigation is going to be if the feds will not cooperate.

Let's talk about what we are hearing from the federal government. Vice President JD Vance, who has a law degree from Yale, said an astonishing amount before an investigation had even begun here:

“I can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognizing that it's a tragedy of her own making and a tragedy of the far left who has marshaled an entire movement, a lunatic fringe, against our law enforcement officers,” he said. And he has been very clear that he thinks the ICE agent involved, Jonathan Ross, has “absolute immunity.”

What does the vice president mean?

I mean, he needs to go back to law school if he thinks that that's the appropriate term. “Absolute immunity” is a term that is used in civil lawsuits, not in criminal investigation — like when you have a private party suing another person, typically for money. The Supreme Court has said that three classes of individuals have absolute immunity from those suits. None of them are law enforcement. Those three classes of individuals are the sitting president, judges, and prosecutors. Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Renee Good, is neither the president of the United States, a judge, nor a prosecutor. So absolute immunity does not apply to him.

There are some doctrines that apply to criminal investigations. Probably the most important one is a doctrine that emerges from a case called In re Neagle. It was an 1890 case, so this is really old, and it involves a federal law enforcement officer who shot a man in the course of duty. The state of California wanted to prosecute him. And Neagle set the rule that in most but not all cases, when a federal law enforcement officer is acting within the scope of their duties, the state cannot prosecute them.

Okay, so even though the vice president was not using the right words, he may have been saying the right thing, because this guy is a federal officer. This precedent that's been around since 1890 probably protects him, right? Unless somebody on the federal end decides to bring criminal charges?

Well, it's unclear, because about six months ago, last June, the Supreme Court handed down another case called Martin v. United States. They weakened Neagle somewhat in that decision.

What I get out of Martin is that protections for federal law enforcement officers against state prosecutions are not absolute. So they are not what JD Vance said they are, even though there is still some protection there.

Is there a chance in your mind that this case ends up in some fashion before the Supreme Court?

I think that if the state of Minnesota prosecutes — and that's a big if here, because first of all, we don't know if they're going to be able to conduct a thorough investigation given the federal sabotage. And second of all, we don't know what the results of that investigation would be. Maybe they determine that they can't bring a successful prosecution here. Even if Jonathan Ross is guilty, the prosecutors still have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. And so they may determine that they just don't have enough evidence that it's worth going to a jury.

But if they bring a prosecution, I think that the state of the law governing when a state can bring a prosecution against a federal officer is very unclear right now. And especially given how high-profile this case is, this is the sort of case that I could easily see winding up in front of the Supreme Court.

If Minnesota state prosecutors are able to bring charges against this man, what does that mean for the way that ICE behaves in the streets next month, six months from now, a year from now?

I think it depends a lot on what the courts say. What the Supreme Court said recently in Martin, though, is that, well, we only want Neagle to apply when we know that this officer is actually carrying out federal duties. [The opinion says that] “federal officers may sometimes defeat state prosecutions against them by demonstrating that their actions, though criminal under state law, were ‘necessary and proper' in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.”

If I was a Minnesota state prosecutor, I could argue that shooting someone when they had their wheels turned against you and they weren't a threat to you is not “necessary and proper” to the discharge of federal law enforcement, and therefore prosecution should be allowed. And if I were Jonathan Ross's attorney, I could argue the opposite.

That's really vague language that the Supreme Court handed down in Martin. So I don't know what the correct answer is to the question of whether or not Ross can be prosecuted at state court, because the only thing I've got to work with is this extraordinarily vague line from the Supreme Court about things that are “necessary and proper” to federal responsibilities.

As somebody who is a lawyer and who has covered the law for a long time, what do you make of the fact that a lot of Americans are feeling right now that the law does not work, that a woman is dead, that ICE is dragging people off the streets, in some cases violently, and the law does not seem to apply to those people?

They are correct that there is in fact selective law enforcement in the Trump administration. Trump had a very different reaction to the January 6 offenders, some of which endangered federal law enforcement officers a whole lot more than Renee Good did.

There's no question here that the Justice Department is behaving in a political manner, and it's a serious problem. For many, many years, there were very strong norms saying that even though the Justice Department is part of a presidential administration, prosecutorial decisions should be made by civil servants for neutral legal reasons and not for political reasons. And that norm has just completely broken down under this president.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The biggest ethereum treasury in the world just made a $200 million bet on MrBeast's DeFi ambitions","https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-bitmine-immersion-investment-youtube-jimmy-donaldson-crypto-tom-lee-2026-1","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:33:00 GMT","

The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.

Tom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.

Jimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.

Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: ""We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.""

In June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.

""MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,"" he said. ""Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.""

Lee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.

""Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,"" he added. ""That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.""

Companies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.

Beast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure ""while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.""

Donaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.

Beast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.

In 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.

Donaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the ""next Disney."" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.

On October 3, Irem Sumer signed a document that team leaders of nerdy crews worldwide dream of inking: a term sheet that raised $30 million in Series A funding for her Istanbul-based game company, Talemonster Games.

Less than 24 hours later, Sumer, the startup's CEO, was signing another important document — her marriage license.

""It was the most chaotic two weeks of my life,"" Sumer told Business Insider, adding that at one point, she told her then-fiancé that wedding planning would be left to him, and she'd just show up to get married.

That day in October capped off two years of work on the game ""Match Valley,"" the game title. The funding round was led by Arcadia Gaming Partners and Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Point72 Ventures and General Catalyst.

This comes after a seed funding round last February, when Talemonster Games' five cofounders raised $7 million to make their game and take it to market.

""I wasn't planning to fundraise in September because I believed it was a bit too early for us. But the metrics were good, and there was a lot of strategic interest in our company,"" Sumer said.

Sumer, a civil engineer by training, worked at Pfizer and Google before joining Peak Games as a product specialist in 2020. She worked there for just over three years, where she met colleagues who would later resign from the company alongside her to start Talemonster Games.

""I wanted to be in tech, and gaming was my passion, but I never thought that I could make money from it,"" Sumer said.

The five-member founding crew quit the same week, Sumer said, and resolved to dedicate 100% of their time to making what would become ""Match Valley.""

Sumer estimates that her team played ""hundreds of games"" during their first month of market research. They then built the game together, pulling 18-hour shifts on most days to build its levels.

""It took us around three months to come up with this idea and lots of prototypes,"" Sumer said.

""Match Valley"" is built on basic puzzle-solving mechanics, much like ""Candy Crush,"" where gamers need to match objects to progress in levels. It's also integrated with tower defense and has a cast of hero characters with unique abilities.

The team launched the game in August after its seed round, when they had a stable version of the game at 200 levels. Then, they started to ""suffer from success,"" Sumer said.

""People consumed all our content in 10 days, and then they turned away from the game,"" Sumer said. ""We had to stop everything and start building more levels. I designed levels myself, too, and also we had to grow the team.""

""Match Valley's"" current engagement metrics, Sumer says, helped convinced investors that their small startup is worth pouring money into.

""The game's core audience is still female dominant, but they are spending one and a half hours on average per player in the game,"" she told Business Insider. On average, players spent two and a half hours in their first day in-game, she said.

The game makes money from its in-app purchase model, Sumer said.

Sumer said she and her cofounders managed to get investor Josh Lu and his team at A16z Speedrun on board with Talemonster after a message on LinkedIn. Sumer says she slid into Lu's LinkedIn DMs after a post he made about being on the lookout for interesting games.

""I thought, he's basically describing our prototype, that can't be a coincidence. So we reached out to him with a cold text, and he just fell in love with the prototype,"" Sumer said of her exchange with Lu.

In a press release announcing the Series A funding, Lu praised Sumer and her team for never taking ""the easy route.""

""They've built an original product and a culture that isn't afraid to challenge the industry,"" said he added.

The $30 million funding round will go to growing ""Match Valley,"" and building a new game that they plan to release this year. TaleMonster has 32 staff, working across engineering, art, product management, level design, and marketing.

""I don't plan to hire too many people,"" Sumer said, adding that she likes ""lean, high-responsibility teams.""

Sumer told Business Insider she has three pieces of advice for people looking to build a gaming startup.

""When you are starting from scratch, I think it's on you to be brave. You have nothing to lose,"" she said.

Secondly, it's important to pick the right partners.

""The team you create, the culture you create, the investors you accept, they have to share the same vision with you,"" she said. ""And it's a painful process because you have to say lots of nos.""

And lastly, she said to celebrate wins, despite the daily anxiety of running a new company.

""You are always in this grind mode, and you always have to think about your next goal, and the next after that,"" Sumer said. ""I think you have to stop and say, 'I mean, we are achieving great stuff, so we have to celebrate it together.'""

Grok will no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on X, after widespread global backlash.

""We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,"" X's safety account said in a blog post on the platform on Wednesday. ""This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.""

The change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor, Rob Bonta, said he launched an investigation into sexualized AI deepfakes, including those of children, generated by Grok.

Bonta said that there had been a flood of reports in the last few weeks that Grok users were taking pictures of women and minors they found online and using the AI model to undress them in images.

""xAI can and should put better safeguards in place to protect children and women from the harms of sexually explicit materials being generated without their consent,"" a representative of the California Attorney General's office said in a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday after Grok's changes.

The representative added: ""While this is an encouraging development, California DOJ is investigating to determine whether xAI violated the law with the conduct that has occurred.""

xAI develops Grok and also owns the social media site X, where the chatbot is integrated to respond to users when tagged.

Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok because of the images, the first countries in the world to ban the AI tool. Lawmakers in the UK publicly considered suspending it, and the country's communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation.

Liz Kendall, the UK's technology secretary, said Thursday that she welcomes the change from X but expects ""the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom's ongoing investigation.""

In Wednesday's blog post, the social media company reiterated that image creation and the ability to edit any type of image via Grok on X will now only be available to paid users as an additional safety measure.

The company restricted non-paying users last week after complaints from officials globally, but it was criticized for being insufficient.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the time that it ""simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.""

Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, said that the UK government wanted ""any excuse for censorship"" in response to a post questioning why AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT were not being looked into.

On Wednesday, a few hours before X's official account posted about the ban on creating sexualized images, Musk asked users to try to get around the AI model's image restrictions.

Grok is also available as a stand-alone web and mobile application. It's unclear if it's still possible for users to make sexualized images on its webpage and app. xAI could not be reached for immediate comment.

X said in its blog post that its safety team was working to add additional safeguards.

""We now geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal,"" X said.

Dipal Dutta, CEO and founder of IT company Redoq UK, told Business Insider that xAI should implement several technical constraints to prevent the creation of non-consensual images ""at the point of origin.""

They include automatically denying user requests containing words on a blocklist, training future versions of Grok on datasets free from explicit content, and using ""secondary AI models"" to detect and block intimate content before it is generated.

Sarah Armstrong-Smith, a UK government cyber advisory board member and a former Microsoft chief security advisor, told Business Insider that Grok reflected a ""growing divide"" among AI companies.

""On one side are organizations prioritizing responsible AI and safety frameworks,"" she said. ""On the other, are organizations positioning themselves as protecting freedom of expression by resisting regulatory control.""

""Perhaps the real opportunity is whether this finally signals the end of unchecked AI experimentation,"" she added.

Last fall, OpenAI sent shockwaves through the software industry. Now, Anthropic is doing the same. 

A new wave of announcements from Anthropic this week revived fears that generative AI could undermine the economics of traditional software companies.

In a research note published Wednesday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said a flurry of recent product launches from Anthropic, including new AI tools for productivity and healthcare, has coincided with a broad selloff across the software sector and could deepen concerns that AI is becoming a competitive threat rather than a tailwind.

On Sunday, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences, which includes HIPAA-ready enterprise tools. The next day, it unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles document generation and file management. And then on Tuesday, it announced the expansion of Labs, an internal incubator team that tests and showcases experimental AI products.

Shares of Salesforce, Workday, Intuit, and Snowflake fell sharply after this barrage of news, losing between 6% and 13%. That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted.

""While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. cause material intra-day swings in stock prices throughout 2025), we believe the velocity of innovation and announcements from the model providers could continue to weigh on the broader software landscape throughout 2026,"" RBC analysts wrote.

For years, SaaS companies have justified recurring subscription fees by packaging productivity features, analytics, automation, and domain expertise into proprietary tools. But AI threatens to flatten that value proposition by turning many of those features into on-demand capabilities accessible through a single interface.

The anxiety isn't new. Last year, OpenAI triggered a similar sell-off after demonstrating a suite of internal workplace tools built on top of its models. An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being ""squeezed"" by AI-driven competition.

Perhaps most concerning for investors is that AI's reach now appears to be extending into vertical software, an area long viewed as relatively insulated because of regulatory complexity and domain expertise.

RBC analysts said Anthropic's healthcare-focused tools suggest that assumption may no longer hold. By integrating directly with industry databases such as PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, and by offering specialized agent skills tailored to medical workflows, AI providers are beginning to encroach on niches historically served by specialized vendors.

""We've viewed vertical software as one pocket of software that is likely to be viewed as 'AI-proof' (for now), given the deep domain, regulatory nuance, and workflow expertise required to be successful,"" RBC's note stated. ""That said, recently announced Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences suggests the AI bear narrative contagion could spread to some vertical names, and they may prove to be less defensive (at least from a multiple perspective) than originally thought.""

The analysts warned that the AI overhang on software ""may remain"" and ""could spread"" as Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google accelerate their pace of announcements.

A US judge ruled Equinor ASA can resume building its multibillion-dollar wind project near New York, marking the second time this week a federal court has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a halt on offshore developments.

Equinor's Empire Wind project would likely suffer “imminent irreparable harm” from further delays while its legal fight over the government's stop-work order plays out in court, US District Judge Carl J.

In this article

Amazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store ""burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year"" and failed to hold up their agreement. 

When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.

""That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,"" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ""Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.""

As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded ""Saks at Amazon"" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. 

In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. 

Amazon wrote that it ""hopes"" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may ""seek more drastic remedies"" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. 

During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. 

Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. 

The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.

The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.

Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. 

Correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly quoted the Amazon filing.

The United States has seized another Venezuela-linked tanker, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday, ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

The seizure marks the sixth vessel targeted in recent weeks that was either carrying Venezuelan oil or had done so in the past. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the seizure took place in the Caribbean.

The U.S. military's Southern Command confirmed the pre-dawn operation, saying U.S. forces apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica ""without incident."" It said the Veronica was ""operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.""

""The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully,"" Southern Command said in a statement.

The seizures began as part of Trump's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power, which culminated in U.S. forces swooping into the country to grab him and his wife on January 3.

Since then, Trump has said the United States plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry.

The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a ""shadow fleet"" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers -- Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

Last week, the U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that was being shadowed by a Russian submarine after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic.

The move was condemned by Moscow.

The latest seizure came ahead of Thursday's meeting between Trump and Machado, in their first face-to-face meeting since the U.S. ousted her long-time foe, Maduro.

Trump has previously called her a ""freedom fighter"" but dismissed the idea of installing her to lead Venezuela after ousting Maduro, saying she did not have enough domestic support.

A classified CIA assessment presented to Trump concluded that Maduro loyalists, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to maintain stability.

The list of states that have launched retirement programs for private-sector workers continues to grow.

This year, Minnesota and Hawaii will become the 17th and 18th states to provide a way for workers without access to a 401(k) or other workplace plan to save for retirement through their job. Minnesota's program opened Jan. 1 and will begin enrolling workers Jan. 19, and Hawaii plans to launch its version later this year. In general, these state-run options require all but the smallest employers to either offer their own retirement plan or facilitate worker enrollment in their state's option.

Although there are some minor differences among these programs, most involve employees being automatically enrolled in Roth individual retirement accounts through a payroll deduction — starting around 3% or 5% — unless they opt out. There is generally no cost to employers, and these so-called auto-IRAs are managed by an investment company.

An estimated 53.7 million full-time and part-time workers between the ages of 18 and 65 lack access to any employer-based retirement plan, according to 2025 research from the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy group. The state-run retirement programs help fill that gap.

Collectively, workers have saved $2.75 billion through state-run retirement programs as of the end of 2025, according to data from the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. The bulk of that, around $2.69 billion, is in auto-IRAs.

""We're seeing those programs move the needle to cover workers … and it's also moving employers to adopt plans of their own,"" said Angela Antonelli, executive director for the center.

The rise of state-run auto-IRA programs comes amid an ongoing push to give people a way to save for retirement through a work-based option. Workers are about 15 times more likely to save if they can do so through their employer, according to AARP research.

Automatic enrollment also boosts participation. In 2024, 61% of 401(k) plans included auto-enrollment, up from 54% in 2020 and 27% in 2010, according to Vanguard's How America Saves 2025 report. Moreover, plans with auto-enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 64% for those without that feature, according to the report. 

Last year, a provision from retirement legislation known as Secure 2.0 took effect that requires 401(k) plans to auto-enroll workers, although it excludes some employers — i.e., very small businesses — as well as plans that were in existence prior to the legislation's passage in December 2022.

Federal policymakers and legislators continue proposing ways to improve the U.S. retirement system. For example, a bill in Congress called the Automatic IRA Act generally aims to do what the state-run programs do: require most employers to either automatically enroll their workers in a retirement account, whether an IRA or through a 401(k) plan or similar option.

A separate measure, the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, would create portable retirement accounts for workers without a workplace plan. ""There's no one solution in the marketplace that has everybody covered,"" said John Lettieri, co-founder, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, which supports the proposed legislation.

The state plans ""can coexist"" if a federal law were enacted to cover all workers, Lettieri said, ""but in a way that ensures the target group of left-behind workers have a wider array of options and stronger access as they choose how to plan for retirement.""

It's uncertain whether lawmakers would act on either of these proposals any time soon. In the meantime, states are continuing to plow ahead with tweaking their programs and, in the case of states without an option, exploring the possibility of an auto-IRA program. A measure in the Florida state legislature, for instance, would create a task force to determine how best to expand retirement savings options to private-sector employees without a workplace plan.

""I think there's a general sense that right now, with the combination of states and private-sector providers, that [this] private and public sector collaboration focused on closing the access gap is promising and moving in the right direction,"" Georgetown University's Antonelli said.

If the federal government does end up adopting some sort of mandate, ""the state programs will continue to play a role,"" Antonelli said.

While most private-sector workers — 72%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — have access to a retirement plan at work, that figure drops among employees at smaller businesses. The BLS data is based on a survey of 126.9 million workers.

Fifty-nine percent of workers at employers with under 100 employees are offered a retirement plan, compared with 90% of workers at employers with 500 or more employees, according to the BLS. The state-mandated programs at least partly help address that disparity.

The existence of the programs also appears to boost the number of employers that choose to offer their own retirement plan instead of enrolling their workers in the state program, according to a December study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. 

At the same time, up to a third of workers opt out of the auto-IRAs, Antonelli said. OregonSaves, which was the first to launch in 2017, has an opt-out rate of about 27%, according to recent data from the program. The average savings rate among those who participate is 6.8% of their pay, and the average monthly contribution is $176. The average balance is $2,991.

""The best-use case for these auto IRAs is just getting non-savers started,"" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth in New York and a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. ""The long-term impact depends [partly] on if they stay enrolled and increase their contribution rate over time.""

For workers who may end up enrolling in a state-run auto-IRA program, it's worth knowing that contributions to Roth accounts are not tax-deductible as they are with traditional 401(k) plans. Traditional IRAs, whose contributions may be tax-deductible, might be available as an alternative option, depending on the specifics of the state's program.

However, Roth IRAs — unlike, in general, 401(k) plans — also come with no penalty if you withdraw your contributions before age 59½. 

This means that if you take back any contributions to a Roth before retirement, there is generally no penalty because you already paid taxes on that money. For earnings, however, there could be a tax and/or penalty.

Additionally, these Roth accounts generally won't have an employer match on work contributions, as 401(k) plans often do.

Contribution limits to IRAs, both Roth and traditional, are also lower than those for 401(k)s. In 2026, you can contribute up to $7,500 in an IRA, although higher earners are limited in what they can contribute, if at all. Also, anyone age 50 or older is allowed an additional $1,100 so-called catch-up contribution.

For 401(k)s, the 2026 contribution limit is $24,500, and the catch-up limit is $8,000, although workers ages 60 to 63 can instead save an extra $11,250, based on changes enacted via Secure 2.0.

As the co-owners and founders of boutique staffing agency The Grapevine, Lori Zuker Briller and Rachel Zaslansky Sheer interview ""thousands"" of candidates each year.

Their goal is to match strong candidates with ""cool, unique and interesting"" roles as varied as executive assistant, estate manager and personal chef, Briller tells CNBC Make It.

Drawing on 20 years of running The Grapevine, Sheer and Briller shared their top hiring insights in their upcoming book ""Straight From the Grapevine: How to Crush Your Job Search.""

According to Briller, a candidate's online presence is one of the most ""impactful"" considerations in the job process.

Candidates should take a hard look at their profiles and ask themselves, ""Who are you online? What is your narrative and story online?"" she says.

If a candidate's social media posts or online content don't align with the image they present in interviews, that can be a ""definite red flag"" for hirers, according to Sheer. 

For example, if someone applying for a child-care role posts content that's ""not on-brand"" for a nanny, ""it could cost them the job,"" she says. 

In Briller's view, it's best to avoid posting, liking or sharing any content that could call your professionalism into question, particularly on career-focused platforms like LinkedIn.

Recently, Briller says she's seen an uptick in candidates sharing controversial or overly negative opinions on LinkedIn.

""There's a lot of ranting going on,"" Briller says, particularly about people's frustrations with past jobs or the hiring process.

Even if your view is justified, venting about a negative job experience online could make you seem like a ""disgruntled employee,"" career coach Eliana Goldstein previously told CNBC Make It.

According to Goldstein, expressing resentment or anger in a social media post could cause hirers to question your attitude and professionalism.

It's best to discuss those feelings ""with people you're really close to and trust,"" rather sharing them on the internet, she says. 

Similarly, Briller advises the job seekers she works with to talk about their career challenges with friends and colleagues, instead of ""putting every thought out there"" online.

She tells candidates, ""Look, it's not my place to have an opinion. If this is what you want, great. But just be careful, because hiring parties, HR people might see that as problematic.""

Some candidates are ""really resistant"" to this advice, Briller says: ""They're kind of like, well, it shouldn't be any of their business.""

Still, job seekers need to accept that their online presence is fair game in the hiring process, Sheer says. 

""Everyone checks, everyone Googles, everyone looks on social media now. It's just part of it,"" she says.

When a couple welcomes a child to their family, many may want one parent to stay home with the new addition, rather than returning to work. 

But that decision comes with a number of tradeoffs. Having one parent stay home may help the family save money on child care, which can cost more than college tuition in more than half of states, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. However, it could negatively impact that parent's salary prospects or career growth if they later decide to return to work.

Another factor to consider is if the working parent's income is enough to support the entire family. In Hawaii, a working parent needs to earn at least $102,773 a year to support themself, a non-working partner and a child, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis of Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator data. 

The analysis includes estimates for basic living expenses, including rent, groceries and health care. It doesn't account for discretionary costs like travel and entertainment, but includes cost estimates for basic apparel, household supplies and personal care products. 

In Hawaii, the working parent needs to earn the most of any state to support a three-person household, the analysis found. However, if both parents work, the family needs to earn at least $115,814 a year to afford basic living expenses including child care, SmartAsset found. The median household income in Hawaii is just over $98,000, according to Census Bureau data. 

Here's how much one parent needs to earn so the other can stay home in every U.S. state.

Leaving the workforce for a few years can have long-term effects on a parent's career, Emily Green, head of wealth management for Ellevest, previously told CNBC Make It. This often affects more women than men since women represent 82% of stay-at-home parents, according to Pew Research.

""In households where there's a little more financial wiggle room, women often don't think about what they may give up in the long term —  say in 5-10 years — by leaving their jobs now,"" Green said.

Leaving the workforce for an extended period of time could mean missing out on steady salary increases, adding gaps to your resume that could make it harder to secure future job opportunities and falling behind on long-term career goals, Green said. 

Those tradeoffs may be worth it to some parents and necessary for others who don't have other viable child-care options. 

""I have seen many women leave their jobs because their salaries don't cover the cost of child care,"" Green said. ""In some households, that math means a career break is inescapable.""

Regardless, they are important factors to consider when thinking about your family's financial situation. Families may want to work with a financial professional to see how various scenarios may impact their long-term goals.

Oops, something went wrong

NIP Group Inc., the publicly traded parent company of long-running esports team organization Ninjas in Pyjamas, announced Thursday that it mined approximately 151.4 Bitcoin—about $14.5 million worth—during its initial three months of operation from September through November.

The company, which trades as NIPG on the Nasdaq, first revealed plans to enter Bitcoin mining last July. In November, the company said that it was expanding its fleet of mining rigs, targeting monthly production of 160 BTC. In Thursday's announcement, the firm updated that estimate to 140 BTC per month (currently about $13.5 million worth).

Mining refers to the act of securing the Bitcoin network by using high-powered computers to crunch calculations, with each block reward winner earning a bounty of 3.125 Bitcoin (about $303,000) plus user fees. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process that's typically operated by large companies or groups with warehouses full of dedicated, specialized computers.

In November, NIP Group said it had acquired mining rigs with a combined hash rate of approximately 8.19 EH/s from sellers including Apex Cyber Capital, Prosperity Oak Holdings, and Noveau Jumpstar. In exchange, NIP Group agreed to issue over 314 million Class A ordinary shares.

NIP Group said Thursday that its mining capacity currently sits at 9.66 EH/s, positioning it among the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the United States and the largest in the MENA region. The company expects to achieve total operating capacity of approximately 11.3 EH/s later this month once final tranches of the deal are completed.

""These production results prove what we set out to demonstrate—that we can deploy mining infrastructure at scale and generate meaningful Bitcoin output,” said NIP Group Co-CEO Hicham Chahine, in a statement.

“With 9.66 EH/s now operational and the remainder closing soon, we've built a second growth engine that complements our entertainment portfolio,” he added. “This positions us uniquely at the intersection of digital assets, computing infrastructure, and gaming—with optionality to expand into AI workloads as that market develops.”

In November, NIP Group told Decrypt that its primary focus was maximizing Bitcoin holdings and mining hash rate. However, the company said it would sell Bitcoin when market conditions are ""appropriate"" to cover expansion or operational costs.

NIP Group is primarily a digital entertainment company known for esports and gaming ventures, including its competitive esports team Ninjas in Pyjamas, which competes at top levels in games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, League of Legends, and Rocket League.

The firm's stock is flat Thursday at a recent price of $1.10, but has fallen nearly 54% over the last six months per data from Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin's gradual price ascent that resumed earlier this week continued in the past 24 hours as the asset tapped $98,000 for the first time in about two months.

Its dominance over the altcoins has risen within the same timeframe, as most altcoins have failed to double down on their recent gains. Nevertheless, ETH is still well above $3,350, aiming at $3,400.

After last week's price gains that drove BTC from under $90,000 to almost $95,000 within days, the cryptocurrency's run was halted, and it slipped below its starting point. However, the bulls quickly intercepted the move and helped bitcoin reclaim the $90,000 support.

It tried to break out on a couple of occasions. Although it failed at $92,000 the first few times, it finally reclaimed that level on Tuesday and surged to $96,500. The bears stepped up at this point, driving it to under $94,500, but BTC was quick on the gas pedal.

On Wednesday evening, it skyrocketed by several grand again and touched $98,000 for the first time since mid-November. This came despite the growing geopolitical tension. Although it was stopped there, it currently sits at $97,000 with a 2.2% increase in the past day.

Its market capitalization has risen to $1.940 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has grown to 57.5%.

Ethereum has also charted a daily increase, even though it's more modest than BTC's. It's up by 1% and sits above $3,350, with analysts expecting another surge to and beyond $3,400. BNB, TRX, XMR, and BCH are also slightly in the green, while XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and XLM have dropped over the past day.

HYPE, LTC, HBAR, TAO, and CC are also in the red, while RAIN and ICP have become the top performers from the larger caps. HASH has stolen the show, surging 20%.

The total crypto market cap has added another $40 billion overnight and is up to $3.370 trillion on CG.

Galaxy Digital has closed its first tokenized collateralized loan obligation (CLO), bringing private credit onto blockchain infrastructure.

The deal, known as Galaxy CLO 2025-1, was issued on Avalanche and has financed roughly $75 million in loans so far, according to a Thursday announcement. The transaction is anchored by a $50 million allocation from Grove, an institutional credit protocol within the Sky ecosystem, formerly known as MakerDAO. 

“By uniting our strengths in debt capital markets, blockchain technology, and asset management, we're opening a new avenue for institutional engagement in credit markets—one that benefits from greater efficiency, transparency, and expanded collateral flexibility through onchain execution,” Chris Ferraro, president and chief investment officer at Galaxy, said. 

Galaxy said the CLO is designed to support its lending operations through an uncommitted credit facility extended to Arch Lending, a crypto lending platform backed by Galaxy Ventures. Arch issues consumer loans that are overcollateralized with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Money from the CLO is used to buy these loans as they are created, with the program able to grow to $200 million over time.

Galaxy's tokenized CLO to trade on INX platform

Crypto trading platform INX issued the CLO's bonds and put them on the blockchain. The tokens are expected to be listed on INX's platform for approved investors. The safest portion of the CLO pays interest at a rate tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 5.7%, matures in December 2026 and makes monthly payments, per the announcement. 

Galaxy's internal teams handled the structuring and blockchain setup, while Galaxy Asset Management oversees the product.

Anchorage Digital Bank acts as trustee and custodian, tracking collateral and settlements in real time using its blockchain infrastructure. Galaxy also partnered with Accountable, a data platform that lets investors continuously monitor loan performance and collateral backing the CLO.

Stablecoins to overtake ACH payments in 2026: Galaxy

In a recent report, Galaxy Research, the research arm of Galaxy Digital, predicted that stablecoins could handle more transaction volume than the US Automated Clearing House system as early as 2026. The firm noted that stablecoins already process more transactions than major card networks like Visa and now account for roughly half of ACH transaction volume.

Galaxy said stablecoin supply has been growing at a 30%–40% annual rate, with transaction activity rising alongside issuance.

A new study showcases how brain waves known as alpha oscillations help us distinguish between ourselves and the outside world.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Sometimes, investigations into neuroscience lead to questions that—at first glance—seem rather obvious. For example, how does our body know what our body is in relation to the outside world? It's tempting to simply answer “well, it just does,” but in the realm of scientific inquiry, that explanation doesn't exactly win Nobel Prizes. 

To find an explanation with a bit more experimental rigor, scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, analyzed the alpha-frequency brain oscillations that were believed to be responsible for a person's temporal binding window (TBW). This is the period of time when the brain treats visual and tactile signals—even if they're not perfectly synchronous—as if they're occurring together. 

By performing behavior experiments and recording electroencephalograms (EEG) for 106 participants, the study pieced together that  the speed of alpha brain waves from the parietal cortex (the area responsible for processing bodily sensory information) dictated how long the TBW lasted. This, in turn, formed either a stronger or weaker distinction between the body and the external world. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Communications. 

“We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied,” Mariano D'Angelo, the lead author of the study from the Karolinska Institute, said in a press statement. “The findings may provide new insights into psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, where the sense of self is disturbed.”

The human brain generates different kinds of brain waves, each associated with specific mental states. Delta waves, the slowest of the group, often dominate our sleeping lives, while alpha waves usually appear when the brain is alert, but mostly idle (unlike Gamma waves, which are often associated with high-cognitive functions). 

To investigate the role of alpha waves in defining our sense of self, the authors relied on a classic experiment: the rubber hand illusion. When both a person's out-of-view real hand and an in-view rubber hand were poked, prodded, or touched synchronously, subjects reported feeling that the rubber hand was actually a part of their body. When that timing became progressively more asynchronous, that feeling of body ownership slowly faded. Interestingly, the study finds a positive correlation among those with faster alpha brain waves and the sensitivity to timing differences between sensations felt by the real hand and the rubber hand. 

To confirm this finding, researchers used a non-invasive method for adjusting the speed of alpha brain waves, and found that these changes also impact a subject's precision of body ownership. D'Angelo and his team theorized that alpha brain waves play a key role in judging the timing of sensory signals—the more sluggish the alpha oscillations, the more lax is the boundary between the self and the external world. 

As the authors mentioned, further investigations into the role of alpha brain waves in controlling the TBW could help ease some cognitive disorders (including schizophrenia) and improve the sensory experience of those living with artificial limbs.

                         (2026)Cite this article


Aging and DNA damage increase the risk of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, yet the molecular underpinnings remain unclear. In this study, we uncover a DNA damage-driven mechanism in macrophages that triggers immune autoreactivity. Here, using Er1Lyz2/− mice with a macrophage-specific DNA repair defect in ERCC1−XPF, we demonstrate that monocyte-derived macrophages accumulate DNA damage, activate the immune system, drive polyclonal T cell responses and generate antinuclear autoantibodies. Proteomic and immunopeptidomic analyses reveal a distinct major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) antigen repertoire enriched in nuclear and ribosomal peptides, relying on autophagy for nuclear cargo delivery to MHC-II. Aged macrophages exhibit a similar lysosomal cargo profile, linking autophagy-driven nuclear antigen presentation to immune activation. Notably, inhibiting autophagy in Er1Lyz2/− mice suppresses autoimmune features, pinpointing autophagy-facilitated nuclear antigen processing as a central driver of age-related autoimmunity. These findings establish DNA damage-induced autophagy in macrophages as a pivotal mechanism linking aging to autoimmunity, unveiling potential therapeutic targets to mitigate age-related immune dysregulation.

Aging is characterized by the accumulation of DNA damage, a hallmark that fuels chronic inflammation, accelerates immunosenescence and drives a spectrum of age-related pathologies1,2,3,4,5,6. Persistent DNA lesions and impaired repair mechanisms activate inflammatory pathways, including type I interferon signaling through cytoplasmic nucleic acid release and the activation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)1,7,8,9,10,11. Recent studies reveal that genotoxic stress stimulates adaptive immunity by generating peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules, highlighting the intricate interplay between DNA damage and immune responses12.

Macrophages have a critical role in the immune system as sentinels, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and modulators of immunity13,14. Aging impairs macrophage or monocyte function through reduced clearance of apoptotic cells, debris and pathogens15,16, increased MHC expression17, skewed polarization18 and chronic cytokine secretion19. In autoimmune responses, macrophages can contribute to the accumulation and presentation of immunogenic antigens. Identifying these peptides is essential for the development of targeted therapies, such as peptide-based vaccines or immunomodulatory agents, to selectively suppress autoimmune responses without broadly suppressing the immune system20,21.

Autophagy, a fundamental cellular degradation and recycling process, maintains homeostasis by clearing damaged organelles, misfolded proteins and intracellular debris, particularly in response to genotoxic stress22,23. Additionally, autophagy intersects with antigen presentation pathways, playing a pivotal role in MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation24,25. Dysregulation of autophagy-mediated antigen processing is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Despite its importance, the precise composition of autophagy-derived antigens and their impact on immune activation remain largely undefined26,27. In the present study, we reveal how DNA damage in macrophages drives immune activation using Er1Lyz2/− mice, a model with myeloid-specific DNA repair defects. ERCC1−XPF is a heterodimeric, structure-specific endonuclease complex required for lesion excision in nucleotide excision repair (NER)28,29. It is also known to participate in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA interstrand-crosslink (ICL) repair, base excision repair (BER), telomere maintenance and for the processing of various alternative DNA structures that hinder replication and transcription events30,31,32,33. Er1Lyz2/− mice exhibit autoimmune symptoms, driven by MHC-II presentation of nuclear and ribosomal peptides. Aged macrophages show similar increase in antigen presentation, linking these changes to the DNA damage response (DDR). Notably, inhibiting autophagy reduces immune activation, highlighting autophagy as a key driver of nuclear antigen processing and a promising therapeutic target for age-related autoimmune diseases.

To study how persistent DNA damage in monocyte-derived macrophages affects the immune system response, we studied mice with an engineered Ercc1 defect in the myeloid cell lineage (Lyz2-cre+;Ercc1fl/−, hereafter referred to as Er1Lyz2/− mice). By 8 months of age, Er1Lyz2/− mice develop a systemic inflammatory response and an increase in tissue infiltrates compared to their wild-type counterparts—that is, Lyz2-cre−;Ercc1fl/+ mice34. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed chronic inflammation in multiple intraparenchymal areas of the kidneys isolated from Er1Lyz2/− mice, including around the pelvicalyceal system. The inflammatory infiltrates consisted primarily of small lymphocytes, large activated lymphocytes and numerous plasma cells, indicative of an active immune response (Fig. 1a). Immunofluorescence analysis of kidney cryosections showed an increased deposition of complement protein C3 and immune complexes according to IgM and IgA staining (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These proteins are commonly localized in the kidneys of patients with autoimmune glomerulonephritis and mouse models. Despite this, skin preparations of Er1Lyz2/− mice displayed no inflammatory foci or other alterations according to H&E analysis, and there were no apparent changes in the thickness of paws or ankles (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Notably, periodic acid−Schiff (PAS) staining in kidneys and an albumin ELISA argued against the presence of tubular atrophy or fibrosis of the kidney parenchyma or proteinuria in Er1Lyz2/− mice. PAS stain, however, additionally revealed the expanse of the mesangium of 30−40% of the glomeruli in Er1Lyz2/− kidneys, indicating glomerular damage (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Supporting this, an indirect immunofluorescence assay using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a substrate demonstrated the presence of autoantibodies in the sera of 8-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice. The increase in autoantibody production was similar to that observed in naturally aged 24-month-old wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Antibody staining patterns included homogenous or speckled nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Antinuclear antibody enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ANA-ELISA) confirmed the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies in the sera of Er1Lyz2/− mice (Fig. 1b). Adoptive transfer of sera derived from 8-month-old wild-type or Er1Lyz2/− mice to young wild-type recipients and analysis of kidney cryosections resulted in an increase in the localization of IgM immune complexes in the glomeruli of mice receiving Er1Lyz2/− sera when they were compared to the recipients of wild-type sera (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Histological analysis of wild-type spleens showed normal morphological features, with a normal ratio of white to red pulp. Er1Lyz2/− spleens, however, showed marked hyperplasia of the white pulp, with foci of plasmacytic cells at the white−red pulp border. Spleen weights complemented these results, with Er1Lyz2/− spleens weighing more than their wild-type controls, pointing to an increase in cellularity (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Staining of splenocytes for CD19 (B cell maker) and CD138 (plasma cell marker) revealed increased plasma cell percentages and numbers in the secondary lymphoid organs and the bone marrow and further supported the increased antibody production in 8-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). This aligns with findings in aged C57BL/6 mice, which spontaneously developed antinuclear autoantibodies driven by MHC-II antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells, accompanied by an immune complex deposition in the kidneys of old mice35. Flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes from Er1Lyz2/− and wild-type mice showed increased numbers of additional cell populations that regulate autoimmunity: CD11b+ myeloid cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, NK1.1+CD3− (natural killer) cells and regulatory CD4+ T cells in Er1Lyz2/− spleens but not granulocyte−monocyte progenitors in Er1Lyz2/− bone marrow (Fig. 1d−g and Extended Data Figs. 2f−i and 3a). Splenic macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+SinglecF−) and CD11b+Ly6G− cells of monocytic origin from Er1Lyz2/− mice exhibited higher percentages of cells expressing MHC-II antigen presentation and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules, respectively, along with increased protein expression levels of both markers (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Accordingly, flow cytometry analysis of cells from spleens and lymph nodes stained for the CD4 glycoprotein, the CD44 adhesion molecule responsible for T cell migration and the L-selectin/CD62L naive T cell marker revealed a gradual increase in the percentages and numbers of memory CD4+ T cells (CD44hiCD62Llo) in 8−10-month-old Er1Lyz2/−mice36,37 (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Conversely, a decrease in the percentage of naive CD4+ T cells (CD44loCD62Lhi) was observed, arguing for a polyclonal CD4+ T cell expansion in Er1Lyz2/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 3f). This resembled the T cell expansion observed in 24-month-old wild-type mice (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 3g). To assess T cell function, CD4+ T cells from 10-month-old mice were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin for 4−6 h, which activates protein kinase C and induces calcium signaling, important for T cell activation and cytokine production38. Stimulation of CD4+ T cells from 10-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice with PMA and ionomycin led to increased interferon-γ (IFNγ) secretion, indicating a more robust T helper 1 (TH1) immune response (Fig. 1j). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing T-bet, the master regulator of TH1 differentiation, was observed in the lymph nodes of these mice compared to controls (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 3h). Along with their activated profile and increased numbers, FOXP3− T cells from Er1Lyz2/− mice increased expression of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (Fig. 1l) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Extended Data Fig. 3I), indicating prolonged exposure to activation signals. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells isolated from 10-month-old wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− mice to NOD scid gamma (NSG) hosts led to a higher frequency of T cell infiltration in the kidneys of mice receiving Er1Lyz2/− T cells, as suggested by the inflammatory foci observed during H&E analysis and CD4+ T cell numbers measured by flow cytometry analysis of kidney Percoll fractions (Extended Data Fig. 4a−c).

To determine whether Er1Lyz2/− macrophages could trigger the immune activation observed in Er1Lyz2/− mice, we performed a bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) adoptive transfer experiment. In this experiment, wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs, differentiated in vitro, were intravenously administered into young wild-type mice every 2 weeks for 8−12 weeks. Notably, wild-type mice receiving Er1Lyz2/− macrophages showed a higher percentage of memory CD4+ T cells (CD44hiCD62Llo) in their lymph nodes and plasma cells (CD19+CD138+) in their spleens, accompanied by an increase in sera autoantibodies compared to mice receiving wild-type macrophages (Fig. 1m and Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). These results indicate that Ercc1 ablation in BMDMs induces spontaneous immune activation and autoantibody production in mice, further supporting the role of DNA damage in promoting autoimmune and inflammatory responses.

DSBs caused by low-dose chemotherapeutic agents or irradiation upregulate MHC-II via the ATM−NF-κB−IRF1 pathway, a mechanism described in cancer cells and B cells39,40. Similarly, genotoxic stress, such as X-rays or chemotherapeutic drugs, has been predicted to stimulate HLA-I-mediated T cell activation12. DNA-damaging agents such as doxorubicin further link genotoxicity to immunogenicity by inducing senescence and triggering CD8+ T cell responses to neoantigens41. Co-localized foci of DDR markers γH2AX and 53BP1 in Er1Lyz2/− macrophages indicated the accumulation of DNA DSBs, which were partly diminishedby reducing oxidative stress with the use of antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and Mito-TEMPO. This was in line with the higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) when we tested for the detection of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) oxidative lesions in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). These DNA breaks can activate an ATM-mediated DDR, shown by the increased protein levels of the phosphorylated form of ATM (Extended Data Fig. 5c). To test whether Er1Lyz2/− macrophages harboring DNA damage could directly drive CD4+ T cell responses in an MHC-II-dependent manner, we treated BMDMs with the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (ref. 42). Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs showed elevated MHC-II levels, a response abrogated by ATM inhibition, demonstrating that ATM activation is critical for DNA damage-driven antigen presentation (Fig. 2a,b). Likewise, treatment of BMDMs with ATR and DNA-PK inhibitors, also key mediators of the DDR, led to a similar decrease in MHC-II levels (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5d). DNA damage has been linked to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a risk factor. For this reason, we considered the role of the DDR in MHC-II antigen presentation in monocyte-origin cells derived from 11-month-old New Zealand Blank (NZB)/New Zealand White (NZW) F1 lupus-prone mice. We performed flow cytometry analysis in splenocytes from lupus-prone and control mice and found increased levels of γ-Η2Α.Χ DNA damage marker in CD11b+Ly6G− monocyte-origin cells (Extended Data Fig. 5e). In addition, the increased antigen presentation capacity of lupus-prone compared to control monocyte-origin cells dropped upon ATM kinase inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 5f). DNA damage thus renders monocytes and macrophages able to initiate innate immune responses in a lupus mouse model, based on immunogenic MHC-II peptide generation. Accordingly, treatment of wild-type BMDMs with etoposide and camptothecin, potent genotoxins that induce DSBs and single-strand breaks (SSBs) through inhibition of topoisomerase II and I, respectively43, activated the DDR. This response, observed 24 h after treatment, resulted in an increase in MHC-II protein levels (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Figs. 5g and 6a). By contrast, stress responses such as tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or starvation did not significantly elevate MHC-II levels (Extended Data Fig. 5g). In addition to MHC-II epitope binding to the T cell receptor (TCR), effective T cell activation relies on the cytokine and chemokine milieu provided by APCs44,45,46. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed upregulation of T cell chemoattractant genes in Er1Lyz2/− macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Building upon findings that DNA damage in brain-resident macrophages induces type I interferon production ex vivo9, we assessed interferon-β (IFNβ) levels in BMDM culture supernatants. Protein concentration and western blot analysis confirmed increased levels of IFNβ in Er1Lyz2/− BMDM supernatants. Additionally, western blotting of BMDM lysates showed increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and upregulation of IRF5, indicating the activation of type I interferon signaling pathways (Extended Data Fig. 6c). MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation is crucial for determining CD4+ T cell reactivity, playing a key role in both peripheral tolerance maintenance and breakdown47,48. To investigate whether Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs could directly activate antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells, we performed a BMDM−T cell co-culture. wild-type or Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs were co-cultured with antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells isolated from 10-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice, which were more activated in vivo but maintained normative ERCC1 expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing CD69, an early activation marker49, when they were co-cultured with Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Consistently, IFNγ ELISpot assays, used to measure the effector function of CD4+ T cells in the co-culture, revealed higher IFNγ secretion in the span of 48 h. Although blocking MHC-II or IFNβ levels both led to a reduction in the number of IFNγ spots, MHC-II led to a substantial reduction in the spot numbers, whereas IFNβ blockade led to a smaller but consistent decrease (Fig. 2e). These results confirm the enhanced capacity of Er1Lyz2/− macrophages to activate T cells, linking DNA damage in macrophages to an activated adaptive immune response and implicated antigen presentation and type I interferon in this process. Considering the activation status of macrophages, we hypothesized that MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation would be critical for sustaining CD4+ T cell activation in Er1Lyz2/− mice. To test this, we blocked the MHC-II−TCR interaction in vivo by intraperitoneally administering an anti-MHC-II or an isotype control antibody to 6-month-old wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− mice, which showed a similar percentage of activated CD44hiCD62Llo T cells at this age (Figs. 1i and 2f). Five weeks after treatment, at the point when Er1Lyz2/− untreated mice showed an activated immune system (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1−3), there was a reduction in MHC-II surface levels in CD11b+ myeloid and in CD4+ T cell activation percentages in Er1Lyz2/− mice treated with anti-MHC-II compared to the isotype control-treated group. This was evident by the CD44hiCD62Llo population decrease and reduced IFNγ secretion after PMA and ionomycin stimulation. By contrast, no changes in T cell activation were observed in wild-type mice, regardless of anti-MHC-II or isotype control treatment (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6f,g). Moreover, we reported a drop in the C3 complement protein deposition in the glomeruli of anti-MHC-II-treated Er1Lyz2/− mice when they were compared to their isotype controls (Extended Data Fig. 6h). To further support our data, we next performed a depletion of CD4+ T cells by administration of a neutralizing anti-CD4 antibody to 6-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice for 5 weeks. This led to a reduction in the inflammatory foci in the kidneys and a decrease in plasma cell numbers and percentages in spleens derived from anti-CD4-treated mice compared to the ones derived from isotype control-treated mice (Fig. 2i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6i).

The MHC-II-mediated generation of CD4+ T cells in Er1Lyz2/− mice prompted us to examine if there are DNA damage-related epitopes driving this phenotype. We characterized the immunopeptidome of wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs as well as wild-type macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known immunostimulant50. LPS induces higher MHC-II protein expression while maintaining a similar DDR in wild-type and LPS-treated BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). After MHC-II peptide immunoprecipitation (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and peptide purification, we performed liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC−MS/MS) (Fig. 3a), identifying 1,237 peptides from wild-type mice, 1,290 peptides from Er1Lyz2/− mice, and 999 peptides from LPS-treated wild-type BMDMs. Of these, 798, 823 and 661 peptides were predicted to be potential MHC-II binders for each condition, respectively.

Most peptides were 14–17 amino acids in length (Fig. 3b), aligning with the most common peptide length presented by MHC-II proteins. Moreover, peptide clustering using GibbsCluster confirmed the presence of the typical MHC-II binding motifs (Fig. 3c). Notably, more presented peptides were enriched or uniquely identified in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs compared to untreated and LPS-treated wild-type cells, indicating that DNA damage alters the antigenic landscape of macrophages (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 1). These overrepresented peptides predominantly originated from subcellular compartments including the ER (calnexin), ribosomal proteins (RPL30 and RPS19) and, notably, the nucleus (such as histone H1, NOLC1, HNRNPL, EXOSC4 and NME2). By contrast, peptides from wild-type cells were mostly derived from plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins, whereas peptides presented by LPS-treated wild-type cells were from extracellular proteins (MMP14 and FN1) and plasma membrane proteins (ANPEP and MARCKSL1) (Fig. 3e). Comparison of the Er1Lyz2/− enriched peptides with Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) peptides identified 72 epitopes arising under genotoxic stress, including those from histone H1, NOLC1, HNRNPL and NME2 proteins (Fig. 3f). Gene Ontology (Cellular Component) enrichment analysis of the significantly overrepresented Er1Lyz2/− peptides further highlighted an increased abundance of epitopes associated with the nucleus, euchromatin, perinuclear space and ribonucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 3g). Conversely, pathway analysis in the overrepresented LPS-treated wild-type antigens confirmed their distinct origin (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

To assess the predicted immunogenicity of the Er1Lyz2/− overrepresented peptides, we synthesized peptides, isolated splenocytes from 8-month-old wild-type or Er1Lyz2/− mice and performed IFNγ ELISpot assays to restimulate CD4+ T cells. We selected peptides that were uniquely identified or of nuclear origin, as nuclear antigens are crucial for the development of autoimmune responses51. We found that peptides of nuclear origin (H1 and HNRPL) and the ribosomal and nuclear peptide RPL30 elicited a more robust IFNγ T cell response in Er1Lyz2/− splenocytes (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 7f).

To explore how genotoxic stress shapes the antigen presentation profile in Er1Lyz2/− cells, we focused on the mechanisms that enable self-peptides to be presented by MHC-II molecules. These peptides are typically delivered to MHC-II via two pathways: the endocytosis/phagocytosis pathway, where external materials are engulfed by APCs, and the autophagy-mediated pathway. Both pathways culminate in protein degradation in lysosomes52,53. Given that DNA damage activates autophagy in macrophages34, we examined its role in enhancing immunogenicity. To assess the contribution of autophagy to MHC-II-dependent T cell responses, we inhibited autophagosome formation in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs by treating them with 3-methyladenine (3-MA)54. When treated macrophages were co-cultured with CD4+ T cells from 8-month-old Er1Lyz2/− mice, we observed a reduction in the number of spots in ELISpot assays (Fig. 4a). This provides direct evidence that autophagy has a crucial role in MHC-II peptide presentation in DNA-damaged macrophages.

Cells experiencing senescence or DNA damage rely on autophagy to remove excess material55,56,57,58,59,60,61. We hypothesized that DNA damage-induced alterations in autophagosome content could determine the availability of proteins for lysosomal processing and MHC-II loading. To explore this, we employed an in vivo proximity biotinylation approach, combining the APEX2−LC3B system with proteomic analysis62. We constructed U2-OS cells constitutively expressing the APEX2−LC3B construct, cultivated them in SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) media for metabolic labeling and exposed them to etoposide or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells were labeled with ‘medium' and ‘heavy' amino acids, respectively, and subjected to biotinylation by addition of biotin-phenol and H2O2, whereas non-biotinylated controls were labeled with ‘light' amino acids. After treatment, cells were exposed to bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), a vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor, to accumulate autophagosomes and prevent degradation of their contents63,64.

Autophagosomal cargo was purified by streptavidin pulldown in the presence of proteinase K to prevent contaminants from the outer membrane of autophagosomes, and the protein content was quantified using LC−MS/MS (Fig. 4b). Etoposide treatment led to the enrichment of 128 proteins within autophagosomes, including vesicle-resident proteins such as MAP1LC3B and LAMP1, as well as nuclear-derived proteins such as histones H2A, H2B and H3, LMNA, NME2 and HNRNPL and ribosomal proteins such as FAU, RPL23A and RPL4 (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Table 2). These results are consistent with the peptides identified in the Er1Lyz2/− BMDM immunopeptidome, highlighting a substantial overlap in the pathways involved. This suggests that DNA damage-induced changes in the autophagic cargo are pivotal in shaping the antigenic profile of macrophages, contributing to the MHC-II loading of nuclear-derived peptides.

Our findings uncover a pivotal role for autophagy in maintaining nuclear homeostasis under genotoxic stress. Previous studies linked the loss of lamin A/C and lamin B1 to DNA damage, which may lead to the release of nuclear constituents into the cytoplasm, where they can be cleared via autophagy. To test this, we examined the levels of these nuclear lamins in wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs. We observed a reduction in both lamin A/C and lamin B1 in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs (Fig. 4e), suggesting that DNA damage disrupts nuclear integrity, despite the lack of cell cycle arrest (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Interestingly, ATR-mediated but not ATM-mediated signaling seems to be associated with the decrease in lamin B1 levels (Extended Data Fig. 8b). We further investigated the consequences of autophagic inhibition by treating BMDMs with 3-MA, BafA1 and chloroquine, which led to the accumulation of cytoplasmic chromatin structures (DAPI+H1+) and nucleosome protein H1 in Er1Lyz2/− macrophages (Fig. 4f). Similarly, etoposide-treated wild-type cells displayed a phenotype resembling that of Er1Lyz2/− macrophages. No DSBs were induced within a 3-h timeframe by these treatments, as evidenced by the co-localization of γH2AX and 53BP1 markers (Extended Data Fig. 8c). The cGAS−STING pathway, a key sensor of cytosolic DNA, is involved in the removal of DNA through autophagy, as autophagy proteins interact with cGAS−STING to promote clearance of cytosolic double-stranded DNA65,66. We tested the levels of the cytosolic cGAS in wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs and found increased levels in untreated Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs compared to wild-type controls. Autophagic induction via starvation in Er1Lyz2/− macrophages, however, reduced cytosolic cGAS levels, suggesting that increased autophagy turnover facilitates the removal of chromatin fragments (Extended Data Fig. 8d). To monitor autophagic flux in these cells, we transfected BMDMs with a fluorescent mCherry−GFP−LC3 plasmid67. In Er1Lyz2/− macrophages, we observed a higher red-to-green fluorescence ratio, indicating increased loss of GFP fluorescence (sensitive to acidic lysosomal environments), whereas red fluorescence was retained in the lysosomes, suggesting an enhanced autophagic flux (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Moreover, lysosomes in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs were larger and more acidic than in wild-type controls, as shown by flow cytometry analysis with LysoTracker and LysoSensor dyes (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Collectively, our data point to an enhanced lysosomal function, likely enabling the more efficient and timely transfer of nuclear material for the generation of antigens in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs.

To further investigate the role of autophagy in the transport of nuclear material to lysosomes, we performed immunofluorescence studies with antibodies against LAMP-1, p62, histone H1 and lamin B1. Cells were treated with chloroquine to inhibit the degradation of autophagic cargo. We observed co-localization of H1 and lamin B1 proteins with autophagosomes, which were either fusing with or in close proximity to lysosomes. This was quantified by measuring the percentage of cells with triple co-localized foci and the total number of these foci per each individual cell (Fig. 5a,b). Interestingly, treatment of Er1Lyz2/− cells with Dynasore68, a dynamin inhibitor that blocks endocytosis and phagocytosis in macrophages (early endosome antigen EEA1; Extended Data Fig. 9a), did not diminish the levels of H1 or lamin B1 co-localizing with autolysosomes. This enhanced the notion that autophagic vacuoles dispose of dispensable cytoplasmic content originating from within Er1Lyz2/− cells rather than cell debris derived from neighboring macrophages (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Furthermore, this is supported by the lack of cell death, as measured by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide-stained cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Finally, we purified and analyzed lysosomes from chloroquine-treated wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs. Western blotting confirmed the presence of nuclear proteins such as histone H1, lamin B1, lamin A/C and FAU ubiquitin-like as well as ribosomal protein S30 and the LAMP-1 lysosomal protein (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9d). These findings underscore the enhanced nucleophagy and turnover of ribosomal and nuclear proteins in Er1Lyz2/− macrophages, highlighting the crucial role of autophagy in maintaining nuclear integrity on the one hand but enrichment of nuclear antigens in the lysosomes on the other hand. Notably, evidence from immunofluorescence studies in the THP-1 human monocytic cell line upon etoposide treatment and monocyte-derived CD11b+Ly6G− cells isolated from SLE model mice additionally revealed the presence of small cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. These DNA moieties are coated with histone H1 and co-localized with autophagy protein p62 (Fig. 5d,e). Etoposide-induced DNA damage additionally upregulated HLA-DR (MHC-II cell surface receptor) in THP-1 cells, further verifying our hypothesis in human monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9e).

To further investigate the role of autophagy in modulating immune responses in Er1Lyz2/− mice, we generated double knockout (DKO) mice by simultaneously deleting Ercc1 and Atg5, which is crucial for autophagosome formation, in myeloid cells (Ercc1fl/−;Atg5fl/fl;Lyz2-cre+) (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In comparison to their Er1Lyz2/− littermates, DKO mice exhibited a reduction in inflammatory foci in their kidneys at 8 months of age, accompanied by lower levels of antinuclear autoantibodies in their sera and moderate hyperplasia of the spleen white pulp with plasmacytic cell foci (Fig. 6a,b and Extended Data Fig. 10b). The numbers of CD11b+F4/80+ splenic macrophages and Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−CD34+CD16/32+ myeloid granulocyte−monocyte progenitor cells in the bone marrow were similar between Er1Lyz2/− and DKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Building on this, we checked for the percentages of activated CD4+ T cells and plasma cells and found them to be decreased in DKO compared to Er1Lyz2/− spleens (Fig. 6c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10e). Assessment of cell viability in wild-type, Er1Lyz2/− and DKO BMDMs exhibited no alterations among genotypes, indicating that neither Ercc1 loss nor autophagy ablation in the absence of Ercc1 induces cell death in BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 10f). To test whether the lack of Er1Lyz2/− nuclear and ribosomal antigen presentation could induce the mitigation of adaptive immune system activation, we next performed MHC-II peptidomics analysis in DKO BMDMs (Supplementary Table 3). We selected the potential MHC-II binders and searched for the protein names of the peptides uniquely identified in the case of Er1Lyz2/− immunopeptidomes when they were compared to wild-type control peptidomes. Notably, no peptides derived from H1.1, RPL30, EXOSC4 and ATP5ME were identified in any of the wild-type or DKO MHC-II ligandomes. Likewise, most of the rest of the Er1Lyz2/− peptides (corresponding to 103 out of 120 proteins) were not in common with the DKO overrepresented peptides. We then checked for the subcellular origin of the DKO overrepresented peptides and traced them back to mainly plasma membrane, cytosolic and extracellular matrix proteins, whereas 8% of the peptides consisted of nuclear proteins where approximately 30% of them were overrepresented in Er1Lyz2/− cells (Fig. 6e). Considering that DNA damage in BMDMs triggers cytoplasmic DNA sensing coupled with a type I interferon response, we checked for the cytoplasmic cGAS levels also in DKO BMDMs, which were increased in comparison to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 10g). DKO BMDM−CD4+ T cell co-culture data well aligned with these results, eliciting a dampened IFNγ production compared to T cells cultured with Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Furthermore, ELISpot assays using splenocytes from 8-month-old mice demonstrated a decline in the recall response of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells isolated from DKO mice (Fig. 6f), indicating a critical role for autophagy in systemic inflammation and autoimmune feature appearance in this model. Interestingly, when we purified lysosomes from DKO BMDMs, there was a reduction in the levels of histone H1 and nuclear lamins B1 and A/C compared to lysosomes from Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs. These findings suggest that autophagy is essential for the presentation of immunogenic nuclear and ribosomal antigens (Fig. 6g).

The lysosomal proteome of senescent cells changes significantly, contributing to the lysosome-derived SASP69. In addition to the exocytosis of extracellular matrix components, we hypothesized that lysosomes from senescent or aged cells might be enriched with proteins also found in the lysosomes of BMDMs accumulating DNA damage (such as in Er1Lyz2/− cells), potentially influencing the immunopeptidome. To test this, we analyzed the lysosomal proteome of senescent SK-MEL-103 cells induced by palbociciclib70. We found that approximately 25% of the Er1Lyz2/− MHC-II-presented peptides were shared with the lysosomal cargo of senescent cells, including nuclear proteins H1 and NME2 and ribosomal proteins such as RPL30 and RPL35A (Fig. 7a). Next, we investigated whether macrophages from aged mice display similar traits of senescence and genotoxic stress, potentially altering their lysosomal content and immunopeptidome. We examined different monocyte and macrophage subtypes from both young (2 months) and aged (24 months) mice, including BMDMs (Ly6G−CD11b+CD115+), cells of monocytic origin (Ly6G−CD11b+) and peritoneal macrophages staining positive for marker F4/80 (thioglycolate-elicited macrophages (TEMs)) (Supplementary Fig. 1a−c). Aged BMDMs exhibited elevated levels of γH2X compared to their young counterparts. Similarly, more splenic macrophages and TEMs from aged mice were positive for γH2AX (Fig. 7bi(iii)). Flow cytometry analysis showed that MHC-II levels were increased across all three aged macrophage subtypes, indicating enhanced antigen presentation (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Notably, a greater proportion of aged TEMs tested positive for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) marker, similar to Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs34 (Fig. 7c). Aged TEMs also showed lamin A/C loss (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a higher percentage of cells with chromatin fragments and higher co-localization of histone H1, p62 and LAMP-1 in aged TEMs (Fig. 7d). These results suggest that DNA damage in aged macrophages leads to profound alterations in their autophagosomal and lysosomal cargo, similar to senescent cells, thereby contributing to higher antigen presentation. Finally, we investigated whether nuclear proteins such as histone H1 and lamin A/C were transported more frequently in lysosomes of aged TEMs and found that they contained higher levels of both proteins. This increase was reduced with 3-MA, implicating macroautophagy in this process (Fig. 7e). Thus, both senescent cells and aged macrophages exhibit significant changes in their lysosomal proteomes, with increase in antigen presentation and, likely, alterations in their immunopeptidome. These changes, driven by DNA damage and macroautophagy, highlight the potential for lysosomes to influence immune responses during aging.

Our study reveals how DNA damage in macrophages links genotoxic stress to autoimmune disorders and identifies autophagy as key in nuclear and ribosomal antigen processing. This mirrors findings in DNA repair-deficient conditions such as xeroderma pigmentosum, where impaired genome maintenance predisposes individuals to autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes and SLE71. Similarly, type 1 diabetes has been associated with Cockayne syndrome, driven by transcription-coupled repair defects that impair DNA damage removal from actively transcribed genes72,73. Individuals with Cockayne syndrome exhibit increased inflammation74. Consistently, exposure to genotoxins can trigger autoimmune responses75,76,77,78. In line, individuals with SLE exhibit higher DNA damage levels compared to healthy individuals, and several proteins related to genome maintenance have polymorphisms79,80,81. Pharmacological targeting of ATR in B cells of patients with active SLE disease attenuates antibody production82. Accordingly, monocyte-derived cells isolated from NZB/NZW F1 mouse spleens exhibited higher levels of γH2AX and MHC-II depending on the DDR protein ATM.

Native DNA turns immunogenic when modified or mislocalized—a shift evident in SLE, where the presence of anti-DNA antibodies is a hallmark. In our study, Er1Lyz2/− mice developed antinuclear autoantibodies, kidney inflammation and complement deposition in the glomeruli, hyperplasia of the spleen white pulp and activation of adaptive immunity. Kidney targeting of immune complexes may be a result of the accumulation of tissue-external nuclear antigens and their corresponding antinuclear antibodies in the kidney filtration barrier or the outcome of MHC-II antigen presentation from BMDMs in the glomerular microvasculature and resident macrophages83,84. DNA damage or repair defects lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of single-stranded DNA10, double-stranded DNA9 or telomeric DNA85, activating a type I interferon response. Cells clear cytoplasmic DNA via various mechanisms including autophagy to maintain homeostasis and prevent immune activation. In addition, autophagy is implicated as a critical mechanism in the defense against pathogens86. Besides its role in suppressing inflammatory responses, macroautophagy is also known to contribute to the development of intracellular MHC-II antigens87,88. Genetic depletion of autophagy in APCs—that is, dendritic cells or macrophages—results in impaired epitope presentation via MHC-II and epitope-specific CD4+ T cell responses89,90,91,92,93. In vivo, dendritic cell-specific Atg5-deficient mice have abrogated autoimmune disease appearance upon myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and fail to mount effective TH1 responses in the presence of a viral challenge, due to defective processing and presentation of MHC-II antigens89,90,93. In Er1Lyz2/− cells and genotoxin-treated macrophages and human monocytes, DNA damage boosts MHC-II antigen presentation, displaying nuclear self-peptides, as revealed by MHC-II peptidome analysis. This underscores the role of autophagy in clearing nuclear proteins for antigen presentation. The enrichment of nuclear proteins and ribosomal protein FAU in lysosomes from Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs supports this hypothesis. Our data align with previous reports that different pathologies result in the formation of unique MHC-II peptidomes94,95. Myeloid cell-specific DNA repair and autophagy-deficient mice (Ercc1fl/−;Atg5fl/fl;Lyz2-cre+, DKO) showed improved autoimmune symptoms, reduced antigen-driven CD4+ T cell responses and reversed nuclear and ribosomal MHC-II epitope presentation and nuclear protein enrichment in lysosomes (Fig. 7f). This supports that the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine—drugs commonly used to treat rheumatic diseases—involves reducing the ability of APCs to present immunogenic peptides to CD4+ T cells.96. Consistently, monocytic-origin cells isolated from NZB/NZW F1 mice had a higher percentage of chromatin fragments in their cytoplasm that were co-localized with p62. Conversely, enhancing autophagy via starvation in Er1Lyz2/− BMDMs lowered the levels of cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA sensor cGAS, indicating the role of autophagy in preventing toxic buildup and dampening antiviral responses to cytoplasmic DNA. Over time, however, this protective mechanism may shift, driving chronic antigen load and heightened T cell responses, ultimately contributing to the development of immunological memory with age. Aged monocytes in mice and humans show elevated MHC-II levels, signaling higher antigen loads and increased autoimmune risk with age17. In 24-month-old macrophages, this rise in antigen presentation, along with increased DNA damage, was evident. We propose that increased nuclear component trafficking to lysosomes via macroautophagy drives heightened MHC-II presentation of nuclear peptides. Together with the observed DNA damage in aged monocytes, this suggests that aging fosters the generation of immunogenic epitopes in macrophages. SASP components secreted during aging significantly contribute to macrophage immunogenic potential and likely also autoimmune responses. In this work, besides the aged macrophage secretome, we suggest that senescent features also determine their lysosomal proteome and MHC-II peptidome. Studies in animal models have shown that chloroquine extends the lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, mice and rats while reducing systemic inflammation97,98,99. Similarly, 3-MA alleviates colitis and inflammation in aged mice100. In this respect, boosting DNA repair capacity101, developing DNA damage-centered peptide vaccines102, leveraging exosome-based therapies to remove cytoplasmic nucleic acids9,10,85 or inhibiting autophagy in age-related autoimmune disorders is promising and could enhance immune tolerance and reduce autoimmune risk.

Wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− mice were generated as previously described by intercrossing Lyz2-cre (C57BL/6 background), Ercc1fl/fl (FVB background) and Ercc1+/− (C57BL/6 background) mice. This breeding strategy produced wild-type mice carrying a floxed and a wild-type Ercc1 allele (Ercc1fl/+) and Er1Lyz2/− mice carrying one floxed and one knockout allele in conjunction with the Lyz2-cre transgene (Lyz2-cre;Ercc1fl/−). Similarly, Atg5fl/fl mice (C57BL/6) were used to achieve the conditional knocking out of both Atg5 and Ercc1 genes in the same background. Eleven-month-old male F1 mice exhibiting lupus-like disease resulted from the cross of NZB × NZW mice. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology-Foundation for Research and Technology (IMBB-FORTH) where the light/dark cycle (12 h) and temperature were controlled. Mice were fed a normal chow diet and were provided water ad libitum. This work received ethical approval by an independent animal ethics committee at IMBB-FORTH. All relevant ethical guidelines for the work with animals were adhered to during this study. For the duration of all in vivo experiments, mice were monitored daily.

Mice were initially anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine. For the acquisition of serum, the blood was centrifuged twice at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept, and pellets were discarded. For the adoptive transfer of mouse sera to young hosts, sera from 10-month-old wild-type and Er1Lyz2/− mice were diluted 1:3 in 1× PBS and injected intravenously once per week for a total of 5 weeks.

Bone marrow was harvested from the tibias and femurs of mice, and precursor cells were differentiated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics (50 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 50 U ml−1 penicillin from Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mM l−1 glutamine from Gibco) and 30% L929 conditioned media for 6 days. On the seventh day, 30% L929 media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS, antibiotics and 10% L929. All treatments were performed on the seventh day of differentiation. In more detail, etoposide (ETO; Sigma-Aldrich, E1383) was added at the concentration of 25 μM for 1 h, and cells were recovered for 24 h before MHC-II flow cytometry analysis. Inhibitors targeting ATM kinase signaling (10 μM ATMi; KU 60019; Sigma-Aldrich, 531978), ATR kinase signaling (10 μΜ ATRi; Millipore, 189299) and DNAPK kinase signaling (2.5 μΜ; NU7441; STEMCELL Technologies, 74082) were added for a 6-h duration. N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, A9165) and Mito-TEMPO (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0737) were added at the concentration of 1 mM and 20 μM, respectively, for 24 h. Autophagy inhibitors 3-MA (Sigma-Aldrich, 189490), 10 mM, and chloroquine (Sanofi Aventis), 50 μM, were added for a duration of 3 h. For the inhibition of endocytosis, cells were treated with 80 μM Dynasore (Sigma-Aldrich, 324410) for a total of 3 h, including a 2-h chloroquine treatment in the case of autolysosome−nuclear protein co-localization studies. LPS-induced activation of BMDMs was carried out at a concentration of 100 ng ml−1 for a 16-h timeframe. For the determination of the cells' autophagic flux, FUW mCherry−GFP−LC3 lentivirus (Addgene, plasmid no. 110060; http://n2t.net/addgene:110060; RRID: Addgene_110060) production was performed in HEK293T cells with helper plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G. The supernatant was collected 72 h later, filtered using a 45-μm filter and precipitated with polyethylene glycol before immediate use or storage at −80 °C until use. Viral transfection of BMDMs with the mCherry−GFP–LC3 plasmid was performed in 10% L929 conditioned media on day 6 of differentiation. Cells were fixed 48 h later, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in 1× PBS and stained with DAPI for the detection of nuclei.

Cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (no. TIB-202) and cultured in RPMI 140 (Gibco). Approximately 2 × 105 cells were treated with 25 μM ETO for 1 h or left untreated and recovered in fresh RPMI medium for 24 h before flow cytometry analysis or 4% formaldehyde fixation for immunofluorescence staining. Cells analyzed with immunofluorescence were treated with chloroquine for 3 h beforehand.

CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of mice. Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were obtained by mushing spleens in 40-μm strainers, collecting cell pellets by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min at room temperature, removing red blood cells (RBCs) by resuspending the pellets in RBC lysis buffer for 2 min at room temperature and, finally, centrifuging again at 300g for 5 min at room temperature. MACS MicroBeads (CD4 L3T4; Miltenyi Biotec, 130-117-043) were used for positive selection of the desired cell population, as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the T cell−BMDM co-culture, isolated BMDMs were seeded on a 96-well plate with CD4+ T cells in a ratio of 1:1 in the presence of 0.5 μg ml−1 CD28 (Invitrogen, 16-0281-86), in RPMI 140 medium (Gibco).

BMDMs were differentiated as described, and 5 × 106 cells were injected intravenously at the timepoints indicated. CD4+ T cells were isolated as described, and 2 × 106 cells were injected intravenously once per week for a total of 8 weeks in young NSG hosts.

Intraperitoneal injections of 70 μg of anti-MHC-II (I-A/I-E, M5/114 monoclonal antibody by Bio X Cell) blocking or isotype control antibodies were administered weekly, for 4−6 weeks.

Intravenous injections of 150 μg of anti-CD4 (Bio X Cell) blocking or isotype control antibodies were administered weekly, for 6 weeks.

BMDMs, TEMs, THP-1 monocytes, CD11b+Ly6G− monocytes from NZB/NZW F1 mice or MEFs were fixed in 1× PBS/4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in 1× PBS, blocked and permeabilized using 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS. Primary antibodies or mouse sera were incubated in 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton/PBS, and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were added in 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three more washes in 0.1% Triton X-100/1× PBS. Mounting was done with 80% glycerol, and samples were imaged with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.

Cells were fixed in methanol, on ice, for 10 min and washed three times with 1× PBS. After fixation, the coverslips were air dried and incubated in 0.05 N HCl for 5 min, on ice, washed three times in 1× PBS and then incubated in a 100 μg ml−1 RNase A (Macherey-Nagel, 740397), 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate solution for 1 h, at 37 °C. A 1× PBS wash was performed for 3 min, followed by sequential ethanol dehydration steps: 35%, 50% and 75% ethanol for 3 min. Then, 0.15 N NaOH in 70% ethanol was added for 4 min; two PBS washes were performed; and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 70% ethanol for 2 min. The fixation buffer was exchanged with 50% and then 35% ethanol, and cells were again washed with 1× PBS for 2 min and treated with 5 μg ml−1 proteinase K in Tris-EDTA buffer for 5−10 min, at 37 °C. After a PBS wash, blocking and primary antibody incubation was performed as described before. An 8-oxoG antibody (Millipore, MAB3560) was used, at a 1:100 concentration, overnight.

Kidneys were fresh frozen in OCT compound and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Kidneys were sliced using a Leica CM1850 UV cryostat (7 μm). Tissue sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with 1× PBS and blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. A similar protocol as the one for immunofluorescence of fixed cells was followed. Kidneys were stained for IgM (dilution 1:500; Invitrogen, A21042), IgA (dilution 1:800; BioLegend, 407001) or C3 (dilution 1:300; Invitrogen, PA5-21349).

Skins, kidneys and spleens were dissected from mice, fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde, washed three times with 1× PBS and then embedded in paraffin blocks. Tissue sections were used for H&E or PAS staining.

For surface protein staining, cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies diluted in staining buffer (1× PBS/5% FBS or 1× HBSS/5% FBS) for 20 min on ice, using the concentrations indicated by the manufacturer. Cells were washed by staining buffer and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. For the staining of intracellular proteins, True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BioLegend, 424401) was used, and cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at room temperature, after fixation. Staining for the detection of granulocyte−monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow was as follows. Bone marrow was collected by flushing the femur, and cells were incubated with RBC buffer for the removal of erythrocytes. Then, 1 × 106 cells were stained with Pacific Blue anti-mouse lineage antibody cocktail (1:10), PE anti-mouse CD34 (1:50), FITC anti-mouse c-Kit (1:100), APC anti-mouse CD16/32 (1:50) and PerCP anti-mouse SCA-1 antibody (1:100) for 3 h at 4 °C, before a PBS/5% FBS wash and flow cytometry analysis. Antibodies and isotype controls were purchased from BioLegend and Proteintech: anti-CD19 (BioLegend, 152410; clone 1D3/CD19), anti-CD138 (BioLegend, 142503; clone 281-2), anti-CD11b (BioLegend, 101212; clone M1I70), anti-CD4 (BioLegend, 100406, 100412 and 100432; clone GK1.5), anti-CD25 (BioLegend, 102012; clone PC61), anti-FOXP3 (Proteintech, PE-65089; clone 3G3), anti-MHC-II (BioLegend, 107606, 107636 and 107631; clone M5/114.15.2), anti-CD86 (BioLegend, 105026; clone GL-1), anti-Ly6G (BioLegend, 127654 and 127607; clone 1A8), anti-CD62L (BioLegend, 104412; clone MEL-14), anti-CD44 (BioLegend, 103036; clone IM7), anti-T-bet (BioLegend, 644812; clone 4B10), anti-PD-1 (BioLegend, 135214; clone 29F.1A12), anti-CD69 (BioLegend, 104507; clone H1.2F3), anti-F4/80 (BioLegend, 123110; clone BM8), anti-CD115 (BioLegend, 135512; clone AFS98), anti-mouse Lineage Cocktail with Isotype Ctrl (BioLegend, 133305; clones 17A2, RB6-8C5, RA3-6B2, Ter119 and M1/70), anti-mouse CD34 antibody (BioLegend, 119307; clone MEC14.7), anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (Sca-1) (BioLegend, 108123; clone D7), anti-mouse CD16/32 (BioLegend, 101325; clone 93), anti-mouse c-Kit (BioLegend, 105815; clone 2B8), anti-mouse CD170 (Siglec-F) antibody (BioLegend, 155523; clone S17007L), anti-mouse NK-1.1 (BioLegend, 108705; clone PK316), anti-mouse CD3a (Proteintech, PE-65060), anti-mouse FoxP3 (BioLegend, 126409; clone MF-14), i-mouse CD8a (BioLegend, 100712; clone 53-6.7), PerCP rat IgG2a (BioLegend, 400529; clone RTK2758) and FITC rat IgG2a (Proteintech, FITC-65209; clone 2A3) were used as isotype control antibodies. Lysosomal dyes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific: LysoTracker Red DND-99 (L7528) and LysoSensor Green DND-189 (L7535). For Annexin V/propidium iodide staining in BMDMs, the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, 556547) was used. Cell analysis was eventually performed in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer or a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). The gating strategies were as follows: forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) for live cell selection and debris removal; forward scatter area/side scatter area (FSC-A/SSC-A) for the subsequent removal of cell aggregates; and then fluorophore-conjugated specific antibodies for the next gates.

Spleens were obtained from NZB/NZW F1 mice, and single-cell suspensions were either cryopreserved and thawed for analysis or directly stained with PE anti-mouse Ly6G (1:200) and APC anti-mouse CD11b (1:100) for 20 min, at 4 °C, in 1× PBS/5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA. Cell sorting was performed in a FACSAria III flow cytometer, and monocytic-origin cells were identified as Ly6G−CD11b+. Cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, in 48-well plates (105 cells per well), and cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 and recombinant M-CSF (250 ng ml−1 working concentration; PeproTech, 315-02). Cells were treated with chloroquine for 3 h prior to fixation. The splenocytes that were not separated through cell sorting were seeded on 48-well plates (105 cells per well), in RPMI 1640 and recombinant M-CSF, and treated with an ATM inhibitor for a duration of 16 h. Cells were collected and stained with DAPI for dead cell exclusion, CD11b and Ly6G for monocyte labeling and MHC-II antigen presentation protein.

Quantitative qPCR was performed using a CFX Duet Real-Time PCR system device (Bio-Rad), and data were analyzed as previously described34. The Hprt1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) gene was used for normalization. Primers: Ccl2: forward: TGATCCCAATGAGTAGGCTGGAG, reverse: ATGTCTGGACCCATTCCTTCTTG; Ccl7: forward: TCCCTGGGAAGCTGTTATCTTC, reverse: TGGAGTTGGGGTTTTCATGTC; Ccl24: forward: AATTCCAGAAAACCGAGTGG, reverse: TGGCCCCTTTAGAAGGCTGG; Cxcl1: forward: CCACACTCAAGAATGGTCGC, reverse: GTTGTCAGAAGCCAGCGTTC; Cxcl5: forward: TGCCCCTTCCTCAGTCATAG, reverse: GGATCCAGACAGACCTCCTTC; Cxcl10: forward: ATGACGGGCCAGTGAGAATG, reverse: CATCGTGGCAATGATCTCAACA.

At least 30 × 106 BMDMs or TEMs pooled from four mice were collected for the isolation of lysosomes using the Lysosome Isolation Kit (Abcam, ab234047). Lysosomes were then lysed using RIPA, and their protein content was detected through immunoblotting analysis.

Cells or lysosomes were lysed with RIPA buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For IFNβ detection from BMDMs, culture supernatants from the same amount of cells were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Merck Millipore, UFC901024). The concentrated supernatants were mixed with equal volumes of 2× Laemmli and boiled at 80 °C for 10 min before being loaded into the gel for SDS−PAGE. For cell and lysosome lysates, protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assay, and equal amounts of protein were loaded (50−80 μg for cells and 5−8 μg for lysosomes) for SDS−PAGE. Equal parts of concentrated supernatant proteins were loaded. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Hybond), blocked using 5% skim milk diluted in 1× PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h and probed with antibodies. β-tubulin or actin was used for the normalization in the case of cell lysates and supernatants and Ponceau staining for the normalization in the case of lysosomal lysates. An ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific and Amersham) development was performed, and results were imaged using ImageBlot (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed using Fiji (ImageJ). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: MHC-II (Bio X Cell, clone M5/114; western blot: 1:800), ERCC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone D-10; western blot: 1:500), Ki-67 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9129S, clone D3B5; FACS: 1:500), γH2AX (Millipore, 05-636; immunofluorescence: 1:12,000), 53BP1 (NB100-304; immunofluorescence: 1:200), IFNβ (Cell Signaling Technology, 97450; immunofluorescence: 1:500, western blot: 1:1,000), pSTAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9167; western blot: 1:250) and STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 14994; western blot: 1:500), β-tubulin (Abcam, ab6046; western blot: 1:1,000), IRF5 (Proteintech, 10547-1-AP; western blot: 1:500), actin (Cytoskeleton, BK037; western blot: 1:5,000), H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8030; immunofluorescence: 1:50, western blot: 1:200), LAMN A/C (Proteintech, 10298-1-AP; western blot: 1:2,000), lamin B1 (Abcam, ab16048; immunofluorescence: 1:500, western blot: 1:1,000), cGAS (Proteintech, 26416-1-AP; immunofluorescence: 1:200), EEA1 (Proteintech, 28347-1-AP; western blot: 1:200), LAMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-19992; immunofluorescence: 1:100), LAMP1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; western blot: 1:200), p62 (Abnova; immunofluorescence: 1:1,000), p62 (Cell Signaling Technology; immunofluorescence: 1:500), GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245; western blot: 1:2,000), FAU (Proteintech, 13581-1-AP; western blot: 1:200), ATG5 (Proteintech, 10181-2-AP; western blot: 1:1,000) and γH2AX (Cell Signaling Technology; immunofluorescence: 1:500, FACS: 1:500).

Approximately 3 × 108 BMDMs, derived from a pool of isolated cells from four mice of the same genotype, were used per each MHC-II immunoprecipitation sample. Cells were initially lysed using a buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors. After rotating the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were again centrifuged at 51,200g for 50 min at 4 °C. Native MHC-II−peptide complexes were purified using InVivoMAb anti-mouse MHC-II (I-A/I-E, M5/114 monoclonal antibody by Bio X Cell) along with Protein G Sepharose beads (Millipore). Immunopeptides were purified using Sep-Pak tC18 columns containing 100 mg of sorbent (Waters Corporation). The elution of peptides from the tC18 sorbent was conducted with 32% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Eluates were volume reduced using a vacuum evaporator until almost all liquid was evaporated. The peptides were then resolved with 2% ACN in 0.5% TFA and stored at −80 °C until further analysis103.

An LC−MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) online coupled to an UItiMate 3000 RSLC nano-HPLC (Dionex/Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were automatically injected and loaded onto a C18 trap column (300-µm inner diameter × 5 mm, Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 5 µm, 100 Å, LC Packings; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 30 µl min−1 flow rate prior to performing C18 reversed-phase chromatography on the analytical column (nanoEase MZ HSS T3 Column, 100 Å, 1.8 µm, 75 µm × 250 mm; Waters Corporation) at a 250 nl min−1 flow rate in a 95-min nonlinear ACN gradient from 3% to 40% in 0.1% formic acid. Profile precursor spectra from 300 m/z to 1,650 m/z were recorded at 60,000 resolution with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 × 106 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. The 15 most abundant peptide ions of charges 1 to 4 were selected from the mass spectrometry scan and fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 28, an isolation window of 1.6 m/z and a dynamic exclusion of 15 s. MS/MS spectra were recorded at a resolution of 30,000 with an AGC target of 1 × 105 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software (version 2.5.0.400; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for peptide and protein identification via a database search (Sequest HT search engine) against the SwissProt murine database (release 2020_02; 17,070 sequences). Furthermore, the workflow for the identification of the immunopeptidome included the INFERYS rescoring node104. The database search was performed with an unspecified peptide cleavage. The precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da. The carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as static modification. Dynamic modifications included the deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, the oxidation of methionine and a combination of methionine loss with acetylation on the protein N terminus. Peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) and peptides were validated with the Percolator algorithm105. Only the top-scoring hits for each spectrum were accepted with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% (high confidence).

The mass spectrometry data for Fig. 6 were acquired in DDA-PASEF mode on a timsTOF Ultra 2 mass spectrometer (Bruker). Peptides were loaded on Evotips (one Evotip for each injection). They were placed in an Evosep autosampler until analysis. The 40 samples per day whisper method employing a 27-min gradient with solvents A (0.1% formic acid, water) and B (0.1% formic acid, MeCN) was chosen, and a 15-cm column (PepSep C18, 1.9-µm beads, 75-µm inner diameter) was used for separation of peptides. Column was heated to 50 °C. The DDA-PASEF method (‘MHC class II') covered a mass range from 100 m/z to 1,700 m/z and a mobility range from 0.64 to 1.45 1/K0. A duty cycle of 100% was achieved by setting the ramp time and accumulation time to 100 ms each. Collision energy for 0.6 1/K0 was set to 20 and for 1.6 1/K0 to 59. Estimated cycle time was 0.6 s.

PEAKS Studio 12.5 software (Bioinformatics Solutions) was employed for peptide identification using the DeepNovo algorithm for de novo peptide sequencing against the SwissProt Mouse database (release 2020_02; 17,061 entries). Mass spectrometry data were searched without enzymatic specificity constraints, with precursor mass error tolerances set to 10.00 ppm and 20.00 ppm for different experiments, and fragment mass error tolerance was maintained at 0.02 Da. Peptide length was constrained between 6 and 30 amino acids to accommodate the broader range typical for MHC-II immunopeptidomics applications. Variable post-translational modifications included N-terminal acetylation (+42.01 Da), asparagine and glutamine deamidation (+0.98 Da) and methionine oxidation (+15.99 Da), with a maximum of three variable modifications permitted per peptide. PSMs were filtered using stringent criteria including DeepNovo confidence scores ≥70.00% and PSM significance thresholds of −log10(P) ≥ 20.0, with confident amino acid assignment requiring ≥2.00% threshold. Label-free quantification was performed using identification-directed quantification with feature intensity thresholds ranging from 300 to 100,000. Ion mobility tolerance was set to 0.05 (1/K0) where applicable. Data refinement included mass correction and chimera association algorithms to improve spectral quality. No normalization methods were applied to preserve the inherent biological variance in the quantitative data.

Co-culture supernatants were collected after two centrifugations: 300g, 5 min, room temperature, for the removal of cells and 2,000g, 15 min, 4 °C, for the removal of cell debris. Protease inhibitors were added, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Mouse IFNγ protein levels were quantified using Mouse IFNγ ELISA MAX Deluxe Set (BioLegend, 430804). Antinuclear autoantibodies were quantified using Mouse Anti-Nuclear Antigens (ANA/ENA) Ig (total (A + G + M)) ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostics International, 5210). Albumin levels in the urine were detected using Mouse Albumin ELISA Kit (Bethyl Laboratories, E99-134).

ELISpot assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mabtech, 3321-4APT-2). In total, 200.000 splenocytes were stimulated for 48 h in the presence of 3 μg of the indicated synthesized peptide (Macrogen) and 30 U ml−1 recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2; PeproTech, 0717108). rIL-2-stimulated splenocytes derived from Er1Lyz2/− mice were used as a negative control. For the T cell−macrophage co-cultures, T cells and BMDMs were mixed in a 1:4 ratio for 48 h, in the presence of 0.5 μg ml−1 anti-CD28 and 30 U ml−1 rIL-2. BMDMs were pretreated with 10 mM 3-MA for 3 h and 20 μg ml−1 anti-MHC-II (I-A/I-E, M5/114 monoclonal antibody by Bio X Cell) or 20 μg ml−1 anti-IFNβ (BioLegend, 508107) for 24 h where necessary. Samples were imaged with a Leica M205 FA dissection microscope, and spots were counted using ImageJ. The peptides used for the assays were as follows: H1-1: KKPKVVKAKKVAKSPA, RPL30: PGDSDIIRSMPEQTGEK, COL1A: TPAKNSYSRAQANKH, HRNRPL: YGNVEKVKFMKSKPG, EXOSC4: GPHEIRGSRSRALPD.

U2-OS cells constitutively expressing APEX2−Flag−LC3B were subjected to autophagosome content profiling as described in Le Gerroué et al.62. Quantification of the proteasomal content of autophagosomes via mass spectrometry was based on SILAC. In brief, APEX2−Flag−LC3B proximal proteins were biotinylated in ‘medium' and ‘heavy' labeled cells by inducing APEX2 activity after incubation with biotinphenol (500 mM) for 2 hat 37 °C and a 1-mimpulse with H2O2 (1 mM). Biotinphenol was also added to ‘light' labeled cells, but biotinylation was not induced by omission of H2O2 application. In heavy labeled cells, autophagy was induced with genotoxic stress for 16 h of etoposide treatment (10 µM), whereas medium and light labeled cells were treated with DMSO. Autophagosome enrichment was induced by adding BafA (200 nM) to all cells for 2 h simultaneously to the biotinphenol treatment. Quenching solution (1 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate and 5 mM Trolox in DPBS) was added to all cells to stop remaining biotinylation reactions, followed by three washing steps with PBS.

Cells were collected from 15-cm dishes by trypsinization (3 min, 37 °C). Afterwards, cells were washed twice in PBS prior to mixing them in a 1:1:1 ratio based on cell numbers.

An autophagosome-enriched fraction was recovered from the cells by the steps below performed at 4 °C prior to a streptavidin pulldown. Cells were washed and incubated in homogenization buffer I (10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES-KOH and 1 mM DTT (pH 7.5)) for 20 min in an overhead shaker. Afterwards, cells were transferred into a dounce homogenizer and lysed with tight-fitting pestle B. The lysate was transferred into a new reaction vessel and diluted in homogenization buffer II (75 mM KCl, 22.5 mM MgCl2, 220 mM HEPES-KOH and 0.5 mM DTT (pH 7.5)). After centrifugation, the autophagosome-rich supernatant was treated with proteinase K (30 µg ml−1) and 1 mM CaCl2 for 30 min. Then, 5 mM PMSF was added to inactivate proteinase K. The fraction was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended and incubated in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 150 mM NaCl) for 30 min. Afterwards, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight with pre-equilibrated NeutrAvidin beads. Beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 3× sample buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT for 20 min at 95 °C. Proteins were incubated with CAA (4.5 mM) in the dark and resolved on SDS-PAGE. In-gel digestion using trypsin followed prior to subjection of the peptides to LC−MS/MS analysis.

Differential protein analysis was performed using rule-based (frequency of identification, fold change) and statistical tests (t-test). Uniquely identified proteins were marked as those identified in all three biological repeats of the group and in none of the repeats of the comparing condition. Commonly identified but differentially abundant proteins between the two conditions were reported as those with greater than or equal to 1.75-fold change of average protein abundance between groups and t-test P < 0.05, for proteins identified in all three biological repeats in each of the comparing conditions. The rest of the proteins were considered non-significant. The t-test was performed on log2-transformed protein intensity values between the heavy and medium isotopically labeled conditions. Analysis was performed in Python programming language using common libraries (scipy, statmodels, numpy, pandas and matplotlib).

Plots were created by a free online platform for data visualization, SRplot (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/en), and GraphPad Prism 8.0.

All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 8.0. Error bars indicate s.e.m. among replicates. Asterisks indicate the significance set at P value: *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001 (two-tailed Student's t-test). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications34. No data were excluded from the analyses. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Samples were allocated to experimental groups according to genotypes or treatments. No method of randomization was used to assign samples to experimental groups.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Former CISA Director Jen Easterly Will Lead RSAC Conference","https://www.wired.com/story/former-cisa-director-jen-easterly-will-lead-rsa-conference/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

Jen Easterly, a longtime public- and private-sector cybersecurity practitioner who led the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for more than three years, has been appointed CEO of RSAC Conference, known as RSAC.

The organization puts on the prominent annual gathering of cybersecurity experts, vendors, and researchers that started in 1991 as a small cryptography event hosted by the corporate security giant RSA. RSAC is now a separate company with events and initiatives throughout the year, but its conference in San Francisco is still its flagship offering with tens of thousands of attendees each spring.

“The conference is the crown jewel, but now we are also a year-round global membership entity for cyber professionals,” Easterly tells WIRED. “We are internationalizing more deeply and I'm excited to expand the innovation sandbox, the early stage expo and startup ecosystem, and that's really about supporting the next generation of AI-driven cyber companies and secure by design innovators to produce high-quality software. In many ways we are living through an inflection point.”

Easterly's appointment as CEO certainly comes at a moment of great transition for the cybersecurity industry. AI tools are beginning to enhance the capabilities of both attackers and defenders, and security experts have a crucial role to play in securing AI platforms themselves along with the infrastructure supporting the services. At the same time, the Trump administration's stark alterations to US foreign and domestic policy seem poised to alter private-sector cybersecurity and public-private partnerships in North America and around the world.

Easterly emphasizes that she is a lifelong independent and that cybersecurity crosses all administrations and borders. She had multiple deployments in the US Army, worked for the National Security Agency, helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense, and spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley's global cybersecurity, all before joining CISA in 2021.

Trust building and collaboration have been some of the most important priorities of her career. But the Trump administration did not ask her to stay on at CISA during the transition at the end of 2024, and President Donald Trump has extensively criticized the election integrity work CISA had been doing under her leadership and that of her predecessor, Chris Krebs. Separately, in July, the Army directed the Military Academy at West Point to rescind an employment offer it had made to Easterly to become the Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair of the academy's Department of Social Sciences.

“I don't approach this leadership opportunity at RSAC through the lens of fear and speculation, I approach it with the same relentless optimism and belief in the power of community that's been at the center of my service, public and private,” Easterly says. “Cybersecurity is not a political endeavor, RSAC is certainly not a political organization, and I am not a political person. I am a lifelong independent.”

Easterly says that RSAC Conference will continue to welcome insights and collaboration from officials of all governments as part of its efforts to facilitate community building and collaboration in cybersecurity. And she says that there is “magic” that can happen when the security community has supportive forums to come together.

“Security and resilience are issues that affect every country, every industry, every citizen,” she adds. “And RSAC's strength is that it brings together operators and technologists and innovators and researchers and policymakers across administrations and across borders precisely because it is grounded in expertise and mission, not in politics.”

Updated 9 am ET, January 15, 2026: Clarified that RSA Conference LLC's flagship event has now been rebranded as RSAC Conference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Real AI Talent War Is for Plumbers and Electricians","https://www.wired.com/story/why-there-arent-enough-electricians-and-plumbers-to-build-ai-data-centers/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

AI companies like Meta and OpenAI have been offering multimillion-dollar pay packages to top talent, hoping to lure the best researchers and engineers away from their competitors. But there's another dimension of the AI talent wars that has garnered far less attention: the massive shortage of electricians, plumbers, and heating and cooling technicians in the US who can build the physical data centers that power AI.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that between 2024 and 2034, there will be a shortage of roughly 81,000 electricians on average each year in the US, measured in terms of unfilled jobs. The BLS projects the number of employed electricians to grow 9 percent over the next decade, “much faster than the average for all occupations.” One McKinsey study came to a more dire conclusion: Between 2023 and 2030, it estimates that an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—would be needed in the US.

The rapid construction of AI data centers across the country is likely a major driver of demand for skilled tradespeople. According to a May blog by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—a labor union representing electrical workers in the US, Canada, and US territories—some local affiliates “are facing single data center projects that require two, three, sometimes four times their current membership.”

Chris Madello, an international representative with the United Association, a union for plumbers and pipe fitters, says data center projects are currently demanding more workers than any other single industry. He adds that with the growth of AI, which requires a huge amount of electricity to run, “more and more manpower” is required.

Some tech companies are already sounding the alarm about the dwindling pool of skilled tradespeople and taking steps to address it. Google announced last spring that it was donating an undisclosed amount of money to the Electrical Training Alliance, a group that provides training materials for electrical workers, to help 100,000 existing electricians upgrade their skills and train 30,000 new apprentices by 2030. The company said the project would contribute to an estimated 70 percent increase in the size of the trade in the coming years.

Tech companies building data centers have to compete for trades talent with other construction projects, including residential housing, hospitals, factories, and energy facilities. In all of these areas, there's already not enough workers to go around. “We have had a skilled construction worker shortage in America for years,” says Anirban Basu, chief economist of the Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group for the construction industry. In earlier eras, he says, tradespeople passed their skills on to their children, but more recently they have been encouraging the next generation to pursue four-year college degrees. As a result, Basu explains, the construction workers with the most advanced skills are now reaching retirement age.

“For years, the industry warned of a ‘silver tsunami' in which these highly skilled baby boomers would retire in large numbers,” Basu says. “That period has arrived. It's been here, and as a result, the industry has been dealing with generally expanding skilled-worker shortages.”

Dan Quinonez, an executive at the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association (PHCC), a trade group for plumbing and HVAC professionals, says that the plumbing industry is “doing everything” it can to increase the number of workers available. But the problem requires long-term solutions and can't be fixed overnight.

Demand for workers also varies widely by trade and by region. In northern Virginia, for example, there's no lack of people applying to become plumbers or pipe fitters, even as data center construction has surged in the area, Madello says.

“We always have far more people applying than we actually accept into our apprenticeship programs,” Madello explains. How many trainees are admitted, he adds, depends largely on how many union members are expected to retire in the coming years.

One problem, however, is getting people trained quickly enough to work on data center projects. Quinonez says the work itself is not very different from other plumbing jobs, but data centers are built on strict schedules, leaving little room for delays or errors.

That matters because apprentices typically learn on the job alongside more experienced plumbers at active construction sites. On data center projects, Quinonez says, companies are far less willing to take risks, since even small mistakes can slow a project down.

“It could get very costly for a contractor for something to go wrong,” he explains. Apprentices and trainees, he adds, may have to go through “more rigorous training” before they are assigned to help build a data center.

David Long, CEO of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), says the group has done a good job keeping pace with retirements by training new electricians. But the scale and technical requirements of data center projects has made it a “challenge”—which he argues that NECA is appropriately meeting—to ensure that all workers are onboarded quickly and safely.

Charles White, who oversees regulatory affairs at PHCC, tells WIRED that there's plenty of incentives for plumbers, pipe layers, and HVAC technicians to work on data centers. The projects typically offer higher pay than other types of construction, partially because of their tight schedules, which make it more likely that workers will log overtime.

White adds that high demand for plumbers incentivizes workers to switch employers, and they are often enticed by the longer hours and therefore better pay being offered by data center developers.

“I actually hear these stories all the time,” Quinonez tells WIRED. “You're going to get paid quickly because you're dealing with an Amazon, or a Google, or a large tech company. So there's competition across the board.”

“The competition does get fierce,” Quinonez adds. “And part of the problem is there's just not enough plumbers and HVAC technicians.”

In any industry, companies are always competing for a limited pool of manpower. But in construction, Madello says, some of the pressure is offset by the reserve of traveling tradespeople, who are prepared to show up “anytime you build something in the middle of nowhere.”

It's unclear how long demand for tradespeople will last after the artificial intelligence boom eventually starts to wane. When construction ends, data centers typically keep a small crew on site around the clock, along with a network of outside contractors who handle repairs for multiple facilities.

“When the project gets done, they're not crawling with people,” White tells WIRED. “But you have all of this stuff that has to be maintained and systems operated. So a certain number of those folks are going to stick around and get on a maintenance crew or an operations crew.”

If construction eventually tapers off, there might not be enough alternative jobs to go around, especially if the US economy enters a recession. But for now, business is great, and how things will end remains anyone's guess. “Is it a sustained boom? Does it crash spectacularly?” says Basu. “Is the activity just gradually receding once the heart of the boom is over?”

                                What happens here matters everywhere

One of Seattle's tallest skyscrapers has a new name that reflects JPMorganChase's growing banking and technology hub in Seattle.

Formerly known as the Russell Investments Center, the building at 1301 Second Ave. is now the JPMorganChase Center.

The renaming coincides with JPMorganChase adding an additional 40,000 square feet at the 42-floor tower, which also houses Zillow Group and Perkins Coie. 

The financial services giant, which now occupies 128,000 square feet, is also relocating its Seattle Tech Center from 1201 Third Ave. to the newly expanded space. 

JPMorganChase has 850 employees in Seattle, including 400 tech workers — that's up slightly from 380 people last year. 

The company's Seattle Tech Center opened in 2018, in part to tap into the region's talent pool. The center focuses on areas including cybersecurity, cloud technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It's led by Mamtha Banerjee, a computer scientist, business leader, and Seattle startup veteran.

JPMorganChase implemented a five-day in-office policy last year. It has more than 2,220 employees across 150 branches and corporate offices in Washington state. There are about 320,000 employees globally. The company recently opened a new headquarters in Manhattan.

The company also on Wednesday anounced $1.5 million in grants to five Seattle-area nonprofits: Business Impact NW, Friends of Little Saigon, Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, Seattle University's RAMP-up, and the Capitol Hill EcoDistrict program of the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle.

The office expansion comes as downtown Seattle hit another record high for vacancy rate last year at 34.7% in Q4, as hybrid work continues to weigh on the commercial real estate market. 

Zillow once filled several floors of the JPMorganChase Center but scaled down after committing to remote work during the pandemic. More than 70% of the Zillow's workforce is made up of remote employees.

Russell Investments moved its Seattle headquarters last year from 1301 Second Ave. to nearby Rainier Square.

As part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.

In addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.

These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers' queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn't just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. 

The foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.

“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation's CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” 

In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site's past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia's YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.

The organization's birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.

After months of rumors that the Trump administration was going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, a tariff has been announced for some chips. The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China.

President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries.

This news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to give Nvidia the green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips to vetted customers in China in December. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X.

In spite of the tariffs, Nvidia publicly cheered the move, which allows it to sell the chip to approved customers.

“We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch.

There is demand for these H200 semiconductors. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies.

Demand is just one factor, though. The other is how the Chinese government decides to regulate these imports.

China finds itself in a similar, yet different situation to the U.S. when it comes to chip production and the global AI race. China wants to boost its domestic semiconductor industry, but the country also doesn't want to fall behind while it waits for its domestic tech to catch up to international rivals.

The Chinese central government is working to draft rules and guidelines of how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas, according to reporting from Nikkei Asia. This would allow for some purchasing of Nvidia's chips and would be a reversal from the country's current adversity toward the chip imports.

Wednesday's executive order does not apply to chips that are imported into the U.S. and then used in the country for research, defense, or commercial purposes.

“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10% of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated.

The tech world's nonconsensual, sexualized deepfake problem is now bigger than just X.

In a letter to the leaders of X, Meta, Alphabet, Snap, Reddit, and TikTok, several U.S. senators are asking the companies to provide proof that they have “robust protections and policies” in place and to explain how they plan to curb the rise of sexualized deepfakes on their platforms.

The senators also demanded that the companies preserve all documents and information relating to the creation, detection, moderation, and monetization of sexualized, AI-generated images, as well as any related policies.

The letter comes hours after X said it updated Grok to prohibit it from making edits of real people in revealing clothing and restricted image creation and edits via Grok to paying subscribers. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

Pointing to media reports about how easily and often Grok generated sexualized and nude images of women and children, the senators pointed out that platforms' guardrails to prevent users from posting nonconsensual, sexualized imagery may not be enough.

“We recognize that many companies maintain policies against non-consensual intimate imagery and sexual exploitation, and that many AI systems claim to block explicit pornography. In practice, however, as seen in the examples above, users are finding ways around these guardrails. Or these guardrails are failing,” the letter reads.

Grok, and consequently X, have been heavily criticized for enabling this trend, but other platforms are not immune.

Deepfakes first gained popularity on Reddit, when a page displaying synthetic porn videos of celebrities went viral before the platform took it down in 2018. Sexualized deepfakes targeting celebrities and politicians have multiplied on TikTok and YouTube, though they usually originate elsewhere.

Meta's Oversight Board last year called out two cases of explicit AI images of female public figures, and the platform has had nudify apps selling ads on its services, though it did sue a company called CrushAI later. There have been multiple reports of kids spreading deepfakes of peers on Snapchat. And Telegram, which isn't included on the senators' list, has also become notorious for hosting bots built to undress photos of women.

In response to the letter, X pointed to its announcement regarding its update to Grok.

“We do not and will not allow any non-consensual intimate media (NCIM) on Reddit, do not offer any tools capable of making it, and take proactive measures to find and remove it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Reddit strictly prohibits NCIM, including depictions that have been faked or AI-generated. We also prohibit soliciting this content from others, sharing links to “nudify” apps, or discussing how to create this content on other platforms,” the spokesperson added.

Alphabet, Snap, TikTok, and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The letter demands the companies provide: 

The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

The move comes just a day after xAI's owner Elon Musk said that he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California's attorney general opened an investigation into xAI's chatbot, following mounting pressure from governments across the world incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen.

xAI has maintained that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such content in the first place.

The problem isn't constrained to nonconsensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI's Sora 2 reportedly allowed users to generate explicit videos featuring children; Google's Nano Banana seemingly generated an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and racist videos made with Google's AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.

The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices, and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don't exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.

U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. The Take It Down Act, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery. But a number of provisions in the law make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.

Meanwhile, a number of states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, New York governor Kathy Hochul proposed laws that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban nonconsensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.

You mention you've done work for public transit - well, if public transit documentation suddenly starts being terrible, will it lead to an immediate, noticeable drop in revenue? Doubt it. Firing the technical writer however has an immediate and quantifiable effect on the budget.Apply the same for software (have you seen how bad tech is lately?) or basically any kind of vertical with a nontrivial barrier to entry where someone can't just say ""this sucks and I'm gonna build a better one in a weekend"".

I don't work for the public transit company; I introduce immigrants to Berlin's public transit. To answer to the broader question, good documentation is one of the many little things that affect how you feel about a company. The BVG clearly cares about that, because their marketing department is famously competent. Good documentation also means that fewer people will queue at their service centre and waste an employee's time. Documentation is the cheaper form of customer service.Besides, how people feels about the public transit company does matter, because their funding is partly a political question. No one will come to defend a much-hated, customer-hostile service.

Sure, the megacorps may start rotting from the inside out, but we already see a retrenchment to smaller private communities, and if more of the benefits of the big platforms trickle down, why wouldn't that continue?Nicbou, do you see AI as increasing your personal output? If it lets enthusiastic individuals get more leverage on good causes then I still have hope.

When it became cheaper to make games did the quality go up?When it became cheaper to mass produce X (sneakers, tshirts, anything really) did the quality go up?It's a world that is made of an abundance of trash. The volume of low quality production saturates the market and drowns out whatever high quality things still remain. In such a world you're just better of reallocating your resources from the production quality towards the the shouting match of marketing and try to win by finding ways to be more visible than the others. (SEO hacking etc shenanigans)When you drive down the cost of doing something to zero you you also effectively destroy the economy based around that thing. Like online print, basically nobody can make a living with focusing on publishing news or articles but alternative revenue streams (ads) are needed. Same for games too.

One of the qualia of a product is cost.

No, but the availability (more people can afford it) and diversity (different needs are met) increased. I would say that's a positive. Some of the expensive ""legacy"" things still exist and people pay for it (e.g. newspapers / professional journalism).Of course low quality stuff increased by a lot and you're right, that leads to problems.

I am genuinely not sure how one can do it when the basis of wealth derives from what exactly? The growth of stock markets which people call bubbles or the US debt crisis which is fueling up in recent years to basically fuel the consumerism spree itself. I am not sure.If you were to make people wealthy, they might still buy cheapest of cheapest crap just at a 10x more magnitude in many cases (or atleast that's what I observed US to do with how many people buy and sell usually very simple saas tools at times)

Maybe my opinion is just biased and I'm in the comfortable position to pass judgment but I'd like to believe that more people would be more ethical and conscious about their materialistic needs if things had more value and were better quality and instead of focusing on the ""price"" as the primary value proposition people were actually able to afford to buy other than the cheapest of things.Wouldn't the economy also be in much better shape if more people could buy things such as handmade shoes or suits?

I hear ya but I wonder how that reflects on Open source software which was the GP request created by LLM let's say. Yes I know it can have bugs but its free of cost and you can own it and modify it with source code availability and run it on your own hardwareThere really isn't much of a difference in terms of hardware/electricity just because of these Open source projectsBut probably some for LLM's so its a little tricky but I feel like open source projects/ running far with ideas gets incentivizedAtleast I feel like its one of the more acceptable uses of LLM in so far. Its better because you are open sourcing it for others to run. If someone doesn't want to use it, that's their freedom but you built it for yourself or running with an idea which couldn't have existed if you didn't know the details on implementations or would have taken months or years for 0 gains when now you can do it in less timeIt significantly improves to see which ideas would be beneficial or not and I feel like if AI is so worrying then if an idea is good and it can be tested, it can always be rewritten or documented heavily by a human. In fact there are even job posts about slop janitor on linkedin lol> Wouldn't the economy also be in much better shape if more people could buy things such as handmade shoes or suits?Yes but also its far from happening and would require a real shake up in all things and its just a dream right now. i agree with ya but its not gonna happen or not something one can change, trust me I tried.This requires system wide change that one person is very unlikely to bring but I wish you best in your endeavourBut what I can do on a more individualistic freedom level is create open source projects via LLM's if there is a concept I don't know of and then open sourcing it for the general public and if even one to two people find it useful, its all good and I am always experimenting.

When it became cheaper to mass produce sneakers, tshirts, and anything, the quality of the individual product probably did go down, but more people around the world were able to afford the product, which raised the standard of living for people in the aggregate.  Now,  if these products were absolute trash, life wouldn't make much sense, but there's a friction point in there between high quality and trash, where things are acceptable and affordable to the many.  Making things cheaper isn't a net negative for human progress: hitting that friction point of acceptable affordability helps spread progress more democratically and raise the standard of living.The question at hand is whether AI can more affordably produce acceptable technical writing, or if it's trash.  My own experiences with AI make me think that it won't produce acceptable results, because you never know when AI is lying: catching those errors requires someone who might as well just write the documentation.  But, if it could produce truthful technical writing affordably, that would not be a bad thing for humanity.

It introduces a lower barrier to entry, so more low-quality things are also created, but it also increases the quality of the higher-tier as well. It's important to note that in FOSS, we (Or atleast...I) don't generally care who wrote the code, as long as it compiles and isn't malicious. This overlays with the original discussion...If I was paying you to read your posts, I expect them to be hand-written. If I'm paying for software, it better not be AI Slop. If you're offering me something for free, I'm not really in a position to complain about the quality.It's undeniable that, especially in software, cheaper costs and a lower barrier to get started will bring more great FOSS software. This is like one of the pillars of FOSS, right? That's how we got LetsEncrypt, OpenDNS, etc. It will also 100% bring more slop. Both can be true at the same time.

I truly don't see this happening anymore. Maybe it did before?If there's real competition, maybe this does happen. We don't have it and it'll never last in capitalism since one or a few companies will always win at some point.If you're a higher tier X, cheaper processes means you'll just enjoy bigger profit margins and eventually decide to start the enshittification phase since you're a monopoly/oligopoly, so why not?As for FOSS, well, we'll have more crappy AI generated apps that are full of vulnerabilities and will become unmaintainable. We already have hordes of garbage ""contributions"" to FOSS generated by these AI systems worsening the lives of maintainers.Is that really higher quality? I reckon it's only higher quantity with more potential to lower quality of even higher-tier software.

I'd argue that this started 30  years ago when automated phone trees started replacing the first line of workers and making users figure out how to navigate where they needed to in order to get the service they needed.I can't remember if chat bots or ""knowledge bases"" came first, but that was the next step in the ""figure it out yourself"" attitude corporations adopted (under the guise of empowering users to ""self help"").Then we started letting corporations use the ""we're just too big to actually have humans deal with things"" excuse (eg online moderation, or paid services with basically no support).And all these companies look at each other to see who can lower the bar next and jump on the bandwagon.It's one of my ""favorite"" rants, I guess.The way I see this next era going is that it's basically going to become exclusively the users' responsibility to figure out how to talk to the bots to solve any issue they have.

First, I understand what you're saying and generally agree with it, in the sense that that is how the organization will ""experience"" it.However, the answer to ""will it lead to a noticeable drop in revenue"" is actually yes. The problem is that it won't lead to a traceable drop in revenue. You may see the numbers go down. But the numbers don't come with labels why. You may go out and ask users why they are using your service less, but people are generally very terrible at explaining why they do anything, and few of them will be able to tell you ""your documentation is just terrible and everything confuses me"". They'll tell you a variety of cognitively available stories, like the place is dirty or crowded or loud or the vending machines are always broken, but they're terrible at identifying the real root causes.This sort of thing is why not only is everything enshittifying, but even as the entire world enshittifies, everybody's metrics are going up up up. It takes leadership willing to go against the numbers a bit to say, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we provide quality documentation, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we use screws that don't rust after six months, yes, we will be better off in the long term if we don't take the cheapest bidder every single time for every single thing in our product but put a bit of extra money in the right place. Otherwise you just get enshittification-by-numbers until you eventually go under and get outcompeted and can't figure out why because all your numbers just kept going up.

That's one way to frame it. An other one is, sometime people are stuck in a situation where all options that come to their mind have repulsive consequences.As always some consequences are deemed more immediate, and other will seem remoter.

Coding is like writing documentation for the computer to read. It is common to say that you should write documentation any idiot can understand, and compared to people, computers really are idiots that do exactly as you say with a complete lack of common sense. Computers understand nothing, so all the understanding has to come from the programmer, which is his actual job.Just because LLMs can produce grammatically correct sentences doesn't mean they can write proper documentation. In the same way, just because they are able to produce code that compiles doesn't mean they can write the program the user needs.

If you are in charge of a herd of bots that are following a prompt scaffolding in order to automate a work product that meets 90% of the quality of the pure human output you produce, that gives you a starting point with only 10% of the work to be done. I'd hazard a guess that if you spent 6 months crafting a prompt scaffold you could reach 99% of your own quality, with the odd outliers here and there.The first person or company to do that well then has an automation framework, and they can suddenly achieve 10x or 100x the output with a nominal cost in operating the AI. They can ensure that each and every work product is lovingly finished and artisanally handcrafted , go the extra mile, and maybe reach 8x to 80x output with a QA loss.In order to do 8-80x one expert's output, you might need to hire a bunch of people to do segmented tasks - some to do interviews, build relationships, the other things that require in person socialization. Or, maybe AI can identify commonalities and do good enough at predicting a plausible enough model that anyone paying for what you do will be satisfied with the 90% as good AI product but without that personal touch, and as soon as an AI centric firm decides to eat your lunch, your human oriented edge is gone. If it comes down to beancounting, AI is going to win.I don't think there's anything that doesn't require physically interacting with the world that isn't susceptible to significant disruption, from augmentation to outright replacement, depending on the cost of tailoring a model to the tasks.For valuable enough work, companies will pay the millions to fine-tune frontier models, either through OpenAI or open source options like Kimi or DeepSeek, and those models will give those companies an edge over the competition.I love human customer service, especially when it's someone who's competent, enjoys what they do, and actually gives a shit. Those people are awesome - but they're not necessary, and the cost of not having them is less than the cost of maintaining a big team of customer service agents. If a vendor tells a big company that they can replace 40k service agents being paid ~$3.2 billion a year with a few datacenters, custom AI models, AI IT and Support staff, and totally automated customer service system for $100 million a year, that might well be worth the reputation hit and savings. None of the AI will be able to match the top 20% of human service agents in the edge cases, and there will be a new set of problems that come from customer and AI conflict, etc.Even so. If your job depends on processing information - even information in a deeply human, emotional, psychologically nuanced and complex context - it's susceptible to automation, because the ones with the money are happy with ""good enough."" AI just has to be good enough to make more money than the human work it supplants, and frontier models are far past that threshold.

If your job depends on processing information - even information in a deeply human, emotional, psychologically nuanced and complex context - it's susceptible to automation, because the ones with the money are happy with ""good enough."" AI just has to be good enough to make more money than the human work it supplants, and frontier models are far past that threshold.

Not from a moral perspective of course, but the technical possibility. And the overton window has shifted already so far, the moral aspect might align soon, too.IMO there is an entirely different problem, that's not going to go away just about ever, but could be solved right now easily. And whatever AI company does so first instantly wipes out all competition:Accept full responsibility and liability for any damages caused by their model making wrong decisions and either not meeting a minimum quality standard or the agreed upon quality.You know, just like the human it'd replace.

That's not sufficient, at least from the likes of OpenAI, because, realistically, that's a liability that would go away in bankruptcy. Companies aren't going to want to depend on it. People _might_ take, say, _Microsoft_ up on that, but Microsoft wouldn't offer it.

I call it the banana bread problem.To curate a list of the best cafés in your city, someone must eventually go out and try a few of them. A human being with taste honed by years of sensory experiences will have to order a coffee, sit down, appreciate the vibe, and taste the banana bread.At some point, you need someone to go out in the world and feel things. A machine that cannot feel will never be a good curator of human experiences.

You may enjoy this story about her work:https://www.folklore.org/Inside_Macintosh.htmlAs a counterpoint, the very worst ""documentation"" (scare quotes intended) I've ever seen was when I worked at IBM. We were all required to participate in a corporate training about IBM's Watson coding assistant. (We weren't allowed to use external AIs in our work.)As an exercise, one of my colleagues asked the coding assistant to write documentation for a Python source file I'd written for the QA team. This code implemented a concept of a ""test suite"", which was a CSV file listing a collection of ""test sets"". Each test set was a CSV file listing any number of individual tests.The code was straightforward, easy to read and well-commented. There was an outer loop to read each line of the test suite and get the filename of a test set, and an inner loop to read each line of the test set and run the test.The coding assistant hallucinated away the nested loop and just described the outer loop as going through a test suite and running each test.There were a number of small helper functions with docstrings and comments and type hints. (We type hinted everything and used mypy and other tools to enforce this.)The assistant wrote its own ""documentation"" for each of these functions in this form:""The 'foo' function takes a 'bar' parameter as input and returns a 'baz'""Dude, anyone reading the code could have told you that!All of this ""documentation"" was lumped together in a massive wall of text at the top of the source file. So:When you're reading the docs, you're not reading the code.When you're reading the code, you're not reading the docs.Even worse, whenever someone updates the actual code and its internal documentation, they are unlikely to update the generated ""documentation"". So it started out bad and would get worse over time.Note that this Python source file didn't implement an API where an external user might want a concise summary of each API function. It was an internal module where anyone working on it would go to the actual code to understand it.

- Most people don't communicate as thoroughly and complete - written and verbal - as they think they do. Very often there is what I call ""assumptive communication"". That is, sender's ambiguity that's resolved by the receiver making assumptions about what was REALLY meant. Often, filling in the blanks is easy to do - as it's done all the time - but not always. The resolution doesn't change the fact there was ambiguity at the root.Next time you're communicating, listen carefully. Make note of how often the other person sends something that could be interpreted differently, how often you assume by using the default of ""what they likely meant was...""- That said, AI might not replace people like you. Or me? But it's an improvement for the majority of people. AI isn't perfect, hardly. But most people don't have the skills a/o willingness to communicate at a level AI can simulate. Improved communication is not easy. People generally want ease and comfort. AI is their answer. They believe you are replaceable because it replaces them and they assume they're good communicators. Classic Dunning-Kruger.p.s. One of my fave comms' heuristics is from Frank Luntz*:""It's not what you say, it's what they hear."" (<< edit was changing to ""say"" from ""said"".)One of the keys to improved comms is to embrace that clarify and completeness is the sole responsibility of the sender, not the receiver. Some people don't want to hear that, and be accountable, especially then assumption communication is a viable shortcut.* Note: I'm not a fan of his politics, and perhaps he's not The Source of this heuristic, but read it first in his ""Words That Work"".

That's the logical fallacy anyone is going to be pushed to as soon as judging their individual worth in an intrinsically collective endeavor will happen.People in lowest incomes which would not be able to integrate in society without direct social funds will be seen as parasites by some which are wealthier, just like ultra rich will be considered parasites by less wealthy people.

Your use of the word parasite, especially in the context of TFA, reminds me of the article James Michener wrote for Reader's Digest in 1972 recounting President Nixon's trip to China that year. In an anecdote from the end of the trip, Michener explained that Chinese officials gave parting gifts to the American journalists and their coordinating staffs covering the presidential trip. In the case of the radio/TV journalists, those staffs included various audio and video technicians.As Michener told it, the officials' gifts to the technicians were unexpectedly valuable and carefully chosen; but, when the newspaper and magazine writers in the group got their official gifts, they turned out to be relatively cheap trinkets. When one writer was bold enough to complain about this apparent disparity, a translator replied that the Chinese highly valued those who held technical skills (especially in view of the radical changes then going on in China's attempt to rebuild itself).“So what do you think about writers?” the complainer responded.To that, the translator said darkly, “We consider writers to be parasites.”

The kind of documentation no one reads, that is just here to please some manager, or meet some compliance requirement. These are, unfortunately, the most common kind I see, by volume. Usually, they are named something like QQF-FFT-44388-IssueD.doc and they are completely outdated with regard to the thing they document despite having seen several revisions, as evidenced by the inconsistent style.Common features are:- A glossary that describe terms that don't need describing, such as CPU or RAM, but not ambiguous and domain-specific terms, of which there are many- References to documents you don't have access to- UML diagrams, not matching the code of course- Signatures by people who left the project long ago and are nowhere to be seen- A bunch of screenshots, all with different UIs taken at different stages of development, would be of great value to archeologists- Wildly inconsistent formatting, some people realize that Word has styles and can generate a table of contents, others don't, and few careOf course, no one reads them, besides maybe a depressive QA manager.

But today's AI might do better than the average tech writer.  AI might be able to generate reasonably usable, if mediocre, technical documentation based on a halfheartedly updated wiki and the README files and comments scattered in the developers' code base.  A lot of projects don't just have poor technical documentation, they have no technical documentation.

I think everyone on the team should get involved in this kind of feedback because raw first impressions on new content (which you can only experience once, and will be somewhat similar to impatient new users) is super valuable.I remember as a dev flagging some tech marketing copy aimed at non-devs as confusing and being told by a manager not to give any more feedback like that because I wasn't in marketing...

But even if a PM cares about UX, they are often not in a good position to spot problems with designs and flows they are closely involved in and intimately familiar with.Having someone else with a special perspective can be very useful, even if their job provides other beneficial functions, too. Using this ""resource"" is the job of the PM.

Also true that most tech writers are bad. And companies aren't going to spend >$200k/year on a tech writer until they hit tens of millions in revenue. So AI fills the gap.As a horror story, our docs team didn't understand that having correct installation links should be one of their top priorities. Obviously if a potential customer can't install product, they'd assume it's bs and try to find an alternative. It's so much more important than e.g. grammar in a middle of some guide.

I think I agree, at least in the current state of AI, but can't quite put my finger on what exactly it's missing. I did have some limited success with getting Claude Code to go through tutorials (actually implementing each step as they go), and then having it iterate on the tutorial, but it's definitely not at the level of a human tech writer.Would you be willing to take a stab at the competencies that a future AI agent would require to be excellent at this (or possibly never achieve)? I mean, TFA talks about ""empathy"" and emotions and feeling the pain, but I can't help feel that this wording is a bit too magical to be useful.

For tech documentation, I suppose that AI agents would mainly benefit from Skills files managed as part of the tool's repo, and I absolutely do imagine future AI agents being set up (e.g. as part of their AGENTS.md) to propose PRs to these Skills as they use the tools. And I'm wondering whether AI agents might end up with different usability concerns and pain-points from those that we have.

I do not think that these skills are so easily replaced; certainly the machine can do a lot, but if you acquire those skills yourself you shape your brain in a way that is definitely useful to you in many other aspects of life.In my humble opinion we will be losing that from people, the upscaling of skills will be lost for sure, but the human upscaling is the real loss.

I suspect a lot of folks are asking ChatGPT to summarize it…I can't imagine just letting an LLM write an app, server, or documentation package, wholesale and unsupervised, but have found them to be extremely helpful in editing and writing portions of a whole.The one thing that could be a light in the darkness, is that publishers have already fired all their editors (nothing to do with AI), and the writing out there shows it. This means there's the possibility that AI could bring back editing.

Au contraire. It's not very often that the cost of labor actually drops to anywhere close to zero, but we have some examples. The elevator operator is a prime example. When it was costly to hire an operator we could only hire a few of them. Nowadays anyone who is willing to operate an elevator just has to show up and they automatically get the job.If 1,000 engineers are worth having around, why not an infinite number of them, just like those working as elevator operators? Again, there is no cost in this hypothetical scenario.> Cost is not the only driver to demand.Technically true, but we're not talking about garbage here. Humans are always valuable to some degree, just not necessarily valuable enough when there is a cost to balance. But, again, we're talking about zero cost. I expect you are getting caught up in thinking about scenarios where labor still has a cost, perhaps confusing zero cost with zero payroll?

Five engineers could be turned into maybe two, but probably not less.It's the 'bus factor' at play. If you still want human approvals on pull requests then  If one of those engineers goes on vacation or leaves the company you're stuck with one engineer for a while.If both leave then you're screwed.If you're a small startup, then sure there are no rules and it's the wild west. One dev can run the world.

Peak productivity has always been somewhere between 1-3 people, though if any one of those people can't or won't continue working for one reason or another, it's generally game over for the project.  So you hire more.This is why small software startups time and time again manage to run circles around with organizations with much larger budgets.  A 10 person game studio like Team Cherry can release smash hit after smash hit, while Ubisoft with 170,000% the personnel count visibly flounders.  Imagine doing that in hardware, like if you could just grab some buddies and start a business successfully competing with TSMC out of your garage.  That's clearly not possible.

I am not even quite sure I know how to manage a team of more than two programmers right now. Opus 4.5, in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, can develop software almost as fast as I can write specs and review code. And it's just plain better at writing code than 60% of my graduating class was back in the day. I have banned at least one person from ever writing a commit message or pull request again, because Claude will explain it better.Now, most people don't know to squeeze that much productivity out of it, most corporate procurement would take 9 months to buy a bucket if it was raining money outside, and it's possible to turn your code into unmaintainable slop at warp speed. And Claude is better at writing code than it is at almost anything else, so the rest of y'all are safe for a while.But if you think that tech writers, or translators, or software developers are the only people who are going to get hit by waves of downsizing, then you're not paying attention.Even if the underlying AI tech stalls out hard and permanently in 2026, there's a wave of change coming, and we are not ready. Nothing in our society, economy or politics is ready to deal with what's coming. And that scares me a bit these days.

Two years ago, I asked chatgpt to rewrite my resume. It looked fantastic at a first sight, then, one week later I re-read it, and feel ashamed to have sent it to some prospective employers. It was full of cringe inducing babble.You see, for an LLM there are no hierarchies other than what it observed in their training, and even then, applying it in a different context may be tricky for them. Because it can describe hierarchies, relationships by mimicry, but it doesn't actually have a model of them.Just an example: It may be able to generate text that recognizes that a PhD title is a step above from a Master's degree, but sometimes it won't be able to translate this fact (instead of the description of this fact) into the subtle differences in attention and emphasis we do in our written text to reflect those real world hierarchies of value. It can repeat the fact to you, can even kind of generalize it, but it won't take a decision based on it.It can, even more now, get a very close simulation of this, because relative importance of stuff would have been semantically capture, and it is very good at capturing those subtle semantical relationships, but, in linguistic terms, it absolutely sucks at pragmatics.An example: Let's say in one of your experiences, you improved a model that detected malignancy in a certain kind of tumor images, improving its false negative rate to something like 0.001%, then in the same experience you casually mention that you tied the CEOs toddler tennis shoes once. Given your prompt to write a resume according to the usual resume enhancement formulas, there's a big chance it will emphasize the irrelevant tennis lace tying activity in a ridiculously pompous manner, making it hierarchically equivalent to your model kung-fu accomplishments.So in the end, you end up with some bizarre stuff that looks like:""Tied our CEO's toddler tennis shoes, enabling her to raise 20M with minimal equity dilution in our Series B round""

Given your prompt to write a resume according to the usual resume enhancement formulas, there's a big chance it will emphasize the irrelevant tennis lace tying activity in a ridiculously pompous manner, making it hierarchically equivalent to your model kung-fu accomplishments.So in the end, you end up with some bizarre stuff that looks like:""Tied our CEO's toddler tennis shoes, enabling her to raise 20M with minimal equity dilution in our Series B round""

One thing to add is that the LLM doesn't know what it can't see. It just amplifies what is there. Assumed knowledge is quite common with developers and their own code. Or the more common ""it works on my machine"" because something is set outside of the code environment.Sadly other fields are experiencing the same issue of someone outside their field saying AI can straight up replace them.

What post was that?

I was terrible writer, but we had to write good docs and make it easy for our customers to integrate with our products. So, I prepared the context to our tech writers and they have created nice documentation pages.The cycle was (reasonably takes 1 week, depending on tech writer workload):    1. prepare context
    2. create ticket to tech writers, wait until they respond
    3. discuss messaging over the call
    4. couple days later I get first draft
    5. iterate on draft, then finally publish it

Today its different:    1. I prepare all the context and style guide, then feed them into LLM.
    1.1. context is extracted directly from code by coding agents 
    2. I proofread it and 97% of cases accept it, because it follows the style guide and mostly transforms my context correctly into customer consumable content
    3. Done. less than 20 minutes

Tech writers were doing amazing job of course, but I can get 90-95% quality in 1% of the time spend for that work.

During the nineties of the last century I was still naive enough to believe that the great improvements in technology, i.e. the widespread availability of powerful word processors and the availability of the Internet for extremely cheap distribution will lead to an improvement in the quality of technical documentation and to easy access to it for everybody.The reverse has happened, the quality of the technical documentation has become worse and worse, with very rare exceptions, and the access to much of what has remained has become very restricted, either by requiring NDAs or by requiring very high prices (e.g. big annual fees for membership to some industry standards organization).A likely explanation for the worse and worse technical documentation is a reduction in the number of professional technical writers.It is very obvious that the current management of most big companies does not understand at all the value of competent technical writers and of good product documentation; not only for their customers and potential customers, but also for their internal R&D teams or customer support teams.I have worked for several decades at many companies, very big and very small, on several continents, but, unfortunately only at one of them the importance of technical documentation was well understood by the management, therefore the hardware and software developers had an adequate amount of time planned for writing documentation in their schedules for product development. Despite the fact that the project schedules at that company appeared to allocate much more time for ""non-productive tasks"" like documentation, than in other places, in reality it was there where the R&D projects were completed the fastest and with the least delays over the initially estimated completion time, one important factor being that every developer understood very well what must be done in the future and what has already been done and why.

The parts about hallucinations and processes are also a bit dated. We're either at, or very close to the point where ""agentic"" stuff works in a ""GAN"" kind of way to ""produce docs"" -> read docs and try to reproduce -> resolve conflicts -> loop back, that will ""solve"" both hallucinations and processes, at least at the quality of human-written docs. My bet is actually better in some places. Bitter lesson and all that. (at least for 80% of projects, where current human written docs are horrendous. ymmv. artisan projects not included)What I do agree with is that you'll still want someone to hold accountable. But that's just normal business. This has been the case for integrators / 3rd party providers since forever. Every project requiring 3rd party people still had internal folks that were held accountable when things didn't work out. But, you probably won't need 10 people writing docs. You can hold accountable the few that remain.

Many engineers are terrible at documentation, not just because they find it boring or cannot put it into words (that's the part an LLM could actually help with) but because they cannot tell what to document, what is unneeded detail, how best to address the target audience (or what is the profile of the target audience to begin with; something you can tell an LLM but which it cannot find on its own), etc, etc. The Fine Article goes into these nuances; it's the whole point of it.> ""Write a manual for air travel for someone who never flew.

My advise to tech writers would be to get really good at directing and orchestrating AI tools to do the heavy lifting of producing documentation. If you are stuck using content management systems or word processors, consider adopting a more code centric workflow. The AI tools can work with those a lot better. And you can't afford to be doing things manually that an AI does faster and better. Your value is making sure the right documentation gets written and produced correctly; correcting things that need correcting/perfecting. It's not in doing everything manually; you need to cherry pick where your skills still add value.Another bit of insight is that a lot of technical documentation now has AIs as the main consumer. A friend of mine who runs a small SAAS service has been complaining that nobody actually reads his documentation (which is pretty decent) and instead relies on LLMs to do that for them. The more documentation you have, the less people will read all of it. Or any of it.But you still need documentation. It's easier than ever to produce it. The quality standards for that documentation are high and increasing. There are very few excuses for not having great documentation.

From reading news from Denmark about it, politicians been repeatedly argued that Google's framing reduces journalism to a revenue input, ignoring its democratic function.

The moat crossing isn't in competing with the likes of Google or Paypal directly. The moat crossing is in accumulating enough capital to build the thing that leapfrogs them. Being a middleman allows you to accumulate a lot of money while expending fairly little of it. Then, you focus on the next thing, be it AI or whatever, while collecting middleman fees.This has a collective effect on a nation's economy. You could tell the American companies to go kick rocks and develop your own local alternatives, but then you're expending your capital on developing a local alternative, not developing the Next Big Thing (TM), and the Americans are. The risk is that your economy becomes less competitive overall while becoming more competitive with one segment of the American economy.

100-120k net is considered quite a good salary and is unattainable even for most as a contracted employee. You do get benefits like healthcare and pensions which work differently. You can get higher rates if you are good at marketing, but then you need to insure your unemployment and pension yourself as well.My latest info on Silicon Valley compensation (Google, Netflix, and Twitter) was that 400k/year gross before tax and RSU was typically achievable with even higher regular occurrences. 50% of that is still way over what you typically find here. (Switzerland excluded but all prices are inflated in Switzerland.)

The whole TechBro mafia structure behind Trump has again and again
threatened damage against Europeans. A good example was Vance trolling
on the security conference in Munich, where he complained how the ultra
right are silenced in Europe. This showed that the new agenda that the
TechBros in the USA do, is actively hostile - this in addition to Trump
acting as agent Krasnov buddy for Putin. So, any more money that goes
into the USA, is ultimately money that goes against Europe. In many ways
Canadians understand this problem MUCH better than many governments in
Europe - just look at the german government. They are absolutely unwilling
to stop being so obedient to the USA. Denmark at the least understands the
problem - why is Germany so strange?

It is a courtesy that citizens from free countries pay US tech companies a middleman fee over various ways. What US tech workers fail to realize is that  - nobody needs Facebook to chat with their family
  - nobody needs Visa, Paypal or Mastercard to pay in a local shop
  - nobody needs Netflix subscription to watch a movie created by a non-US entity
  - nobody needs to pay 50€ per month for privilege of Microsoft spying on your PC
  - nobody needs their emails/pictures held hostage by Apple or Google 
  - nobody needs Uber in order to order a Taxi


So many of these things were done due to convenience and convention, making US tech workers richer and richer. I feel people are realizing what kind of pricks not only the management of US tech companies but also the US tech workers themselves are.

The largest predator to ever walk on Earth may have taken a surprisingly long time to reach its massive size. A new study revealed that it may have taken Tyrannosaurus rex 35 to 40 years to become fully grown.

The team of researchers behind the study, published in PeerJ, carried out an analysis of T. rex fossils to home in on the dinosaur's growth rate. The dinosaur bones showed that T. rex didn't reach its full size until the age of 40, maturing for an additional 15 to 20 years longer than previously estimated.

Scientists examine annual growth rings on the fossilized bones of dinosaurs to determine their age at the time of death. For the recent study, the team gathered samples of thigh and shin bones from 17 Tyrannosaurus specimens, making it the largest collection of data ever assembled on the dinosaur.

Using polarized light, the researchers were able to see previously undetected growth marks on those bones. The growth rings were not accounted for in previous studies. “Examining the growth rings preserved in the fossilized bones allowed us to reconstruct the animals' year-by-year growth histories,” Holly Woodward, a professor of anatomy at Oklahoma State University and lead author of the new study, said in a statement.

The team was able to estimate the growth trajectory of T. rex across all stages of life in a much more detailed way. “The composite growth curve provides a much more realistic view of how Tyrannosaurus grew and how much they varied in size,” Nathan Myhrvold, a mathematician and paleobiologist at Intellectual Ventures who led the statistical analysis for the study, said in a statement.

The findings suggest that T. rex took its time in reaching adulthood, continuing to grow for four decades before reaching a size of roughly 8 tons.

The new growth rate estimates could have implications for how T. rex may have spent its juvenile years. “A four-decade growth phase may have allowed younger tyrannosaurs to fill a variety of ecological roles within their environments,” Jack Horner, a researcher at Chapman University and co-author of the study, said in a statement. “That could be one factor that allowed them to dominate the end of the Cretaceous Period as apex carnivores.”

Smaller but Still Deadly: New Insights Into the Life of Teenage T. Rex

Previous studies suggested that T. rex individuals lived for about 30 years. Although it's difficult to determine the exact age at which the species died, the new study points to a lifespan of around 45 to 50 years.

The massive predator, known for its powerful build and fatal bite, continues to surprise scientists looking to explore the life of the extinct species.

Don't you dare call her the Bride of Frankenstein. The Bride—just the Bride—makes her grand entrance in the first full trailer for Maggie Gyllenhaal's creature romance after that monstrously intriguing teaser back in September. The Bride! stars Jessie Buckley as the title character, with Christian Bale as her similarly undead soulmate, and this extended glimpse gives us even more of those Bonnie and Clyde vibes, with a dash of Joker 2: Folie à Deux (ack), but also an anarchic, punk-rock energy that could indeed translate into an electrifying feature.

We now have a better sense of the Bride's arc—with all those pleas for help, it's clear she was not in a good place before dying and being brought back to life—as well as the movie's plans to incorporate some sort of “damn the man” crusade against corruption but also spontaneous dance parties. The 1930s setting infuses the production design, but Buckley's outlaw heroine is clearly a classic shit-starter unbeholden to any specific time period, declaring, “The dead have got something to say, and I'm saying it!”

As for Bale's Frankie, we get that there's an “I am a monster”/”So am I” dynamic in the relationship, and that perhaps the concept of “monster” will expand beyond the couple's gruesome origins. Less prominent are characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, and the blink-and-you'll-miss-them Annette Bening and Penélope Cruz.

The song in the background is “Everybody Scream” by Florence + the Machine, which feels exactly in line with the tone being conveyed here. What do you think of the trailer—and the propulsive, subversive feeling that The Bride! is giving off?

Written and directed by Gyllenhaal, The Bride! hits theaters March 6.

Elon Musk's social media platform X is taking additional steps to curb its sexual deepfake problem, following weeks of backlash and multiple government investigations around the world. But the changes don't really resolve the issue outright and instead add new layers of limited restrictions rather than a platform-wide fix.

In a pretty confusing post on Wednesday evening, X's @Safety account outlined several updates to how its AI image generation and editing features work, with different rules depending on whether users are generating or editing images by tagging the @Grok account or going straight to the Grok tab on X.

First, the company said it has implemented new technical measures to prevent users from specifically using the @Grok account to alter “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” X says the restriction applies to all users, including those on a premium plan.

X also reiterated that image generation and image editing through the @Grok account are now limited to paid subscribers.

“This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable,” the company said in the post.

X previously announced plans to restrict using @Grok to edit images to paid users, a move that drew criticism from U.K. government officials. A spokesperson for Downing Street said at the time that the change “simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.”

However, as The Verge first pointed out, Grok's image generation tools remain available for free when users access the chatbot through the standalone Grok website and app, as well as through Grok tabs on the X app and website. Using a free account, Gizmodo was also able to access Grok's image generation feature through the Grok tab on both the X website and mobile app. On Thursday, the dedicated site still gave us no trouble when asked to generate an image of Elon Musk wearing a bikini and was willing to take the bikini off. 

The biggest update is that X claims it will now block “the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.” This specific update seems to apply to both the @Grok account and the Grok tabs on X. 

It also arrives as lawmakers in the U.K. are working to make such images illegal. 

“We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content,” the company said.

X and its parent company, XAI, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

The overall changes arrive after weeks of intense backlash over the recent proliferation of sexual deepfakes on the platform, and relative silence from the company itself. Since late last month, some X users have used Grok to generate sexualized images from photos posted by other users without their consent, including images involving minors.

One social media and deepfake researcher found that Grok generated roughly 6,700 sexually suggestive or nudifying images per hour over 24 hours in early January, Bloomberg reported.

Governments around the world have been quick to respond. Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to Grok, while regulators in the U.K. and European Union opened investigations into potential violations of online safety laws.

The U.K.'s online regulator, Ofcom, said it would continue its investigation despite the newly announced changes.

In the U.S., California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Wednesday that his office had launched its own investigation into the issue.

Meanwhile, as scrutiny of Grok has intensified, X quietly updated its terms of service to require that all pending and future legal cases involving the company be filed in the Fort Worth division of the Northern District of Texas, where one of the court's three judges is widely seen as friendly to the company.

Left-leaning watchdog Media Matters, a frequent critic of Musk's X, said it would leave the platform in response to the updated terms.

After a medical issue prompted their evacuation, NASA's Crew-11 astronauts safely splashed down off the coast of California in the predawn hours of Thursday morning. Their departure brought an early end to their mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS), leaving the orbital laboratory temporarily understaffed.

On Monday, Crew-11 pilot Mike Fincke handed command of the space station over to Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Fincke and his three crewmates then departed the ISS on Wednesday, leaving Kud-Sverchkov, his fellow cosmonaut Sergei Mikaev, and NASA's Chris Williams as the station's only remaining crew members.

Three is the minimum number of astronauts required to keep the ISS running. While it's not inherently dangerous to run the ISS with a skeleton crew, it will certainly have an impact on day-to-day operations.

The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 25 years. For the first nine years of operations, the nominal crew size was only three. It has since increased to seven to maximize scientific research and operational efficiency—larger crews mean more hands to perform maintenance and laboratory tasks.

The ISS program is designed to maintain that level of continuous human presence, but missions don't always go as planned, like in the case of Crew-11's medical evacuation. The space station will now operate with a crew of three until the next team of astronauts, Crew-12, arrives in February.

In the meantime, Kud-Sverchkov, Mikaev, and Williams will have to shift their focus toward essential maintenance and space station operations, with less time available for research. They will also refrain from conducting any spacewalks that are not absolutely necessary for safety, as it is nominal to have two crew members perform the EVA while another two provide support from inside the ISS.

Williams will also be managing the NASA segment of the ISS on his own while Kud-Sverchkov and Mikaev oversee the Roscosmos side.

“Chris is trained to do every task that we would ask him to do on the vehicle,” NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya said during a press conference on January 8. Kshatriya added that ground control teams and Williams's Russian crewmates will also be available to assist him.

As long as Crew-12 launches on time, Williams, Kud-Sverchkov, and Mikaev will only be alone on the ISS for about a month. The three of them are expected to remain aboard the space station until the summer, completing an eight-month mission.

Now that the Crew-11 astronauts have returned, all four of them are likely undergoing routine medical evaluations so that they can begin the reconditioning process. Spending an extended period of time in low gravity results in muscular atrophy, bone density loss, and fluid shifts, which means ISS astronauts have to go through weeks of rehabilitation back on Earth.

The ailing astronaut whose condition prompted Crew-11's evacuation will now receive diagnostic attention that wasn't possible on the ISS. NASA has not disclosed which astronaut is affected, nor any specifics about their condition, but has repeatedly said they are stable.

This was the first time in the 25-year history of the ISS that NASA has had to perform a medical evacuation. The agency's ability to bring Crew-11 home safely and expediently just goes to show that it is always prepared for the unexpected, as are the ISS astronauts. NASA officials have expressed utmost confidence in Williams, Kud-Sverchkov, and Mikaev's ability to maintain the space station while they await Crew-12's arrival.

I haven't had many HP portable monitors come across my desk over the years, but the company's latest offering definitely makes a lasting impression. The new HP Series 5 Pro 514PN hits all the right notes with a thin-and-light 14-inch form factor, an aluminum-alloy chassis, and an IPS Black panel (the first I've seen on a portable monitor) that delivers brilliant color and contrast.

In a segment where OEMs are quickly racing to release portable monitors that focus primarily on value (with some dipping into the $50 range), the Series 5 Pro is a more premium choice, priced at $299.

The 514PN has a very clean design, with a svelte aluminum-alloy chassis measuring 12.62 x 8.21 x 0.35 inches and weighing 1.4 pounds. It has a premium look and feel, which is commensurate with a portable monitor that costs $299. There's a built-in kickstand that takes up roughly half of the display's back panel. The kickstand has a stiff hinge that allows the 514PN to lie back at your preferred viewing angle. In addition, because the kickstand spans nearly the full width of the display, it can prop up the 514PN in landscape or portrait orientation.

There are two USB-C ports on the monitor, supporting 65-watt Power Delivery (which I verified worked perfectly with an HP OmniBook X) and DisplayPort 1.2 connectivity. HP wisely includes a USB-C cable with one end that has a 90-degree connector. This helps to keep the USB-C cable from sticking straight out the top of the monitor when used in portrait mode, and instead allows it to more discreetly run horizontally along the top of the monitor.

Speaking of pack-ins, a grey magnetic cover is included to help protect the display when traveling. It's not as all-encompassing as some of the more substantial pouches that protect the entire monitor, but it's better than no protection at all. Perhaps HP was just trying to minimize the 514PN's size profile for travel, but a full pouch/case would be a better solution to protect this pricey accessory.

There aren't really any other major standouts on the 514PN, aside from dedicated + and – buttons for brightness control and a power button situated directly below. I'll also note that the color and size of the 514PN is a perfect match for my personal HP OmniBook X Snapdragon X laptop (right down to the placement of the HP logos on the back of the devices). The only mismatch is that my OmniBook X has a glossy display, while the 514PN has an anti-reflective coating.

Curiously, the 514PN doesn't feature built-in speakers or HDMI connectivity, which are notable omissions for a portable monitor sold through HP's business solutions division.

At first glance, it might appear that the 514PN doesn't have an on-screen display (OSD). And I assumed as much, since there's no OSD button and only two physical buttons for display brightness.

However, I consulted the user manual, which explained that the OSD is activated by pressing and holding the “increase brightness” button for two seconds. This opens the color mode menu; you can then select a mode using the plus button and confirm your selection with the minus button. The color modes include: Warm, Neutral, Cool, Native, Night, HP Enhance+, and Custom RGB.

 




There's no built-in accelerometer, so you'll need to head into Windows display settings to change from landscape to portrait orientation. You'll also be able to change other settings natively in Windows, like the resolution (the 514PN has a native resolution of 2560 x 1600) and refresh rate (the 514PN tops out at 75 Hz, which is slightly above the segment-usual 60 Hz).

The 514PN uses an IPS Black panel with Neo:LED and an anti-reflective coating, and it's excellent. IPS black technology delivers a significant increase in contrast ratio compared to traditional IPS panels. IPS panels used in portable monitors (and laptops) typically have an average contrast ratio of 1,000:1, but the 514PN doubles that metric to 2,000:1. In practice, you will see darker blacks (instead of skewing toward gray) and better color accuracy.

 




Our instrumented testing showed that the 514PN tended to display colors as a bit oversaturated, covering 193.9 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 137.3 percent of sRGB. The numbers that the 514PN put up were more in line with what we'd see in an OLED panel. The brightness numbers from our light meter came in at 352.4 nits, putting it just behind the ViewSonic TD1656-2K (363 nits) and further behind the Dell Pro 14 Plus (409 nits).

I watched a few movie trailers on the 514PN and was amazed at the deep black levels and rich colors. I watched the trailer for Crime 101 and came away impressed by how well the monitor resolved darkened scenes without appearing like a sea of dark greys (much of the trailer shows action taking place at night).

The 514PN has a native panel resolution of 2560 x 1600, putting it on even footing with the TD1656-2K. However, the HP has a slight advantage in maximum refresh rate, topping out at 75 Hz instead of 60 Hz. I appreciated the extra horizontal and vertical resolution when working on spreadsheets, as most portable monitors – especially the budget models – have a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 (or 1920 x 1200).

The HP Series 5 Pro 514PN is a remarkable entry into the portable monitor market. It might not be the thinnest or lightest in its class, but it's well-built and looks great next to your laptop. In addition, the IPS Black panel is gorgeous, with deep blacks and vibrant colors. When using the 514PN as a secondary monitor, you'll appreciate the added resolution that the native 2560 x 1600 panel offers over less expensive 1080p peers. In addition, the two USB-C ports do support 65-watt Power Delivery, allowing you to power your laptop through the 514PN, cutting down on cable clutter.

However, you won't find HDMI connectivity here, nor are there integrated speakers. But the most significant barrier to entry will likely be the price. $299 is a lot to spend on a productivity-focused portable monitor, but it offers better value than the similarly priced Espresso Display 15, which has a 1080p panel. The tougher competition comes from the ViewSonic TD1656-2K, which also features a 1600p display and 65-watt PD, but crams in touch support, macOS support, and so-so speakers. If touch support and internal speakers aren't a big selling point for you, it's hard to argue against the 514PN for customers looking for a premium portable monitor.

Solid single-core results, too.

A few days ago, AMD added two new SKUs to its Strix Halo lineup at CES 2026. One of those was the Ryzen AI Max+ 392, serving as a cut-down version of the top-end AI Max+ 395 but with fewer CPU cores — 12 instead of 16. While the company teased the chips ahead of CES, the first real-world Geekbench listing for the AI Max+ 392 has just surfaced.

 




The new Strix Halo APU scored 2,917 points in the single-core test and 18,071 points in the multi-core test, which almost matches the 18,348 points achieved by the desktop Ryzen 7 9800X3D. This multi-threaded score is actually more than the 17,624 points listed for the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395 on Geekbench's database, but the sample size for that chip is much larger.

Apart from AI, these Ryzen AI Max+ chips are focused on gaming, which is more of a single-threaded task, so it's once again impressive to see the 392 land among the top performers. Once again, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 itself has a recorded score of 2,781 points, so this result in particular is better. As for desktop counterparts, the Ryzen 9 7900X and 7950X3D are both within the margin of error as well.

The Geekbench listing also tells us that the score was extracted from an Asus TUF Gaming A14, a device we covered extensively at CES and even awarded ""best in show"" in the gaming laptops category. This unit, in particular, was rocking 64 GB of on-chip memory running at 8000 MT/s, and boosted up to 5.02 GHz, in line with the listed specs for the chip.

Speaking of, the Ryzen AI Max+ 392 is a 12-core/24-thread CPU with 40 RDNA 3.5 Compute Units (same as the 395). It has 76 MB of L3 cache, a boost clock of 5.0 GHz, along with a rated TDP of 45-120W — Asus caps it at 85W for this machine. Even though the general availability for new Strix Halo machines is Q1 2026, we'll have to wait and see just how much shelf space is populated with these. AMD's other, more mainstream Ryzen AI 400 series was recently listed for a January 22 release in China.

Community pharmacies across England could face widespread closures as business rate discounts are phased out on April 1st, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has warned. 

In a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the NPA said “many pharmacy businesses will be unable to survive” the planned changes.

The warning follows an NPA report published in 2025 which found that 6 in 10 pharmacies risk permanent closure within a year without additional financial support. The NPA represents about 6000 independent pharmacies across the UK.

Reeves said in the 2024 autumn budget that business rate discounts for sectors including pharmacies would fall from 75% to 40% in 2025-2026, with the temporary relief scheme then due to end in 2026-2027. In her 2025 autumn budget, she confirmed plans for new, permanently lower multipliers from April 2026, alongside transitional relief to limit year-on-year increases.

In 2025-2026, the small business and standard business rates in England stand at 49.9p and 55.5p in the £, respectively. From April 2026, the government plans to introduce a reformed system with lower rates for retail, hospitality, and leisure properties, alongside higher rates for larger and higher-value premises, meaning bills will rise for some businesses even as headline rates fall.

“Despite a welcome uplift last year, we are concerned that many pharmacies are hanging on by their fingertips and this could push them to the brink of collapse, leading to more closures impacting the patients we serve,” said Henry Gregg, chief executive of the NPA.

The NPA's letter follows confirmation that pubs will receive additional business rates support in the coming year, unlike community pharmacies.

“It would be indefensible if support was provided to pubs but not to pharmacies, who are fundamental to everyone's health and deserve fair treatment,” Gregg said. 

Unlike most other high street businesses, pharmacies receive about 90% of their income from the NHS for services such as dispensing and vaccination programmes. This means they cannot raise prices to absorb higher business rates. 

Gregg said pharmacies should be treated as equal partners in the NHS and given the same business rates support as GP practices and NHS dental services.

The Treasury said it recognises that lower headline rates will not fully offset rising costs. It has introduced a transitional relief scheme to cap annual increases in business rates until 2028-2029.

“With COVID support ending and valuations rising, we have stepped in to cap bills and help businesses, as part of a £4.3 billion support package,” a spokesperson told Medscape News UK in an emailed comment. 

The Department of Health and Social Care has also committed to increase funding to pharmaceutical services via its Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework from £2.7 billion in 2024-2025 to £3.07 billion in 2025-2026.

However, the NPA said the scale of support remains insufficient.

""Despite a recent uplift, pharmacies still face a yawning £2.6 billion funding gap, with pharmacies closing in record numbers and those still open going to extraordinary and unsustainable lengths to do so,” Gregg said. 

Earlier this week, the NPA called for an above-inflation funding settlement for 2026-2027, contract reform, and a commitment to closing the funding gap. It also urged investment to expand clinical services and changes to end what it described as an “unfair system of clawbacks.”

Extensive research and increased breast cancer screening over the past few decades have led to remarkable progress in understanding breast cancer and developing more targeted therapies. Selecting appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer depends on subtype, location of metastases, symptoms, and prior therapies.

Patients with metastatic breast cancer can develop dermatologic manifestations owing to side effects from anticancer therapies. The most common signs and symptoms include rash, hand-foot syndrome, alopecia, pruritus, paronychia, and onycholysis. Cutaneous metastases can also occur, though they are considered uncommon. Additionally, inflammatory breast cancer is characterized by an erysipeloid appearance on the skin.

Learn more about dermatologic manifestations of breast cancer.

Data indicate that triple-negative breast cancer has the highest incidence of metastasis and distant recurrences. However, any histologic subtype of breast cancer can spread regionally and systemically. Prognosis tends to be worse in this population as well compared with other breast cancer subtypes.

Learn more about breast cancer.

Clinical N3 breast cancer indicates ipsilateral level III node metastases with or without level I or level II nodes, ipsilateral internal mammary metastases with level I or level II node metastases, or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases (with or without node involvement).

Learn more about breast cancer staging.

RANK ligand inhibitors or bisphosphonates are both appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have bone metastasis. Late-generation, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are more potent than earlier-generation, non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Both RANK ligand inhibitors and bisphosphonates are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw, although this is a rare but potentially serious adverse effect. Because both treatments block osteoclast action and can cause hypocalcemia, patients must initiate calcium and vitamin D supplementation before starting treatment, and serum calcium should be monitored during therapy.

The immune system remains seriously out-of-whack – in an inflammatory state of overactivation and impaired functionality – following the international gold standard for treating people with latent tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, a team at Texas Biomedical Research Institute reports in Nature Communications.

The good news is that the treatments control the virus and kill most of the TB bacteria. The bad news is that the immune system in the lungs does not fully recover.""

Riti Sharan, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at Texas Biomed and co-corresponding author

The study is believed to be the most detailed analysis to date documenting what happens in the lungs following the standard treatment for co-infection, which is possible thanks to well-established nonhuman primate models representing humans with latent TB and active HIV.

""We believe this is the first time researchers have shown experimentally how immune responses remain dysfunctional following co-infection and combined treatment,"" said Deepak Kaushal, Ph.D., Professor at Texas Biomed and co-corresponding author. ""It's been hypothesized by many, and this is really the first deep dive into it.""

Latent TB is when Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is present but not causing active symptoms of disease and is not infectious. About a quarter of the world's population – upwards of 2 billion people globally – is estimated to have latent TB. In the U.S., 13 million people are estimated to have the bacteria. The vast majority do not fall ill, but those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, have a higher risk for developing active TB disease. Antiretroviral therapy is highly effective at suppressing HIV, so the virus is no longer the death sentence it once was. Rather, TB has become the leading cause of death for those with co-infection.

Upon a new HIV diagnosis, the World Health Organization recommends antiretroviral therapy to control the virus and an antibacterial protocol called 3HP to help minimize the chance of reactivating latent tuberculosis, which involves taking one pill once a week for 12 weeks.

The Texas Biomed research team has previously shown immune responses remain dysregulated following HIV treatment. This time, they evaluated simultaneous treatment for HIV and latent TB to see if it helped better restore lung immune system functionality.

""Co-infection messes things up for the immune response,"" Dr. Kaushal said. ""You would think that after treatment the immune responses would reset to normal – that does not happen. That has the potential to explain why co-infected people remain at greater risk for respiratory infections.""

The team found that specific populations of T cells, which are white blood cells and a key component of the immune system, were imbalanced following treatment compared with the control group. Specifically, following treatment, there were significantly fewer CD4+ effector memory T cells, which are frontline defenders and send early signals to other immune cells to attack. A subset of beneficial T helper cells (TH1) were decreased, while another T cell type (TH17) was increased and may be responsible for continuous immune system activation.

""When the immune system is continuously activated, it leads to immune exhaustion, which increases susceptibility to reinfection with TB bacteria,"" Dr. Sharan said.

With the help of single cell RNA sequencing, the team also tracked the activity of macrophages – which are large immune cells that engulf Mtb in the lungs – at the beginning of infection. Macrophage functionality, determined through which genes were turned on or off, changed as early as two weeks after co-infection with SIV, the nonhuman primate equivalent of HIV, and did not change back after completing the treatment regimens.

Based on these findings, the bottom line is clear.

""We need host-directed therapies,"" Dr. Sharan said. ""The immune system is not getting any help with these standard treatments. We are controlling the bug, but what about the immune system?""

Host-directed or immunotherapies specifically target a part of the immune system to help improve responses to treatments. The researchers are investigating potential options in their respective labs.

""It's clear treating TB and HIV is not going to be enough to ensure people are able to go on living healthy lives,"" Dr. Kaushal said. ""Developing host-directed therapies to restore the immune system could potentially be used not just for TB and HIV, but for a range of respiratory diseases.""

ATLANTA – U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, after making major strides at the international and club level.

The Florida native captained the U.S. U-20 Men's National Team to the quarterfinals of the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, scoring five goals in the competition to become just the second U.S. player to claim the Golden Boot as the leading scorer of the tournament. After starring at MLS club Inter Miami, Cremaschi currently plays on loan with Serie A side Parma.

Of the five finalists for Young Male Player of the Year, Cremaschi took 38.9 percent of the weighted vote, followed by Cavan Sullivan (34.8 percent) and Mathis Albert (12.3 percent).

“This award means a lot to me,” Cremaschi said. “It's a representation of how my year went with my clubs and the National Team. This is an amazing accomplishment, but it also speaks to all the people around me that keep me going as a player. I want to thank my family, teammates and everyone that made this award possible. My U-20 teammates gave me the confidence I needed to be the player and leader I needed to be at the World Cup. That is a group of guys I will never forget. I also want to thank Marko Mitrovic – a coach I've had at many different levels with the National Team – for his belief and guidance along the way. Finally, I'm so grateful to my family, for their support and love.”

Votes for U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year Awards are collected from National Team coaches, USMNT players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, professional league head coaches and sporting directors, select media members and former players and administrators.

The 2025 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, presented by Henkel, provides the winner with a $10,000 donation toward a charity of the recipient's choice. Cremaschi chose the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST), a premier research organization that is also the largest non-governmental funder of Angelman Syndrome research in the world. Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting the nervous system, affecting one in every 15,000 people, including Benjamin Cremaschi's cousin.

“We congratulate Benjamin on this well-deserved recognition and celebrate the example he is setting for young athletes,” said Jennifer Schiavone, Henkel Vice President, Corporate Communications, Americas. “Henkel is honored to be the presenting sponsor of this year's awards and the first to provide charitable donations in the names of these young players.”

“I want to thank Henkel for this generous donation to the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics,” Cremaschi said. “When they told me there was a donation to the charity of my choice if I won this award, my cousin Martin was obviously the first person I thought of because of the struggles he experiences and the things my uncle and aunt go through. FAST is an organization that does amazing work to drive forward research and development programs for those living with Angelman syndrome and I'm proud to help contribute to their effort.”

The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team returned to the U-20 World Cup after a quarterfinal finish in 2023, with Cremaschi captaining the U.S. throughout the tournament. The midfielder started every game for the USA in Chile, leading the Americans to the quarterfinals for the fifth consecutive tournament. In the team's historic 9-1 group stage victory over New Caledonia, Cremaschi proved to be the key player registering a hat trick in addition to notching two assists. The midfielder added to his goal tally with a brace in a 3-0 Round of 16 victory over 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup runners-up Italy. After scoring five goals in the tournament, Cremaschi set a U.S. U-20 MNT record for most goals scored in a single tournament on the way to winning the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot.

After making his full senior international debut in September 2023, Cremaschi has continued to integrate himself into the U.S. setup including competing with the U.S. Men's Olympic Team for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris as the youngest member of the team. Following strong performances with the Olympic team and Inter Miami, Cremaschi earned his first call-up under USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino last January, starting both friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica.

At club level, Cremaschi was an integral part of the Inter Miami setup, playing 22 games with 16 starts. During the 2025 season, Cremaschi registered one goal and four assists for a team that would go on to win the 2025 MLS Cup. The midfielder's strong showings led to European interest, with Italian Serie A club Parma signing Cremaschi on loan during the summer transfer window, where he has appeared in three matches, including a start in the Coppa Italia.

Cremaschi is the 28th player to be voted the U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year, an award a player can only win once. Future two-time World Cup player Josh Wolff was the inaugural winner back in 1998, with the prize also claimed by future World Cup players Ben Olsen (1999), Landon Donovan (2000), DaMarcus Beasley (2001), Bobby Convey (2002), Eddie Johnson (2004), Benny Feilhaber (2005), Jozy Altidore (2006), Michael Bradley (2007), DeAndre Yedlin (2014), Christian Pulisic (2016), Josh Sargent (2017), Sergiño Dest (2019), Gio Reyna (2020) and Yunus Musah (2022).

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — People on social media are using the hashtag #BoycottWorldCup, citing safety concerns within the United States as reasons to not attend the tournament. 

One man, Mohamad Safa, executive director for Patriotic Vision (PVA) with special status at the United Nations, posted he cancelled his World Cup tickets. 

“The ICE may decide that I am a gang member, and I'll be locked in prison for a year with no charges, no hearing, no trial, no right to consult a lawyer, no phone call. The US is not safe to visit,” wrote Safa on X. 

Others are posting with a similar sentiment, either saying they are not attending or urging others not to go.

“The US is really unable to protect its own citizens right now. We are seeing people killed in broad daylight, so what about tourists? Even the US president is telling the world that international law doesn't matter to him,” said Safa in an interview with FOX4. 

Numbers have circulated online that thousands have cancelled their tickets; however, FOX4 was not able to verify that number. FIFA states on its website that people who purchase tickets cannot cancel their tickets or get a refund. 

Those claiming to have cancelled their tickets may be referring to their application for a ticket through the latest round of Random Selection Draw ticket sales, which closed Tuesday. They would've had to do so prior to when the window wrapped up, which closed Tuesday. But now that the application is closed, you cannot cancel. 

That round of ticket sales saw 500 million ticket requests, according to a FIFA press release.

FOX4 reached out to the World Cup Committee, and a KC2026 spokesperson said, “Our focus is on delivering the best possible experience in Kansas City and welcoming the world to the heartland.”

It won't be long before soccer fans from around the globe descend upon Massachusetts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup Tournament. Organizers have scheduled seven soccer matches for Gillette Stadium in Foxboro from June 13 to July 9.

New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, never one to skip a beat when it comes to promoting the Whaling City, is rolling out a welcome mat for World Cup participants and fans.

""New Bedford is a short drive from Foxboro and is a great place to stay for the games,"" Mitchell said. ""From beautiful beaches to unique restaurants, attractions, and museums, our city has something for everyone while they are here for the World Cup.""

State House News Service reported, ""State officials say they are making progress on preparations but raise fresh concerns about World Cup funding and event locations in a new report to the Legislature.""

Hold the phone! According to New Bedford Publication Information Officer Jonathan Darling, the City may be able to help out there, too.

""The city's first regulation-sized soccer field outside of a public school opened last year at Dias Field,"" Darling said. ""That park also has the city's first mini-pitch, which is an emerging version of soccer on a smaller court. The interest surrounding the World Cup could be a boost to the min-pitch gaining popularity.""

""The City is working with Southeastern Massachusetts Visitors Bureau on marketing and advertising around the World Cup,"" he said.

""People from around the world will descend on Massachusetts this summer for the World Cup, and we encourage all of them to explore New Bedford and experience what makes our city special,"" Mitchell said.

The FIFA World Cup is set to be one of the most exciting events of the year. With 104 matches across 16 host cities, the tournament is bigger than ever and coming to the United States for the first time in decades.

Atlanta is hosting eight matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium during the tournament.

The Random Selection period of ticketing closed on Jan. 13 after 33 days, according to officials. The round allows anyone wishing to purchase tickets to enter a random drawing for the matches they'd most like to attend.

By the end of the entrance period, half a billion people requested World Cup tickets, according to officials.

When potential spectators put their names in the pot for tickets to some of the World Cup matches, they requested which matches they would most like to see.

Here are the matches that were chosen most.

Officials say the list highlights ""the exceptional appeal of both marquee fixtures and knockout-stage encounters across all three host nations.""

World Cup officials also noted where the 500 million ticket requestors were coming from.

""Half a billion ticket requests in just over a month is more than demand — it's a global statement. On behalf of FIFA, I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response,"" Gianni Infantino, the FIFA President, said in a statement.

The highest number of applicants came from the three host countries: the United States, Canada and Mexico, officials said.

But there were also a dominant number of applications from residents of Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

""Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums,"" Infantino said. ""That is why we are committed to creating multiple ways for fans to be part of the FIFA World Cup 2026 – through a wide range of fan experiences beyond the stadiums, both in person and online – so that as many people as possible can share in what will be the biggest sporting event ever staged.”

Now that the ticket requests are in, FIFA officials will verify that the applications meet the set requirements and household limits. Then, the ticket winners will be chosen at random. Those who have been awarded a ticket will be alerted after Feb. 5.

The Random Selection drawing entry period may be closed, but there will be other ways to attend the World Cup.

First, if you would only like to attend a game for a specific team, you may be eligible for a Participating Member Association. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site.

Some fans can also purchase ""premium, elevated matchday"" ticket experiences through hospitality packages, found at FIFA.com/hospitality, or from On Location, the group curating the experiences for the World Cup.

Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. The packages include match tickets in category 1 or 2, transport in the city and to and from the airport, hotel stays and domestic and international flights.

The FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace will be the last official outlet to buy match tickets. The marketplace will open on the FIFA ticketing site on Dec. 15.

Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.

What's next:

Fans will receive an email with the outcome of their ticket application no earlier than February 5.

Tickets will be allocated randomly for matches in which demand exceeds availability, according to FIFA.

If fans don't receive tickets during this phase, they will have another opportunity to purchase remaining tickets during the Last-Minute Sales phase, which is expected to run from early April until the end of the tournament.

FIFA also operates an official resale/exchange marketplace for eligible ticket holders.

By the numbers:

FIFA has faced criticism for its World Cup ticket prices, asking for up to $8,680 per ticket.

Last month, the association said they would offer $60 tickets for every game to the 48 national federations in the tournament.

Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has revealed his squad have been hit with a virus that has affected players and staff. The Blues were without Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens due to illness for their Carabao Cup semi-final clash against Arsenal and both players have been ordered to stay at home. More staff members have also been affected ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash with Brentford.

The Blues are continuing to battle a bug that has ripped through the Chelsea squad in west London. Gittens and Delap remain sidelined due to illness and have been ordered to stay at home, while more staff members have also been affected, according to The Athletic. The situation comes just days after Rosenior replaced Enzo Maresca at the helm and amid a hectic run of fixtures for Chelsea and their new manager. The Blues are due back in action on Saturday against Brentford in the Premier League and still have games against Pafos, Crystal Palace, Napoli and West Ham to come before the end of January.

Rosenior spoke about the situation at a press conference on Thursday. He said Delap would not be back in time for Saturday's game and delivered the latest on the situation. ""No, he's still at home at the moment, recovering. As is Jamie Gittens. Our club doctors are doing everything they can to contain what looks to be a virus because some members of our staff have come down with it as well. We had a meeting today with the players about washing your hands, the basics, which is really important and hopefully we can contain it. We have a busy period, so we need everyone ready to go and fit and healthy.”

Rosenior did have better news on Romeo Lavia who has endured a nightmare time with injuries at Chelsea. The midfielder was ruled out of action again in November but is closing in on a return to training. Rosenior said: ""Romeo is on the pitch, he's not with the group yet but we can see him out on the grass doing his rehab. He is looking really, really good. I love him, firstly as a lad but also as a player. He's someone I would love to work with in the long term because he's just an outstanding footballer. The most important thing for him now is to make sure we don't push him too hard, so that when he does come back, he's back for good and I can get some real work into him tactically. For me, he's a player I can't wait to have back in the group, and I'm really, really looking forward to having him back with us.""

Rosenior faces an in-form Brentford next as he takes charge of Chelsea for the first time in the Premier League on Saturday. The Blues possess a disappointing record against Saturday's visitors and have won just one of their last eight Premier League games against the Bees. Their home record has also been a concern in the 2025-26 campaign, something Rosenior is keen to change. He explained: ""I think the past is the past, I said that to the players. I can only affect the now. If I affect the now, I affect the future. I want us to play with high tempo so the opposition know it is difficult to come and play at Stamford Bridge. The most important thing is that we do the basics really well.""

Brentford will make the short trip to Stamford Bridge two points and three places above Chelsea in the Premier League table. Keith Andrew's side are on a run of six games without a defeat, with the two sides having played out a 2-2 draw earlier in the season at the Gtech Community Stadium.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

Legendary F1 designer and team boss Ross Brawn looks back at some of the standout cars he played a role in creating.

Formula 1 will enter an all-new era in 2026, with overhauled regulations – affecting both chassis and power units – coming into play. Before the latest cars break cover, F1.com sat down with design legend Ross Brawn to revisit some of the most memorable creations from his time in F1 and motorsport as a whole, which spanned various rulesets.

Brawn has an extensive list to choose from, given that his motorsport career began back in the mid-1970s, and featured stints at Williams, Arrows, Benetton, Ferrari, Honda, his own Brawn GP team and Mercedes – plenty of race wins and world titles being secured with cars that he helped turn from concept to reality.

Scroll down for the seven challengers Brawn ultimately chose, including one away from the world of F1, as well as some snippets of background and insight from the man himself…

Factfile

Years: 1979 to 1982
Brawn's role: Aerodynamicist
Races: 43 (including several variants)
Pole positions: 8
Victories: 15
Drivers: Alan Jones, Clay Regazzoni, Carlos Reutemann, Rupert Keegan, Keke Rosberg, Mario Andretti
Titles: 3 (1x Drivers', 2x Teams')

My early career at Williams was pretty crucial, and very influential, on the culture, thinking and approach I took to F1. Patrick Head [then Technical Director] was my mentor, and I don't think you could find anyone better in terms of clear thinking, discipline, and a balanced approach. So, that education was definitely the foundation for everything that came afterwards.

It seems amazing now, because I was a young guy who had an interest in aerodynamics for something completely different. I used to race slot cars and model cars, so we played around with the aerodynamics on those all the time, without really knowing what we were doing. I started to study aerodynamics in a very amateur way, and bought all the books. It was very rudimentary, but it was enough to get going in F1, because no one else really knew anymore.

In those early days I ran the wind tunnel programme at Williams, then Frank Dernie joined [as Head of Aerodynamics] and added a lot more strength to that group. It was a period of incredible progress, and with the Williams FW07, which was the first ground effect car we made, I can honestly say that I was very involved in the aerodynamic design. We won Williams' first World Championship in 1980, so it's one of the cars that's really close to my heart.

Factfile

Years: 1987 to 1988
Brawn's role: Designer
Races: 32 (including A10B variant)
Best result: 3rd
Points scored: 34
Drivers: Eddie Cheever, Derek Warwick

I left Williams because I decided I wanted to try and face some different challenges, and ultimately designed my first F1 car at Arrows – the A10. I remember a chap called ‘Megatron John', who was the owner of our main sponsor Megatron. Megatron was a company that basically bought second-hand computers from large corporations and leased them back to smaller corporations. ‘Megatron John' was making millions out of this process, and he was an enthusiast, so he got us a BMW straight-four engine and put his name on it. It was a moderately successful car. We finished third at Monza during the 1988 season, so we got on the podium with it, and we scored some points with it.

Factfile

Years: 1991 to 1992
Brawn's role: Designer
Races: 19
Pole positions: 11
Victories: 6
Main drivers: Martin Brundle, Derek Warwick, David Brabham, Teo Fabi, Davy Jones, Arie Luyendyk
Titles: 2 (1x Drivers', 1x Teams')

The next big car for me was the Jaguar XJR-14, which was essentially an F1 car with a sportscar body over the top. The World Sportscar Championship rulebook opened up in front of me, and I could see all sorts of ways of interpreting the regulations that had not been intended. It was like being in a playground.

It was quite controversial… I mean, the door was actually the window, and the driver crawled out of the car NASCAR-style! We also had an underwing that we counted as a wing, but it was actually an extension of the underbody, which made it much longer than intended. Of course, when the car appeared, we were told, ‘You can't do that', but when the scrutineers read the regulations, they realised you could.

It was several seconds faster than the opposition when we first raced. I loved it. It was one of those cars that just looked fast. It later got developed into two or three different cars that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a Porsche engine in the back, so it had a very interesting history after we won the World Championship in 1991.

That's also when I first met Jean Todt [future Ferrari Team Principal and colleague], who was the Peugeot team manager at the time. He was my nemesis during that period, because he objected to everything we did!

Factfile

Year: 1994
Brawn's role: Technical Director
Races: 16
Pole positions: 6
Victories: 8
Drivers: Michael Schumacher, Jos Verstappen, JJ Lehto, Johnny Herbert
Titles: 1 (Drivers')

Next on my list is the Benetton B194, which won the Drivers' Championship with Michael. It was an extremely controversial year (writer's note: given the allegations of rule-bending, disqualifications for Schumacher and a collision with title rival Damon Hill at the season finale), but one that demonstrated the value of starting projects early. In 1993 we had active suspension, and in 1994 it was passive suspension, so the cars were very different. We started designing the 1994 car at the beginning of 1993, which was almost unheard of in those days, because cars tended to be designed in the last few months of the previous year.

We had some, not original, but very important ideas around the centre of gravity and weight. It was a very, very light car, so we had a huge amount of ballast that we could stick on the bottom, which got the centre of gravity down. Those physics still apply, whatever the racing car is. It was one of the very special cars in my career, clouded a little bit by the controversy – but a fabulous design and a highlight.

Year: 2004
Brawn's role: Technical Director

Drivers: Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello
Titles: 2 (1x Drivers', 1x Teams')

I think the pinnacle of my time at Ferrari was the 2004 car. It all came together. The thing I loved at Ferrari was every year being better than the one before – in terms of the team, the cars we built, the way it was functioning. Every year we were chipping away at it, and every year we were making things a bit better. It culminated in the 2004 car, I think, being the best ever.

We got screwed thereafter by the tyre regulations changing, but I think we'd become too successful, and we had to be stopped somehow. That juggernaut would not have stopped any other way, because we just had everything working so well. Having sat on the other side of the fence since then, I can understand the frustration of Bernie [Ecclestone, then F1 chief], Max [Mosley, then FIA President] and the promoters. It was becoming a shock when we didn't win, rather than a shock when we did win. That was a very special car.

Year: 2009
Brawn's role: Owner and Technical Director
Races: 17

Victories: 8
Drivers: Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello
Titles: 2 (1x Drivers', 1x Teams')

Then, of course, the Brawn car, which had the whole fairy tale story around it. It's well documented, but what I would emphasise is how the resources of Honda built that car, or the resources of the Honda F1 team. We had three wind tunnels working in parallel at one stage, and that can get confusing if you don't manage it carefully. We designed the programmes to complement the strengths and the weaknesses of each particular tunnel. It was one of the Japanese engineers who came up with the twin floor concept using the tunnel in Japan.

Due to the withdrawal of Honda and the very late adaptation of the Mercedes engine in the car, it's also worth mentioning just how compromised the engine installation was. The gearbox was up in the air, because the crankshaft output height was higher on the Mercedes, so we had to lift the gearbox up to get it to fit. Again, that damages the centre of gravity, and affects the suspension geometry and all sorts of things. There were a lot of compromises on that car to fit the Mercedes engine, so I think if it had been designed with a Mercedes engine from scratch, it would have been even quicker than it turned out to be!

Factfile

Year: 2014
Brawn's role: Team Principal until late-2013
Races: 19
Pole positions: 18
Victories: 16
Drivers: Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg
Titles: 2 (1x Drivers', 1x Teams')

One car I'd also mention, which in a way was a repeat of the 1994 Benetton and the 2009 Brawn, is the 2014 Mercedes. Whilst I was no longer there – I'd left in the winter – that car was a result of exactly the same philosophy: start early, have a dedicated programme, and have a very integrated programme. Andy Cowell [then Engineering Director for Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains] was right in tune with everything we were doing on the chassis, and the two groups worked amazingly well together. The car was a runaway success, so I took a great deal of pride in that.

The actor starred in Eastwood's 2009 film 'Invictus.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Matt Damon is recalling his first on-set experience with Clint Eastwood in the director's chair.


	During a recent appearance on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, the Oscar winner said he quickly learned the legendary filmmaker's directing style when he got shut down on his first day of filming 2009's Invictus for asking to film another take. Eastwood is known for giving actors limited takes while filming.




	“So I was playing a South African rugby player, and that's a really tough accent to do,” Damon remembered, adding that he “spent six months” working with a dialect coach to perfect the accent of his character, Francois Pienaar. “[The coach] would come in from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, we would work on this accent. … It was a lot of work and fun and great.

	“And I showed up [on set] and I am ready and it's my chance to work with one of my heroes,” the Odyssey actor continued. “The very first take, I did it … There are a number of ways I'm thinking of doing the scene and he just goes, ‘Cut, print, move on.' I go, ‘Hang on, hang on, hang on, boss. I want to, you know, I want to do another one. That was the first one!' He goes, ‘Why? You wanna waste everybody's time?' And I went, ‘No, I guess we're moving on.' And it was one take.”


Invictus was Damon's first time working with Eastwood, and his performance ultimately earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He collaborated with the director again on Eastwood's 2010 film Hereafter.


	Damon clarified that there was still “kindness” in Eastwood's tone when he rejected his request for more takes, adding that he's “a lovely guy.”

	











	“His whole mentality was … your crew will go to the ends of the earth for you as long as you're not taxing them on every shot,” Damon explained. “When we need to get in there, we get in there. For the most part, professional actors are going to show up with something good and we keep the momentum.”

Spotify updates prices for U.S. users for the third time in three years.


													By
												

	Marc Schneider


Industry News Editor


	Spotify has officially announced that it will raise prices for premium subscribers in the United States, as well as in Estonia and Latvia, beginning with users' next billing cycle in February. The company says subscribers will receive an email soon explaining the changes.


	In the U.S., the individual premium plan will increase from $11.99 to $12.99 per month, while the family plan will rise from $19.99 to $21.99. The premium duo plan will jump to $18.99, up from $16.99, and the student plan will go from $5.99 to $6.99. Most of these prices weren't detailed in Spotify's announcement on Thursday, but its website has already been updated to reflect the new amounts for U.S. users.

	This marks Spotify's third U.S. price increase in three years, following hikes in July 2023 and July 2024. The company says the adjustments are part of its strategy to maintain a strong value-to-price ratio as it adds new content offerings, like audiobooks, videos and various podcast features.


	Spotify will email subscribers to explain what the changes mean and when they take effect. The company previously told investors that price increases, combined with cost-saving measures, have strengthened margins and profitability. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Spotify highlighted strong third-quarter results driven by subscriber growth. Paying subscribers rose 12% year-over-year to 281 million, with premium users fueling a 12% revenue increase to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).


	Analysts estimate that a U.S. price hike could generate hundreds of millions in additional annual revenue.


	The news comes as Spotify continues to expand its platform, including the recent launch of music videos in the U.S. and Canada following a licensing deal for “expanded audiovisual rights” with the National Music Publishers' Association.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment said Thursday that they have hammered out an industry-first $7 billion-plus worldwide Pay-1 licensing deal for the latter's movies, which will stream on the OTT service around the globe following their full theatrical and home entertainment windows. That's a significant jump in SPE's theatrical output value since its 2021 Netflix Pay-1 agreement. 


	The big deal here is the overseas portion of the pay-1 deal. Sony movies will no longer be split up among myriad parties in their offshore pay-1 window. Netflix and Sony didn't provide financial terms on the deal.

	











	The new global pact isn't a shocker: Sony movies such as Anyone But You and It Ends With Us have continually been among Netflix's top 10 most-watched films in any given moment; not to mention the streamer had Sony Animation's KPop Demon Hunters as a first-run title on the service; that pic became the streamer's most watched movie at a half-billion views and also its first No. 1 box office hit ($19M) in theaters. Similar to the previous Sony-Netflix pay-1 deal, the streamer will continue to license rights to select SPE feature film and TV library titles. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Word was that Sony was pursuing an offshore pay-1 deal with Amazon, but Netflix stepped up here in a major way; the deal is a continuation of the domestic and partial offshore pay-1 deal the streamer had with Sony, first hatched in 2022 at a value of $2.5 billion over five years.


	Netflix currently has Pay-1 rights to SPE's feature films in select territories including the U.S., Germany and across Southeast Asia. Hit films from the current deal include Uncharted, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, It Ends With Us, Anyone But You and Venom: The Last Dance. 


	The new global Pay-1 arrangement will roll out gradually starting later this year as individual territory rights become available, with full global availability on Netflix in early 2029 and continuing through 2032. We understand that the rate card for Sony titles is worth 40% more across the board compared to the first deal. A bulk of that massive increase comes from international.

	











	Some of the first SPE movies that will play on Netflix as part of the new deal include the Dakota and Elle Fanning movie The Nightingale, Sony Pictures Animation's Buds; Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and Sam Mendes' upcoming quartet of Beatles films.


	As Netflix continues to move forward in its acquisition of Warner Bros' motion picture and TV studios as well as HBO Max, this new deal with Sony could serve as proof to government regulators that the streamer continues to license product from third parties.


	The Sony deal with Netflix is alongside Netflix and Universal's U.S. Pay-1B window deal (commencing in 2027) that was announced in October 2024. That was a renewal of the licensing deal for Universal, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination animated titles, as well as Uni and Focus' live-action titles following their run on Peacock post-theatrical and Premium VOD. That deal gives Netflix exclusive rights to Uni titles no later than eight months following their theatrical release, for what's a 10-month exclusive window on Netflix.


	“Our members all over the world love movies and giving them exclusive access to Sony's much loved films adds incredible value to their subscriptions,” said Lauren Smith, VP Licensing and Programming Strategy at Netflix. “Sony's impressive slate of iconic film franchises like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and originals like Anyone But You have been popular with our U.S. audience and now we're excited to expand that offering to our members all around the world.”


	“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable,” said Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution, Sony Pictures Television. “This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix's global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount+ has greenlighted Fear Not, a six-part limited series starring and executive produced by Oscar winner Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada). The project, from writer Bash Doran (Boardwalk Empire), Steve Stark's Toluca Pictures (Wednesday) and MGM Television, is based on the 2023 Vanity Fair article “True Crime, True Faith: The Serial Killer and the Texas Mom Who Stopped Him.”


Fear Not was one of the first big buys for the new Paramount+ regime, led by Cindy Holland, Direct-to-Consumer chair for Paramount, and Jane Wiseman, Head of Originals for Paramount+. It originally landed at the streamer in a competitive situation in early September, just a couple of weeks after Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global was completed August 7.

	Written by Doran, Fear Not tells the story of prolific serial killer Stephen Morin — accused of more crimes than Ted Bundy — and the unlikely bond he formed with Margy Palm (Hathaway), the last woman he ever kidnapped. Morin's abduction of Palm, which started as a deadly captive situation, took an unlikely turn; one which included compassion, prayer, and profound courage. Palm's devotion to her faith and her insistence that Morin could be transformed, became the impetus of a relationship that lasted long after Palm was returned to safety — until Morin received the death penalty.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Produced by MGM Television, Fear Not is executive produced by Doran; Stark and Stacey Levin for Toluca Pictures; Helen Estabrook for Vanity Fair Studios; Anne Hathaway, Adam Shulman and Johnathan Rice for Somewhere Pictures; and Margy, Bart and Noelle Palm. 

	











	For Doran, this marks the third green light in five months, joining pilot orders for Foster Dade at Hulu and How To Survive Without Me at HBO Max, both with Greg Berlanti. 


	“At Paramount+, we are always looking for stories that captivate and entertain our audience, and this series will do exactly that,” Wiseman said. “By grounding this chilling true story in the lived experience of our protagonist, Anne is bringing a level of nuance and gravity to the screen that only a performer of her caliber can. We are thrilled to collaborate with Anne, Bash and the rest of this illustrious team and we can't wait for viewers to see what is sure to be an enthralling limited series.”


Fear Not‘s path to the screen started in October 2023 with a heated bidding war for the rights to VF's article, which appeared in the magazine's September print issue under the headline “Sympathy For the Devil.” It was won for MGM Television by studio-based Toluca Pictures after partnering with Hathaway's Somewhere Pictures. Doran was brought in as a writer for the project, which was initially set up for script development at MGM Television's sibling Prime Video under the previous Amazon MGM Studios regime.


	After the streamer opted not to proceed with Fear Not, the package — now including a finished pilot script by Doran — was taken out. It was pursued by two major streamers. Paramount+ ultimately prevailed, putting the project on fast-track development and commissioning a pilot script rewrite, a backup script and a bible for the series. 


	It took awhile for deals to close between the Amazon-owned MGM Television and the Paramount streamer. In the meantime, development continued in the background, with all the materials delivered in December. Like with many high-profile packages, I hear there was a clock on Paramount+ making a greenlight decision, which, in this case was at least in part driven by Hathaway's limited availability. According to sources, the one opening in her feature schedule that would work for Fear Not is in the fall, giving the proceedings urgency in order to make that window.


	In a vote of confidence, I hear the answer came pretty quickly and ahead of the deadline right after the holiday break, with Paramount+ giving Fear Not a straight-to-series order. It brings back together Holland and her former Netflix executive Peter Friedlander, who oversees MGM Television as Amazon MGM Studios' new Head of Global TV. 


Fear Not joins two other series orders by the new regime at Paramount+. That includes the October pickup of A24's legal drama Discretion starring Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning, which Paramount+ won in bidding war. Both projects are female-driven thrillers, a priority genre for the streamer's new leadership as they are expanding the slate to compliment Sheridan's largely male-skewing series.


	Also in October, Paramount+ formally greenlighted 9/12, a six-episode limited series starring and executive produced by Jeremy Strong, which had been in the works at Skydance Television. 


	As depicted in Miller's piece, Margy Palm, a religious Texas mother, was abducted by Stephen Morin outside of a Kmart while shopping for Christmas gifts on Dec. 11, 1981. She spent eight hours as Morin's hostage before convincing him to set her free by appealing to him through a discussion of her faith. The unlikely friendship that developed resulted in Margy visiting Stephen there more than a dozen times in prison before he was executed by lethal injection in 1985 at age 34.

	











	This marks a rare series regular role for Hathaway who started her career as part of the main cast of the short-lived 1999-2000 Fox comedy-drama Get Real. In 2001, she made her feature debut in The Princess Diaries. Hathaway has been largely focused on movies since, winning an Oscar for Les Misérables. Her only other major TV series role over the past two and a half decades was a lead in the 2022 Apple TV limited series WeCrashed, which she also executive produced. 


	Hathaway has several high-profile movies coming out in 2026, Mother Mary, The Devil Wears Prada 2, The Odyssey, Verity and Flowervale Street. She is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, Sloane, Offer, Weber and Dern. 


	Doran's movie Henry, financed by Studio Canal, starring Ralph Fiennes, will shoot in 2026. She is writing an adaptation of Witness For the Prosecution for 20th Century Studios, and also developing an anthology series for Apple TV+ with Playtone. She created and executive produced Traitors for Channel 4 and Netflix, was a co-executive producer on Hulu's The Looming Tower and co-wrote the Netflix film Outlaw King starring Chris Pine and directed by David Mackenzie. Doran is repped by UTA, Untitled Entertainment and Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham.


	Toluca Pictures is repped by CAA and Myman Greenspan Fineman Fox Rosenberg & Light.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Hans Zimmer and his Bleeding Fingers collective are set to score the HBO Harry Potter series.


	Zimmer, who has scored more than 500 TV and movie projects, has started work on the composition alongside the collective co-founded by Zimmer, Russell Emanuel and Steven Kofsky.


	They are taking on one of the biggest shows of this decade, HBO's reboot of the JK Rowling franchise that made stars of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. The score is a big job, coming after the memorable movie music composed by John Williams, Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper and Alexandre Desplat.

	Zimmer, Kara Talve and Anže Rozman said: “The musical legacy of Harry Potter is a touch point for composers everywhere and we are humbled to join such a remarkable team on a project of this magnitude. The responsibility is something that myself, Kara Talve and Anže Rozman do not take lightly. Magic is all around us, often just beyond reach, but as in the world of Harry Potter, you simply must look for it. With this score we hope to bring audiences that little bit closer to it whilst honoring what has come before.”

	The Harry Potter series has its leads and is also set to feature the likes of Paapa Essiedu, John Lithgow and Janet McTeer.


	The series is written and executive produced by Francesca Gardiner. Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series for HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television.

Oh please… give John Williams his due.  His music is Harry Potter.  No one else contributed iconic music, much less memorable music.

Ever heard of a “swag gap?”

Well, Kylie Kelce is here to not only explain the concept, but also to own it.

“My [social media] algorithm has informed me of a new Gen-Z trend: the swag gap,” the “Not Gonna Lie” podcast host announced on a recent episode. “And I feel personally victimized,” she added.

Kelce then explained the concept of a couple who doesn't sartorially align, using the example of a fashion-forward girl and a guy who quickly slipped on a pair of flip-flops and headed out the door.

And while husband Jason Kelce is known for his love of flip-flops, “I am the one bringing the team down,” Kylie admitted. “it's me. It's not my husband … he's the one who's got the swag.”

It's no secret that the former Philadelphia Eagles player isn't as into fashion as his brother, Travis and Kylie confessed Jason “disliked suits so badly,” before his 2024 retirement.

However, dapper outfits are now part of Jason's regular rotation for his ESPN “Monday Night Countdown” hosting gig — and Kylie is loving the switch-up.

“Let me tell you something … don't ever ask yourself why we have four kids,” she jokes, “that's self-explanatory,” she says with raised eyebrows.

The 33-year old also shared that, when they first met, Jason had a consistent uniform that included tight V-neck T-shirts in multiple colors.

“That was Jason's MO. He would just wear the exact same shirt in a different color,” she said. She went on to describe: “Let me tell you, it hugged his biceps. It hung off the shoulders nicely. And it also emphasized like how, just … it looked good.”

We know Kylie is Jason's biggest fan no matter what he wears — and she's willing to put adoring fans in their place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","George R.R. Martin plans to kill more and different characters than Game Of Thrones show did","https://www.avclub.com/goerge-rr-martin-song-of-ice-and-fire-ending-explained","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:29:44 GMT","

With a new series set in Westeros arriving on Sunday, George R.R. Martin has been doing his media rounds and facing—as he has for at least a decade—questions about his forthcoming books in the Song Of Ice And Fire series. We've known for a while that Martin is sick of being asked about this, but in a new interview in The Hollywood Reporter, the author offers some specifics about his ending for the novels. 

“[The book's ending is] going to be significantly different,” Martin says in the interview. “Some characters who are alive in my book are going to be dead in the show, and vice versa.” He says later in the article, “I was going to kill more people. Not the ones they killed [in the show]. They made it more of a happy ending. I don't see a happy ending for Tyrion. His whole arc has been tragic from the first. I was going to have Sansa die, but she's been so appealing in the show, maybe I'll let her live …” The show, which saw Martin cede more control to showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss by the end of its run, did largely avoid killing its most consequential figures during episodes like “The Long Night,” which doesn't seem like something Martin would do. The series' divergence from his own plans for his ending is part of what has prevented sequel series, like the proposed one about Jon Snow, from happening; he doesn't want the stories to diverge further before he gets to put his stamp on the story's ending.

Of course, it doesn't actually sound like Martin is any closer to finishing The Winds Of Winter than he was the other times this topic has come up. When he does make progress, he describes second-guessing himself or just scrapping it. “I wrote a Tyrion chapter I just loved,” Martin says of his pandemic-era retreat to a cabin to write. “Then I looked at it and said: ‘I can't do this, it will change the whole book. I'll make this into a series of dreams. No! That doesn't work either …'” 

Given the slow pace of Martin's progress, some fans have speculated that a different author may ultimately be the one to finish out ASOIAF. (The profile references a moment in August when a fan asked him this directly because he's “not going to be around much longer,” to which Martin says, “I really didn't need that shit.”) This sounds out of the question. “If that happens, my work won't be finished,” he says about the event of his death. “It'll be like The Mystery of Edwin Drood.” But that's not something Martin wants, either. “I would hate that,” the author says when asked if he'd ever consider just giving up. “It would feel like a total failure to me. I want to finish.”

It wouldn't be a season of A.V. Undercover without an appearance from GWAR, especially when the lineup consists of returning acts, including OK Go, Rhett Miller, and The Wood Brothers. The only real question was which song the intergalactic rockers (by way of Richmond, Virginia) would choose from our list. GWAR's shown an impressive knack for reimaginings, having already offered indelible takes on Kansas' classic rock staple, Cyndi Lauper's ode to masturbation, and an Oscar nominee, to cite just a few of their “dismantlings.” But when the band came a-knocking at Chelsea Studios NYC late last year, it was to join the ranks of Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club,” and transform “the song's glitter-drenched celebration of identity and self-expression into a full-scale alien-metal spectacle.” Mission accomplished:




In a press release, The Berzerker Blöthar said of the choice, “‘Pink Pony Club' is about embracing exile from a boring, shitty world and remaking yourself into whatever you want—be who you are, be who you aren't, piss people off, we don't care!” GWAR also noted their shared history with The A.V. Club, which includes appearing on Undercover more than any other artist and, at one point, giving away an autographed penis (drawn on a piece of drywall). 

We're keeping an ear out for what Roan thinks of the cover, and also extending an early invitation to our fellow Midwesterner to join us for A.V. Undercover season 11. If another GWAR song makes the song list, she'll have an opportunity for her own rejoinder. 

GWAR will kick off The Gor Gor Strikes Back Tour this spring, starting in Richmond, VA (naturally). You can check out upcoming dates here.

Lyndsay Lamb could not be happier for her twin sister and HGTV co-star, Leslie Davis, who announced her surprise engagement on January 14, 2026. The news shocked fans who thought Davis was still married to her first husband, Jacob Davis, and didn't know she'd been dating someone else. 

Posts about the happy news from Davis and Lamb, who have starred in five seasons of “Unsellable Houses,” were flooded with comments from fans, both congratulating Davis and expressing how “confused” they were about her new status. Lamb kindly responded to a few without giving away too many details about her sister's personal life. 

The fifth season of “Unsellable Houses” aired in late 2024, following Davis and Lamb winning the 2024 edition of “Rock the Block,” where Davis said that she met her fiancé, Don Reidy, who worked as a carpenter on the show. She noted in her post that she was “still shocked” to have found love while filming the competition show. 

Although the sisters did appear as judges on “Rock the Block” in 2025, they have not provided any updates on the status of their renovation series. They also have not shared any details about major family changes, like Davis' apparent divorce after two decades. 

In August 2021, Davis wrote in a blog post for Lamb & Co., the design and real estate company she owns with her sister, that she and Jacob were celebrating their 19th anniversary that year. The former couple shares three sons — Kyler, Cash, and Cole. 

That left many fans confused about the engagement. While Davis ignored comments on her post from people expressing surprise, Lamb responded to some on hers. 

When someone wrote, “I need to get an update….” Lamb replied, “It's been almost two years so ya, a ton has happened ◡̈. Leslie has more details on her page.”

Lamb also expressed in the comments of her post how thrilled she is for her twin, including in her reply to someone who wrote, “Congratulations! Seeing your family happy is the BEST!! ❤️” The interior designer replied, “It is the best! I love seeing her happy.”

When another person commented, “Awww, that's awesome. Congrats guys!” Lamb responded, “It's pretty cool!” 

To someone else who noted how happy Lamb must be for her sister, she wrote, “Very happy for them 🙌”

When “Rock the Block” host Ty Pennington expressed how thrilled he was for Davis and Reidy, Lamb replied, “These two are great together!” 

Davis did not reply to comments on her engagement post from fans who expressed confusion, but hours after sharing the news, she put the post in her Instagram Stories, with a photo of her and Reidy after getting engaged, and wrote, “Thank you all so much for the love on our exciting news!”

“No Other Choice” didn't endure quite as impossible a quest as its protagonist, but it's close. After he gets laid off, career man Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) eventually decides that he must hunt down and kill all his potential rivals for the vanishingly rare jobs in the paper-making business, the rock upon which he has built his life. The film has to guide the audience through the wild tonal swings of all those murder-plots and the threat they place on Man-su's family, and it does so with exhilarating visual flourishes and inventiveness. 

 










But one of the hardest pieces of the movie to get right, according to director Park Chan-wook, was the house for which Man-su's willing to kill. The house situates the history and economic limitations of Man-su's circumstances, but it still has to look like the middle-class capitalist dream he's chasing.

“We had to find this house and design this house that could satisfy both requirements. We had to find this perfect midpoint,” Park told IndieWire on an episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “So even before the actual pre-production process had begun, we had already started location scouting for the perfect house. We searched all over Korea and managed to find this house from back in the day, when people called house merchants, that were involved in the real estate business, would build a bunch of similar-looking houses to sell, like a cookie-cutter-style house.” 

 










There used to be houses of that cookie-cutter style, built quickly to simulate a more luxurious idea of home ownership for the buyers than they might otherwise be able to achieve, all over Korea. A lot of them have since been taken down. Finding one of the rare ones still left allowed Director Park and his production team to imbue a sense of that history into the design. Each corner of the property, from the barbecue and picnic tables to the twin doghouses, is a visual representation of that middle-class dream that Man-su doesn't want to wake up from. 

“This architectural design was an imitation of a European style — they actually used to call this a French-style house, even though there was no actual association or relationship with French architecture at all. It was just born from this admiration for European culture, and it's a representation of the greed of the Korean middle class,” Park said. “When you really think about it, it doesn't really reflect elegant taste at all.” 

Starting with that resonant base for the house, Park and his team added the wavy concrete design texture on the exterior, adding a little bit of a brutal(ist), unyielding touch and making the house a castle that Man-su wants to defend. But even the traditionally softer elements of the house were designed to have a slightly sinister valence. 

 










“The garden was created by us, with landscaping professionals, including the tree that had the pink petals in the opening scene of the film. All of the trees and rocks were designed to be there. And of course, we also built the greenhouse in the backyard as well, this cave that Man-su hides in. The bamboo forest was also built in, and this was all very important because Man-su is such a lover of plants.” 

Man-su is a lover of plants, but that by no means limits what he will do to plants. One of the most expressive devices in “No Other Choice” is the way that Park amplifies the sound of Man-su manicuring his bonsai trees to be louder and almost wetter, like bones breaking. It's a signal for some more grisly manipulation he does to one of his victims later in the film, and was, for Park, one of the perks of being able to tell this story in contemporary Korea. 

“[The bonsai] was something that was added for the character, his hobby. In contrast, something that left [from the adaptation] was the theme of the dance party. Initially, the dance park was themed after US history, so people would dress up as historical figures, and Pocahontas was one of those figures. It's something we didn't use anymore for the Korean version,” Park said. 

 










But whether set in Korea or in the original Donald E. Westlake story that “No Other Choice” is based upon, the character of Man-su remained pretty consistent. If anything, the pressures and responsibilities on the character were heightened. “I don't know how things are in America, but Korean people, I think, have a particularly strong obsession with this ownership of their house. That would be something that strengthened in the process. But when I've observed the reception of foreign audiences to this film, I do question whether these elements are limited to just Korean culture,” Park said. “I've noticed that they also feel the same way about these issues.”

Harry Styles has announced his first new album in four years, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., which is out March 6 via Columbia. The former One Direction singer hasn't shared any new music from the LP just yet, but he did unveil the album artwork. Check it out below.

Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally. is the fourth solo album of Styles' career. The record spans 12 songs in total and was produced by Kid Harpoon, who also co-wrote and produced 2022's Harry's House. That previous album churned out the massive hit “As It Was” as well as the singles “Daylight,” “Satellite,” “Music for a Sushi Restaurant,” and “Late Night Talking.”

Styles had quite the time supporting Harry's House, ranging from a headlining set at Coachella in 2022 to winning the coveted Album of the Year award at the 2023 Grammys. He also performed “As It Was” on a handful of awards shows, helped bid adieu to host James Corden on the final episode of his late-night TV series, and starred in the movie Don't Worry Darling. Once he wrapped up his tour, though, Styles largely retreated from the public eye.

In 2024, Styles' longtime friend and One Direction bandmate Liam Payne died after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. He was 31. Styles penned an emotional tribute to Payne online, as did his fellow One Direction members.

SETI Institute Opens Call for Nominations for the 2026 Tarter Award

January 15, 2026, Mountain View, CA – The SETI Institute announced that nominations are now open for the 2026 Tarter Award for Innovation in the Search for Life Beyond Earth. The Tarter Award recognizes individuals whose projects or ideas significantly advance humanity's search for extraterrestrial life and intelligence. 

Named in honor of Dr. Jill Tarter, SETI Institute co-founder and leader in the field of SETI research, the award celebrates contributions across science, technology, education, art, philosophy, law and ethics that support the SETI Institute's mission to search for life and intelligence beyond Earth. Tarter received the inaugural Tarter Award in 2024.

“The SETI Institute's Tarter Award recognizes innovators whose creativity produces a concept that helps improve the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, even though its original purpose was something entirely different,” said Tarter. “Although the Keder Welt was invented so long ago that no official inventor has ever been identified, the person who came up with that exceedingly efficient way of attaching fabric sails to a ship's mast has greatly improved the antennas of the Allen Telescope Array, allowing a radome cover to protect the sensitive electronics at the heart of the signal detection system. We are looking for other creative individuals and their creations that we can use in unexpected ways to do our mission better.”

The Tarter Award is open to any individual or individuals whose innovative work has demonstrably impacted the search for life beyond Earth. For serious consideration, a nominee's contributions should generally have been published, at least in part, in peer-reviewed journals or subjected to an equivalent expert review.

The nomination period opens on January 15, 2026, with a deadline of March 31, 2026. All nominations should be submitted via email to tarteraward@seti.org.

Nomination packets must include:

The 2026 Tarter Award recipient will be publicly honored at a SETI Institute event and will receive $100,000 in recognition of their achievement.

Members of the Tarter Award selection committee include:

""Jill Tarter's career, as significant as it was in developing and broadening the search for possible signals from extraterrestrial intelligence, always included more than just pure research,” said Andrew Fraknoi, SETI Institute Board Member.  “She has been a thought leader in considering the consequences of the search — what it will mean for psychology, for philosophy, for education, and for relations among diverse countries on our planet.  It thus made a lot of sense to name an award for her that recognizes innovative or interdisciplinary projects in the search for life in the universe.""

Elizabeth Short's body was found mutilated and drained of blood on Jan. 15, 1947

Bettmann/Getty ; INTERNATIONAL NEWS PHOTO/Getty

 It has been nearly eight decades since Elizabeth Short was found dead — but her case remains one of Hollywood's most notorious murder mysteries.


 In the early hours of Jan. 15, 1947, the 22-year-old was brutally murdered and then left on the side of the road in an undeveloped Los Angeles neighborhood. Her body had been mutilated and cut in half with surgical precision. Despite the gruesome killing, not a drop of blood was left behind.


 News of Short's death spread quickly, and before authorities could cordon off the crime scene, reporters swarmed the area. It began an intense period of tabloid press coverage fueled by rumors and inaccurate reporting. The media dubbed Short the “Black Dahlia,” a nickname inspired by the 1946 film The Blue Dahlia and influenced by Short's rumored penchant for black clothing.


 The initial investigation into the murder delved into Short's mysterious life, filled with questions about the men she knew and how she lived her life. Hundreds of suspects were considered throughout the inquisition, and several falsely confessed to the crime.


 Although the LAPD had leads into Short's death, including handwritten notes from the killer, no one was ever charged. The Black Dahlia remains an unsolved mystery and a case that detectives are still working on today.


 So, who killed the Black Dahlia? Here's everything to know about what happened to Elizabeth Short, 79 years after her murder and where the investigation stands.


Hulton Archive/Getty

 Short was born on July 29, 1924, and grew up outside Boston with her parents and four sisters, per The Black Dahlia: Shattered Dreams. When she was 6 years old, her father lost the family's savings following the 1929 stock market crash and mysteriously disappeared. His car was later found abandoned on the Charlestown Bridge, where he was believed to have died by suicide.


 After dealing with a respiratory condition and undergoing surgery, a 16-year-old Short began spending winters in Florida with family friends, per a doctor's recommendation who believed the milder climate would help improve her health. Eventually, Short dropped out of high school and regularly visited her loved ones.


 In 1942, Short's mother received an apology letter from her husband, who had been presumed deceased for over a decade, according to Shattered Dreams. In the note, he said that he had begun a new life in Northern California. Soon after, when Short was 18, she decided to join him, but it was short-lived, and she moved out in early 1943.


 Later that year, she relocated to Santa Barbara but ended up being arrested for underage drinking and was sent home to her mother. Short again moved to Florida for a while before returning to L.A. to reportedly pursue her dreams of acting. Less than six months later, she would be found dead.

 Over the last six months of her life in L.A., Short is said to have lived in multiple places across the city while working various jobs. Several men have since recalled enjoying Short's company, taking her on dates, and offering her gifts. She struggled financially but always seemed to come up with money for rent and other necessities.


 “Miss Short's life in Hollywood seemed to follow a pattern. She didn't have any visible signs of employment, she'd be broke, and then suddenly have some money,"" former police officer Vince Carter said in Shattered Dreams.


 He continued, ""Her roommates, the bartenders, and the hotel clerks all came up with the same story. She was secretive — never one to confide. She never said what she was really doing, or who she was really going out with, or where she was really going.""


 In December 1946, just weeks before her murder, Short left L.A. for San Diego. She allegedly told friends that she was scared but didn't explain why, and immediately moved. When Short arrived in San Diego, she met another young woman named Dorothy French, who allowed her to stay with her family.


 During her time with them, Short admitted she was hiding from an ex-boyfriend out of fear, per Black Dahlia Avenger: A Genius Murder. French revealed that several weeks into Short's stay, two men and a woman came to the home looking for her. Upon hearing about the visitors, Short became “very frightened” and “panicky,” refusing to see them. They eventually left, and she decided to relocate.


 According to Shattered Dreams, Short departed on Jan. 8 with a traveling salesman she had been seeing. They drove back to L.A. together, and he dropped her off at the Biltmore Hotel, where she claimed to be meeting her sister. (Short's sibling, Virginia, later told authorities they hadn't arranged to see each other.)


 Hotel employees recounted seeing Short make several telephone calls in the lobby that evening, growing increasingly frantic. She finally departed the hotel around 10 p.m., and it was the last confirmed time she was seen alive.


 The next few days of Short's life leading up to her murder have been shrouded in some degree of mystery. Her exact whereabouts are unknown, aside from sporadic sightings and an alleged encounter with Officer Myrl McBride, who claimed to have seen Short on Jan. 14, just hours before she was found dead.


 According to Black Dahlia Avenger, McBride told authorities that the woman, believed to be Short, approached her “sobbing in terror” and claimed that someone threatened to kill her. Short appeared too shaken up to return to a bar she had been in to retrieve her purse, so McBride accompanied her. By then, the man was gone, and McBride left Short's side.


 Later, McBride saw Short exiting the same bar with two men and a woman, and the officer checked in on her. Although she appeared to be fine at the time, Short was murdered hours later.


 On the morning of Jan. 15, 1947, Short's body was discovered by a young mother on a walk with her child through Leimert Park, an L.A. neighborhood that was largely undeveloped at the time.


 Noticing the body from afar, the woman first believed it to be a mannequin, per the FBI, due to the contorted position of the limbs. As she approached the grassy area on the side of the road, she found something much more horrific.


 Short's naked body had been severed at the waist with surgical precision. Though internal organs were removed, the extensively mutilated corpse had been drained of blood, indicating that Short had been killed elsewhere. Her face was also bruised and cut, with a grisly slash running from each side of her mouth.


 When the coroner later examined the body, he ruled that the cause of death was due to hemorrhaging from the lacerations to Short's face and the shock from the repeated strikes to her head, according to Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia.

 When police arrived at the scene of the crime, they had no idea about the identity of the mysterious young woman. Being so disfigured, authorities knew that they would be unable to share photos of the body with the public.


 Instead, they took her fingerprints and allowed an artist from the Los Angeles Examiner to sketch a recreation of the unidentified woman, per The Black Dahlia: Shattered Dreams.


 Police quickly mailed a copy of Short's fingerprints to the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., but, being cross-country, they knew it would be days before they received answers.


 That's when a staff member at the Examiner suggested that authorities send the fingerprints using the newspaper's new Soundphoto machine — an early version of a fax machine.


 Hours later, the FBI successfully identified Short, thanks to the fingerprints they had on record from when she applied for a job on an army base in California and when she was arrested for underage drinking.


INTERNATIONAL NEWS PHOTO/Getty

 The origins of Short's Black Dahlia nickname date back long before her murder.


 When Short was briefly living in the Long Beach area of California, she was reportedly given the name as a play on the 1946 film The Blue Dahlia and as a tribute to Short's dark hair and rumored preference for wearing black clothing, according to the Los Angeles Times.


 Around the time that Short was murdered, it was common for newspapers to assign a nickname for murder cases, especially those involving women. Upon news of Short's death, the case made major headlines, and the media became engrossed in coverage of the investigation. The day after Short was found dead, the Examiner sold the most copies it had since World War II ended, per The Guardian.


 While outlets initially dubbed the Short's killing the Werewolf Murder, writers quickly pivoted when they learned of her nickname, per the Los Angeles Times. While it's unclear which journalist discovered the name first, the Black Dahlia moniker appeared in print for the first time in both the Herald-Express and the Los Angeles Daily News on Jan. 17.


 Newspapers would go on to cover the case in a sensational manner for months — with related items making front page news for 31 consecutive days on the cover of the Los Angeles Record, according to The Guardian.


INTERNATIONAL NEWS PHOTO/Getty

 After Short's body was discovered, the Los Angeles Police Department launched an investigation, which ran until 1950 when it was shut down, according to 48 Hours.


 Over three years, the LAPD received dozens of clues, leads and false confessions — but ultimately, it all yielded no substantial results.


 As months passed, the investigation continued, and the police ruled out suspects. Still, the media continued to extensively cover the murder with baseless claims.


 In 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss the inability of the LAPD's homicide unit to solve murders, during which Short's death was further investigated. In front of the grand jury,


 Detective Harry Hansen, who was assigned to the case, said in a sworn testimony that he still believed a “medical man” was behind the crime because of how Short's body was severed, per the Los Angeles Times.


 The trial led to further investigative interviews with friends, family and suspects, but there were no additional leads on the case.

 To this day, no one has ever been officially charged for Short's murder.


 Several people remained suspects until their deaths, including nightclub owner Mark Hansen, who knew Short.


 Through the years, people have continued to investigate the case, including Detective Hansen, who searched for Short's killer for 23 years until his retirement.


 ""My only regret is that I never solved the murder of Elizabeth Short,"" he said in 1968, per the United Press International.

 While there are numerous theories about Short's murder, one of the most highly suspected culprits is Dr. George Hodel, a gynecologist who had a clinic in L.A.


 He was known to throw parties for Hollywood's rich and famous and was rumored to be dating Short before her death, per 48 Hours. Hodel was initially labeled a suspect in 1949 after he was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting his teenage daughter.


 Although acquitted, his name was brought forth as a potential suspect in the Black Dahlia case. He was listed as one of the few remaining primary suspects when the case was discussed before a grand jury later that year.


 During that time, authorities wire-tapped Hodel's home and recorded him making jarring statements, seemingly confessing to the 1945 death of his former secretary Ruth Spaulding as well as suspicious comments about Short's murder. (Spaulding died of a drug overdose.)


 “Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead,” Hodel said in the recordings. “Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary.”


 Hodel eventually relocated to the Philippines, living there for the next four decades. Much of the information about his status as a suspect was not publicly known until his son Steve, a former LAPD detective and private investigator, began looking into his father's involvement in the murder.


 When Hodel died in 1999, Steve found a photo in his father's belongings that appeared to be Short. While it has remained unconfirmed whether the photo is actually of Short, it began Steve's inquiry into her murder.


 In his years of research and investigation, Steve has come across other pieces of evidence tying his father to the murder, including “five witnesses in newspapers describing him as [Short's] boyfriend.” He also had formal training as a surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco.


 Additionally, Steve and a handwriting expert discovered eerie similarities between his father's writing and letters sent to the Examiner in 1947. He also found receipts for bags of cement purchased by his father just days before Short's death — the same brand as an empty bag of cement found near her corpse.


 Then, in 2018, Steve told the South Pasadenan that he had uncovered a 70-year-old letter from a former police informant who had written that Short was killed by a man named “GH.”


 Although the LAPD looked into Steve's research, they chose not to pursue his leads. (He believes his father was friendly with officers and they were protecting him.) Still, some officials thought that he may have cracked the case.


 “I told Steve, if his father was still alive, I would have filed murder charges against him,” L.A. Deputy District Attorney Steve Kay told PEOPLE. “His evidence was very persuasive.”


 More recently, new theories have emerged surrounding former pre-med student Marvin Margolis, who lived with Short for 12 days and was questioned by the police following her murder.


 According to the Los Angeles Times, an amateur codebreaker was looking into the Zodiac Killer by using artificial intelligence to generate a list of 71 million possible 13-letter names, after the notorious serial killer sent in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle with the words, ""My name is —"" followed by a 13-character string of letters and symbols.


 The coder then used known details about the Zodiac Killer based on witness descriptions and eventually narrowed it down to one name: Marvin Merrill, which turned out to be the alias Margolis adopted following Short's murder.


 Two veteran homicide detectives who once served at the LAPD, including the former detective who oversaw Short's investigation, say that several clues point to Margolis, who died in 1993, being responsible for Short's death and the five murders attributed to the Zodiac Killer. That said, no investigation or charges have followed.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran's crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after earlier threatening intervention.

After Iran's foreign minister said Iran had “no plan” to hang people, ‍Iranian state media ​on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence.

Rights organization Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution had been postponed, citing his relatives.

In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: “This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!”

Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with colluding against “internal security and propaganda activities against the regime,” the ⁠death penalty does not apply to such charges.

Trump's comments on Wednesday led oil prices to retreat from multi-month highs and gold eased from a record peak on Thursday. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the clerical establishment has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since Dec. 28.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in an interview that Iran has 'no plan' to carry out hangings, when asked about the anti-government protests in the country.

Reuters

People inside the country, reached by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, said the protests appear to have abated since Monday. Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week. 

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday the government was trying to address some of the economic problems that first spurred the protests, saying it ‌intended to tackle issues of corruption and foreign exchange ‍rates and that this would improve purchasing power for poorer people. 

Despite this, Washington tightened pressure on Tehran on Thursday by imposing sanctions on five ‌Iranian officials it accused of being behind the crackdown, and ‍said it was tracking Iranian leaders' funds being wired to banks around the world.

The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security as ‍well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and law enforcement forces commanders.

“U.S. Treasury knows, that like rats on a ‌sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you,” ⁠Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a video. “But there's still time, if you choose to join us. As President Trump has said, stop the violence and stand with the people of Iran.”

Sanctions were also imposed on Fardis Prison, where the U.S. ​State Department said women have “endured cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.”

The Group of Seven countries said it was prepared to impose additional restrictive measures on Iran if it continued to crack down.

Tensions had escalated on Wednesday, with Iran saying it ‌had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in ‍the region in the event of U.S. strikes, and a U.S. official saying the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region.

Trump said he had been told by “very important sources on the other side” that killings in the crackdown were subsiding.

He did not rule out potential U.S. military action but said his administration had received a “very ​good statement” from Iran.

Trump said on Wednesday that he had been told that killings in Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests were subsiding and that he believed there was currently no plan for large-scale executions.

Reuters

Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank, said that while Trump has appeared to back away from action against Iran, he remained unpredictable.

Iran's government is at “a strategic dead end, but I don't think they are at immediate risk of state collapse or regime change,” he added.

In comments to Reuters, Trump expressed uncertainty over whether Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent figure in Iran's fractured opposition, would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.

Trump told Reuters it was possible Iran's government could fall but that in truth “any regime can fail.”

Turkey, one of several states in the region where the U.S. has forces, expressed ​opposition to the use of violence against Iran, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan saying at a press conference in Istanbul that the priority is to avoid destabilization.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday and discussed ways to support security and stability in the region, Saudi state media reported.

The security warning level at ⁠the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar has been lowered after a heightened alert triggered on Wednesday, three sources briefed on the situation told Reuters on Thursday. U.S. aircraft that were moved out of Al Udeid are gradually returning to the base, ‌one of the sources added.

The ​U.S.-based HRANA rights group says it has so far verified the deaths of 2,435 protesters and 153 government-affiliated individuals in the unrest that started with protests over soaring prices before turning into one of the biggest challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The death toll has dwarfed that of previous bouts of unrest crushed by the Iranian authorities, and Iran and its Western foes have both described the unrest as the most violent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iranian authorities said the demonstrations turned from legitimate protest at economic grievances into unrest fomented by its foreign enemies, accusing people it described as terrorists of attacking the security forces and public property.

The ‌intelligence ministry urged people on Thursday to report any suspicious activities, state media reported.

A New York City labor union in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is endorsing Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), who launched his reelection bid for a third term last week.

Teamsters Local 237 released a statement on Thursday backing Goldman over former New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who exhibits more socialist leanings than the progressive incumbent.

“A member of the Labor Caucus and co-founder of the Dads Caucus, Rep. Goldman knows what it takes to fight and win for working families and organized labor,” Teamsters Local 237 President Gregory Floyd said, as first reported by Politico. “He delivered more good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, championed legislation that protects the right to organize, wants to make the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share, and more.”

Goldman is running to hold on to his seat in New York's 10th Congressional District, starting his 2026 reelection campaign with endorsements from Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). Meanwhile, Lander is backed by New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and New York's Working Families Party.

Making the endorsement before his inauguration, the socialist described Lander as a “trusted ally and partner of mine” and argued he will “continue delivering for those who need government to show up for them the most.” The two previously cross-endorsed each other during New York City's ranked choice mayoral primary.

Lander cast himself as someone who doesn't do “AIPAC's bidding,” referring to the pro-Israel lobbying organization that contributed over $190,000 to Goldman's campaign during the 2024 election cycle.

Even though Goldman and Lander are both Jewish, only Goldman has openly criticized Mamdani's rhetoric on Israel.

In terms of labor support, Goldman now has Teamsters Local 237 and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3 in his corner. Historically, he has been supported by many national unions.

So far, Lander secured an endorsement from United Auto Workers Region 9A earlier this month.

“UAW Region 9A is excited to endorse Brad Lander for Congress. We have known and worked with Brad for years and know he walks the walk,” UAW Region 9A Director Brandon Mancilla said. “In every role he's served, he's called out bad bosses, walked picket lines with all our locals, and leveraged the tools of his office to fight for workers. From housing to workers' rights, we know Brad will be a steadfast champion for working people in Congress.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","X stops Grok from making sexualized AI images of real people on the social-media site after global backlash","https://www.businessinsider.com/grok-stops-users-making-sexualized-ai-images-backlash-xai-musk-2026-1","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:48:00 GMT","

Grok will no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on X, after widespread global backlash.

""We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,"" X's safety account said in a blog post on the platform on Wednesday. ""This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.""

The change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor, Rob Bonta, said he launched an investigation into sexualized AI deepfakes, including those of children, generated by Grok.

Bonta said that there had been a flood of reports in the last few weeks that Grok users were taking pictures of women and minors they found online and using the AI model to undress them in images.

""xAI can and should put better safeguards in place to protect children and women from the harms of sexually explicit materials being generated without their consent,"" a representative of the California Attorney General's office said in a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday after Grok's changes.

The representative added: ""While this is an encouraging development, California DOJ is investigating to determine whether xAI violated the law with the conduct that has occurred.""

xAI develops Grok and also owns the social media site X, where the chatbot is integrated to respond to users when tagged.

Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok because of the images, the first countries in the world to ban the AI tool. Lawmakers in the UK publicly considered suspending it, and the country's communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation.

Liz Kendall, the UK's technology secretary, said Thursday that she welcomes the change from X but expects ""the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom's ongoing investigation.""

In Wednesday's blog post, the social media company reiterated that image creation and the ability to edit any type of image via Grok on X will now only be available to paid users as an additional safety measure.

The company restricted non-paying users last week after complaints from officials globally, but it was criticized for being insufficient.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the time that it ""simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.""

Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, said that the UK government wanted ""any excuse for censorship"" in response to a post questioning why AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT were not being looked into.

On Wednesday, a few hours before X's official account posted about the ban on creating sexualized images, Musk asked users to try to get around the AI model's image restrictions.

Grok is also available as a stand-alone web and mobile application. It's unclear if it's still possible for users to make sexualized images on its webpage and app. xAI could not be reached for immediate comment.

X said in its blog post that its safety team was working to add additional safeguards.

""We now geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal,"" X said.

Dipal Dutta, CEO and founder of IT company Redoq UK, told Business Insider that xAI should implement several technical constraints to prevent the creation of non-consensual images ""at the point of origin.""

They include automatically denying user requests containing words on a blocklist, training future versions of Grok on datasets free from explicit content, and using ""secondary AI models"" to detect and block intimate content before it is generated.

Sarah Armstrong-Smith, a UK government cyber advisory board member and a former Microsoft chief security advisor, told Business Insider that Grok reflected a ""growing divide"" among AI companies.

""On one side are organizations prioritizing responsible AI and safety frameworks,"" she said. ""On the other, are organizations positioning themselves as protecting freedom of expression by resisting regulatory control.""

""Perhaps the real opportunity is whether this finally signals the end of unchecked AI experimentation,"" she added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Taiwan will invest $250 billion in U.S. chipmaking under new trade deal","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/us-taiwan-chips-deal-china.html","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:17:50 GMT","



The U.S. and Taiwan have reached a trade agreement to build chips and chip factories on American soil, the Department of Commerce announced on Thursday.

As part of the agreement, Taiwanese chip and technology companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., and the Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit for these companies. 

In exchange, the U.S. will limit reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, down from 20%, and commit to zero reciprocal tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients, aircraft components, and some natural resources.

Taiwan Semiconductor has bought land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan in an interview on Thursday. 

""They just bought hundreds of acres adjacent to their property,"" Lutnick said. ""I'll let them go through with their board and give them time.""

The announcement added that future tariffs under the Section 232 framework will have some exceptions for companies that are building chips in the U.S. Taiwanese companies building new U.S. chip fabs — such as TSMC — will be able to import up to 2.5 times the amount of capacity they are building while the factories are under construction, without paying tariffs under the framework.  

Taiwanese auto parts, lumber, and related products will also avoid tariffs over 15% under Section 232, the announcement said. 

When the factories are completed, companies will be able to import 1.5 times their U.S. production capacity, Commerce said.

The agreement provides clarity to chip companies and technology firms that have grappled with uncertainty over the past year over the Trump administration's approach to tariffs in the semiconductor industry.

It also incentivizes TSMC, the world's leading fab company, to continue to build more factories on U.S. soil, while making it clear that it can continue to build chips for U.S. companies in Taiwan. 

Lutnick said during the interview that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff. He said that the government's objective was to bring 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S.

""That's what they get if they don't build in America, the tariff's likely to be 100%,"" Lutnick said. 

TSMC has already built fabs in Arizona, investing as much as $40 billion to produce chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia, using previous grants of U.S. government money under the CHIPS Act.

The U.S. government has prioritized American production of leading-edge chips as the struggle for access to AI semiconductors has become a key geopolitical matter. 

U.S. officials have also said that there is substantial risk to the U.S. economy if China invades Taiwan and reduces access to TSMC chips. 

""We're going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,"" Lutnick said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Consciousness May Not Be Uniquely Human, New Theories Suggest—Rewriting What We Know About the Mind","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69999529/consciousness-without-cortex-theory/","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:48:00 GMT","

Now, scientists think consciousness might be older and more widespread than previously believed. 

 Here's what you'll learn in this story:

Consciousness has long evaded our understanding. Not only are researchers unable to define what consciousness is—whether it be basic self-awareness or some kind of higher connection with the universe—but they also aren't exactly sure where it comes from. However, some experts believe turning to other conscious beings may be key to understanding our own minds. 

In their respective November 2025 papers, two research groups at the Ruhr University Bochum (RUB) in Germany suggest that looking at other species, particularly birds, could redefine the illusive concept and explain where our own consciousness evolved from. Both articles were published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.

In the first paper, researchers Albert Newen, PhD, and Carlos Montemayor, PhD, argue that across species, consciousness evolved in distinct waves, each serving a particular function. They present three levels of consciousness: basic arousal, general alertness, and self-reflexivity; each level builds upon the last, like levels of a pyramid. These stages challenge previous theories of consciousness, as they provide a new framework that relies less on the cortex, the outermost layer of your brain, which is commonly associated with consciousness theories. Likewise in the second paper, authors Gianmarco Maldarelli, PhD, and Onur Güntürkün, PhD, present evidence that there may be more structures capable of generating consciousness than previously thought. 

🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

In Newen and Montemayor's evolutionary framework, basic arousal developed first. It's like nature's security alarm, warning the body of any dangers that may arise. Hunger, pain, thirst, fear, and pleasure are all sensations that drive this form of consciousness in a way that unconscious reflexes cannot.

Next came general alertness. In this stage of awareness, you can focus on one detail in an ocean of otherwise overwhelming information. This is “what we humans experience as our everyday consciousness, but it is also clearly proven to be realized in many mammals,” including mice, the researchers say in the paper. General alertness allows you to focus on one detail amid a slew of otherwise overwhelming information, giving your brain the tools to judge the outcome of decisions.

For instance, if you're holding a hot plate, you're focused on a piece of information—pain in your hand—but have the capacity to weigh two choices: drop it or burn yourself. For a wild animal, this may look like weighing the risk of running into a predator while collecting food in an open area or going hungry. More simply put, general alertness enables organisms to develop complex associations, helping them better navigate their environment. 

Finally, for humans and some animals, reflexive self-consciousness evolved. This stage “focuses not on perceiving the environment,” but rather on perceiving oneself and the past, Newen says in a press statement. The researchers explain that, at its core, this level of self awareness “makes it possible for us to better integrate into society and coordinate with others.” 

Passing the mirror self-recognition test—a behavioral test where animals are prompted to examine themselves in a mirror—is commonly associated with reflexive self-consciousness. During the test, the subject is marked with paint or a sticker on an area of their body that they normally wouldn't be able to see. When placed in front of the mirror, if the animal touches or examines the foreign mark, it's considered an act of self awareness or self recognition. Human children are able to pass the test at around 18 months old, and animals including chimpanzees, dolphins, and magpies also perform well, meaning linguistic abilities aren't necessary in proving reflexive self-consciousness.

In Maldarelli and Güntürkün's paper, the two researchers argue “that consciousness is not the ultimate triumph of human evolution but rather represents a more basic cognitive process, possibly shared with other animal phyla,” meaning consciousness might be much older and more widespread than researchers previously believed. 

The researchers present growing evidence that various birds display self awareness—or what Newen and Montemayor would likely consider reflexive self-consciousness. The authors list several species who performed well on “ecologically significant” mirror tests unique to their family. For instance, roosters did not warn their own reflections when they saw a bird of prey, meaning that to a certain extent, they recognized their reflection as themselves, not a member of the flock. 

Maldarelli and Güntürkün also present biological evidence that birds could be conscious, showing that avian brains have the hardwiring to generate such processes. For example, the avian forebrain shares many similarities with the mammals. The researchers argue that, structurally, “Birds thus meet many criteria of established theories of consciousness,” Güntürkün says in the press statement.

And even where avian brains do differ from mammalian brains, they are by no means weaker. Maldarelli and Güntürkün argue that the nidopallium caudolaterale—the bird version of a prefrontal cortex—is still “immensely connected,” meaning it's capable of processing information in complex ways. In other words, “bird brain” isn't quite the insult you intend it to be. 

Should their speculation prove true, the implications of Maldarelli and Güntürkün's work deeply complicates our understanding of human consciousness. The paper suggests that consciousness is possible without a mammalian prefrontal cortex—a well-organized brain structure commonly associated with the profound consciousness we humans are capable of. This could mean that other structures are capable of producing similar levels of consciousness or that consciousness originates elsewhere. However, the authors note that no notable conclusions can be drawn yet. 

To Jeff Sebo, PhD—who is unrelated to the recent papers, but has conducted his own work on animal consciousness—studying the consciousness of other species is key to understanding the topic broadly. 

“When we focus only on human minds, it can be difficult to tell which of our features are essential to consciousness and which are merely part of our particular form,” Sebo writes in an email. “By studying consciousness across species, we can better understand our own feelings and emotions, as well as those of other humans who may differ from us.”

Aside from what we might learn about human consciousness, studying animal awareness is also valuable because of the ethical implications it poses, according to Sebo.

“If animals can experience feelings and emotions like pleasure, pain, happiness, suffering, satisfaction, and frustration, then they have the capacity to be harmed, and we have a responsibility to avoid harming them unnecessarily,” he writes. 

For now, the true root of consciousness remains just outside of our understanding—but know that next time a bird perches on your windowsill, it might be thinking the same thing you are.

Thomas Tuchel's England contract expires at the end of this summer's World Cup

England manager Thomas Tuchel says players will need the right ""social skills"" and personality to make his World Cup squad.

Tuchel only has two friendlies in March, against Uruguay and Japan, before naming his squad for the finals - where England will face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in the group stages.

The former Chelsea manager has not been afraid to leave out big names such as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden since replacing Gareth Southgate - and recalled experienced Brentford midfielder Jordan Henderson.

Tuchel says he needs the right balance in his squad - and not necessarily just the best players.

""When I speak to players who have been in World Cups, it has always made the difference when the connection was right, when the communication was right,"" he said.

""When the players had the feeling that the right group is in camp, that they knew their role, why they are in camp, what is expected of them, and they had the feeling that the tournament could even go on for another four weeks and they would be happy to be together, then they were successful.

""It will be very important that we don't select just for talent, but also for what we need from a player.

""What the social skills are of a player, is he a good team-mate? Can he support if his role is maybe the supporting role? So, this is where the focus is.""

England have reached the past two Euros finals and were World Cup semi-finalists under Southgate in 2018.

They face Croatia in Arlington, Texas on 17 June, at the start of what could potentially be a long tournament.

""We will have a lot of players out there who hopefully play until May for international titles, they will play for national titles and we will demand - the World Cup will demand a lot out of them,"" Tuchel said.

""Then we will be hopefully six to eight weeks together if we make it until the very end.

""It will demand a lot of our social skills, how we are together as a group and we need to get the nomination right.

""We need to find the right balance in the team and take it as an opportunity and take it as a dream coming true to be part in a World Cup and to play, hopefully, a major role is nothing else than a dream.""

Arsene Wenger's proposals for football risk doing more harm than good Dan Mullan/Getty Images

He's one of the most respected managers in the history of football, and his unique standing is such that he was appointed as FIFA's first-ever chief of global football development in 2019. So it might seem like a strange question. But does Arsene Wenger actually get football?

Wenger, of course, was once one of football's great revolutionaries. His reforms when manager of Arsenal forced everyone to reconsider their approach to the sport: the physical preparation, the multinationalism of club squads, the idea football should be played as if it were a branch of the arts. He was so transformative because he approached the game in such a grandiose manner.

Advertisement

Johan Cruyff, for example, is often cast as a footballing philosopher, but he also talked about the game in detailed, specific ways. Wenger, by and large, does not.

His long-awaited autobiography in 2020 was a remarkably vague tome, summarising a storied career with such broad brushstrokes that you wondered how much of it he actually remembered.

As a manager, he was obsessive about detail in off-the-pitch matters. He used to time training drills to last precisely 15 minutes, and not a single second more. When Arsenal were building the Emirates Stadium, he specified the shape of the dressing rooms and the steepness of the stands.

But Wenger never talks about on-pitch matters with such regard for detail. Frankly, he doesn't seem to see, or understand, football in a spatial manner.

When managing Arsenal, he never offered precise explanations for why his side won or lost a match. His reasons were always about intangible (if important) qualities. He would talk about sharpness, or confidence, or nervousness, or tiredness. Fine. But he didn't ever seem to consider that his side might have been exposed in one particular zone, or ineffective in one aspect of the game.

He didn't talk about, say, compactness the way Rafael Benitez did, or the transitions in the way Jose Mourinho did, or the half-spaces in the way Pep Guardiola has done. If Wenger arrived in English football today, he wouldn't be a manager at all. That job is now largely about tactical preparation and decision-making. Wenger didn't make many specific plans for individual matches, and didn't make particularly decisive interventions midway through those matches. Today, he would surely be a sporting director.

And, on that basis, Wenger's job at FIFA seemed to suit him.

He can speak about football in a wide sense, and analyses the big-picture things well. If Wenger concludes that — to invent a scenario — an under-21 tournament should actually be reconfigured to an under-23 competition to help younger players progress, he's probably talking sense. But the problem is that, as part of Wenger's role, he's on the panel of the International Football Association Board, which is in charge of the Laws of the Game.

It's logical to have a well-respected former manager on that board, but he might be the worst person for it.

The clearest sign that Wenger doesn't quite get it is in his attempted reform to the offside law. Wenger is, like many, frustrated that attackers can be adjudged offside by VAR when, say, their big toe is poking out ahead of the last outfield defender, and wants to change the rule so that you are onside if any of your body is onside. To a certain extent, it can be seen in relation to the old, unofficial concepts of ‘level' and ‘daylight'.

But there are two issues.

First, Wenger has implied that football would “no longer have decisions that are about millimetres”, which is plainly untrue. Whatever you make the rule, and wherever you draw the offside line, there will always be marginal decisions in relation to it.

The second issue is about how players would adapt.

Attackers could, in theory, make lateral runs in an offside decision, then effectively dip a toe back into an onside position, and be able to run onto any through balls. This would be a very stark revolution in how football is played. The knock-on effect might be defenders feeling unable to keep a high line, and instead dropping back to defend deep. It would transform football into a different sport — maybe better, maybe worse, but are we really going to change the entire shape of the game because of an issue about VAR offsides?

“It would change the offside law so drastically that there would be huge unforeseen consequences,” said Darren Cann, an assistant referee in the 2010 World Cup final, in an interview with The Times this week. “I believe it would mean more VAR decisions, so more delays, and would make it much harder for an assistant referee to judge if a player is offside or not. If I was still an assistant referee, I would have resigned if it had come in.”

Few of Wenger's other plans seem to make sense.

He has suggested players should be able to take free kicks to themselves — replicating a similar change made in field hockey — in an attempt to speed up the game. Again, there are surely various unintended consequences here — players would be able to flick the ball up to themselves and shoot over the wall at a free kick, for example. Again, you can argue this is desirable, but it would fundamentally change the game. And do we really need to speed up football further anyway?

Similarly, Wenger favours kick-ins over throw-ins, although only in a side's own half. But this would make football even more based around set pieces, and allow teams to launch the ball further downfield with their feet than they could with their hands.

Wenger has also suggested legalising corners which bend out of play and then drift in again, which seems like an incredibly niche issue in the first place, and, once again, who benefits from this? Those teams who want to ‘get it in the mixer' and challenge the goalkeeper in the air.

Almost all of Wenger's potential reforms would be bad for sides like the one he created at Arsenal — who, for all their flaws in the latter years, were generally an attractive and entertaining football team.

It's sad to talk about one of football's great statesmen in such a way, but there's a real danger that FIFA's first chief of global football development might be doing more harm than good.
