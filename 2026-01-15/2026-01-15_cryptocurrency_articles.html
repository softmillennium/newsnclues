                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Thursday's announcement, the firm updated that estimate to 140 BTC per month (currently about $13.5 million worth). Mining refers to the act of securing the Bitcoin network by using high-powered computers to crunch calculations, with each block reward winner earning a bounty of 3.125 Bitcoin (about $303,000) plus user fees. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process that's typically operated by large companies or groups with warehouses full of dedicated, specialized computers. In November, NIP Group said it had acquired mining rigs with a combined hash rate of approximately 8.19 EH/s from sellers including Apex Cyber Capital, Prosperity Oak Holdings, and Noveau Jumpstar. In exchange, NIP Group agreed to issue over 314 million Class A ordinary shares. “With 9.66 EH/s now operational and the remainder closing soon, we've built a second growth engine that complements our entertainment portfolio,” he added. “This positions us uniquely at the intersection of digital assets, computing infrastructure, and gaming—with optionality to expand into AI workloads as that market develops.” In November, NIP Group told Decrypt that its primary focus was maximizing Bitcoin holdings and mining hash rate. However, the company said it would sell Bitcoin when market conditions are "appropriate" to cover expansion or operational costs. NIP Group is primarily a digital entertainment company known for esports and gaming ventures, including its competitive esports team Ninjas in Pyjamas, which competes at top levels in games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, League of Legends, and Rocket League.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This strategic shift further cements GeeFi's commitment to accessibility, security, and user empowerment as the next generation of crypto adoption accelerates. This update comes at a vital moment for GeeFi, with Phase 3 of the GEE token presale quickly approaching capacity. Fewer than 3 million tokens remain available at $0.10 each, putting early participants in a favorable position to capitalize before the price advances. The built-in presale feature removes common barriers by eliminating the need to navigate third-party sites, ensuring that both newcomers and crypto-savvy users can acquire tokens with minimal friction. With a planned listing price of $0.40 per token, initial buyers could see an impressive 300% ROI at launch. If industry predictions of a $2 price point materialize, those who secure tokens during this round could expect a remarkable 1,900% potential return. As a non-custodial solution, it provides full ownership and control over private keys, prioritizing user sovereignty. Security is further reinforced with biometric authentication for instant, protected access. Support for more than 14 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Tron means users can manage a diverse portfolio in one place. The wallet also boasts built-in swap and bridge functionality for easy token movement across chains, as well as NFT management and an integrated Web3 browser to explore a wide universe of decentralized apps. The Road Ahead: GeeFi DEX and Crypto Cards The GeeFi DEX will give users access to decentralized trading directly from their wallets, upholding the project's vision of true user autonomy and financial inclusion. Meanwhile, the forthcoming Crypto Cards will bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, enabling users to pay at merchants worldwide by seamlessly converting crypto to fiat at the point of sale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A solo Bitcoin miner beat the odds Thursday, taking home over $300,000 after processing a block on the leading crypto network. This could be a private company or one-man band. Including fees, the lucky miner took home ‎3.157 Bitcoins. Many solo miners, who are up against huge corporate Bitcoin miners, have beaten the odds as of late, with crypto enthusiasts constantly flagging the wins on social media. But while Thursday's miner was listed as “unknown” on Mempool, a website that shows transaction data, it's worth noting that the miner may have invested in a large setup to process the block. Bitcoin miners are typically large operations — warehouses full of expensive computing equipment used to process transactions and mint new digital coins for the leading crypto network's economy. And while most blocks are processed by big companies that run mining pools, occasionally, independent miners can beat the big players. An anonymous miner can plug in and start working to process transactions on the blockchain, and whether or not they are a well-known company, one thing is for sure: They will likely be using a lot of money and resources to do so, as Bitcoin mining has become a tougher industry to make ends meet. Miners are rewarded with a flat fee of 3.125 Bitcoins per block they process, plus any transaction fees paid by those sending the cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin trading down, mining businesses have struggled to turn a profit, and many operations are now diverting resources to power the artificial intelligence and high-powered computing industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technologies, the Ethereum treasury firm chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, unveiled a $200 million investment on Thursday in Beast Industries, a company founded by YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson, recognized worldwide as MrBeast. In a statement, Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said the firm would explore ways to “incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform” moving forward. In October, Beast Financial applied for several U.S. trademarks, indicating that the company would provide crypto exchange, payment processing, banking, and insurance services. Alex Choi, Donaldson's key thumbnail strategist, warned on X in December that social media posts touting “MrBeast coin” were not legitimate. The crypto industry has a lengthy track record of scams, stemming from celebrity endorsements or social media hacks. YouTube Star MrBeast Files Trademark for Crypto Exchange and Payments Service It was unclear how BitMine's investment would dovetail with its business, which includes the creation of a “Made in America Validator Network.” Validators serve an essential function on Ethereum's network by validating blocks of transactions, while also earning rewards. The feature, backed by stablecoin issuer Tether, supports Bitcoin and tokenized gold. He also promoted a gaming league in 2023 that generated controversy over its use of digital assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This site requires JavaScript for certain functions and interactions to work. The document details a range of underlying principles agreed upon by both government and the ICO, as well outlining actions that each will take – individually and jointly. The two parties have committed to “work together to ensure the public can see real benefits in sharing their data and trust that it will be protected” and also to “work collaboratively and transparently, taking a ‘no surprises' approach”. Other clear actions enshrined in the new agreement include the establishment of “a clear process for responding to a personal data breach” – which all civil servants will be asked to follow. Government will also “seek the ICO's expert advice when it has identified that the use of personal data in the delivery of a policy or a system carries a significant risk” and take steps to “ensure that, at all times, there is an accountable and named individual responsible… for managing cross-government data protection risk and compliance” – a responsibility which is currently held by the government chief data officer, Aimee Smith. Other, less measurable commitments include a promise to focus on “prioritising public trust and confidence in the government's handling of personal data” and to help cultivate “a cross-government culture of continuous learning around improving information security”. The commitments will be supported by efforts to “track key indicators that monitor civil service maturity and awareness of information management”. Another pledge contained in the MOU is to “provide regulatory certainty by producing timely and relevant products including guidance, codes of practice, advice notes, opinions and audits that support government and the public sector to use people's data safely”. Other commitments set out in the arrangement include a stipulation that the data regulator will “provide independent and expert advice in response to government raising a substantial risk” and, finally, that it “will recognise that senior responsible officers in DSIT and Cabinet Office are responsible for driving collaboration between departments and… will work with both officers to support that”. Following the publication of the MOU – which was undersigned by security minister Dan Jarvis, digital government minister Ian Murray, and information commissioner John Edwards – the ICO issued a statement claiming that the new arrangement has come in light of “several serious, high-profile data breaches that undermined public trust in government, some of which also placed lives at risk”. This MOU is further strengthened by the leadership of the government chief data officer and expert network of departmental data protection officers who play a vital role in embedding good data practice and culture across government.” In a written ministerial statement on the MoU, Jarvis said: “It is essential that we have strong public trust in the government's protection of sensitive personal information. This Memorandum of Understanding sets out a shared understanding of how government and the ICO will work towards better government data security and use. "The Memorandum of Understanding will help ensure that the measures we have in place to protect sensitive data are robust and support this government's ambition to use new technologies to transform public services, create a modern digital government, and drive economic growth.” Read the most recent articles written by Sam Trendall - Identity crisis?

A documentary on state television highlights how a senior central bank official was bribed with a digital currency

Beijing has revealed how its graft-busters are investigating bribes paid in hard-to-trace cryptocurrencies by tracking the ways in which corrupt officials have been spending the proceeds.

Investigators became suspicious when Yao bought a villa in Beijing for more than 20 million yuan (around US$2.9 million) under the name of a family member.

They later concluded that he had been given 2,000 ether coins by the director of an unnamed digital currency firm he had helped to list on an exchange and had cashed in 370 of these digital tokens for 10 million yuan in 2021 – when the currency's value peaked.

Investigators from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) also found that he had been given a cash bribe of 12 million yuan by an unnamed information services company.

Yao, 56, led the team that developed the digital renminbi and also headed technology supervision at China's securities regulator. The anti-corruption watchdog said he had used his influence within the crypto sector for his own gain.</p>

Meta Racing's mechanics involve a rich strategic layer where players engage in tactical races against four others. Each player prepares and deploys strategies based on the unique conditions of each track, utilizing ability cards to outpace rivals. This complex gameplay emphasizes the importance of asset customization and upgrades, vital for success in global leaderboards and enhancing in-game rewards. This campaign is part of Meta Racing's broader strategy to build its community and player engagement. Slated for an official release in Q1 2026, these efforts are aligned with additional initiatives like collaborations and onboarding guilds or Key Opinion Leaders (KOL). The roadmap suggests further developments including on-chain tournaments, seasonal leaderboards, and a Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled in the subsequent phases with continuous content updates into Q2 2026. As the campaign unfolds, two factors merit close attention. We do not share any kind of investment advice. NFT Games are very risky and come with no guarantees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has reached a new milestone with 30% of circulating tokens staked as analysts expect the second biggest cryptocurrency's price to surge. Bitmine has emerged as a top vote of confidence for the proof-of-stake mechanism by locking up $600 million in Ethereum on Wednesday. To be sure, it is still down 32% from its all-time high of $4,950 set back in August. Meanwhile, other assets like stocks and gold have pushed towards their all-time high in 2026. But despite Ethereum's poor price performance relative to other assets, Wall Street is betting big on the blockchain network. JPMorgan chose it for the first-ever tokenised money market fund, an asset class valued at $9 trillion. Morgan Stanley also filed for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund product earlier this month. British bank Standard Chartered told investors this month it expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin going forward and that the price will hit $40,000 per token by 2030. Chair Tom Lee said on Monday that Bitmine “will be the largest staking provider” in the entire cryptocurrency industry and anticipates over $1 million daily in revenue from staking Ethereum. Lee argues that a stock split will be necessary because Bitmine's share price “follows Ethereum price,” and projects the company's stock trading at $5,000 per share when Ethereum reaches $250,000. Publicly-traded companies perform stock splits to lower the price of a single share. That makes it seem more affordable for regular investors to buy in without changing the company's actual total value. Lee, who is also head of research at Fundstrat, a Wall Street research firm, warned investors against fighting the White House in a video update to the firm's clients. “Washington is picking winners and losers,” Lee said, arguing that this dynamic matters more than macroeconomics or monetary policy. Lee said that losers include traditional credit card companies, the Federal Reserve, and institutional mortgage buyers amid President Donald Trump's push to cap credit card interest rates and political pressure on the Fed. Winners are firms in energy, materials, tech, crypto, industrials, financials, and other companies that benefit economic growth, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its dominance over the altcoins has risen within the same timeframe, as most altcoins have failed to double down on their recent gains. Nevertheless, ETH is still well above $3,350, aiming at $3,400. After last week's price gains that drove BTC from under $90,000 to almost $95,000 within days, the cryptocurrency's run was halted, and it slipped below its starting point. It tried to break out on a couple of occasions. The bears stepped up at this point, driving it to under $94,500, but BTC was quick on the gas pedal. On Wednesday evening, it skyrocketed by several grand again and touched $98,000 for the first time since mid-November. Its market capitalization has risen to $1.940 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has grown to 57.5%. Ethereum has also charted a daily increase, even though it's more modest than BTC's. BNB, TRX, XMR, and BCH are also slightly in the green, while XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and XLM have dropped over the past day. The total crypto market cap has added another $40 billion overnight and is up to $3.370 trillion on CG. Jordan got into crypto in 2016 by trading and investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global markets were steadier on Thursday after a volatile prior session, with investors digesting easing geopolitical tensions, shifting equity leadership in the United States, and a series of policy and regulatory developments spanning currencies, crypto, and technology. Commodity prices pulled back from recent highs, while Asian equities were mixed. Meanwhile, Washington signaled further uncertainty regarding crypto regulation and the Federal Reserve's leadership. Asian markets and global assets react to easing tensions Oil prices retreated from multi-month highs and gold eased from a record peak after US President Donald Trump sought to calm market anxiety over the risk of US military action against Iran. Brent crude futures fell 3.3% to $64.32, while Nymex futures dropped 2.4% to $60.51, after having climbed as high as $66.82 and $62.36, respectively, in the previous session. Gold slipped 0.8% to around $4,585 per ounce, after touching a record $4,642.72 on Wednesday. Equity markets in Asia were mixed, with tech shares facing renewed selling pressure after declines on Wall Street. Taiwan's TAIEX dropped 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.4%, weighed down by technology stocks. Mainland Chinese blue chips were flat, while South Korea's KOSPI added 1% to a record high after the Bank of Korea left interest rates unchanged and signaled an end to its current easing cycle. Currency markets paused after sharp moves in the yen. Recent volatility has been driven by expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament's lower house and call a snap election, a move investors see as potentially leading to larger fiscal stimulus. In Washington, the Senate Banking Committee delayed discussion of a closely watched crypto market-structure bill, hours after Coinbase Global withdrew its support for the latest draft. The market-structure bill aimed at strengthening the legitimacy of digital assets had been scheduled for markup on Thursday, a stage that includes debate and proposed amendments. However, on Wednesday, Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong said on social media platform X that he was withdrawing support for the bill's latest draft, citing “too many issues.” President Trump said he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite a Justice Department probe into the central bank's renovation project. Trump also said he was unfazed by criticism from Republican lawmakers who have raised concerns that the investigation could be seen as an effort to influence interest-rate decisions. Trump reiterated that he intends to nominate Powell's successor within the next few weeks and praised potential candidates Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. Separately, Elon Musk's xAI said it is disabling the ability of its Grok chatbot to create sexualized images of real people following widespread criticism. It added that Grok has been restricted from producing images of real people in bikinis, underwear, or similar attire in jurisdictions where such content is illegal.
