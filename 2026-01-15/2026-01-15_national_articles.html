                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy appeared increasingly smothered Thursday, a week on from authorities shutting the country off from the world and escalating a bloody crackdown that activists say killed at least 2,615 people. President Donald Trump says he's heard from “very important sources” on the other side” that planned executions in Iran were stopped.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy appeared increasingly smothered Thursday, a week after authorities shut the country off from the world and escalated a bloody crackdown that activists say has killed at least 2,637 people. In Iran's capital, Tehran, witnesses said recent mornings showed no new signs of bonfires lit the night before or debris in the streets. The sound of gunfire, which had been intense for several nights, has also faded. Iranian state media has announced wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls “terrorists” while also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, which offer the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. “Since Jan. 8, we saw a full-fledged war, and anybody who was in the gathering since then is a criminal,” said Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi, according to a report Wednesday from the judiciary's Mizan news agency. China's foreign ministry said Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told his Chinese counterpart that the situation in the country was now stable. But as Iran tries to assert control at home, it has signaled worries about threats from abroad, including the United States, which has threatened military action over the killing of peaceful demonstrators. Tensions soared after Trump's comment Tuesday that “help is on its way” to Iranian protesters. The Islamic Republic shut down its airspace for hours early Thursday without explanation, something it has done in previous rounds of attacks between it and Israel, as well as during the 12-day war in June. The U.S. moved some personnel from Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base while warning diplomats in Kuwait to stay away from military bases where American troops are stationed. Britain closed its Tehran embassy and withdrew British staff from Iran. The Israeli military said it had raised the level of readiness for possible missile attacks, though guidelines for Israeli civilians, including the size of gatherings and whether people needed to stay within a certain distance of a shelter, were unchanged. The Iranian airspace closure lasted for over four hours, according to pilot guidance issued by Iran, which lies on a key east-west flight route. International carriers diverted north and south around Iran, but after one extension, the closure appeared to have expired, and several domestic flights were in the air just after 7 a.m. Even before the closure, several international airlines had reduced or suspended services to Iran, “and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said the website SafeAirspace, which provides information on conflict areas and air travel. In 2020, Iranian air defense shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 with two surface-to-air missiles, killing all 176 people on board. Trump made a series of statements that left unclear what action, if any, the U.S. would take. A day after threatening action, he said Wednesday that he had it on good authority that the executions would be halted. On Thursday, he hailed as “good news” reports that a protester's death sentence had been lifted. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that 800 executions had been scheduled to take place. She said the president and his team had communicated to Iranian officials that there would be “grave consequences” if more protesters were killed. Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, urged the U.S. to find a solution through negotiation. Asked by Fox News what he would say to Trump, Araghchi said: “My message is: Between war and diplomacy, diplomacy is a better way, although we don't have any positive experience from the United States. Activists warned that hangings of detainees could come soon, though Araghchi said “there is no plan for hanging.” Among those hit with U.S. sanctions Thursday was the secretary of Iran's Supreme Council for National Security, whom the Treasury Department accuses of being one of the first officials to call for violence against protesters. The Group of Seven, of which the U.S. is a member, also warned they could impose more sanctions if Iran's crackdown continues. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc was looking at strengthening sanctions “to push forward that this regime comes to an end and that there is change.” The U.S.-based agency, founded 20 years ago, has been accurate throughout multiple years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities.</p>

As President Donald Trump turns up the volume on his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark, two new national polls put a spotlight on the fact that most Americans oppose taking over the massive and crucially strategic island that lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would oppose military action to take over Greenland. Military vessel HDMS Ejnar Mikkelsen of the Royal Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN poll conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland. Ninety-four percent of Democrats and eight in 10 Independents said they would oppose such a move, with Republicans split 50%-50%. Meanwhile, by a 55%-37% margin, voters questioned in the Quinnipiac survey said they opposed any U.S. effort to try and buy Greenland. But there's a stark political divide on this question, with the vast majority of Democrats and nearly six in 10 Independents opposed to buying Greenland, and more than two-thirds of Republicans supporting such efforts. And the president emphasized that "anything less" than U.S. control of Greenland is "unacceptable." Trump's push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland is causing tension with Denmark and other NATO allies who insist that the semiautonomous Danish territory should determine its own future. Trump officials are openly considering all options, including military force, to take Greenland, spurring bipartisan opposition from some in Congress. Troops from several European countries deployed to Greenland this week for a brief two-day mission to bolster the territory's defenses. France, Germany, Sweden and Norway are participating in the exercise, Fox News has learned. Leaders say the mission is meant to demonstrate they can deploy military assets "quickly."

Former NSC Senior Director Michael Allen joins 'Fox & Friends' to react to claims from President Donald Trump that violent unrest in Iran is beginning to quell amid mass protests and U.S. military pressure. Pro-regime demonstrators in Iran chanted "death to America" and held signs calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump, images from Iranian state television showed Thursday. Several protesters held photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while some brought makeshift signs featuring photos of Trump after the failed assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania. Multiple of those signs featured Arabic text translating to "This time there will be no error." Another sign showed the same photo with a caption in English, "The arrow doesn't always miss." The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status for Somalia, requiring thousands of Somali migrants—including hundreds in Minnesota—to leave the U.S. by March 17, citing improved conditions in Somalia and national security concerns. Humanitarian groups estimate that Iranian forces have killed over 2,000 protesters, though the true number could be far higher. Iran appeared to reopen its airspace on Thursday after a sudden overnight closure disrupted flights across the region. Empty airspace over Iran is seen in this screengrab from FlightRadar24 on Jan. 15, 2026, amid heightened tensions and concerns about potential military action between the United States and Iran. The overnight closure lasted around five hours after a Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, was issued, according to the aviation risk-monitoring site Safe Airspace. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he was informed the killing of protesters in Iran was "stopping." But, we've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping," he said. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said on Wednesday that nationwide protests continued into the 18th day as authorities maintained a near-total internet shutdown. Cars burn in a street during a protest over the collapse of the currency's value in Tehran, Iran, Jan. 8, 2026. Trump has threatened action against the regime, warning Tehran in multiple Truth Social posts to stop killing its people. Fox News' Ashley Carnahan contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Insurrection Act: President Donald Trump warned he might invoke the centuries-old law to deploy US troops to Minnesota as state and federal officials clash over tactics used by immigration agents. • Another Minneapolis shooting: Law enforcement and demonstrators clashed last night near where a federal agent shot and injured a man after he allegedly assaulted the agent. • High tensions: Minneapolis leaders are asking residents to remain calm following last night's shooting, which happened a week after Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent. The shooting sparked nationwide protests and prompted the Trump administration to send in hundreds more agents as part of its coast-to-coast immigration enforcement crackdown. • Court fights: A judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order after Minnesota and the Twin Cities sued federal officials, claiming the immigration enforcement operation involves warrantless arrests and excessive force. Children boarded school buses at the intersections where citizens clashed with law enforcement less than 12 hours earlier, and much of the debris that littered the street had already been cleaned up, leaving only a few remnants behind. Community members here are eager to protect one another. Senate Majority Leader John Thune downplayed President Donald Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota over ICE protests and said he hoped federal, state and local officials will restore calm soon. So, I mean, we'll see what happens there,” the Republican leader told reporters. He was asked about plans to fund DHS in a yet-to-be passed appropriations bill as some Democrats are demanding language be added to the bill to rein in ICE – something most Republicans oppose. “That will be the hardest one for sure,” he said of the DHS bill, adding that they might need to pass a continuing resolution for DHS that would keep its current spending levels. Congress has a deadline at the end of month to pass the remaining spending bills to avert another government shutdown. “I can tell you that Minnesota is out of control. You have local and state leaders who seem to be encouraging violence,” Johnson told CNN, adding, “The president's frustrated about it, and so are we.” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters today that people “surrounding” someone alleged to have committed a crime may be asked to “validate their identity.” One reporter asked Noem why Americans are “being asked on the street to provide proof of citizenship in Minnesota,” whether it's “targeted enforcement” and if she's “advising Americans to carry proof of citizenship.” “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. Thousands of federal agents are in the Minneapolis area carrying out the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has led to days of tense protests. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told anchors Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room” that it is “unconstitutional” to ask people to show proof of citizenship “without some other basis to make a stop.” “In order to stop somebody, detain them, question them for immigration purposes, an officer has to have reasonable suspicion,” Honig said. The liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school said its research shows that more than 21 million American citizens — over 9% of citizens — “don't have proof of citizenship readily available.” President Donald Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell anti-ICE protests in Minnesota is dangerous and extreme, said Teresa Nelson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota. It's unnecessary, dangerous and wrong,” she told Ana Cabrera on MS Now this morning. “However, the law enforcement, when there are protests, they have a responsibility to facilitate that lawful protest, and what we're seeing time and time again is a quick escalation of violence against indiscriminate violence against everybody,” Nelson said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday that she has discussed the Insurrection Act with President Donald Trump, after he threatened invoking it in Minnesota, but she said the decision on whether to move forward with it rests with him. “I discussed with the President this morning several things that we are dealing with under the department and different operations. “My hope is that this leadership team in Minnesota will start to work with us to get criminals off the streets.” While Noem did not describe the situation in Minneapolis as an “insurrection,” she said, “I describe it as violent and violation of law in many places.” Noem told CNN's Alayna Treene that she didn't specifically recommend the Insurrection Act to Trump, but it was discussed as “one of the options he had constitutionally.” Pressed on whether she believes its necessary in Minnesota, Noem deferred to Trump. “If things don't get better with Governor Walz, I don't anticipate that the streets will get any safer. Governor Walz and his leadership team need to come to us and find out how we can work together like we have in many other states,” Noem said. As for the administration's ICE operations, Noem said that there are “no plans to pull out of Minnesota.” Local leaders have not done enough to protect residents during the federal law enforcement surge in Minneapolis, City Council member Robin Wonsley told CNN's Sara Sidner on Thursday. “Elected officials, like myself, need to be doing everything we can to get ICE out of Minneapolis, ICE out of Minnesota,” Wonsley said. “Residents are demonstrating a huge amount of courage right now, and it's not being matched by our elected officials,” the city council member said, adding that residents should not stop protesting. “If elected leaders are not going to show up in this moment to protect and care for our neighbors — we will.” The incident that led to intense clashes between federal officials and protesters began around 6:50 p.m. local last night when a federal law enforcement officer in Minneapolis tried to conduct a ﻿“targeted traffic stop” of  a Venezuelan national who fled the scene in his car, the Department of Homeland Security said. The man crashed into a parked car and then took off running. Demonstrators began gathering near the scene in the hours after the incident to face off with law enforcement officers who deployed multiple tear gas canisters and what sounded like flash bangs before officials told people to “go home.” Video from a CNN crew at the scene showed two vehicles that appeared ransacked and vandalized, with the words “F*ck ICE” plastered on one, while another had “America land of the obey or die” written on it. US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino was among those spotted at the scene. “For those who have peacefully protested, I applaud you. You are not helping the people who call this place home,” Mayor Jacob Frey said during a news conference late Wednesday night. President Donald Trump warned he might invoke a centuries-old law to deploy US troops to Minnesota as state and federal officials clash over tactics used by immigration agents. Trump previously threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send US troops in response to anti-ICE protests in Portland last fall. Anytime a federal officer or agent fears for their life or the lives of others, they can escalate to the use of deadly force, and discharging their weapon “would be appropriate,” CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow told CNN's John Berman while discussing last night's shooting in Minneapolis. “What we're seeing is intensification, not de-escalation — across the board.” When clashes between the public and federal law enforcement escalate to the level they did in Minneapolis last night, he said, it “transcends away from this peaceful protest narrative or nonviolent direct action into things that law enforcement has to react to maintain civil order.” Law enforcement works best when federal, state, and local entities operate in parallel, Wackrow said. The Minneapolis Police Department embedding with ICE agents would not be an endorsement, but would help ensure greater public safety for everyone, he said. US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino was spotted among other federal agents in Minneapolis, at the scene where a federal agent shot a man who allegedly assaulted him. Video captured by CNN shows a heavy presence of federal agents and local law enforcement at the scene. Bovino arrived after the shooting and can be seen walking among other officers without a face mask, wearing a green coat and black shoes. He walked with the group into a taped-off area. Clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement erupted Wednesday night after the shooting of a man who allegedly assaulted a federal officer. Flash bangs and gas canisters were deployed as tensions rose. Here's a glimpse at what it looked like in Minneapolis last night: Spray paint covers the sides of two vehicles, with phrases reading “F**k ICE” and “America land of the obey or die.” It is not immediately clear who owns the vehicles. CNN has reached out to both the FBI and DHS for more information. A judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order after Minnesota and the Twin Cities sued federal officials, claiming their immigration enforcement operation involves warrantless arrests and excessive force.</p>

The U.S. military has seized another fugitive oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the Caribbean, U.S. Southern Command announced Thursday. The U.S. military has seized another fugitive oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the Caribbean, U.S. Southern Command announced Thursday. The U.S. has now seized six oil tankers since ramping up a campaign against illicit oil trade by Venezuela. "In another pre-dawn action, Marines and Sailors from Joint Task Force Southern Spear, in support of the Department of Homeland Security, launched from USS Gerald R. Ford and apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica without incident. "These operations are backed by the full power of the U.S. Navy's Amphibious Ready Group, including the ready and lethal platforms of USS Iwo Jima, USS San Antonio, and USS Fort Lauderdale. The U.S. military has seized another fugitive oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the Caribbean, U.S. Southern Command announced Thursday. The operation comes as President Donald Trump is set to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House on Thursday. The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a "shadow fleet" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela. Trump has said the U.S. will "run" Venezuela after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. U.S. forces have seized six oil tankers in recent weeks. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that was published Wednesday that "only time will tell" how long the U.S. will be running the country, but said it would be "much longer" than a year. Additionally, Trump announced recently that Venezuela would hand over up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S. and that the oil would be sold "immediately." "We will rebuild it in a very profitable way," Trump told the Times. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need." President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will temporarily "run" Venezuela. Likewise, Trump shared a doctored image that looked like a Wikipedia page that identified him as "Acting President of Venezuela" since January 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says President Donald Trump has the “most unhinged eating habits” out of all the Cabinet members, revealing his diet often consists of candy, Diet Coke, and McDonald's. “I don't know how he's alive, but he is,” the 71-year-old secretary told former Trump aide Katie Miller in a new episode of her podcast released on Tuesday. Kennedy went on to reveal that Trump only eats “junk food” while traveling and that “he wants to eat food from big corporations,” such as McDonald's, “because he trusts it” and “doesn't want to get sick when he's on the road.” But whenever he's at his Mar-a-Lago resort or the White House, Trump tends to eat “really good food” made by his chefs, according to Kennedy. Additionally, Trump once offered McDonald's on his private plane in November 2024 after winning the presidential election. “If you travel with him, you get this idea that he's just pumping himself full of poison all day long and you don't know how he's walking around, much less being the most energetic person any of us have ever met,” Kennedy said of Trump. “I think he actually does eat pretty good food usually.” Trump's health has been called into question by the New York Times and other news outlets after he underwent numerous health assessments during his first year back in office. The 79-year-old president took an annual physical last April, followed by a routine yearly checkup and multiple cognitive tests several months later. Without addressing those health assessments specifically, Kennedy said Trump has “got incredible health” for someone of his age — and revealed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz concurs based on his own assessment. Oz looked at his medical records and said he's got the highest testosterone level that he's ever seen for an individual over 70 years old,” Kennedy added, drawing laughter from the podcast host.</p>

Anti-Iranian regime protesters in Los Angeles swarmed a U-Haul truck that drove through the gathering on Sunday, smashing its windshield and attacking the suspect with flag poles until police arrived. The driver of a U-Haul truck that drove through protesters demonstrating against the Iranian regime in Los Angeles on Sunday claims that police waved him onto the street full of protesters, and that he had never meant to hurt anyone. Calor Madanescht, 48, was taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department on suspicion of reckless driving following the incident. "I had no intention to hit anybody," Madanescht told FOX11 Los Angeles. Madanescht said an LAPD officer waved him onto the avenue, where he intended to join the protest. However, he claims a pro-Shah group began to attack him. Calor Madanescht, 48, said that he did not mean to hit anybody as he drove the U-Haul truck. He claims he was attacked by a pro-Shah group, which prompted him to drive through the crowd. "I was really afraid for my life," he said, adding that some protesters helped clear a path so he could drive away. "They were telling me, ‘Go, go,' and they opened the path, as you see in the video." Video online appears to show the U-Haul truck moving quickly through a dense crowd as people screamed along Veteran Avenue near the Federal Building in the Westwood neighborhood. "All I want is peace and human rights for everyone in Iran and for minorities," Madanescht said. Madanescht said that once he pulled over, other demonstrators began to attack him. He showed the outlet a bandaged hand, a cut on his ear, bruises and black eyes. Madanescht shows a bandaged hand, claiming he suffered injuries during the attack. Others stuck flagpoles through an open passenger-side window, appearing to jab the suspect. Anti-Iranian regime protesters in Los Angeles swarmed a U-Haul truck that drove through the gathering on Sunday, smashing its windshield and attacking the suspect with flag poles until police arrived to take the man into custody. During Madanescht's interview with the outlet, two men who were at the protest gave their accounts of what happened. "They broke the window, kicked the truck, assaulted him, and he has a right to free speech." Police said the adult male driver has been detained pending further investigation. His identity has yet to be released. The other man questioned Madanescht's claim that LAPD had waved him onto a street that was occupied by demonstrators. But Madanescht maintained that his intentions for being at the protest were only peaceful. "The reality is I peacefully came, cooperated with LAPD, and I'm deeply grateful for them," he said. The protest comes amid ongoing unrest in Iran, where demonstrations that began over economic grievances have spread nationwide, evolving into a direct challenge to Iran's clerical leadership. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said at least 18,470 people have been arrested and confirmed the deaths of 2,615 individuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter after signing a bill that returns whole milk to school cafeterias across the country, in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Washington. Donald Trump is determined to maintain Republicans' threadbare House majority this fall and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when Democrats won control of the chamber in midterm elections and went on to impeach him twice. This time, Trump is involved in candidate recruiting, dispensing strategic advice and promising he will not let history repeat. But a number of moving pieces and unanswered questions remain. Democrats, buoyed by the results of several 2025 elections, are more than eager for the president to be the GOP front man, though they also must improve their stock with voters and attract growing numbers of independents. Ongoing redistricting battles, spurred on by Trump, could affect the eventual outcome. As Trump tries not to repeat 2018, he also is fighting midterm trends that have gone against a president's party for generations. Here are some key questions and data to explain the fight ahead. “It's an amazing phenomenon,” Trump acknowledged at a recent House Republican retreat. Regardless, since 1932, the sitting president's party has lost an average of 26 House seats, and only three times has the president's party gained seats. Another dynamic may be a factor this year: Dozens of House members have announced they are not running for reelection, putting a record number of seats up for grabs at this point in the midterm election cycle. Democrats romped in November, winning elections across the country. In House special elections last year, Democrats outperformed their 2024 presidential election results, often by double digits. Off-year elections are not perfect predictors of midterm results. But it is notable that Democrats saw the same trends in 2017 before their 2018 midterm victories during Trump's first term. Trump and House Republicans are going all-in together, regardless of his job approval ratings. Georgia Rep. Brian Jack, the Republicans' chief candidate recruiter, said many GOP recruits got into their races because they are “very inspired by President Trump” and that voters will see nominees “talking about the president's successes.” Jack said Republicans cannot afford to distance themselves from the president. Yet Trump's approval was just 40% in January, according to recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, a number that has remained consistently low throughout his second term. That could make it harder to excite core Republicans and reach independents at the same time. Past presidents' approval rating in the lead-up to midterms has largely correlated with their party's performance, according to Gallup polling. He rebounded substantially four years later when House Democrats gained seats. Another dynamic that could be good news for Democrats this fall: A new Gallup survey found that 45% of U.S. adults now identify as independents. Pocketbook issues promise to be at the forefront of this fall's campaigns. In a December AP-NORC poll that asked adults an open-ended question about what issues they want the government to focus on this year, 4 in 10 people mentioned health care costs. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults wanted the federal government to focus on housing costs. Democrats are hammering affordability on everything from groceries to health care. Trump has referred to the affordability “hoax” but also nodded to political and economic realities: He has urged Republicans to reach a deal on health insurance premium subsidies and he is promising populist action on housing costs. Trump wants Republicans to sell the sweeping domestic policy law passed last summer as a tax cut for working-class voters. Democrats note that tax advantages in the law, which passed with only GOP support, are tilted to wealthier Americans while the law cuts health care and other programs. Despite national narratives, Republicans and Democrats insist candidates still matter, especially in swing districts. “It's really district-by-district,” said Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood, a chief candidate recruiter for Democrats. “It's not just going to be a narrative of ‘the suburbs reject Trump' or something like that.” If voters' broad opinions shift back in Trump's favor on the economy, for example, Republicans stand to do better. That's why Democrats were especially sorry to see Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate who represents most of small-town and rural Maine, forgo reelection, while Republicans expect to nominate former two-term Gov. Golden represents one of 13 Democratic-held districts that Trump won in 2024. Democrats are excited about candidates such as Elaine Luria, a military veteran and former congresswoman. But Trump pushed GOP-led states to draw new maps that would increase the number of congressional districts where Republicans have an advantage. Altogether, Republicans appear to have increased their odds by a handful of districts. If the Supreme Court guts a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, some states controlled by Republicans could theoretically move quickly to eliminate Democratic advantages in districts where nonwhite voters have sway. The final version could help Republicans keep a majority. Or Republicans could succeed in increasing the number of GOP-friendly districts yet still lose House control because voter discontent flips enough districts anyway. In that case, the gerrymandering would simply mean a smaller new majority for Democrats. AP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early on in her tenure as President Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi scrapped a Biden-era policy that banned the Justice Department from pursuing reporters' phone records and notes while investigating leakers. The message was unmistakable: Trump-era investigators would welcome a confrontation. This week, the Justice Department took the extraordinary step of obtaining a search warrant for Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson's home. Reporters called the search “incredibly disturbing” and unprecedented. Natanson met with Post lawyers and security experts, scrambled to line up her own outside legal counsel, and urged her colleagues to keep reporting. But now that the line has been crossed, some journalists and media lawyers expect it will happen again. Trump allies at the Justice Department have been “itching to do this,” a law enforcement reporter told CNN. Bondi's revised policy, which went into effect last May, weakened her predecessor Merrick Garland's protections for the press and reflected Trump's personal frustration with leaks. On Wednesday night, Bondi alleged on Fox News that Natanson's devices “contain classified material regarding our foreign adversaries, and that's what we're looking into now.” Courts have repeatedly upheld the rights of journalists to obtain and report on leaked documents, even highly classified ones. But “in modern times, everything about the Espionage Act when it comes to treatment of the press has been based on norms and policy, not law,” national security attorney Mark Zaid told CNN. Since the Trump administration has “discarded policy norms previously set in place by prior administrations,” he said, “there is every reason to believe that what was just experienced by a Washington Post reporter was just the tip of the iceberg of things to come.” Natanson was one of six Post reporters who published an exclusive story last week about Venezuela, citing secret government documents obtained by the Post. Natanson also reported extensively on Trump's overhaul of the federal government, drawing on tips from sources inside federal agencies. She encouraged people to message her on Signal, the encrypted messaging app. Under more ordinary circumstances, federal investigators investigating a leak of government secrets might seek a subpoena for reporters' records. Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aggressively pursued leakers and, at times, journalists, secretly seizing phone records from Associated Press reporters and labeling Fox News correspondent James Rosen a potential “co-conspirator” in a leak case. The backlash later led Obama attorney general Eric Holder to tighten Justice Department protections for reporters. Then, during Trump's first term, prosecutors covertly pursued internal communications from several major news outlets, including CNN, while hunting for sources. Xochitl Hinojosa, who ran the Justice Department's public affairs department back then, wrote on X, “I, personally, had to sign off on any investigative step involving a reporter when I was at DOJ. But there were very strict guidelines: we would not subpoena reporters for their sources. Hinojosa, who is now a CNN political commentator, also wrote that the search of Natanson's home was “a clear effort to intimidate reporters.” Bondi cast it as a necessary step to protect classified information. Bondi wrote in a memo that “investigative techniques relating to newsgathering are an extraordinary measure to be deployed as a last resort when essential to a successful investigation or prosecution.” On Wednesday, Post colleagues gathered around Natanson's desk in the Washington newsroom, expressing support for her and asking what they could do to help. Natanson exhorted her colleagues to get back to work, especially because she can't right now — her devices are in the government's hands. “The best thing you can for me,” she told a group of colleagues, is “keep reporting.” Murray echoed that sentiment during Thursday morning's editorial meeting. The Post editorial board has also weighed in, observing that “leaks frustrate every president, but efforts to intimidate or neutralize reporters always fail in the end.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak at a news conference at the Embassy of Denmark, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Washington.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak at a news conference at the Embassy of Denmark, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Washington. At the same time, Denmark and several European allies are sending troops to Greenland in a pointed signal of intent to boost the vast Arctic island's security. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said after a meeting in Washington on Wednesday with his Greenlandic counterpart, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that a “fundamental disagreement” remained. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak at a news conference at the Embassy of Denmark, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Washington. Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. agreed to form a high-level working group “to explore if we can find a common way forward,” Løkke Rasmussen said. Danish and Greenlandic officials didn't specify who would be part of the group or give other details. Løkke Rasmussen said the group should focus on how to address U.S. security concerns while respecting Denmark's “red lines.” The two countries are NATO allies. He wouldn't elaborate on what a compromise might look like, and expectations are low. As Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen put it Thursday, having the group is better than having no working group and “it's a step in the right direction.” It will at least allow the two sides to talk with each other rather than about each other. Trump has argued repeatedly that the U.S. needs control of Greenland for its national security. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. An Airbus A400M transport aircraft of the German Air Force taxis over the grounds at Wunstorf Air Base in the Hanover region, Germany, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026 as troops from NATO countries, including France and Germany, are arriving in Greenland to boost security. Just as the talks were taking place in Washington on Wednesday, the Danish Defense Ministry announced that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland, along with NATO allies. France, Germany, Norway and Sweden announced that they were each sending very small numbers of troops in a symbolic but pointed move signaling solidarity with Copenhagen. The U.K. said one British officer was part of what it called a reconnaissance group for an Arctic endurance exercise. The German Defense Ministry, which dispatched 13 troops, said the aim is to sound out “possibilities to ensure security with a view to Russian and Chinese threats in the Arctic.” It said it was sending them on a joint flight from Denmark as “a strong signal of our unity.” Poulsen said that “the Danish Armed Forces, together with a number of Arctic and European allies, will explore in the coming weeks how an increased presence and exercise activity in the Arctic can be implemented in practice,” he said. The deployment “serves both to send a political signal and military signal to America, but also indeed to recognize that Arctic security should be reinforced more,” said Maria Martisiute, an analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak at a news conference at the Embassy of Denmark, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Washington. Poulsen has said he and Greenland's foreign minister plan to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Monday to discuss security in and around the Arctic. NATO has been studying ways to bolster security in the Arctic region.</p>

A tent camp for displaced Palestinians stretches across Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. A tent camp for displaced Palestinians stretches across Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cast the U.S. announcement that the fragile ceasefire in Gaza would advance to its second phase as largely symbolic, raising questions about how its more challenging elements will be carried out. Israeli police officer Ran Gvili's parents had earlier pressed Netanyahu not to advance the ceasefire until their son's remains were returned, which Israel's Hostage and Missing Families Forum said Wednesday. Netanyahu told Gvili's parents that his return remained a top priority. Questions also include the timing of deployment of international forces and the reopening of Gaza's southern Rafah border crossing, as well as concrete details about disarming Hamas and rebuilding Gaza. In an interview on Wednesday with the West Bank-based Radio Basma, Ali Shaath, the engineer and former Palestinian Authority official slated to head the committee, said he anticipated reconstruction and recovery to take roughly three years. He said it would start with immediate needs like shelter. “If I bring bulldozers, and push the rubble into the sea, and make new islands (in the sea), new land, it is a win for Gaza and (we) get rid of the rubble,” Shaath, a Gaza native, said. Palestinians in Gaza who spoke to The Associated Press questioned what moving into phase two would actually change on the ground, pointing to ongoing bloodshed and challenges securing basic necessities. More than 450 people have been killed since Israel and Hamas agreed to halt fighting in October, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Thursday. Those casualties, which UNICEF said include more than 100 children, are among the 71,441 Palestinians killed since the start of Israel's offensive, according to the ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians. Every day there is suffering in the tents, in the rain and the sun, from sun to rain to death,” said Samed Abu Rawagh, a man displaced to southern Gaza from Jabaliya. Hamza Abu Shahab, a man from eastern Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said he was waiting for tangible changes, such as easier access to food, fuel and medical care, rather than promises. “We were happy with this news, but we ask God that it is not just empty words,” he told the AP in Khan Younis. “We need this news to be real, because in the second phase we will be able to return to our homes and our areas … God willing, it won't just be empty promises.” Gaza's population of more than 2 million people has struggled to keep cold weather and storms at bay while facing shortages of humanitarian aid and a lack of more substantial temporary housing, which is badly needed during the winter months. The United Nations has estimated reconstruction will cost over $50 billion. This process is expected to take years and little money has been pledged so far. Hamas has said it will dissolve its existing government to make way for the committee announced as part of the ceasefire's second phase. But it has not made clear what will happen to its military arm or the scores of Hamas-affiliated civil servants and the civilian police. Israel has insisted Hamas must lay down its weapons, while the groups' leaders have rejected calls to surrender despite two years of war, saying Palestinians have “the right to resist.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump threatened to invoke a law allowing him to send the military or federalized National Guard troops into Minnesota on Thursday, arguing that “insurrectionists” are causing chaos in the streets. The word “insurrection” isn't defined in the act but is typically understood as an act of revolting against civil authority or government, according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. It's been used previously by presidents to quell labor disputes and rebellions in the early days of America. Protests in Minneapolis have been ongoing since an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a Minnesota woman accused of trying to kill federal officers. On Wednesday evening and overnight, demonstrators responded to a second shooting in the city, in which the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said a federal officer shot an illegal immigrant in the leg after being attacked by multiple suspects with a snow shovel and broomstick. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said some protesters were throwing fireworks and rocks at federal agents. He characterized it as an “unlawful assembly,” as law enforcement used tear gas and flash bangs on rioters launching fireworks and snowballs at officers. Officials said 600 Minneapolis Police Department officers are working to “keep our streets safe. Both sides continue to blame the other for escalating tensions. The Trump administration has vigorously defended all ICE tactics as justified amid sweeping questions about how federal agents handled the incident leading up to Good's death. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche suggested late Wednesday evening that an “insurrection” is occurring in the state, and accused Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging violence.” ICE agents are merely trying to protect citizens from “criminal aliens,” he said. He suggested Democrats in the state are using “anarchists and professional agitators” to prevent ICE agents from trying to detain thousands of rapists and other criminals. But, like Frey, while he has urged them to remain “peaceful,” the governor's rhetoric has also been heated, accusing ICE on Wednesday evening of conducting “a campaign of organized brutality” and “kidnapping innocent people with no warning.” Walz is urging protesters to make their way to ICE operation scenes and record their actions to create a “database of the atrocities against Minnesotans.” “They're breaking windows, dragging pregnant women down the street, just plain grabbing Minnesotans and shoving them into unmarked vans,” he alleged. “What we need most of all right now is a pause. “The situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable,” Frey said. The president, during an interview on Wednesday, continued to stand by the ICE officer who shot Good dead, while sending a message “of love” to her father-in-law. “I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person, but her actions were pretty tough.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA astronauts landed safely back on Earth after a medical emergency forced them to head back early during a mission at the International Space Station. NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke landed off the coast of San Diego at 3:41 a.m., alongside Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. “On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew-11,” mission controllers told the four-member crew of the SpaceX Dragon capsule as it splashed down. George Alderman, NASA's deputy press secretary, said in a press conference after the landing that the four were in “good spirits,” and that the “crew member of concern is doing fine.” “The crew spent more than 850 hours on scientific studies, including research about loss in microgravity and the long-term storage of cryogenic fluids in space with direct applications in medical and industrial fields. This work advanced our understanding of long-duration space flight and contributed valuable research that benefits life here on Earth and further human exploration,” he added. “To be overwhelmingly clear, crew 11 was a very successful mission,” Alderman continued, arguing that the emergency landing showcased NASA's readiness for all contingencies. Fundamentally, it's why we're in space to learn. It's why NASA prepares for the unexpected, so we are ready to respond decisively and safely,” he said. NASA maintained its secrecy regarding who had the medical emergency and what the medical emergency was, citing privacy concerns.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Why Catholics could be the key to Trump's opposition. From the deployment of masked paramilitary thugs to enforce immigration policy to the full-throated assault on transgender Americans to an unrelenting campaign against the rights of women and girls, reactionary Christianity is riding high. This agenda pursued by the administration has been made possible through 50 years of campaigning by the religious right, a coalition of white evangelical Protestants, conservative Catholics, and conservative Eastern Orthodox Christians and Jews that formed the core of the late 20th- and early 21st-century Republican Party. But in this season of their triumph, a genuine faith-based opposition is finally beginning to break through. The evidence of religious resistance first emerged on Inauguration Day. … In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. These words, a public reminder that there is diversity within the Christian tradition with respect to political opinion, were only the beginning. There appeared to be some coalition-building when a dozen or so religious organizations sued the administration over new policies that gave immigration officials more latitude in making arrests in and around houses of worship. These are also denominations that have been in demographic decline for decades, and only 11 percent of the American public identifies with the mainline Protestant traditions. This is hardly encouraging for the possibility of a mainstream political movement or resistance. Enter American Catholicism, a group that may redefine the role religion has played in politics and public life. The political power of the religious right depended in large part on religious conservatives agreeing to adopt the GOP's positions on issues such as labor rights, immigration, environmental regulation, and even taxes. In exchange, the Republican Party embraced their reactionary consensus on certain social issues, largely related to gender and sexuality. These groups were, by a large margin, Catholic. Upon their arrival, these immigrants had not been considered “white.” After growing up largely in ethnic neighborhoods in northern cities like New York and Chicago, the children of these early 20th-century immigrants found economic prosperity in the post-World War II boom and through government programs such as the GI Bill. For example, in the battles over school busing, white evangelicals — and the national media — publicly framed Catholics as fellow defenders of white neighborhood schools, treating them not as foreign outsiders but as part of a unified white Christian community. These founding foot soldiers of the religious right sought to slow social progress and turn back the clock on integration, and they were willing to trade away the economic policies that had brought them affluence. The shared concern of evangelicals and Catholic “ethnics,” once very antagonistic American groups, was what we now euphemistically call “cultural anxiety,” a reaction to a rapidly changing and racially integrating society. Anyone surprised that the children of not-quite-white immigrants would join with white Southerners against Black progress must remember that racial tensions between newly arrived immigrants and Black Americans in northern cities were among the most intense conflicts in early 20th century America. These founding foot soldiers of the religious right sought to slow social progress and turn back the clock on integration, and they were willing to trade away the economic policies that had brought them affluence. For a Republican Party that had long been shunned by these voters, the chance to win them was worth abandoning its once-enlightened, patrician stance on matters of personal conduct. The party that had once championed women's suffrage and abolition, and tolerated reproductive rights, turned its back on all of that for this new base. It should go without saying that Christians are incredibly politically diverse. After all, there are over 2 billion Christians in the world, roughly a third of all human beings and 62 percent of Americans. If Christians all agreed on every public matter, politics as a competition of ideas would simply cease to exist in a number of countries. In a strange way, conservative Catholics, through their alliance with evangelicals, ended up with more influence over public perception of Catholic teaching than the pope himself. For Catholics, even the ones who eventually embraced it, the bargain was far messier, more conflicted, and never fully secure. While the politics of evangelical Christians is by nature fluid and divided, Catholicism inherently demands greater ethical uniformity. And during the period in which the religious right was taking shape, Catholic social teaching was evolving in a direction that made this alliance particularly fraught. As the decades wore on, the Vatican's teachings on social and economic justice were increasingly out of step with the GOP platform on almost every issue except abortion and marriage for same-sex couples. The very people who demanded that Catholic, pro-abortion rights politicians such as Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi be denied communion often ignored Church teaching on the death penalty, the treatment of poor people, and immigration. It also reflects the different demographics of their communities. Roman Catholicism in America is far more racially and ethnically diverse than evangelical Christianity, which might be why the strident xenophobia of some white evangelicals is harder for American Catholics to embrace. The simple fact is that changing demographics mean Catholics are being disproportionately affected by Trump's draconian policies. As a whole, Catholicism is increasingly concentrated in the Global South, with 72 percent of the world's Catholics living in Latin America, Asia, or Africa. In the United States, it is increasingly a religion of new arrivals. A hundred years ago, immigrants to America came mostly from southern and eastern Europe, but that is no longer so. These trends mean that, today, there are over 53 million adult Catholics in the United States, or approximately 20 percent of all Americans. These Catholics, who are the present and future of the Catholic Church, are more likely to be someone, or know someone in their faith community, who is adversely affected by the MAGA paradigm. Plus, today's American Catholics are more likely to feel solidarity with those in the Global South, because they are more likely to have familial ties there. The simple fact is that changing demographics mean Catholics are being disproportionately affected by Trump's draconian policies. Support and even silence are no longer a tenable position for the Catholic hierarchy and for an increasing number of Catholics, no matter how politically conservative they may be. Will they be loyal to their fellow Catholics or will they be auxiliary members of the new MAGA faith? Given the obvious historical parallel, one might think that a continuation of the alliance would allow newly arrived Latin American and Asian Catholics to benefit from the same deal that Italian and Polish Americans enjoyed. But today's Catholics are not being made such an offer by politically ambitious evangelicals, who are much more concerned with immigration as an absolute evil than their forebearers were. Instead, anti-immigrant rhetoric occupies a more prominent place in America's nationalist discourse than at any time since the 1920s. All this makes Catholicism a wild card in the shifting landscape of American alliances. If this happens at the same time that enough conservative Catholics conclude that the compromises demanded by MAGA — especially on issues like immigration — are simply too much to accept, then American Catholicism may present a very different public face. We may already be seeing the early outlines of such a transformation. Perhaps never before has a Pope challenged a US president as directly as Pope Leo XIV has Donald Trump. “… And I think that there's a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what's happening.“ These remarks are part of escalating criticism from the pope, which has strongly condemned the ”vilification” of immigrants, a not-so-subtle nod to the terror unfolding on the streets of many American cities Pham will head the Diocese of San Diego, which has been among those worst affected by Trump's war on immigrants. The new bishop, Ronald A. Hicks, is in many ways Dolan's opposite and is widely known as a defender of immigrant communities. This shift has broken part of the religious right's spell. The idea that holding certain GOP- or MAGA-approved political views is synonymous with taking the “Christian” position is no longer tenable. The rhetoric once used to shame pro-abortion rights Catholics like Biden and Pelosi can now be applied equally to anti-immigrant Catholics such as Vice President JD Vance and Steve Bannon. After all, the pope has declared that support for immigrants and opposition to the death penalty are essential parts of a truly “pro-life” ethic. Vance, American Catholicism's most high-profile convert — who like many converts has a much more conservative political and theological outlook than many cradle Catholics — has tried to brush aside papal criticism. As in the movement's original formation, any new coalition will require compromise, perhaps especially on issues related to gender and sexuality. But hurdles do not put such a deal off the table. The Catholic Church, internationally, is undeniably moving more toward the American mainline Protestant position on such issues and away from an increasingly hardline American evangelical perspective. And American Catholics have always had more diverse political views on these issues than their evangelical counterparts. The religious right has defined American Christianity for half a century, reshaping politics, theology, and culture in its own image. But as Trump's second administration pushes the coalition into increasingly extreme territory, new cracks are appearing. Mainline Protestants, though diminished, are asserting themselves, and Catholics are showing signs of resistance, a resistance that might even lead them into a new coalition. A new faith-based opposition is still fragile, but if it can form, it could redefine both American Christianity and American politics. Yes, there is a downside to GLP-1 drugs — if you aren't careful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As it finds itself in the most uncertain position in its modern history, Venezuela's destiny may well be decided by the maneuvering of two powerful women. After former Venezuelan ruler Nicolas Maduro was snatched from Caracas in the dead of night by U.S. Army Delta Force commandos, most observers were certain the U.S. would push for Maria Corina Machado, Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader, as the next president of Venezuela. Trump's choice reflected Washington's newfound realpolitik approach to geopolitics, but also a long-running behind-the-scenes effort from the two to win the president's favor. Machado was born into an elite family and began her career studying to be an industrial engineer, then got a master's degree in finance. Her passion quickly turned to politics after the socialist Hugo Chavez took power, however, spurring a rivalry that would come to define her political life. She defined herself as the co-founder of Súmate, a political group that dedicated itself to promoting a referendum to remove Chavez from power in 2004. Another prominent theme of Machado's political life began just as early — appeals for U.S. and world support to help oust Chavez. She slowly rose through the ranks after first running for president in 2012. She would form an even more prevalent rivalry with Chavez's successor, Maduro. She was accused of trying to assassinate the president, charges she denied, which caused her to lie low for much of the next decade, allowing the less politically savvy Juan Guaido to position himself as the head of Venezuela's opposition, an adventure that ended in failure when he overestimated his own position. Maduro's government banned her from running on spurious grounds, triggering widespread outrage. Machado gambled on throwing her full support behind Trump, even going so far as to avoid harming his ego by dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to him. Some uncorroborated reports suggested that Trump passed over Machado after capturing Maduro over his jealousy regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, but further reporting has revealed missteps that cost the opposition leader dearly. Machado fumbled several planned meetings with Trump officials, failing to deliver a list of political prisoners, declining to meet in person with Trump's special envoy Richard Grenell, and drawing frustration after failing to concretely lay out how a democratic government could take power in Venezuela, the New York Times reported. Machado's allies insisted to the Financial Times that she isn't dejected and still has hope of taking power. She's been broadly described as a Christian liberal democrat, stressing free market capitalism, individualism, transparent elections, and liberalism. She's long been heavily pro-U.S., and if installed, would likely sign even more favorable agreements with the U.S. She's even gone so far as to plead for direct U.S. military intervention multiple times throughout her political career, going as far back as 2014. Machado is now banking everything on charming Trump at a Thursday White House meeting. After showing U.S. dominance over Venezuela with Operation Absolute Resolve, Trump's decision regarding the country is likely to prove decisive if she ever wants to take power. Aside from being strong-willed and a politician, Rodriguez holds almost nothing in common with Machado. While Machado hails from an elite business family, Rodriguez was born the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla leader who was arrested over his involvement in the kidnapping of an American businessman. “The revolution is our revenge for the death of our father,” Rodriguez said in a past interview, referring to Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution. Her brother also shared the family's leftist views — Jorge Rodriguez would also enter politics and serve as one of the most influential Chavista politicians. She first entered politics in 2002 during the military coup attempt against Chavez, rallying support for Chavez from abroad, going so far as to symbolically take over the Venezuelan embassy in London with her mother. She implemented pragmatic economic reforms as minister of economy, finance, and foreign trade, including reductions in price controls, partial dollarization, and establishing relationships with the private sector. Among her most impressive accomplishments was her handling of the country's lucrative but struggling oil industry, which she wielded significant control over after being appointed vice president. Under her management, Venezuela's oil industry saw modest growth despite crippling U.S. sanctions and a lack of international expertise, the primary move that earned her attention from the Trump administration. Lesser known at the time, but perhaps influential later, was her attempted courting of Trump during his first term. This effort is largely viewed as a failure, given Trump's first administration's hard-line stance toward Venezuela, but it could have planted the seed of the second administration's cautious trust placed in her. Trump's statement on Jan. 3 expressing confidence that she would work with the U.S. took many by complete surprise. Some analysts doubted Trump's sentiment, given her hostile rhetoric immediately following Maduro's capture. At her swearing-in ceremony, she denounced Operation Absolute Resolve as an “illegitimate military aggression.” “I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.” She repeated this rhetoric as recently as Monday, once again denouncing “the illegal, illicit aggression of the United States government against the Venezuelan people.” Her most recent remarks came over anger towards Trump after he posted an edited image listing himself as “President of Venezuela” on Wikipedia. “I've seen some caricatures on Wikipedia about who runs Venezuela,” she said, an apparent reference to the meme posted by Trump. She has followed through by adopting policies favoring the U.S., including an oil deal giving the U.S. exclusive discretion over who Venezuela sells its oil to. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security.” “This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump said. For her part, the liberal leader has warned that Rodriguez is little different than Maduro. “Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Machado said in a recent interview with Fox News. “She's the main ally and liaison with Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual that could be trusted by international investors. And she's really rejected, repudiated by the Venezuelan people.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government's deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran. Iran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world's most important oil shipping lanes. Iran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world's sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers. But Iran's potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 billion barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Like Venezuela, China is by far Iran's biggest customer: It bought 97% of Iran's oil in 2024, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don't end there: Iran also nationalized the country's energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies' assets in past decades. But Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela. “Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.” Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela. Oil fell 4%, back below $60, Thursday morning after Trump suggested an attack wasn't imminent. For example, crude prices surged 7% and rose above $74 a barrel in early June as tensions escalated between Israel and Iran. But prices actually fell sharply after the United States' historic attack on three Iranian nuclear facilities later that month because the United States avoided attacking the country's oil infrastructure – and Iran's missile attacks on US bases were intercepted and widely viewed as symbolic. “Iran's ability to cause chaos in the oil markets is significant if they choose to lash out,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners. That's why the oil market is getting jittery. “Oil traders are effectively placing bets on chaos,” said Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory giant deVere Group. Iran has a surprisingly diversified economy for a sanctioned nation, with oil making up only about 10% to 15% of the country's overall gross domestic product. But Iran's government relies heavily on the oil industry for its finances, bringing in half of its revenue from crude exports. “Oil plays a critical role in the current regime and would continue to do so if the regime changes,” said Pickering. Iran also has a leg up on Venezuela, whose authoritarian regime allowed the country's oil infrastructure to crumble over the past couple decades. By contrast, Iran's infrastructure is in decent shape. “A future government would not be starting from zero,” Green said. Of course, that's if a new government in Iran is friendly to the West, persuading countries around the globe to drop their sanctions, noted Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. But a new government in Iran could help stabilize and reduce oil prices in the long run, especially if it adds the transparency that the current authoritarian Iranian government has prevented for decades. That could put a significant amount of oil into the global market, according to Matt McManus, a former State Department official and a visiting fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics. Political stability and guarantees of security would need to precede any major American oil company's involvement in Iran. And with crude prices still quite low, oil companies aren't exactly rushing into new opportunities with questionable profits. “As for Iran, it has significant resources,” said Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's trade group. “But any discussion of investment would depend on political stability.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As millions of Venezuelans wait to see what will become of their economically and politically ravaged country, a battle has emerged between two female leaders for control over the nation's future – and for the American president's favor. On one side is opposition leader and Nobel Prize laureate María Corina Machado, who rose to prominence in recent years for her dogged fight for democracy in Venezuela, facing down now-ousted former dictator Nicolás Maduro. She has mostly stayed in hiding after Venezuela's disputed 2024 presidential election, after which government-controlled electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner – allowing him to cling to power until his capture by US special forces in a remarkable raid two weeks ago. And he has kept a massive US military armada in the Caribbean to continue strong-arming Caracas. On the surface, it looks straightforward – Trump has praised Rodriguez but declined to endorse Machado, despite her having high-powered supporters within his administration. But Trump's discussions with other world leaders have shown his opinions can flip quickly. Praise can turn to threats, or vice versa – and a one-on-one meeting, which Machado is about to have on Thursday at the White House, could change everything. Both Machado and Rodriguez have been communicating directly with the US president. On Wednesday, Trump said he had spoken with Rodriguez on the phone, calling her a “terrific person” and saying they were “getting along very well.” She has some powerful allies within the White House – Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among those who praised her work and nominated her for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Even Trump himself, before his inauguration last year, called Machado a freedom fighter who “MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!” But that support appeared to sour when Machado won the Nobel – which Trump has made no secret of wanting for himself. “I can't think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel Prize more than me. And I don't want to be bragging, but nobody else settled wars,” Trump said last week. Why Venezuela's opposition leader Machado is betting her political future on Trump In recent weeks, she suggested she would offer her award to Trump even though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said it cannot be transferred. Trump said it would be an honor to receive her prize, but didn't directly answer whether that could make him reconsider her role in Venezuela. Thursday's lunch might be Machado's best chance at swaying the president; despite being on the back foot right now, a lot can change in one encounter. Just look at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous White House meeting with Trump last February, which left Ukraine scrambling to regain US support and European allies jumping in to play mediator. Meanwhile, Trump has also voiced his willingness to meet “at some point” with Rodriguez, who now faces a tricky balancing act. On the one hand, Rodriguez has outwardly denounced the US operation, condemning Maduro's capture as a “barbarity” and a blatant violation of Venezuela's sovereignty. But under pressure from the US to comply, Rodriguez has since struck a more conciliatory tone, offering an “agenda of cooperation” with the US. Her government has begun releasing high-profile prisoners as a peace gesture, including several Americans. Rodriguez has long had a complicated relationship with the US. In 2017, when she was foreign minister, Venezuela donated half a million dollars to Trump's inauguration committee through its oil subsidiary. Since becoming acting president, she has offered to ship millions of barrels of oil to the US and authorized a visit by US chargé d'affaires Joe McNamara to explore the possibility of reopening the US embassy in Caracas, which was closed in 2019. Trump and other key administration officials have indicated that they view Rodriguez as a stable, pragmatic choice that the US can work with, and who is open to valuable business opportunities – with the first US sales of Venezuelan oil reported on Wednesday. But she's playing “a very difficult double game” with no guarantee of coming out on top, said Will Freeman, Fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But she also has to convince hardliners in the Maduro regime… the military as well, that she's not going to sell them out,” he added. “We're going to see how long she can walk that tightrope.” CNN's Alayna Treene, Mauricio Torres, Christian Edwards and Laura Sharman contributed to this report.</p>
