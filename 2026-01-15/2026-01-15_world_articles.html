On Thursday morning, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a federal law that allows presidents to deploy the U.S. military domestically under certain circumstances, purportedly to help enforce local law enforcement amid civil unrest. His threat comes a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renée Nicole Good, who was attempting to drive away as agents surrounded her car. The Insurrection Act gives presidents broad military authority over whatever geographical area they deem necessary. A challenge purporting that Trump's invocation of the act is politically motivated could also be brought forward. But a legal challenge on any basis would face an uphill battle, as the Insurrection Act does not itself have an explicit oversight provision. Meanwhile, there is myriad video evidence demonstrating instances of federal immigration officials attacking demonstrators in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and other parts of the country without provocation. On Wednesday night, just a week after the killing of Renée Nicole Good, federal agents in Minneapolis shot a man in the leg, prompting residents to turn out in droves to protest the agency. “There is still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a press conference following the shooting. “The city is already under occupation by federal forces,” and the threat of the Insurrection Act could be Trump's attempting to “scar[e] local electeds into cracking down for him and having preemptive compliance,” Caraballo said. Polling shows deep opposition to Trump using the military to carry out his policies, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll in October showing that nearly 6 in 10 Americans (58 percent) believe a president should deploy troops to areas of the U.S. only when there is an external threat. More recent polling shows stark opposition to Trump's immigration policies in general. Furthermore, only 31 percent say ICE is making American cities safer, while 51 percent say the agency is making cities less safe, the poll found.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in,” said Chuck Schumer. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Vice President JD Vance broke a tied Senate vote to block advancement of a war powers resolution that would have stopped President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Senate Republicans used a procedural maneuver Wednesday night to halt debate on the Vietnam War-era statute that gives Congress a check on the president's deployments abroad. Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri flipped on their previous votes to advance the resolution, splitting support at 50-50 — and delivering a victory to Trump, who had strongly criticized Republican senators who earlier defected from the administration. Young said while he “strongly” believes Congress must be involved in any decisions about the commitment of U.S. troops, administration officials assured him that is not the state of play in Venezuela. “After numerous conversations with senior national security officials, I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela. The vote came less than a week after Young and Hawley were among the  five Senate Republicans who broke with party ranks to move the resolution across an initial procedural hurdle — a rare rebuke of Trump from some in his own party. Trump pointedly attacked the five GOP senators after they voted, writing on his Truth Social platform that the lawmakers “should never be elected to office again.” Senate Republicans argued a resolution to rein in Trump's military actions against Venezuela is not relevant because “there's no troops there, there is nothing to terminate,” as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim Risch said on the floor ahead of the vote. “Now, I know some of my colleagues will argue that a vote for this resolution is a prospective statement about limiting future action in Venezuela. But again, that is not what the resolution says. … No language in this resolution addresses future action,” said Risch, R-Idaho, who moved to table the measure. The vote came 11 days after U.S. special forces apprehended Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their bedroom during a surprise overnight raid. The couple was wanted by U.S. authorities on federal drug and conspiracy charges. The vote also comes after a monthslong bombing campaign on small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in which U.S. strikes killed more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists,” according to U.S. Southern Command. Within an hour before senators voted to block any advancement of the war powers resolution, Trump posted on social media that he “had a very good call” Thursday morning with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security. This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump wrote on his own platform, Truth Social. “You don't have to be a great expert in military affairs to know that we are heavily engaged,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, ahead of the vote. Tell that to our service members on the Ford carrier strike force. “Donald Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in before one mistake ignites a larger, more unstable conflict.” Kaine likened the Republicans' procedural move to “a parliamentary gag rule on discussion of this military operation.” Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said more than 100 were killed in the raid, according to numerous media outlets that posted a video of his statement. Five returned to work within days after the attack, while two were still recovering as of Jan. 8. Pentagon officials declined to comment further on their conditions Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People affected by the US visa freeze: share your experience Minnesota governor Tim Walz called on Donald Trump to “turn the temperature down” as protests escalate in Minneapolis after the shooting of an immigrant by an ICE agent on Wednesday. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that those gathering at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday were “engaging in unlawful behavior”. “We cannot fan the flames of chaos,” Walz added. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is due to brief reporters shortly. I'll bring you all the key lines here, so stay tuned. He boasted that he had accomplished so much that “when you think of it, we shouldn't even have an election”. The Trump administration has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, freezing applications from 21 January as part of a sweeping crackdown on legal immigration pathways. We would like to hear from people from countries on the visa ban list who are currently in the immigrant visa application process, particularly those who are at an advanced or final stage. How has the freeze affected you and your plans? How is the uncertainty affecting your work, studies, family life or future plans? Minnesota governor Tim Walz called on Donald Trump to “turn the temperature down” as protests escalate in Minneapolis after the shooting of an immigrant by an ICE agent on Wednesday. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that those gathering at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday were “engaging in unlawful behavior”. “We cannot fan the flames of chaos,” Walz added. “If we are on a target doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” the homeland security secretary told reporters outside the White House today. “That's what we've always done in asking people who they are, so that we know who's in those surroundings, and if they are breaking our federal laws.” “They are doing everything correctly, and over and over again in litigation, in the courts, we've proven that they've done the right thing.” “I'm very proud of our Coast Guard and how they partnered with the Department of War to do unprecedented actions in bringing these flags under jurisdiction.” Last year, Khalil – a green card holder and Columbia graduate – was released from an immigration detention facility, after he was initially arrested for his role in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza. His lawyers are set to appeal the ruling, meaning any re-arrest would not happen immediately. The homeland security secretary added that Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, “needs to start working with our law enforcement officers”, as tensions in the city rise, following the shooting of an immigrant during an enforcement operation on Wednesday. “We could go get these criminals off the streets with their partnership, and do it in a safe manner with less agents, if he [Frey] told everybody to go home and said it was no longer acceptable,” Noem said in an interview with Fox News today. He needs to make sure that he's working with us, with his law enforcement officers, to make sure we're arresting the dangerous ones and sending the rest of them home.” Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said that she spoke to Donald Trump this morning about his threats to invoke the Insurrection Act as protests continued in Minneapolis against federal immigration agents. “That certainly is within the president's constitutional authority to use that if he thinks he needs to keep people safe,” she said. “What I love about this president is the very first question that he asks me is ‘how are you doing, and how are our people doing in this country? How are the people doing and our law enforcement officers? The US military has seized another oil tanker at sea in support of Donald Trump's sanctions against Venezuela, military officials announced Thursday. As tensions rise in Minneapolis and protests over the use of force by federal immigration agents continue, my colleague, Maanvi Singh, is on the ground. She reports that at a news conference at Minneapolis City Hall on Wednesday night, police chief Brian O'Hara said protesters were “engaging in unlawful behavior” and urged everyone who had gathered at the shooting scene in north Minneapolis to leave. The Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, said: “I've seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and intolerable.” But he urged protesters out Wednesday night to go home. “We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos … Anyone who is taking the bait tonight, stop,” he said. “You are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city.” Trump has routinely threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, most recently in Portland, Oregon last October. The president also threatened to invoke the act in June when California governor Gavin Newsom sued Trump to block the use of military forces to accompany federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, calling it an “illegal deployment”. Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as protests against federal immigration agents continue in Minneapolis. On Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg during an enforcement operation in north Minneapolis, sparking further protests in the city, just a week after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good. Also today, we'll hear from press secretary Karoline Leavitt when she holds a White House briefing at 1pm ET.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three House members claim they're being targeted for saying that troops don't need to comply with illegal orders Three House Democrats confirmed on Wednesday they have been approached by federal prosecutors investigating their participation in a November video about military duty, widening the circle of legislators being targeted by the Trump administration. “Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn't like,” Crow said in a statement. “No matter the threats, I am not backing down,” she said in a video posted on X. “It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the president, our commander in chief, to threaten violence against me, and to weaponize the Department of Justice.” The Pentagon secretary, Pete Hegseth, formally censured the Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a retired navy captain, in January and launched administrative proceedings that could result in rank reduction and pension cuts. Kelly has responded with litigation, arguing the Pentagon's actions violate constitutional protections. In it, they reminded service members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey illegal commands – a principle regularly taught in military training. “By sending the FBI and now DoJ after Rep Deluzio and the other members of Congress who stated the law in a recent video, it's obvious that this administration is engaged in a harassment campaign against their political rivals,” Deluzio spokesperson Zoe Bluffstone said. “Congressman Deluzio won't be intimidated and will keep doing the job he was elected to do.” Houlahan suggested the investigation's true motivation was stifling political speech. “The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn't want anyone to hear,” she told NBC News in a statement. The federal targeting represents an extraordinary use of prosecutorial power against sitting legislators for protected political speech. Government watchdog groups have condemned the investigations as authoritarian overreach. The lawmakers had encountered an earlier round of federal interest in November, when FBI agents approached congressional security officials seeking interviews. In her own video statement about the investigation on Tuesday, Slotkin accused Trump of following a familiar authoritarian pattern. “To be clear, this is the president's playbook,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The West doesn't give Iran's political system the credit it deserves, as it has proven resilient through both internal crises and external pressures, a German journalist and director of the publishing house Multipolar Press, Constantin von Hoffmeister told TASS in an interview. "Western narratives often portray the Iranian government as fragile, unpopular, and close to collapse. Their persistence should itself provoke doubt," the expert said. The journalist stressed that "a system that survives war with Iraq, decades of sanctions, assassinations of its scientists, cyberattacks, and constant pressure is not fragile. According to von Hoffmeister, this does not mean there is no social tension, but it shows that hardships actually strengthen the state system's resilience. "The United States and Israel know this. This has been proven repeatedly," the expert added. Unrest in Iran began on December 29, sparked by street protests over the sharp decline in the rial's value. The protests quickly spread to most major cities. Authorities reported that approximately 40 law enforcement officers were killed during the unrest. Since January 8, armed terrorists have appeared among the demonstrators, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a statement. US President Donald Trump had previously warned that he was seriously considering the possibility of using force against the Islamic Republic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sprawling betting scheme to rig NCAA and Chinese Basketball Association games ensnared 26 people, including more than a dozen college basketball players who tried to fix games as recently as last season, federal prosecutors said Thursday. The scheme generally revolved around fixers recruiting players with the promise of a big payment in exchange for those players purposefully underperforming during a game, prosecutors said. Then the fixers placed big bets against those players' teams in those games, defrauding sportsbooks and other bettors, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday. Fixers started with two games in the Chinese Basketball Association in 2023 and, successful there, moved on to fixing NCAA games as recently as January 2025, authorities say. College athletes still banned from betting on professional sports after NCAA Division I schools vote to rescind proposed rule Four of the players charged – Simeon Cottle, Carlos Hart, Oumar Koureissi and Camian Shell – played for their current teams in the last few days, although the allegations against them do not involve this season. Calling it an “international criminal conspiracy,” US Attorney David Metcalf told reporters in Philadelphia that this case represents a “significant corruption of the integrity of sports.” Concerns about gambling and college sports have grown since 2018, when the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice, leading some states to legalize it to varying degrees. The NCAA does not allow athletes or staff to bet on college games, but it briefly allowed student-athletes to bet on professional sports last year before rescinding that decision in November. Of the defendants, 15 played basketball for Division I NCAA schools during 2024-2025 season, prosecutors say. Several of them are playing this season. The other five defendants were described by authorities as fixers. They include two men who prosecutors say worked in the training and development of basketball players. Another was a trainer and former coach, one was a former NCAA player and two were described as gamblers, influencers and sports handicappers. Meanwhile, other bettors unaware of the scheme lost money on their bets and would not have placed those bets had they known about it, authorities say. One betting scandal after another has rocked the sports world, where gambling revenue topped $11 billion for the first three-quarters of last year, according to the American Gaming Association. The indictment follows a series of NCAA investigations that led to at least 10 players receiving lifetime bans this year for bets that sometimes involved their own teams and their own performances. And the NCAA has said that at least 30 players have been investigated over gambling allegations. More than 30 people were also charged in last year's sprawling federal takedown of illegal gambling operations linked to professional basketball.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>officials told Reuters on Thursday, ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. It said the Veronica was “operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.” “The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is co-ordinated properly and lawfully,” Southern Command said in a statement. The vessel had not ‍returned to Venezuela as other ships have done in recent ‌days. The seizures began as part of Trump's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas ⁠Maduro out of power, which culminated in U.S. forces swooping into the country to grab him and his wife on ​January 3. Since then, Trump has said the U.S. plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a US$100-billion plan. U.S. seizes another tanker as it exerts control over Venezuelan oil distribution The U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, four sources told Reuters on ​Wednesday, as Washington consolidates control of oil shipments in and out of the South American country. The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a “shadow fleet” of ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers – Iran, Russia or Venezuela. Last week, the U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that was being shadowed ⁠by a Russian submarine after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic. The latest ‌seizure came ahead of Thursday's meeting between Trump and Machado, in their first face-to-face meeting since the U.S. ousted her long-time foe, Maduro. Trump has previously called her a “freedom fighter” but dismissed the idea of installing her to lead Venezuela after ousting Maduro, saying she did not have enough domestic support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A video accompanying the post shows numerous Russian soldiers being targeted by drones and artillery. "The enemy has recently increased its activity along the State Border of Ukraine, taking advantage of opportunities to infiltrate border villages, attempting to entrench themselves and destabilize the situation," DeepState wrote on Telegram. "The enemy is testing the ground and attempting to entrench themselves in locations like Komarivka and Hrabovske. These incursions are aimed at expanding zones of influence and operational control," DeepState said. Ukraine's Defense Forces are actively responding to these movements by targeting Russian infantry as they attempt to consolidate positions. However, full neutralization is reportedly not always possible. In many cases, the enemy is eliminated at the very start of their attempt to advance, which often makes mapping unnecessary. But when these incursions become repeated, and the enemy manages to hold territory, we mark these developments on the map accordingly," DeepState noted. Kuleba stated that one crew member was injured and is currently receiving necessary medical assistance following the attack. "The ship was getting ready for a container shipment," he wrote. The strike caused damage to three containers and resulted in an oil spill. Emergency teams have deployed a containment boom to localize the pollution and minimize environmental impact. "This is yet another act of Russian terror against civilian port infrastructure, international trade, and maritime safety," Kuleba said. The incident comes amid ongoing attacks on Ukraine's ports, which play a vital role in maintaining grain and goods exports under international agreements. The ongoing energy crisis in Kyiv remains "extremely serious," officials said on Jan. 15, as Ukraine's Security Service said Russia's ongoing strikes against energy infrastructure amount to "crimes against humanity." Some of the drones — including more advanced rocket-powered versions — targeted a thermal power plant in Kyiv, local monitoring telegram channels said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, wrote on X on Jan. 15 that Ukraine's energy sector is facing an "extremely serious situation" due to "unprecedented attacks by Russia and extreme cold across the country." While energy workers repair the damage, the icy temperatures are making it difficult, and replacement equipment is running out. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 14 declared a state of emergency in the energy sector, with particular attention on Kyiv, which is reeling from Russian attacks that have left residents without power, heating, or water in subzero temperatures. At least two people died and 20 others were injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 15. Russia launched 82 Shahed-type drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. Ukraine's air defenses said they shot down or suppressed 61 drones. The Air Force added that 21 drones hit 13 locations. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured five people over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Sumy Oblast, seven people including four children were injured by Russian drone strikes, regional authorities reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured six others over the past day, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Russia has lost around 1,223,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 14. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,557 tanks, 23,904 armored fighting vehicles, 74,306 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,182 artillery systems, 1,611 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,277 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 107,357 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

This “might is right” posturing was not unexpected, given that the Trump administration had announced it late last year in its National Security Strategy. But to see it suddenly in action was still jarring. An emboldened Mr. Trump followed up the Caracas coup by renewing his threat to take Greenland, without ruling out military force. As this space has said, the Trump administration's claim that power, not law, provides legitimacy does indeed date back to ancient times – the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, to be exact, when Athens told the island state of Melos to surrender or face annihilation. But they didn't last long once a coalition, reacting to their aggression, got rolling. Mr. Trump and his advisers are now pretending that never happened and are returning to an era of unchecked power that has repeatedly been rejected as unworkable, but only after great catastrophes. An attempt to rebalance power in Europe after the disastrous Napoleonic Wars, it is criticized for cementing the powers of the great kingdoms of that era, but it is also praised for bringing a century of relative peace to the continent, and for its recognition that diplomacy, not dominance, creates stability and prosperity. Countries that rely on force alone for legitimacy can quickly become overextended and isolated. Already, America's allies are questioning the reliability of an administration that blithely boasts that no one can stop it from seizing Greenland, as Mr. Miller did. This week, for instance, Prime Minister Mark Carney is in China hoping to reset trade relations with Beijing. Countries such as Canada may have no choice but to realign themselves if Mr. Trump intends to dictate from his office, based on his “morality,” which smaller nations will be granted sovereignty and which won't, and on what bullying terms that sovereignty will be permitted. It's worth remembering, too, that Napoleon, for all his military brilliance, only held sway over Europe for 15 years and died alone in exile. He and other would-be strongmen found out that, given time, the iron law of might corrodes. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump and his administration may well be planting the seeds of American decline. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

MOSCOW, January 15. /TASS/. The nuclear potential of the entire West, including Great Britain and France, must be considered when developing a more advantageous document on limiting strategic offensive arms, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing while commenting on the US desire to include China in a possible agreement.

The Kremlin spokesman reiterated that Russia respects the position of China, which does not see the need for its inclusion in the treaty. "Beyond these words from representatives of the US administration about China, we must not forget the statements of President Putin that, further on, discussing issues of strategic stability and security without taking into account the arsenals of France and Great Britain also seems unfeasible," Peskov added.

Earlier this month, Trump told The New York Times that he was unbothered by the impending expiration of the New START treaty. "If it expires, it expires. We'll just do a better agreement," he said.

Meanwhile, Russia's new Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Dmitry Polyansky, who previously served as First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, told TASS that Moscow hopes that the US administration will respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative on preserving the limitations imposed by the New START treaty in the format of voluntary self-restrictions after the document expires. Regarding the issue of China's participation, Moscow proceeds from the understanding that this is a matter for Beijing itself and respects any decision of the Chinese side.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Violent groups urged to join forces and fight ‘enemies of the greater homeland' Less than a week after Delta Force's audacious capture of Nicolas Maduro, Colombia's most wanted guerrilla leader made an unusual plea to his rival insurgents. After decades of waging a bloody conflict over territories, drug trafficking routes and illegal economies, it was time to unite against a common enemy: Donald Trump. Standing in fatigues flanked by two rebel fighters holding machine guns in a video shared last week, he added: “Destiny is calling us to unite. Among the rebel groups singled out by Mordisco, whose real name is Nestor Gregorio Vera, was the Left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's largest and most powerful criminal guerrilla, which controls large swathes of the 1,400-mile border between Venezuela and Colombia. “The war between Mordisco, or Farc dissidents and the ELN has been very, very bloody with a huge humanitarian impact, so it calls my attention that despite that, Mordisco is still saying ‘hey, stop this, let's unite against our enemy, which is the US and its intervention',” Jorge Mantilla, security analyst and expert on Colombian guerrilla groups, said. Gustavo Petro, the Colombian president and former guerrilla fighter, used the threat of such an alliance to call for a concerted effort to “remove” drug trafficking guerrillas. Mr Maduro gave sanctuary to the rebel fighters in Venezuela's borders, seeing their presence on the border with Colombia as a first line of defence against potential US attacks. It allowed the ELN's commanders to evade capture in Colombia and become a binational guerrilla force, capturing states in both countries. They soon realised controlling the border was a lucrative business, allowing them to profit from drug trafficking and people smuggling routes at a time when millions of Venezuelans were fleeing the regime. The ELN, which is thought to have around 6,000 members, controls large chunks of Catatumbo, a major cocaine producing region in Colombia, which is also home to cocaine labs and clandestine airstrips. They are also understood to have guerrilla camps in Venezuela, which are used for specialised training in the use of drones and snipers, according to InSight Crime. “2019 for me was the point where the ELN kind of figures out that it can expand in Venezuela to become a binational army,” Mr Mantilla told The Telegraph from his home in Bogota. “Today, the main goal of the ELN is not the takeover of power in Colombia or to rebuild a Colombian state, but more so to defend the Bolivarian Revolution, because they consider themselves a continental guerrilla [group] because their ideological inspiration is Latin Americanist, so they feel the struggle of Venezuela is their struggle,” he said. When he took office in 2022, Mr Petro had promised to achieve “total peace”, bringing an end to the decades-long internal conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of Colombians. Between January and May 2025, ELN offensives, which included mobilising fighters who attacked from Venezuela, left 117 people dead, including civilians, according to InsightCrime. Despite the mounting pressure of a potential joint military attack, Carlos Arturo Velandia, a former ELN commander turned peace advocate, said he believed the ELN would ignore Mordisco's proposal. “If they made that call, they would be successful, and all the countries would produce guerrilla fighters that would fight imperialism,” Mr Velandia said, although he said he expected these blocs to stay within their own countries. Elizabeth Dickinson, International Crisis Group's deputy programme director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said she believed Mordisco's proposal was “more tactical than strategic”. “I think it's all about sort of positioning in the actual battlefield between armed and criminal groups in Colombia, rather than sort of a strategic shift of guerrilla or insurgent movements in reaction to the US,” she said. There have also been reports of the group crossing the border back in Colombia and closing down camps in Venezuela. Mr Petro responded, claiming the ELN had destroyed an agreement with “blood and fire” and said such discussions could not move forward if the ELN did not give up illicit activities and return to Colombia. While Mr Mantilla notes that a joint attack from the US, Venezuela and Colombia would be the “worst scenario” for the ELN, he does not believe it would be “easy” to defeat insurgent groups. I think it would be a great long-term effort to gain territorial control in those places where the ELN has cultivated criminal governance and has achieved the capacity to corrupt and capture local states.” “This is a huge challenge for the ELN, but it is not an unexpected challenge,” Mr Mantilla said, noting that commanders had been talking about fighting a proxy war with the US over Venezuelan resources for months. Ms Dickinson said the US intervention could work as a “boon” for recruiting for some of these armed groups, especially the ELN, which espouses anti-imperialist ideology. She also warned that the ELN is not a group that can easily be bombed as it has few camps, moves in small commissions of around five to 15 people and is focused on integrating into the population. Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor with the US Army War College, said he thinks the ELN will be hoping to “lie low” and remain embedded in Venezuela until this blows over. “It would be so completely against their interest to actually stand up and fight right now,” he said. He was also sceptical of the idea that the guerrilla forces could join together, as it would make them an easy target for Ms Rodriguez to sell out in an effort to get along with Mr Trump. Should their interests be threatened, he could see a broader Leftist fight from guerrilla groups against the “gringo occupiers and the Chavista sell-outs”, which could involve joint terrorist attacks. It could also serve as an opportunity for Colombia, which has come under pressure from Mr Trump, to say they are cooperating with the US and trying to tackle drug trafficking. “I think ELN is, right now, in a very vulnerable position,” said Angelika Rettberg, political science professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia. “I also don't think that even if they are able to build this unified organisation, that that would make them less likely to be hit by an eventual US attack,” Ms Rettberg said. We won't run away and hide,” he said. Now, seven years later, the group's promise to rise up against their imperialist enemies may finally be tested.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No casualties were reported as a result of the Russian drone attack, according to preliminary information, he said in a post to Telegram. Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine. Overnight on Jan. 8-9, Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones, killing at least four people and injuring 25 others in Kyiv, knocking out electricity for hundreds of thousands while disrupting heat supplies as temperatures fell. On the same night, Russia fired its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile at Lviv, the Russian Defense Ministry said, calling the attack "retaliation" for an attempted Ukrainian drone strike on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's residences, a claim Kyiv has denied. Russia is "going all in" to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure after the second mass attack in less than a week, Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Kolisnyk said on Jan. 13.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X that "this statement is a disgrace," adding that "false moral equivalence between an aggressor and a country defending itself is unacceptable." A meeting between U.S., Danish, and Greenlandic officials on Jan. 14 failed to defuse tensions. During her visit, Georgieva was expected to review Ukraine's progress in passing the 2026 budget, as well as discuss measures to further prevent tax evasion and boost revenue by broadening the tax base. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 14 declared a state of emergency in the energy sector. "I think (Russian President Vladimir Putin is) ready to make a deal. I think Ukraine is less ready to make a ‍deal," U.S. President Donald Trump said. "The consequences of Russian strikes and worsening weather conditions are severe," Zelensky wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ALEXANDER GABUEV is Director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. SERGEY VAKULENKO is a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. “This morning, the United States carried out an act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” Russia's Foreign Ministry wrote on January 3, as news emerged of the U.S. operation targeting various Venezuelan military facilities. Beyond this statement, Moscow did nothing material to help the regime that it has previously called a key strategic partner in Latin America. The Kremlin's impotence in Venezuela follows a familiar pattern that has been on display since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago. Last summer, in response to the U.S.-Israeli strikes against Iran, another strategic partner, the Russians offered to mediate between the belligerents but weren't able to supply useful intelligence or air defense equipment that could have made a difference. In the case of Venezuela, Moscow was able to do even less than it did for Damascus and Tehran. For Putin, the blow from Maduro's downfall has been especially humiliating. Although Venezuela has long been a drain on Russia's state coffers because of unrecoverable loans and money-losing oil projects, the country at least offered a certain point of pride: Moscow could claim to have secured a foothold in the United States' backyard. Maduro's ousting not only makes this rhetoric ring hollow; it also underscores the fact that Venezuela was never Moscow's to lose. Russia and Venezuela have maintained friendly ties for a quarter century. In 2000, Putin and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, both newly elected, met for the first time during a UN General Assembly session in New York. When Chávez embarked on a populist, anti-American course, he was flush with oil profits amid elevated global energy prices and bought up Russian weapons to replace the aging U.S. equipment purchased by his predecessors. The relationship deepened after Russia's five-day war against Georgia, in August 2008, and started to take an ideological turn with shared animosity toward U.S. hegemony. Moscow wanted its partners around the world to recognize the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and dispatched senior officials to persuade them. But then, in September 2009, on a state visit to Moscow, Chávez announced that Venezuela would also recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This was largely a transactional arrangement, but it started to shift the Kremlin's approach toward Venezuela away from pure pragmatism. Within days, Russia opened a $2.2 billion credit line for Caracas to purchase Russian military equipment, despite the fact that the Venezuelan regime had enough oil revenue to pay in cash. Moscow also signaled that it would invest in various industrial, infrastructure, and social projects in Venezuela that would help Chávez boost his popularity and cement his grip on power, which had become more authoritarian over the years. Despite anti-Americanism being an increasingly visible driving force behind the partnership, Moscow was still pursuing its rational self-interest; after a brief dip following the 2008 Great Recession, oil prices were on the rise again, and Russia's investments and loans appeared to be recoverable. It wasn't until Chávez's death from cancer, in 2013, that the remaining pragmatic pillars of cooperation started to unravel. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and launched a war in eastern Ukraine, setting the Kremlin on a path of confrontation with the United States. That same year, oil prices crashed, decimating Venezuela's export revenue, severely reducing government cash flow, and compelling Russian oil companies to cut costs and pare down their programs. The Russian state energy giant Rosneft, for instance, has provided billions of dollars in advanced payments to PDVSA, Venezuela's state oil and gas company, that are unlikely to ever be recovered. Moscow also helped Caracas circumvent U.S. sanctions and invested in the Maduro regime's ability to withstand pressure from Washington. In 2019 and 2024, Moscow even dispatched military planes carrying mercenaries from the state-backed Wagner paramilitary company to Caracas to signal direct support for Maduro during protests against his regime after rigged presidential elections. Still, through it all, the depth of Russia's commitment to Venezuela has been an open question. In 2019, for instance, the Russian leadership cynically signaled to Washington that it was ready to abandon Venezuela if the United States disengaged from Ukraine, according to congressional testimony by Fiona Hill, who served as senior National Security Council director on Russia and Europe during the first Trump administration. When push came to shove, however, the United States didn't need Russia's help. What's more, all the tools deployed by Moscow proved incapable of protecting its key Latin American ally. Russia was not able to provide timely and accurate intelligence to warn Maduro about the upcoming U.S. operations, and the S-300 and Buk-M2 missile systems Moscow supplied had not been properly maintained or plugged into an integrated air defense system, something that the Russian military would be expected to help with for a strategic partner and buyer of Russian military hardware. For the last 20 years, Moscow has demonstrated an ability to inject itself as a player in regions with strong anti-American sentiment. But the Kremlin's costly adventures have yet to show any practical benefits for enhancing Russia's genuine security interests or boosting its economic prosperity. Involvement in places such as Venezuela serves only Putin's vanity, a few votes of solidarity with Moscow at the UN General Assembly, and money-making opportunities for corrupt Russian officials. Moreover, the Kremlin's opportunistic approach does not translate into a durable ability to shape outcomes. But it is unable to help its partners address their regime's vulnerabilities through capacity building. In Syria, for example, Russia lent Damascus its airpower and other military tools, but it couldn't fix the excessive brutality, incompetence, corruption, and economic mismanagement that contributed to the Assad regime's downfall. In Venezuela, Russia wasn't able to provide the Maduro regime with timely intelligence, adequate training, or functioning equipment. Moscow may still be able to exercise influence in settings that are not strategically important to Washington, such as the Central African Republic or Tajikistan. Likewise, Russia has not abandoned Venezuela; its military personnel and equipment are still there.
