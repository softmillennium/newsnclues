                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the FIFA World Cup draws closer and closer, excitement continues to grow around the world as fans reach new records. FIFA says over 500 million ticket requests were submitted for the World Cup 2026 Random Selection Draw. Fans placed an average of 15 million ticket requests per day over the 33-day period, which officials say set a new benchmark in world sport. Outside host countries, the United States, Mexico and Canada, the most ticket requests were made by Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. All game matches and locations have been revealed for the 2026 FIFA World Cup Final Tournament. Fans will receive an email with the outcome of their ticket application no earlier than February 5. Tickets will be allocated randomly for matches in which demand exceeds availability, according to FIFA. If fans don't receive tickets during this phase, they will have another opportunity to purchase remaining tickets during the Last-Minute Sales phase, which is expected to run from early April until the end of the tournament. FIFA also operates an official resale/exchange marketplace for eligible ticket holders. The Source: Information from this article was provided by FIFA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHS launched a new office dedicated to quickly buying and deploying drone technology. The office is called the DHS Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Its mission is to oversee strategic investments in drone and counter-drone technologies that can outpace evolving threats and tactics. “Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “This will help us continue to secure the border and cripple the cartels, protect our infrastructure, and keep Americans safe as they attend festivities and events during a historic year of America's 250th birthday and FIFA 2026.” The office is already operational and is in the process of finalizing a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies. “The new Program Executive Office will be taking the threat of hostile drones head-on and innovating ways drones can keep us safe from other threats on the ground, equipping the Department with the technology and expertise we need to keep us Americans safe,” said a DHS news release. DHS is also fielding proposals for a $1.5 billion contract to facilitate the procurement of drone technologies for use by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement. DHS says it has conducted over 1,500 missions to protect the U.S. from illicit drone activities since 2018. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded $250 million in grants to the 11 World Cup host states and the National Capital Region in December.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After starring at MLS club Inter Miami, Cremaschi currently plays on loan with Serie A side Parma. “This award means a lot to me,” Cremaschi said. This is an amazing accomplishment, but it also speaks to all the people around me that keep me going as a player. I want to thank my family, teammates and everyone that made this award possible. That is a group of guys I will never forget. I also want to thank Marko Mitrovic – a coach I've had at many different levels with the National Team – for his belief and guidance along the way. Finally, I'm so grateful to my family, for their support and love.” Votes for U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year Awards are collected from National Team coaches, USMNT players who earned a cap in 2025, members of the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, U.S. Soccer Athletes' Council, professional league head coaches and sporting directors, select media members and former players and administrators. Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting the nervous system, affecting one in every 15,000 people, including Benjamin Cremaschi's cousin. “We congratulate Benjamin on this well-deserved recognition and celebrate the example he is setting for young athletes,” said Jennifer Schiavone, Henkel Vice President, Corporate Communications, Americas. “When they told me there was a donation to the charity of my choice if I won this award, my cousin Martin was obviously the first person I thought of because of the struggles he experiences and the things my uncle and aunt go through. In the team's historic 9-1 group stage victory over New Caledonia, Cremaschi proved to be the key player registering a hat trick in addition to notching two assists. The midfielder added to his goal tally with a brace in a 3-0 Round of 16 victory over 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup runners-up Italy. After scoring five goals in the tournament, Cremaschi set a U.S. U-20 MNT record for most goals scored in a single tournament on the way to winning the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot. Following strong performances with the Olympic team and Inter Miami, Cremaschi earned his first call-up under USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino last January, starting both friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica. At club level, Cremaschi was an integral part of the Inter Miami setup, playing 22 games with 16 starts. During the 2025 season, Cremaschi registered one goal and four assists for a team that would go on to win the 2025 MLS Cup. The midfielder's strong showings led to European interest, with Italian Serie A club Parma signing Cremaschi on loan during the summer transfer window, where he has appeared in three matches, including a start in the Coppa Italia. Future two-time World Cup player Josh Wolff was the inaugural winner back in 1998, with the prize also claimed by future World Cup players Ben Olsen (1999), Landon Donovan (2000), DaMarcus Beasley (2001), Bobby Convey (2002), Eddie Johnson (2004), Benny Feilhaber (2005), Jozy Altidore (2006), Michael Bradley (2007), DeAndre Yedlin (2014), Christian Pulisic (2016), Josh Sargent (2017), Sergiño Dest (2019), Gio Reyna (2020) and Yunus Musah (2022).

Nominations are being accepted for the 2026 Sports Business Awards. Submit today! Deadline 1/26.

FIFA said that it has “received more than 500 million ticket requests for this year's World Cup,” according to the AP. The organization said that outside the host U.S., Mexico and Canada, the “most requests were made by fans residing in Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.” FIFA added that it will “notify people about their ticket applications no earlier than Feb. 5 and will allocate them randomly for matches in which demand exceeds availability” (AP, 1/14). REUTERS' Angelica Medina noted each application “was validated by unique credit card data,” with fans submitting “an average of 15 million ticket requests per day” (REUTERS, 1/14). 

OVERFLOWING: THE ATHLETIC's Henry Bushnell noted the month-long application window opened shortly after December's World Cup draw and schedule release and allowed fans to “apply for tickets to specific matches, in specific categories, at specific prices.” FIFA will “now conduct random draws for each of the World Cup's 104 matches and award tickets to the selected applicants in February.” The 500-plus million requests -- which “likely represent demand for more than 1 billion tickets, with each request being for 1-4 tickets” -- suggest the World Cup as a whole is “oversubscribed.” In anticipation of that secondary-market demand, some of the more than 500 million requests have “likely come from scalpers” -- people who will purchase tickets and then resell them at a profit. It is “unclear how thoroughly, if at all, FIFA has attempted to block those scalpers from the ticket lottery.” It is “also unclear if FIFA will award all of its remaining tickets to the millions of people who applied over the past month, or if it will withhold some tickets for one last sales phase in the spring” (THE ATHLETIC, 1/14).

The NWSL has announced that its 2026 Challenge Cup will be played at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field on June 26, marking the first time the league will play a game in Columbus since launching in 2013.

The Challenge Cup will feature NY/NJ Gotham FC and the Kansas City Current, who won the league's two major trophies last year.

The Current won the NWSL Shield by finishing a league-best 21-3-2 record in the regular season, while Gotham won its second-consecutive NWSL Championship by defeating the Washington Spirit 1-0 in the final.

Cincinnati native Rose Lavelle, who has spent the past two seasons with Gotham, scored the game-winner against Washington.

The Challenge Cup will be the second women's soccer event hosted at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field in 2026, with U.S. Soccer's SheBelieves Cup set to make a stop in Columbus on March 4. During that leg of the tournament, the U.S. Women's National Team will face Canada, and Argentina will kick off against Colombia.

Kickoff and ticket information for the Challenge Cup has yet to be announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has revealed his squad have been hit with a virus that has affected players and staff. The Blues were without Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens due to illness for their Carabao Cup semi-final clash against Arsenal and both players have been ordered to stay at home. More staff members have also been affected ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash with Brentford. The situation comes just days after Rosenior replaced Enzo Maresca at the helm and amid a hectic run of fixtures for Chelsea and their new manager. The Blues are due back in action on Saturday against Brentford in the Premier League and still have games against Pafos, Crystal Palace, Napoli and West Ham to come before the end of January. Rosenior spoke about the situation at a press conference on Thursday. Our club doctors are doing everything they can to contain what looks to be a virus because some members of our staff have come down with it as well. We had a meeting today with the players about washing your hands, the basics, which is really important and hopefully we can contain it. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Rosenior did have better news on Romeo Lavia who has endured a nightmare time with injuries at Chelsea. The midfielder was ruled out of action again in November but is closing in on a return to training. The most important thing for him now is to make sure we don't push him too hard, so that when he does come back, he's back for good and I can get some real work into him tactically. For me, he's a player I can't wait to have back in the group, and I'm really, really looking forward to having him back with us." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Rosenior faces an in-form Brentford next as he takes charge of Chelsea for the first time in the Premier League on Saturday. The Blues possess a disappointing record against Saturday's visitors and have won just one of their last eight Premier League games against the Bees. Their home record has also been a concern in the 2025-26 campaign, something Rosenior is keen to change. I want us to play with high tempo so the opposition know it is difficult to come and play at Stamford Bridge. Brentford will make the short trip to Stamford Bridge two points and three places above Chelsea in the Premier League table. Keith Andrew's side are on a run of six games without a defeat, with the two sides having played out a 2-2 draw earlier in the season at the Gtech Community Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atlanta is hosting eight matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium during the tournament. The Random Selection period of ticketing closed on Jan. 13 after 33 days, according to officials. By the end of the entrance period, half a billion people requested World Cup tickets, according to officials. When potential spectators put their names in the pot for tickets to some of the World Cup matches, they requested which matches they would most like to see. Here are the matches that were chosen most. Officials say the list highlights "the exceptional appeal of both marquee fixtures and knockout-stage encounters across all three host nations." World Cup officials also noted where the 500 million ticket requestors were coming from. On behalf of FIFA, I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response," Gianni Infantino, the FIFA President, said in a statement. But there were also a dominant number of applications from residents of Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. "Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums," Infantino said. "That is why we are committed to creating multiple ways for fans to be part of the FIFA World Cup 2026 – through a wide range of fan experiences beyond the stadiums, both in person and online – so that as many people as possible can share in what will be the biggest sporting event ever staged.” Then, the ticket winners will be chosen at random. Those who have been awarded a ticket will be alerted after Feb. 5. The Random Selection drawing entry period may be closed, but there will be other ways to attend the World Cup. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site. Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former FC Bayern defender Chris Richards earned a nice award. Former Bayern Munich prospect and current Crystal Palace center-back Chris Richards was voted U.S. Soccer's Player of the Year: U.S. Men's National Team defender Chris Richards has been voted the 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year after an outstanding year in which he started 11 of 12 matches for which he was available for the USMNT and all six matches leading to the 2025 Gold Cup Final, a tournament in which he recorded two goals and earned a spot on the Best XI. For Richards, it was a big honor and came as a shock as he found out on ESPN's Pat McAfee Show: This shows how well we've done as a team and the momentum we are building towards the World Cup,” Richards said. I see Pat all the time on College GameDay. There was never really a doubt that Richards would be a successful professional, but the timing of his arrival at Bayern Munich just happened to coincide with the squad being extremely deep, talented, and experienced on the backline. As such, he moved on and has lived up the lofty potential he brough with him from Alabama to Bavaria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup faces several controversies, from the "absurd" $40,000 price tags to foreign World Cup nations calling to cancel a popular Washington tourist event. Now, #BoycottWorldCup is trending on social media, with since-debunked reports that nearly 17,000 fans canceled their tickets overnight due to recent policies under President Donald Trump's administration. And just as this U.S. travel boycott intensifies, international FIFA fans now brace for a new U.S. visa ban on 75 countries. Many fear that this might block their plans to attend the World Cup. This visa ban was announced today, the same day FIFA revealed a record-breaking number of global requests for World Cup tickets. On Saturday (Jan. 10), Jordanian news source Roya News reported that FIFA had scheduled a meeting for next week after 16,800 people (0.0005% of ticket requests) canceled their 2026 World Cup tickets. Despite this clarification, #BoycottWorldCup continues to make noise on social media, reflecting global concerns over the U.S. political climate. "We need to boycott the FIFA World Cup for all games held in the USA," someone wrote in a Facebook group with nearly 400,000 members. "We should also tell all foreign tourists to not visit the US right now. TheTravel previously reported on the White House hinting that foreign World Cup attendees could be targeted by immigration raids. In a new memo, the U.S. Department of State states that it is pausing immigrant visa processing for 75 countries starting Jan. 21 in an effort to strengthen its screening of applicants deemed likely to become a "public charge." First reported by Fox News today, the announcement immediately caused anxiety among international soccer fans. FIFA giants, like Brazil and Colombia, are among the impacted nations. But the good news is that this U.S. visa processing freeze will not affect World Cup visitors since it only applies to immigration visas, not temporary tourist or business visas. This applies to travelers from countries not in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), like China, India, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, and the Philippines, along with most of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Today, FIFA also revealed that it had received a record-breaking 500 million ticket requests, with high interest from countries including Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina, and Colombia. Even the high prices could not stop these fans. During this 33-day application window, FIFA received applications from fans in all 211 FIFA member nations for the Colombia vs. Portugal match in Miami. The 2026 World Cup winner will receive a record-breaking $50 million jackpot. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the outside looking in, 2025 was a ‘nearly' year for Andre Blake. He backstopped Jamaica in the final round of World Cup qualification, allowing just three goals. But Jamaica fell short of earning an automatic place in the 2026 field. But Blake doesn't see it like that, opting to put the near-misses aside and focus on what was achieved. “For both club and country, there's definitely been challenging times in 2025. Jamaica will play in the inter-confederation playoff, looking to beat New Caledonia, then DR Congo to return to the Men's World Cup for the first time since Jamaica's debut in 1998. Blake and his teammates may have thought they would be able to get to the tournament in North America without the playoff. Jamaica controlled its destiny heading into the final two matches of qualification, but two points in the last two games saw Curacao leapfrog Jamaica into the automatic qualification place.

Had the Reggae Boyz held on to a one-goal edge in their penultimate match of qualification, an away game in Trinidad and Tobago, they would've needed only a stalemate on the final day. But a Kevin Molino goal in the 85th minute meant settling for a point in Port of Spain - and ceding the draw scenario to Curacao. He could do little, however, to help his teammates find a goal that would've made the difference. “It was a devastating moment for me in Kingston. The only thing missing from that game was us scoring a goal or two to win the game.” After the match, Steve McClaren resigned as Jamaica manager. Rudolph Speid, a long-time coach based in Jamaica, is the interim head coach with Miguel Coley and Michael Donaldson named as assistants and Aaron Lawrence, who went to the 1998 World Cup with Jamaica, as goalkeeper coach. The hope is that group of leaders familiar with Jamaica, plus an experienced squad captained by Blake, will be able to strip things back to basics and lead a charge past an underdog from Oceania and a DR Congo team that is favored to go through thanks to its staunch defense. We just haven't been able to bring it together,” Blake said. As soon as we're able to create that system of who we want to be, and you find players to really fit the system, I think we're going to be really successful once we can get those things right.” There is no guarantee that happens in March, or that it ever happens in Blake's playing career. Yet, this is how Blake has operated for years. He has seen coaches come and go both for the Union and for the Jamaica national team. He listens, puts on his gloves and runs back out between the sticks. The idea of being a one-club man appeals to Blake, even as it becomes increasingly difficult to pull that off in the modern soccer industry. “Right now I'm Philly for life,” he said. Replicating last year's dominant MLS campaign may be difficult. The Union traded center back Jakob Glesnes to the LA Galaxy and sold left back Kai Wagner to Birmingham City, meaning Blake will be without a pair of players who made up his typical back four last season. He hopes the institutional knowledge around the club can help cover those significant gaps as a new defense starts to work in front of him. “Over the years we would have lost big time players, and a lot of questions would pop up as to how good we would be losing all those players. But, you know, we have always found ways to still compete and do well. But I'm optimistic that the club would be able to find adequate replacements that can just slot right into the system.” While he speaks softly off the field, on it he is often barking instructions, communicating with defenders and chatting with the officiating crew. Yet, it is one the field where he hopes his play speaks the loudest this year - turning those nearly moments into opportunities fulfilled. “It would be a dream come true for me” Blake says of making the World Cup. “It would bring so much joy to the people of Jamaica, so much inspiration for the younger generation that's coming up. We have an opportunity to make that dream a reality.” The mental fortitude to reframe near-misses as building blocks rather than failures is what separates elite athletes from good ones. If Jamaica can channel that system-based philosophy he mentions into the playoff matches, they've got a real shot at pulling through.</p>
