                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's social media platform X is taking additional steps to curb its sexual deepfake problem, following weeks of backlash and multiple government investigations around the world. But the changes don't really resolve the issue outright and instead add new layers of limited restrictions rather than a platform-wide fix. In a pretty confusing post on Wednesday evening, X's @Safety account outlined several updates to how its AI image generation and editing features work, with different rules depending on whether users are generating or editing images by tagging the @Grok account or going straight to the Grok tab on X. First, the company said it has implemented new technical measures to prevent users from specifically using the @Grok account to alter “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” X says the restriction applies to all users, including those on a premium plan. Using a free account, Gizmodo was also able to access Grok's image generation feature through the Grok tab on both the X website and mobile app. On Thursday, the dedicated site still gave us no trouble when asked to generate an image of Elon Musk wearing a bikini and was willing to take the bikini off. The biggest update is that X claims it will now block “the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.” This specific update seems to apply to both the @Grok account and the Grok tabs on X. It also arrives as lawmakers in the U.K. are working to make such images illegal. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content,” the company said. X and its parent company, XAI, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. Since late last month, some X users have used Grok to generate sexualized images from photos posted by other users without their consent, including images involving minors. One social media and deepfake researcher found that Grok generated roughly 6,700 sexually suggestive or nudifying images per hour over 24 hours in early January, Bloomberg reported. Governments around the world have been quick to respond. Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to Grok, while regulators in the U.K. and European Union opened investigations into potential violations of online safety laws. In the U.S., California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Wednesday that his office had launched its own investigation into the issue. Meanwhile, as scrutiny of Grok has intensified, X quietly updated its terms of service to require that all pending and future legal cases involving the company be filed in the Fort Worth division of the Northern District of Texas, where one of the court's three judges is widely seen as friendly to the company. Left-leaning watchdog Media Matters, a frequent critic of Musk's X, said it would leave the platform in response to the updated terms. The rocket company's safety record continues to fall short. "We will win this race by becoming an AI-first war-fighting force across all domains," the Defense Secretary said Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of rumors that the Trump administration was going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, a tariff has been announced for some chips. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies. China finds itself in a similar, yet different situation to the U.S. when it comes to chip production and the global AI race. The Chinese central government is working to draft rules and guidelines of how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas, according to reporting from Nikkei Asia. This would allow for some purchasing of Nvidia's chips and would be a reversal from the country's current adversity toward the chip imports. Wednesday's executive order does not apply to chips that are imported into the U.S. and then used in the country for research, defense, or commercial purposes. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a medical issue prompted their evacuation, NASA's Crew-11 astronauts safely splashed down off the coast of California in the predawn hours of Thursday morning. Their departure brought an early end to their mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS), leaving the orbital laboratory temporarily understaffed. On Monday, Crew-11 pilot Mike Fincke handed command of the space station over to Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Fincke and his three crewmates then departed the ISS on Wednesday, leaving Kud-Sverchkov, his fellow cosmonaut Sergei Mikaev, and NASA's Chris Williams as the station's only remaining crew members. While it's not inherently dangerous to run the ISS with a skeleton crew, it will certainly have an impact on day-to-day operations. The ISS program is designed to maintain that level of continuous human presence, but missions don't always go as planned, like in the case of Crew-11's medical evacuation. The space station will now operate with a crew of three until the next team of astronauts, Crew-12, arrives in February. In the meantime, Kud-Sverchkov, Mikaev, and Williams will have to shift their focus toward essential maintenance and space station operations, with less time available for research. They will also refrain from conducting any spacewalks that are not absolutely necessary for safety, as it is nominal to have two crew members perform the EVA while another two provide support from inside the ISS. “Chris is trained to do every task that we would ask him to do on the vehicle,” NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya said during a press conference on January 8. Kshatriya added that ground control teams and Williams's Russian crewmates will also be available to assist him. As long as Crew-12 launches on time, Williams, Kud-Sverchkov, and Mikaev will only be alone on the ISS for about a month. Now that the Crew-11 astronauts have returned, all four of them are likely undergoing routine medical evaluations so that they can begin the reconditioning process. Spending an extended period of time in low gravity results in muscular atrophy, bone density loss, and fluid shifts, which means ISS astronauts have to go through weeks of rehabilitation back on Earth. The ailing astronaut whose condition prompted Crew-11's evacuation will now receive diagnostic attention that wasn't possible on the ISS. NASA has not disclosed which astronaut is affected, nor any specifics about their condition, but has repeatedly said they are stable. NASA officials have expressed utmost confidence in Williams, Kud-Sverchkov, and Mikaev's ability to maintain the space station while they await Crew-12's arrival. Atomic-6's innovative Space Armor tiles will finally be put to the test later this year. "Microbes continue to evolve under microgravity, and they do so in ways that are not always predictable." The Crew-11 mission is coming to an early end so that one of its members can receive medical attention back on Earth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Merge Labs, which defines itself as a “research lab” dedicated to “bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability,” came out of stealth on Thursday with an undisclosed seed round. Merge Labs said it intends to reach these feats noninvasively by developing “entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes” to “transit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound.” The move deepens Altman's competition with Elon Musk, whose startup Neuralink is also developing computer interface chips that allow people who suffer from severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts. Neuralink currently requires invasive surgery for implantation, where a surgical robot removes a small piece of skull and inserts ultra-fine electrode threads into the brain to read neural signals. While there are undoubtedly medical use cases for BCIs, Merge Labs seems more focused on using the technology to fulfill a Silicon Valley fantasy of combining human biology with AI to give us superhuman capabilities. “Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are an important new frontier,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. BCIs will create a natural, human-centered way for anyone to seamlessly interact with AI. Blania and Herbig said in separate social media posts that they would continue their roles at Tools for Humanity. Merge Labs did not confirm whether Alfalo and Norman would maintain their positions at Forest Neurotech, only saying that the company would continue operating and will have a “wonderful working relationship” with Merge. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the co-founders are also Merge Labs' board members. As part of the deal, OpenAI will work with Merge Labs on scientific foundation models and other frontier tools to “accelerate progress.” In its blog post, OpenAI noted that AI will not only help accelerate R&D in bioengineering, neuroscience, and device engineering, but that the interfaces will also benefit from AI operating systems that “can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.” In other words, Merge Labs could function as a remote control for OpenAI's software. Altman has been dreaming about the “merge” — the idea that humans and machines will merge — since at least 2017 when he published a blog post guessing it would happen somewhere between 2025 and 2075. He also speculated that the merge could take many forms, including plugging electrons into our brains or becoming “really close friends with a chatbot.” “Although the merge has already begun, it's going to get a lot weirder,” Altman wrote. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.” TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and Merge Labs for more information. This article has been updated to confirm that Merge Labs' founders will continue work at their respective companies.

A few days ago, AMD added two new SKUs to its Strix Halo lineup at CES 2026. Apart from AI, these Ryzen AI Max+ chips are focused on gaming, which is more of a single-threaded task, so it's once again impressive to see the 392 land among the top performers. Once again, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 itself has a recorded score of 2,781 points, so this result in particular is better. The Geekbench listing also tells us that the score was extracted from an Asus TUF Gaming A14, a device we covered extensively at CES and even awarded "best in show" in the gaming laptops category. This unit, in particular, was rocking 64 GB of on-chip memory running at 8000 MT/s, and boosted up to 5.02 GHz, in line with the listed specs for the chip. Even though the general availability for new Strix Halo machines is Q1 2026, we'll have to wait and see just how much shelf space is populated with these. AMD's other, more mainstream Ryzen AI 400 series was recently listed for a January 22 release in China.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. But there's really no other way to describe the 49-inch Samsung ViewFinity S9 monitor that's $400 off for a limited time at Amazon, now $799 down from $1,199. This ultrawide curved display's 32:9 aspect ratio closely mirrors your own field of view, and the dual QHD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate are truly impressive, but they're also only scratching the surface of this monitor's selling points. The ViewFinity S9 gives back some of the desktop real estate it consumes by doubling as a docking station, with built-in ports for connectivity and charging so you can retire your current hub. Picture-in-picture, picture-by-picture, and split screen modes are easily toggled between for multi-device mastery. The Amazon page calls the Samsung ViewFinity S9 a “business” monitor, and that's totally fair considering how many windows and tabs you can fit into its massive 49-inch field of view. Side-by-side QHD screens packed into one monitor is just begging for multitasking. The Samsung ViewFinity S9 also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 for a wide field of deep blacks and crisp whites to create amazing contrast and detailed shades. That's easy on your eyes whether you have a dozen spreadsheets open at one time or you're in the middle of an intense gaming session. The ViewFinity S9's stand allows you to make fine adjustments in height, tilt, and swivel to create the perfect ergonomic conditions for yourself. And if the sheer size and potential features of the ViewFinity S9 are, understandably, a little intimidating at first, Samsung's Easy Setting Box is an amazingly intuitive and simple command center from which you can partition the screen or toggle between viewing modes to fit your own personal preference. With two HDMI IN ports, one DisplayPort IN, a USB-C, USB-B (upstream), USB/service, LAN, USB 3.0, and headphone jack all built in, the ViewFinity S9 is ready to become the command center for all of your productivity and gaming activities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not just about Greenland or Denmark, after all. Growing up I couldn't imagine people being interrogated by masked armed men for daring to … go for a walk in the US. But that's a thing now.Trump threatened to use the insurrection act just today for other “problems”. Trump threatened to use the insurrection act just today for other “problems”. - Greenland has always been open for companies starting mining resources under fair terms. But while they have a lot of resources Greenland is mostly cliffs and glaciers, worse increasingly melting glaciers and permafrost in cliffs, i.e. increasingly unstable terrain. Wetter so cold that a lot of equipment simply would fail. Maybe you can make some decent profit if you run it like the soviet union ran many things, i.e. forced labor with 10s of thousands of people dying.- The US has one military outpost in Greenland, and AFIK they don't need more to a) protect the US from that direction and b) project power to arctic shipping routes and similar. And realistically if this where to actually need some expansion then any past president probably could have come to an reasonable agreement with Greenland. I mean it's land they don't use and can give for some monetary benefit to one of their closest allies while implicitly gaining some added protection, like why would you say no to that. Except maybe the past Trump presidency as he had already been eroding checks and balances then and that is a red flag for trusting that an ally will stay an ally.> Nobody is going to war over this and [..] wants to save face.This is what people also said about:- Hitler starting WW2 (like seriously he said he would start war, neighbors countries where like: "Nah no way he is just barking")- Same, but after Hitler had already rearmed Germany and sized some boarder territory (he -> war, other countries -> na, no way he actually want to start another large scale war)- heck even after he invaded Poland many still insisted that there is no way he would go beyond that as that would be just supper dump- a Wall being build around west Berlin to prevent people from entering it (there is a famous citate: "Nobody intends to build a wall." (after rumors started that they might want to do that, many people believed them as build a wall would just be too absurd))- during WW2 most Germans (in cities) knew something really bad is happening to Jews, many approached it like "there is no way he is literally killing all of them" (even trough he kinda wrote exactly that in his book)- etc. etc.The point is humans are very very prone to make them-self believe that there is no way some very unpleasant possibilities will happen.Also if person who as repeatedly shown to act unreasonable, sometimes outright despotic, with clear autocratic tendencies, who has shown to be fully fine with civilians suffering or dying as consequence of his actions says "I want to size your country", and has the military might to do so, you should assume that they want do _exactly that_ (at least in the moment when saying that).Historically speaking claiming that "nobody wants that, because it's supper dump" has rarely ended well.Lets hope it wont happen anyway it would likely spiral into WW3 as it's a pretty clear signal for China that the the US has lost most of its allies and Nato is disfunctional and the EU is weaker and more likely to work with or at least unlikely to antagonize them then ever before (in recent times). If not now when else is a better time to size Taiwan. China might even profit from it being destroyed in the war... Really don't give them a reason to believe Nato is weak it will screw over the quality of live/cost of living/etc. of pretty much all western countries for years to come.

Between all of Trump antics, and Russia's invasions, I think they're starting to realize that if you let the bully take the small things you don't especially care about, they're just going to demand bigger things. list of countries offering some form of allied support, so far: CA DE ES FI FR* IS IT NL NO PO SE UK* (*P5 seat) If serious: agree, Russia or China won't take Greenland. Russia can't even expand their presence to Ukraine (not a NATO memeber).3. Because controlling Greenland means whoever has it gets excessive control over the Arctic Sea. And both parties, but especially Russia, do not want a party like the United States to have this amount of control given the Arctic is in their backyard. The US had military bases in Greenland when Soviet nukes had to be delivered with bombers flying over Greenland.When ICBMs became a thing, those bases weren't as important anymore. When ICBMs became a thing, those bases weren't as important anymore. Something you can already see in Venezuela as we speak: The Trump Administration has essentially blocked countries like Russia and Iran to ship oil from Venezuela.If they capture Greenland and can build a big Naval presence there they are in a great position to confiscate every cargo ship destined to Russian harbors in the north, and close off China's trading route in the Arctic aswell. If they capture Greenland and can build a big Naval presence there they are in a great position to confiscate every cargo ship destined to Russian harbors in the north, and close off China's trading route in the Arctic aswell. Denmark would have welcomed a big Naval presence in Greenland. It could have been:    America: give us big Naval base in Greenland or we will annex you! It could have been:    America: give us big Naval base in Greenland or we will annex you! America: can we have a big Naval base in Greenland? It could have been:    America: give us big Naval base in Greenland or we will annex you! America: give us big Naval base in Greenland or we will annex you! Russia and China are just made-up excuses for Trump to do what he wants to do: steal territory, at gunpoint if needed. Even if China or Russia were stupid enough to do that, they could never hold it.Now, perhaps the more interesting question:  How likely does Trump think it is? Even if China or Russia were stupid enough to do that, they could never hold it.Now, perhaps the more interesting question:  How likely does Trump think it is? Even if China or Russia were stupid enough to do that, they could never hold it.Now, perhaps the more interesting question:  How likely does Trump think it is? Now, perhaps the more interesting question:  How likely does Trump think it is? But are there any signs that they have taken over the military? Iran and Venezuela was something they had in mind for decades. But are there any generals itching to test themselves invading Greenland against European military? Rule of law is a thin veneer that this president stripped clean. Now personal interests of the people in power is what matters. Are there any generals with personal interest to invade Greenland and fight Europe? They obviously can develop some but it should take few years at least, right? And if you think it's ridiculous to focus on a random twitter troll to explain this admin, then you don't understand this admin, because impressing these guys (and this guy in particular) is largely all they do. An EU arsenal would be a typical retaliatory-strike doctrine. This is more like being stabbed while sleeping over at your best friend's house. You are not sure how it's relevant the main pillar of NATO is openly talking about military action against one of the founding members of NATO?It's relevant since everything in your life right now if you live in any Western country is reliant on this partnership since the end of WW2. It's relevant since everything in your life right now if you live in any Western country is reliant on this partnership since the end of WW2. Imagine Afghanistan but against a modern, professional army and with the weather trying to kill you.Which isn't to say that it would be impossible, but certainly it would cost more in terms of casualties and money than most Americans realise. Which isn't to say that it would be impossible, but certainly it would cost more in terms of casualties and money than most Americans realise. How can you be so certain with that diaper-filler in chief?Deploying troops looks like an attempt to dissuade invasion by highlighting that the optics of US troops capturing (hopefully not shooting at) NATO troops would be real bad... I don't think there's much doubt about a US success if it came to that.</p>

Deep blacks and rich color with the IPS Black panel Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. I haven't had many HP portable monitors come across my desk over the years, but the company's latest offering definitely makes a lasting impression. The new HP Series 5 Pro 514PN hits all the right notes with a thin-and-light 14-inch form factor, an aluminum-alloy chassis, and an IPS Black panel (the first I've seen on a portable monitor) that delivers brilliant color and contrast. In a segment where OEMs are quickly racing to release portable monitors that focus primarily on value (with some dipping into the $50 range), the Series 5 Pro is a more premium choice, priced at $299. The 514PN has a very clean design, with a svelte aluminum-alloy chassis measuring 12.62 x 8.21 x 0.35 inches and weighing 1.4 pounds. There's a built-in kickstand that takes up roughly half of the display's back panel. There are two USB-C ports on the monitor, supporting 65-watt Power Delivery (which I verified worked perfectly with an HP OmniBook X) and DisplayPort 1.2 connectivity. Speaking of pack-ins, a grey magnetic cover is included to help protect the display when traveling. It's not as all-encompassing as some of the more substantial pouches that protect the entire monitor, but it's better than no protection at all. Perhaps HP was just trying to minimize the 514PN's size profile for travel, but a full pouch/case would be a better solution to protect this pricey accessory. There aren't really any other major standouts on the 514PN, aside from dedicated + and – buttons for brightness control and a power button situated directly below. The only mismatch is that my OmniBook X has a glossy display, while the 514PN has an anti-reflective coating. Curiously, the 514PN doesn't feature built-in speakers or HDMI connectivity, which are notable omissions for a portable monitor sold through HP's business solutions division. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. At first glance, it might appear that the 514PN doesn't have an on-screen display (OSD). The color modes include: Warm, Neutral, Cool, Native, Night, HP Enhance+, and Custom RGB. IPS panels used in portable monitors (and laptops) typically have an average contrast ratio of 1,000:1, but the 514PN doubles that metric to 2,000:1. In practice, you will see darker blacks (instead of skewing toward gray) and better color accuracy. Our instrumented testing showed that the 514PN tended to display colors as a bit oversaturated, covering 193.9 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 137.3 percent of sRGB. The numbers that the 514PN put up were more in line with what we'd see in an OLED panel. I watched a few movie trailers on the 514PN and was amazed at the deep black levels and rich colors. I watched the trailer for Crime 101 and came away impressed by how well the monitor resolved darkened scenes without appearing like a sea of dark greys (much of the trailer shows action taking place at night). I appreciated the extra horizontal and vertical resolution when working on spreadsheets, as most portable monitors – especially the budget models – have a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 (or 1920 x 1200). It might not be the thinnest or lightest in its class, but it's well-built and looks great next to your laptop. In addition, the IPS Black panel is gorgeous, with deep blacks and vibrant colors. In addition, the two USB-C ports do support 65-watt Power Delivery, allowing you to power your laptop through the 514PN, cutting down on cable clutter. However, you won't find HDMI connectivity here, nor are there integrated speakers. The tougher competition comes from the ViewSonic TD1656-2K, which also features a 1600p display and 65-watt PD, but crams in touch support, macOS support, and so-so speakers.

Oracle is facing a class action lawsuit from a group of disgruntled bondholders who claim they lost money after the company misled them over how much money it needed to borrow to finance its AI infrastructure commitments. Specifically, they say the company's claim that it "may" need to borrow more money was false and misleading, because it was already planning to issue another set of bonds. However, investors were surprised when the company released another set of bonds worth $38 billion almost two months later. Because of this, the original series of bonds and notes have fallen in value and is now trading like debt from companies with lower ratings. However, they argue that Oracle already knew at this point that it was going to issue another, much larger, loan to fund its expansion. When the company launched its initial bond drive for $18 billion in September, the demand was so high that it was four times oversubscribed. But just three months later, investors are now reportedly sitting on $1.3 billion in paper losses. And even though S&P and Moody's still rate Oracle as investment grade, its BBB or Baa2 rating places it just a couple of notches above junk rating. The massive AI buildout requires billions, if not trillions, of dollars in investment. This is likely not a problem for tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, who have massive war chests and can likely afford to keep pouring money into the infrastructure without breaking a sweat. However, other smaller companies will probably require additional funding — either through bonds and notes, private equity, selling shares, or a mixture of these. More than that, there's also the intricate web of investments, projects, sales, and loans that multiple AI companies have built, so a failure of just one of the companies involved in it could mean a complete collapse for the entire system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google designed the wireless protocol known as Fast Pair to optimize for ultra-convenient connections: It lets users connect their Bluetooth gadgets with Android and ChromeOS devices in a single tap. The result is an enormous collection of Fast Pair-compatible audio devices that allow any spy or stalker to take control of speakers and microphones, or in some cases track an unwitting target's location—even if the victim is an iPhone user who has never owned a Google product. Today, security researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group are revealing a collection of vulnerabilities they found in 17 audio accessories that use Google's Fast Pair protocol and are sold by 10 different companies: Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech, and Google itself. The hacking techniques the researchers demonstrated, which they're collectively calling WhisperPair, would allow anyone within Bluetooth range of those devices—close to 50 feet in their testing—to silently pair with audio peripherals and hijack them. Worse yet, certain devices sold by Google and Sony that are compatible with Google's device geolocation tracking feature, Find Hub, could also be exploited to allow stealthy, high-resolution stalking. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,” says KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta. “Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. “The attacker now owns this device,” adds researcher Nikola Antonijević, “and can basically do whatever he wants with it.” Since the researchers first disclosed their work to the company in August, they say, Google appears to have alerted at least some of the vendors of vulnerable devices, many of whom have made security updates available. However, given that very few consumers ever think about updating the software of internet-of-things devices like headphones, earbuds, or speakers, the KU Leuven researchers warn that the WhisperPair vulnerabilities may still persist in vulnerable accessories for months or years to come. In most cases, applying those updates requires installing a manufacturer app on a phone or computer—a step most users never take and often aren't even aware is necessary. “If you don't have the app of Sony, then you'll never know that there's a software update for your Sony headphones,” says KU Leuven researcher Seppe Wyns. “We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting,” the spokesperson writes. Google also noted that it's pushed out fixes for its own vulnerable audio accessories and an update to Find Hub in Android that the company says prevents rogue actors from using WhisperPair to track victims. Within hours of Google informing the researchers about that fix, however, they told WIRED that they had found a bypass for the patch and were still able to carry out their Find Hub tracking technique. Google didn't immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment on the researchers' bypass of its patch. As for Google's statement that it hadn't seen exploitation of the WhisperPair vulnerability in the wild, the researchers note that Google would have no way to observe audio accessory hijacking that didn't involve Google devices. Xiaomi responded in a statement that it “has been in communication with Google and other relevant parties and is working with suppliers to roll out [over-the-air] updates” to its Redmi brand of earbuds. JBL, which is owned by Harman Audio, said in a statement that “Google has advised JBL about potential security vulnerabilities that could impact devices including headphones and speakers. Given that the researchers didn't tell anyone about their findings until August, however, they suggest that Jabra may be confusing their work with unrelated findings from June. Logitech said it has “integrated a firmware patch for upcoming production units,” and points out that its affected device, the Wonderboom 4 speaker, doesn't have a microphone that could be used for eavesdropping. Marshall, Nothing, and Sony didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment. Most fundamentally, Google's specification for Fast Pair devices states that they shouldn't be able to pair with a new computer or phone while already paired. They note, too, that in some cases, this ID is shared by the device when a computer or phone attempts to pair with it. And in addition to both of these methods of obtaining the right Model ID for a target device, the researchers also found that they could query a publicly available Google API for every possible Model ID and determine them for all devices. In their experiments, the KU Leuven team used a low-cost Raspberry Pi 4 minicomputer to test their technique, attempting to pair with 25 different already-paired Fast Pair devices from 16 different vendors, and found that the majority of the devices and vendors they tested were vulnerable. The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds and five models of Sony earbuds and headphones they tested also suffered from a distinct, disturbing security issue. If the devices weren't previously linked to a Google account—say, because they were used only with an iPhone—then a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the target accessory, but also link it to their Google account. With that tracking technique, the victim might at some point get a smartphone notification that a Find Hub device was tracking them, thanks to safety features designed by Google and Apple to prevent Find Hub devices from being used to follow an unwitting victim. But any victim who followed up on the alert would see that Google or Apple was warning them that it was their own device tracking them and likely assume the alert was just a glitch, the researchers argue. “There's no way to turn Fast Pair off, even if you'll never use it,” says Wyns. The WhisperPair vulnerabilities seem to have emerged from a complex and interrelated set of problems. The researchers point out that it is common for both peripherals manufacturers and chipmakers to make mistakes in implementing the Fast Pair technical standard. Google offers a Validator App through the Play Store that vendors have to run as part of getting their products certified to use Fast Pair. According to its description, the app “validates that Fast Pair has been properly implemented on a Bluetooth device,” producing reports on whether a product has passed or failed an evaluation of its Fast Pair implementation. The researchers point out that all of the devices they tested in their work had their Fast Pair implementation certified by Google. On top of this, certified Fast Pass devices then go through testing in labs Google selects that review pass reports and then directly evaluate physical device samples before large-scale manufacturing to confirm that they align with the Fast Pair standard. Google says that the Fast Pair specification provided clear requirements and that the Validator App was designed mainly as a supportive tool for manufacturers to test core functionality. For now, Google and many device manufacturers have software updates ready to fix the specific vulnerabilities. But installations of those patches are likely to be inconsistent, as it almost always is in internet-of-things security. The researchers urge all users to update their vulnerable accessories, and they point users to a website they created that provides a searchable list of devices affected by WhisperPair. For that matter, they say that everyone should use WhisperPair as a more general reminder to update all of their internet-of-things devices. The broader message of their research, they say, is that device manufacturers need to prioritize security when adding ease-of-use features. But in pursuit of convenience, we should not neglect security.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I like them in the winter because they help the air feel less stale when I can't crack my windows open. We've hand-tested multiple models for our air purifier buying guide, and Coway's have been a consistent favorite. The brand's popular design-forward Airmega line is discounted right now up to 30 percent off—this is close to what they ran for Black Friday. The sale ends January 30, so if you regret not buying an air purifier while they were on sale during the holidays, this is your chance. This is the best price we've seen since Black Friday (and it comes within $30 of that cost), and it usually doesn't fall cheaper than it is right now outside of seasonal shopping events. It can clean a room up to 361 square feet, exchanging the air at 4.8 times per hour. We recommend running it in a slightly smaller room to allow for lower noise levels. It has a built-in timer allowing for automatic shutoff after one, four, or eight hours, and there's an Eco Mode that'll turn it off after 30 minutes without detected pollution. We like this purifier's color-coded light, which shows blue for clean air and purple or red for different levels of pollutants based on its built-in air sensor. That sensor can also automatically adjust the Mighty's fan speed. The whole device is easy to port around, thanks to its incorporated back handle, replacement filters are inexpensive (WIRED editor Kat Merck has a Mighty and buys these), and it has a three-year warranty. This big ol' air purifier is the most effective option we tested for homes with high ceilings. The design is a little Dune-y, but it can clean the air four times per hour in a 1,000-square-foot space if you're running it at its highest setting. It's also pretty quiet, around 50 decibels at its loudest, and there's a control panel lock to help prevent accidental setting changes. It has Coway's air quality indicator light where blue is good and red is bad, so it's a handy way to monitor your air quality at a glance. It has three different airflow speeds and an auto mode that'll adjust fan speed as needed. The machine is heavy at 50 pounds, but it has built-in wheels and handles for easier maneuvering, plus a solid five-year warranty. This tabletop model received an honorable mention in our air purifier buying guide—also see our in-depth review here—but it's still a decent pick for small spaces. But it's also about the size of a roll of paper towels, and the large indicator light on top is easy to spot from across a room.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI's CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, shared the news in a memo to staff this afternoon. Two narratives are already forming about what prompted the departures. A source close to Thinking Machines alleged that Zoph had shared confidential company information with competitors. According to the memo from Simo, Zoph told Thinking Machines CEO Mira Murati on Monday he was considering leaving. Simo went on to write that OpenAI doesn't share the same concerns about Zoph as Murati. The personnel shake-up is a major win for OpenAI, which recently lost its VP of research, Jerry Tworek. A third Thinking Machines staffer, Sam Schoenholz, is also rejoining OpenAI, per the company's announcement. The departures are a blow to Thinking Machines, which also lost another co-founder, Andrew Tulloch, in November when he took a new job at Meta. In a post on X, Murati confirmed Zoph's depature and said that Soumith Chintala will replace him as the startup's chief technology officer. Zoph and Metz left OpenAI in late 2024 to start Thinking Machines with Murati, the ChatGPT maker's former chief technology officer. Zoph was previously OpenAI's vice president of post-training, where he led teams that made final improvements to AI models before they were deployed into products like ChatGPT and OpenAI's API. Metz worked at OpenAI for two years during his first stint at the company and contributed to projects like ChatGPT and the o1 AI reasoning model. The hiring announcement timeline was accelerated, she said, so they still have to work out some details about their roles. Thinking Machines Lab is one of several well-funded AI startups led by former top OpenAI researchers, reflecting the incredible appetite among investors to cash in on the AI race. The startup's main product today is called Tinker, which allows developers to customize AI models on their own datasets.
