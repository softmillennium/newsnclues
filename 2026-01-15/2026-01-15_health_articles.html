Disclosure: Karl D'Silva, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Most patients with CLL are considered asymptomatic. However, it is estimated that up to 90% of patients with CLL have enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination. Patients might also experience other symptoms such as recurring infections, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, enlarged liver or spleen, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite or early satiety, and night sweats; however, these are generally not as common as enlarged lymph nodes. This is usually alongside characteristic leukemia cell blood smear findings such as small, mature lymphocytes featuring a narrow cytoplasm border, dense nucleus with “partially aggregated” chromatin, and smudge cells as cell debris. Large cytotoxic lymphocytes from T cells are more associated with granular lymphocytic Leukemia. Cells with limited cytoplasm and unevenly cleaved nuclei are most indicative of mantle cell lymphoma, though this can be present in atypical CLL cases. Prolymphocytes exceeding half of blood lymphocytes is most often linked to B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Flow cytometry, along with immunophenotyping of peripheral blood, is the most valuable diagnostic test for CLL, and it is used to diagnose/confirm this disease. Bone marrow biopsy and ultrasonography of the liver and spleen can be implemented (depending on patient presentation) and helpful during diagnosis, but they alone are not typically used to initially diagnose CLL. According to the modified RAI classification, lymphocytosis alone with leukemia cells in blood or marrow is considered low-risk CLL. Data indicate that expression of CD20 is usually dim in typical CLL, whereas CD20 expression is usually bright in mantle cell lymphoma. CD23 expression is strongly linked to typical CLL; mantle cell lymphoma usually does not express CD23. Learn more about the differential diagnosis of CLL.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research-backed strategy produces highly homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates (gsADCs) with consistent DAR and tumor suppression lasting over 50 days after a single dose A new white paper from BioDlink, From Complexity to Consistency: How CDMOs Can Unlock One-Step, High-Yield and Homogeneous ADC Manufacturing for Next-Gen Oncology, reveals an advancement in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) manufacturing - achieving over 95% conjugation yield in under one hour using a one-step glycoengineering strategy. The approach, based on research by Dr. Wei Huang et al., significantly reduces process complexity, manufacturing time, and analytical burden while enhancing product consistency and therapeutic performance. With more than 210 ADCs in global clinical development, the field is reaching an inflection point where manufacturing limitations threaten to stall progress. Traditional conjugation processes involve multi-step reactions that span several days and often yield heterogeneous products with inconsistent drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), typically ranging from 0 to 8. This variability increases regulatory uncertainty and risks delays in clinical advancement. High-Yield Conjugation in Record Time: The one-step LacNAc-based glycoengineering platform highlighted in this white paper enables over 95% conjugation yield in under one hour, drastically reducing manufacturing time compared to conventional multi-step ADC workflows. Consistent Product Quality and Stability: The platform produces highly homogeneous gsADCs with a defined DAR of 2, verified through advanced analytics, and maintains low aggregation rates (10.2–14.6%) under stress conditions  -  supporting tighter CQA control and regulatory confidence. Extended Therapeutic Response: In vivo studies show that a single dose of gsADCs delivers tumor suppression lasting over 50 days, outperforming heterogeneous ADC formats with higher DARs, offering stronger and longer efficacy in HER2-positive cancer models. Synthesis of glycosite-specific ADCs using LacNAc-based substrates As a leading global CDMO, BioDlink empowers biotech innovators through advanced technology platforms and strategic partnerships designed to accelerate and de-risk complex biologics development. Based on the core GL-DisacLink® platform technology developed by the Wei Huang team, BioDlink has achieved major breakthroughs in process scale-up, enabling high-yield, site-specific ADC conjugation in a single enzymatic step. Combined with its proprietary BDKcell™ cell line development system - capable of delivering stable clones in just 14 weeks - BioDlink offers a fully integrated solution that enhances product uniformity, reduces off-target effects, and streamlines workflows. These innovations allow BioDlink to complete ADC development from DNA synthesis to toxicology-ready material in as little as 7 months and file full IND applications within 11 months. For monoclonal antibodies, the timelines are even faster at 6 and 10 months, respectively. In a globally competitive landscape, BioDlink focuses not on being the lowest-cost provider, but on delivering value through speed, quality, and reliability - building long-term, win-win partnerships that advance next-generation therapies to market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Tau protein, which has also been linked to many other neurodegenerative diseases, is unstructured in its normal state, but in the pathological state it consists of a well-ordered rigid core surrounded by floppy segments. These disordered segments form a "fuzzy coat" that helps determine how Tau interacts with other molecules. MIT chemists have now shown, for the first time, they can use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to decipher the structure of this fuzzy coat. They hope their findings will aid efforts to develop drugs that interfere with Tau buildup in the brain. If you want to disaggregate these Tau fibrils with small-molecule drugs, then these drugs have to penetrate this fuzzy coat. That would be an important future endeavor." Former MIT postdoc Aurelio Dregni is also an author of the paper. In a healthy brain, Tau proteins help to stabilize microtubules, which give cells their structure. However, when Tau proteins become misfolded or otherwise altered, they form clumps that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia. This fuzzy coat surrounds a rigid inner core that is made from folded protein strands known as beta sheets. Until now, most researchers had overlooked Tau's fuzzy coat and focused on the rigid core of the fibrils because those disordered segments change their structures so often that standard structure characterization techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography can't capture them. In one experiment, they were able to magnetize protons within the most rigid amino acids, then measure how long it took for the magnetization to be transferred to the mobile amino acids. This allowed them to track the magnetization as it traveled from rigid regions to floppy segments, and vice versa. "We have now developed an NMR-based technology to examine the fuzzy coat of a full-length Tau fibril, allowing us to capture both the dynamic regions and the rigid core," Hong says. Based on their measurements of protein dynamics, the researchers found that these segments fell into three categories. Instead, they are highly mobile, indicating that these positively charged proline-rich regions are repelled by the positive charges of the amino acids that form the rigid core. This structural model gives insight into how Tau proteins form tangles in the brain, Hong says. Similar to how prions trigger healthy proteins to misfold in the brain, it is believed that misfolded Tau proteins latch onto normal Tau proteins and act as a template that induces them to adopt the abnormal structure. In principle, these normal Tau proteins could add to the ends of existing short filaments or pile onto the sides. The researchers now plan to explore whether they can stimulate normal Tau proteins to assemble into the type of fibrils seen in Alzheimer's disease, using misfolded Tau proteins from Alzheimer's patients as a template.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children born to mothers who consume a high-fat, high-sugar diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding face a higher risk of developing fatty liver disease later in life. New research from the University of Oklahoma suggests that risk may be reduced: A study found that supplementing pregnant and lactating mice with a naturally occurring compound produced by healthy gut bacteria significantly lowered rates of fatty liver disease in their offspring as they aged. The compound, called indole, is naturally made by healthy gut bacteria when they break down tryptophan, an amino acid found in foods such as turkey and nuts. The findings further a promising line of research into preventing a type of fatty liver disease known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). While MASLD affects both adults and children, it tends to progress more rapidly in children and is strongly linked with diabetes. The disease in children is silent and typically isn't discovered until a parent seeks help for their child for liver-related symptoms." To test that idea, they fed female mice a high-fat, high-sugar (Western-style) diet during pregnancy and lactation. Some of the mice were also given indole. After weaning, the offspring were raised on a normal diet before later being fed a Western-style diet to prompt the development of fatty liver disease. "Because offspring inherit their microbiome from their mother, a poor maternal diet can shape the infant's microbiome in harmful ways," Friedman said. Among offspring whose mothers received indole, researchers observed several encouraging outcomes. These mice maintained healthier livers, gained less weight, had lower blood sugar levels and smaller fat cells, even after exposure to a Western-style diet later in life. Researchers also saw activation of a protective gut pathway involving the acyl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Perhaps most notably, when gut bacteria from these protected offspring were transferred to other mice that had not been given indole, those mice also showed reduced liver damage – further evidence that the microbiome itself plays a key role in protection. Except for weight loss, there currently are no approved drugs for the treatment of pediatric MASLD once it takes hold. "That would be far better than trying to reverse the disease once it has already progressed." Reprogramming offspring liver health: maternal indole supplementation as a preventive strategy against MASLD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UF Health Cancer Institute researchers have discovered a small compound produced naturally by gut bacteria that doubled the response to lung cancer immunotherapy treatment in mice and can now be made into a drug for testing in humans. The findings, published Dec. 19 in Cell Reports Medicine, could have widespread clinical impact as a combination therapy with commonly used immunotherapy treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors, which release the brakes on a patient's own immune system to target their cancer. "Across all cancers, only about 20% of patients who receive immune checkpoint inhibitors respond to them - 80% do not - so anything that could boost responsiveness is a blockbuster drug," said Rachel Newsome, Ph.D., a postdoctoral associate in the lab of Christian Jobin, Ph.D., and the study's first author. "We envision this small molecule drug could be given at the same time or before immune checkpoint therapy and boost patient responsiveness by 50% without adding any invasive treatment. Our goal is to naturally boost the activity of immunotherapy, so more people have a positive effect from treatment. We want to empty those cancer center parking lots that are so full right now." The new findings that a drug can be made from a natural molecule in the microbiome represent a groundbreaking expansion of the field of microbiome science. "We created a pipeline to harvest the therapeutic potential of the microbiota through specific steps to get to an active molecule," said Jobin, the Gatorade Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the UF College of Medicine and co-leader of the UF Health Cancer Institute's Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program. In 2018, funding from the Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance and a collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center gave Jobin's lab access to feces from patients enrolled in a clinical trial testing immune checkpoint inhibitors. When researchers transplanted feces from humans who responded to immunotherapy into mice that did not, the mice responded to the treatment. The discovery was pivotal: It showed that the gut microbiota plays a key role in determining responses to immunotherapy. Newsome identified six bacterial strains out of more than 180 that, when given to mice with lung tumors, boosted their response to immunotherapy. But fecal transplants or oral bacteria administration are difficult to implement on a large scale as therapeutics in humans. From these bacteria, researchers identified a single metabolite, called Bac429, that stimulated an immune response like the six bacteria. When we injected Bac429 into the tumors of mice with highly nonresponsive lung cancer, they had 50% less tumor growth after immunotherapy. Newsome and Jobin are developing drug derivatives of the natural Bac429. They're also working to uncover the exact mechanism. "One could envision having this molecule attached to an antibody or a lipid nanoparticle like those being pioneered at UF." Jobin's lab is also researching how diet, and specifically carbohydrate intake, might affect the molecule's function. UF is pursuing multiple patent applications related to Newsome and Jobin's work on these microbial-derived molecules. Newsome and Jobin have also formed Bebi Therapeutics Inc., a biotech company born as a "spinout" from UF in which Jobin and Newsome hold interest. Microbial-derived immunostimulatory small molecule augments anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Griffith University researchers may have unlocked the secret to treating sepsis, with a Phase II clinical trial in China successfully concluding with promising results. STC3141 was administered as an infusion via a cannula and counteracted a significant biological molecule release phenomenon which occurred in the body during the course of sepsis. The small-molecule experimental drug was a carbohydrate-based molecule and could treat sepsis by reversing organ damage. Sepsis was known to affect millions of hospitalised patients across the world each year and occurred when the body's immune response to an infection attacked and injured its own tissues and organs. When sepsis is not recognised early and managed promptly, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death." The trial, conducted by Grand Pharmaceutical Group Limited (Grand Pharma), involved 180 patients with sepsis, one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. "It's hoped we could see the treatment reach the market in a handful years, potentially saving millions of lives," he said. Executive Director of the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, Professor Paul Clarke, said: "I am thrilled to see the results of the trial which ultimately aims to save lives."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An AI-guided platform at Penn Medicine allows clinicians to quickly and easily unearth pertinent information from patients' electronic health records that otherwise might have been difficult to find. Patients are complex, so doctors have a lot of homework to do for every person they see. Everyone, from an infant to a centenarian, has a unique medical history that constantly grows with wide-ranging data from things like test results, scans, family histories, prescriptions, treatments, and referrals, all documented and integrated over time in their health records. What led a patient to stepping into their doctor's office could be a combination of all, some, or none of that data. Enter Chart Hero, a new generative artificial intelligence-powered, chat-based system created at Penn Medicine's Center for Health Care Transformation and Innovation (CHTI) in partnership with the Penn Medicine Data and Technology Solutions (DTS) team and clinical leaders in the health system. Clinicians can ask Chart Hero, which appears like a sidebar in the electronic health record, to help them automatically gather, arrange, synthesize, and assist in the interpretation of all the pertinent information they'd need for a patient they're going to see, and do it in a minute or two with a couple simple queries instead of digging through piles of data in multiple areas of the electronic health record. "It saves so much time that I would spend very inefficiently searching for an answer to my questions," said Tessa Cook, MD, PhD, an associate professor of Radiology and vice chair of Practice Transformation in that department. "There was a day when it wasn't available, and I thought, 'I have to figure all of this out by myself? Yevgeniy "Eugene" Gitelman, MD, a clinical associate professor of Hospital Medicine, head of custom software at CHTI and associate chief health information officer, began working on Chart Hero late last year. "A doctor reached out to me saying he had to summarize all of these notes and it was a big pain," Gitelman said. "There's just so much data in the charts, and everyone was saying 'Why don't we make it as easy as ChatGPT to find information?'" What Gitelman and his colleagues created is effectively a conversational AI chat that has considerable search abilities while also safeguarding patient information to the exacting standards of HIPAA privacy laws. "There's so much documentation happening across different teams, all these different people looking at the same things, but we haven't been easily able to make use of the work that everyone has done," Gitelman said. That includes making it "smart" enough to determine when someone might be confused. When patients have multiple overlapping or similar conditions, the ability to sort through detailed information is also extremely valuable. "If a clinician asks, 'What is this patient's oncologic history,' it can break things apart and clarify that the patient has something like two separate cancers and, 'Here is the course and treatment for each one, separately,'" Gitelman said. Other health systems have taken swings at something similar, but Penn Medicine's may be the most comprehensive, functional tool in large part due to a specific advantage it has-a unique system that covers a lot of ground and people across the health system. With data from populations that range from Lancaster through Chester Counties, into Philadelphia, and up north to Princeton and Doylestown, with practices dotted in all the areas in between, the data it was built on is diverse and complex. Chart Hero is built on data that's diverse and extensive. And when you combine our team's experience with that data advantage, an EHR-embedded product like Chart Hero is going to deliver deeper, more contextualized insights." To this point, much of the artificial intelligence employed in medicine has been in the realm of interpreting and assisting with radiology results-catching hard-to-see tumors on CT scans, offering better measurements of organs on MRIs to track disease progression, and the like. Much of the AI employed in the realm of large language models also "lacks clinical context," Cook said, not understanding how different medical conditions fit together or how they influence each other. But Cook, the radiologist, said Chart Hero is something different. "I can just type, 'Why is the patient here for a cardiac MRI?' Because sometimes it's not obvious from their chart or recent imaging, but it'll sure look like they did on their imaging today, and that's important to know," Cook said. "And Chart Hero can figure that out for me right away. Cook estimated that, some days, using Chart Hero saves her up to two hours that would have otherwise been spent work on her patients' charts Adusumalli also saw time savings and values Chart Hero's speed. Otherwise, the nurse I work with would need 30 minutes to pull relevant information, and then I'd be clicking through three or four different tabs, and it'd take me 10 times the amount of work to get what Chart Hero pulled for me." The tool fits into Penn Medicine's wider strategic effort to use technology to simplify patient care and create more time for meaningful patient interactions. As such, Chart Hero slots in comfortably with other initiatives like ambient listening, the AI scribe technology more than 1,200 providers are using across Penn Medicine to automatically take notes during patient visits-so they can focus on listening, not typing. "Imagine you're a clinician, seeing a new patient: You want to get up to speed, so you can use Chart Hero to generate a summary, and then that is effectively the seed for the visit," Adusumalli said. Chart Hero is not yet employed across the entire health system, but its users are growing. As they work to expand its use, the development team is also working carefully to smooth out some of the challenges they've encountered with implementation. Like many AI systems, there is risk of hallucination, where an AI generates false, incorrect, or misleading information that it presents as fact. "A secondary AI audit is also being tested to improve our tool's accuracy." They view Chart Hero as an ongoing project, and human review remains a critical safeguard in validating outputs. "We're not just providing tech and walking away," said Lauren Hahn, MBA, senior director of product management at CHTI. "[We ask:] How do we introduce this into clinicians' workflows, as well as potentially redesign care delivery, in a way that is human-centered and easy to approach?" She said that the multidisciplinary expertise of the team developing this, along with their experience scaling projects, is important because they know what it takes to make an enduring solution, rather than a one-off. "Technology only matters if people are willing to use it and use it over time," said Raina Merchant, MD, MSHP, executive director of CHTI and chief transformation officer of Penn Medicine. "With Chart Hero, our goal isn't just accuracy; it's creating something clinicians reach for because it makes their day easier and helps them take better care of patients.
