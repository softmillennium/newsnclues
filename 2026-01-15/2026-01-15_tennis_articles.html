In the final set, Mboko did not face a break point while claiming half of her return points to pull away from the reigning Australian Open title holder.“She hits a pretty strong ball, and all I was thinking in that moment was just to try to stay low and try to redirect as much as I could, and try to either make her miss first or have a good opportunity to take control,” Mboko assessed during a press conference Thursday.The world No. 17, who captured her maiden WTA title on home soil last August at the 1000-level event in Montreal, is seeking her third trophy following a winning conclusion to 2025 in Hong Kong. 17, who captured her maiden WTA title on home soil last August at the 1000-level event in Montreal, is seeking her third trophy following a winning conclusion to 2025 in Hong Kong. 17, who captured her maiden WTA title on home soil last August at the 1000-level event in Montreal, is seeking her third trophy following a winning conclusion to 2025 in Hong Kong. At this time a year ago, Mboko was ranked No. 337.“I kind of had to adjust and adapt very quickly from playing ITFs to suddenly playing on the WTA tour full. Often playing top players, you have to get used to all of that,” reflected Mboko.“So I'm glad I can kind of get a deep run in this tournament, and try to set the tone for the start of this year.”Third-seeded Mirra Andreeva faces her former doubles partner Diana Shnaider in the other semifinal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wild card Taylah Preston scored the first Top 30 win of her career and advanced to her first tour-level semifinal with a straight-sets upset of top seed Emma Raducanu at the Hobart International. Australian wild card Taylah Preston thrilled her home fans at the Hobart International by outhitting No. 204, had only won one tour-level match prior to this week -- at San Diego 2024 -- but backed up her earlier upsets of No. 5 seed Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Rebecca Sramkova to notch her first career Top 30 victory over Raducanu, ranked No. "I don't really know what to say," said Preston after slamming a forehand winner to seal her first match point. "I'm just really happy that I'm through to the next round and get to play here again in front of everyone." Preston's success in Hobart comes after several months of rebuilding her form on the ITF World Tennis Tour. The San Diego win two years ago, over Magdalena Frech, had seemed to presage a breakthrough that year. At the age of 18, Preston also stretched Caroline Garcia to three sets in Adelaide, reached her first WTA 125 final in Puerto Vallarta and rose to a career high of No. But by last September, she had fallen back to No. Against Raducanu, Preston found a top-notch level of clean, aggressive ball-striking, firing 21 winners to the former US Open champion's nine. On Wednesday, Raducanu had been rejuvenated by an overnight postponement, coming from 4-2 down in the second set to defeat Camila Osorio in her first-round match. But following a lengthy rain delay at 2-1 to Preston on Thursday, the opposite occurred. On resumption, Raducanu leaked forehand errors to drop serve twice, while Preston notched two love holds. The highest-quality passage of play saw Raducanu and Preston exchange two more service breaks. But when Raducanu served to stay in the match down 5-4, she let a 40-0 lead slip. Another forehand error gave Preston match point, which she converted with relish. The home player will bid to keep her fairytale run going against either No. 8 seed Magda Linette 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-2 in a marathon contest that ended after midnight local time. Jovic first served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, only for Linette to make a valiant comeback and force a decider. Jovic, 18, advances to her second semifinal in as many weeks, having lost to eventual champion Elina Svitolina at that stage in Auckland. Earlier, Elisabetta Cocciaretto looked unstoppable for long stretches of her Hobart quarterfinal against Anna Bondar. Except for the four times Mother Nature forced play to stop, including once before the match even began on an overcast Thursday afternoon. Fittingly, four was also the number of games Bondar managed to win, as Cocciaretto overpowered her from start to finish in a 6-2, 6-2 victory that concluded nearly three hours past its scheduled start time. She is now 9-3 at the event in her career. And as frustrating as Thursday's delays were for fans, they were nothing compared to the chaos that was their previous encounter. There was no such drama this time around, as Cocciaretto broke Bondar in the opening game as part of a 4-0 start. The rest of the set was choppy, with three rain delays in quick succession, but she eventually closed it out in two hours despite only 40 minutes of on-court action. She ended the match with 24 winners and 13 unforced errors, while breaking Bondar four times, twice in each set. Wild card Taylah Preston scored the first Top 30 win of her career and advanced to her first tour-level semifinal with a straight-sets upset of top seed Emma Raducanu at the Hobart International.</p>

The 26-year-old Spaniard carved a series of stunning angles and winners to defeat reigning Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot 7-6(4), 6-2. “I knew his serve was amazing,” Davidovich Fokina said of Vacherot, who hit 15 aces according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I tried my best to return his serve… It was like playing against [John] Isner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four previous Australian Open champions are in the 2026 field. Eleven Grand Slam winners are in the mix, including four previous Australian Open champions. Among them, Madison Keys returns to Melbourne Park after winning her first Grand Slam last year. She defeated Aryna Sabalenka, who has reached the final each of the past three editions, and won titles in 2023 and 2024. This will be their first meeting against one another. [29] Iva Jovic vs. Katie Volynets: Entering her first Grand Slam as a seeded player, Jovic looks build off her strong 2025 season where she won a WTA 500 title in Guadalajara. Last week, she reached the semifinals in Auckland, falling to eventual champion Elina Svitolina. Our top 8 for #AO26 👀Will one of them take home the crown? [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [20] Marta Kostyuk: We saw this matchup recently in the Brisbane International final, where Sabalenka won 6-4, 6-3 to win back-to-back titles in Queensland. If Brisbane is any indicator, then the way both players performed throughout the tournament could see this be a top quarterfinal matchup. Kostyuk upset Amanda Anisimova, Mirra Andreeva and Jessica Pegula en route to the Brisbane final, while Sabalenka dominated the field with all straight-set victories. Kostyuk has only made on Grand Slam quarterfinal -- the 2024 Australian Open. Barbora Krejcikova vs. [23] Diana Shnaider: Two-time Grand Slam champion Krejcikova looks to climb her way back into the form she once had as former World No. 2, and will face Shnaider to begin her Australian Open campaign. Shnaider has performed well in Adelaide with wins over Katerina Siniakova and 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. This will be their first matchup on the WTA Tour. Olga Danilovic vs. [WC] Venus Williams: Williams, seven-time Grand Slam champion and two-time finalist at the Australian Open, will make her return to Melbourne Park for the first time in five years. Other notable first-round matches: [12] Elina Svitolina vs. Cristina Bucsa; Magda Linette vs. [15] Emma Navarro; [3] Coco Gauff vs. Kamilla Rakhimova; Donna Vekic vs. [8] Mirra Andreeva [3] Coco Gauff vs. [8] Mirra Andreeva: This would be a spectacular quarterfinal matchup, featuring two of the sport's younger stars. The two haven't played in a Grand Slam since 2023, but last played in Madrid last May, a tournament Gauff ultimately won. Keys' path back to Grand Slam glory could feature Jessica Pegula in the Round of 16 and Amanda Anisimova in the quarterfinals. Other notable first-round matches: Emiliana Arango vs. McCartney Kessler; [13] Linda Noskova vs. Darja Semenistaja; [27] Sofia Kenin vs. Peyton Stearns; [WC] Zarina Diyas vs. [25] Paula Badosa; [SR] Karolina Pliskova vs. [Q] Sloane Stephens [4] Amanda Anisimova vs. [6] Jessica Pegula: An all-American battle for a spot in the Australian Open semifinals would be a very entertaining matchup. Both players still covet that first Grand Slam title, and each have been on the doorstep. Anisimova fell in the Wimbledon and US Open singles finals last year while Pegula lost to Sabalenka in the 2024 final. Pegula holds the head-to-head 3-0, but they have not faced since Toronto 2024. Tereza Valentova vs. [30] Maya Joint: Joint, 19, whose family lives in Melbourne, will be seeded at a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. With titles in Rabat and Eastbourne last season, she became the Australian No. Despite Switzerland's loss to Poland in the United Cup final, Bencic finished 9-1 throughout the tournament and 5-1 in singles, including a win over Iga Swiatek, who she could meet in the Australian Open quarterfinals. Other notable first-round matches: [16] Naomi Osaka vs. Antonia Ruzic; [5] Elena Rybakina vs. Kaja Juvan; Sorana Cirstea vs. Eva Lys; Daria Kasatkina vs. [Q] Nikola Bartunkova, [Q] Yuan Yue vs. [2] Iga Swiatek However at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Rybakina earned her first win against Swiatek after four straight losses. Four previous Australian Open champions are in the 2026 field.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet for a number of reasons, Federer identifies his fifth title in Melbourne as the one that stands out the most. “I guess it has to be 2017 just because of the way it ended in the finals against Rafa.” recalled Federer, who was aged 35 and had not played a tour-level match for six months when he arrived at that year's Australian Open. I was maybe going to be happy with the quarters. I was like more, ‘Yeah, no, not at 17 in the world, not having played in six months, all that'. “I played really well at the Hopman Cup. I think just the way the finals played out kind of makes it maybe one of the best special ones I've ever had in my career.” Federer overcame his great rival Rafael Nadal in a five-set championship-match thriller to cap his 2017 run at Melbourne Park. It was a shot that has lived long in the memory of tennis fans. “I've seen it many, many times,” said Federer, who also won the Melbourne crown in 2004, 2006-07, 2010 and 2018. “All my friends send it to me. It's on the algorithm of people I know. It's a nice point, maybe one of the most important ones I've had in my playing career. A new Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry that has etched itself into the tennis landscape in a similar manner to Federer vs. Nadal is the one between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The pair has won the past eight major singles titles between them and contested the final three Grand Slam title clashes of 2025, including a remarkable five-set battle at Roland Garros during which Alcaraz saved three championship points in the third set before triumphing. “The rivalry with Alcaraz and Sinner is a great one,” said Federer. I think that French Open final was unreal. I feel like for a second, for a moment, the world stood still in the sporting world and watched towards Paris, what was going on in that epic fifth set because it could have ended much, much sooner obviously for Jannik. “Then all of a sudden it ended up in this most crazy fashion. Maybe one of the greatest games we've ever had in our sport. It's good we still live off that momentum. I practised with those guys a little bit.

It's like Rory [McIlroy] going for the Masters. Those things are tough,” said Federer, when asked about Alcaraz's prospects. It's true, in order to complete the career Grand Slam already now would be crazy. “So let's see if he is able to do 'crazy' this week. I hope he does because for the game, again, that would be an unbelievable, special moment. He has another hundred and whatever players that say, ‘We don't agree with those plans'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia—Roger Federer will bid a proper farewell to the Australian Open ahead of the 2026 tournament on Saturday, competing alongside ATP legends Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, and Pat Rafter for a “Battle of the world No. 1s” doubles match that kicks off the event's inaugural Opening Ceremony.The six-time champion, who famously coined the “Happy Slam” nickname for the Australian Open, will be back on Rod Laver Arena for the first time since 2020, having officially retired from the sport at the 2022 Laver Cup.“I'm nervous, I'm excited, I'm happy I'm here,” Federer said in a press conference moderated by former ATP doubles No. He was one of my favorite players. Then Andre, I was fortunate enough to play against him maybe 10 times or so. Just being together with those guys is going to make me feel better, as well.“I have great memories of just being here,” he added. “It's been an incredible tournament for me and one of my favorite places to play tennis.” He was one of my favorite players.

Tennis is part of that.”Federer took a stroll down memory lane during the press conference, recalling a particularly iconic point that helped him win the 2017 Australian Open, but confessed that nostalgia for his playing days isn't as strong as some might assume.“If I would have won half of what I've done, I'd be equally proud sitting here because I achieved way more than I ever thought I would,” said Federer. “It's hard to make it a priority in the schedule when you have four children and so many other things going on,” said Federer, who for now prefers competing in doubles rather than singles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia—Sloane Stephens will be the first to tell you that ebbs and flows are natural parts of a tennis career.“In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. “In my career, I've had ups and downs that have been exciting, not exciting, anticlimactic, all the things,” Stephens said with a smile after booking her spot in the 2026 Australian Open main draw. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. But even Stephens, a 32-year-old former Grand Slam champion currently ranked No. 1097 in the world, would concede her trajectory doesn't quite mirror one of the average player's.“I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. “I just told my coach earlier that this whole tennis journey keeps getting weirder and weirder,” joked the American. That journey took the 2017 US Open winner off tour for much of the last 12 months as she dealt with a persistent foot injury. Playing just six matches in 2025, Stephens watched tennis from the literal sidelines as an analyst for various networks, watching the game evolve—but remain recognizable—in her absence.“When you don't play a lot, there's a little lull. You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home. Then, I was able to translate that into a match.”After starting the 2026 season with a three-set defeat at the ASB Classic, Stephens—along with her mom, aunt, and coach Kamau Murray—traveled to Melbourne early to compete in qualifying for the first time since 2011. For reference, the last time Stephens didn't gain direct acceptance into a Grand Slam main draw, the Harry Potter and Twilight film series were still in theaters.“I think I was the only Grand Slam champion to be in qualies, which was interesting,” Stephens said with a still-formidable side eye. I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.” You don't feel as competitive and you don't feel as attached to the game,” she explained. “So, it was just being able to get back, train really hard, and play and have fun on court at home.

I hadn't won a match since God knows whenever, so I was just like, it's an opportunity to go and play and try to figure it out.” She figured it out with few issues over three rounds, rallying from a set down to defeat Australian Olivia Gadecki on Wednesday and holding off a late surge to solve No. 2 seed Lucia Bronzetti to guarantee a 14th main-draw appearance in Melbourne.“It was weird to be in qualies and wonder how it even worked,” mused Stephens. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today. A lot of times in my career, I haven't been afraid to put myself out there, win or lose. Sometimes you get rewarded and sometimes you don't.”Where past years have been rife with stress, the 2013 semifinalist is taking a different approach on the court and behind the scenes, vlogging her trip to Melbourne in a rare peek behind the curtain into Stephens' off-court life.“I would have never shown anything like that ever in life,” Stephens laughed. Being on the other side and doing TV and stuff, I can see how fans would want to see those kinds of moments.“Definitely one of the goals this year is just to have more fun and to enjoy it. “I didn't even know we played back-to-back from yesterday to today.

As mom Sybil texted near the small interview scrum, Stephens showed off her Free People Movement tennis dress, a lacey yellow ensemble evocative of Ted Tinling's iconic designs.“This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies. “Maria Sakkari asked me if it was even a tennis dress and I was like, ‘Yeah girl. Free People Movement, they're growing and they're like the cool kids in town.”Win or lose, that's a role Stephens has inhabited flawlessly in over a decade on tour. “This was made in my living room, and it took about four fittings,” claimed Stephens, lifting her sweatshirt to show off the intricacies.
