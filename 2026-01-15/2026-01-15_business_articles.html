                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. and Taiwan have reached a trade agreement to build chips and chip factories on American soil, the Department of Commerce announced on Thursday. As part of the agreement, Taiwanese chip and technology companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., and the Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit for these companies. In exchange, the U.S. will limit reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, down from 20%, and commit to zero reciprocal tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients, aircraft components, and some natural resources. Taiwan Semiconductor has bought land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan in an interview on Thursday. "They just bought hundreds of acres adjacent to their property," Lutnick said. The announcement added that future tariffs under the Section 232 framework will have some exceptions for companies that are building chips in the U.S. Taiwanese companies building new U.S. chip fabs — such as TSMC — will be able to import up to 2.5 times the amount of capacity they are building while the factories are under construction, without paying tariffs under the framework. Taiwanese auto parts, lumber, and related products will also avoid tariffs over 15% under Section 232, the announcement said. When the factories are completed, companies will be able to import 1.5 times their U.S. production capacity, Commerce said. It also incentivizes TSMC, the world's leading fab company, to continue to build more factories on U.S. soil, while making it clear that it can continue to build chips for U.S. companies in Taiwan. Lutnick said during the interview that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff. "That's what they get if they don't build in America, the tariff's likely to be 100%," Lutnick said. TSMC has already built fabs in Arizona, investing as much as $40 billion to produce chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia, using previous grants of U.S. government money under the CHIPS Act. The U.S. government has prioritized American production of leading-edge chips as the struggle for access to AI semiconductors has become a key geopolitical matter. U.S. officials have also said that there is substantial risk to the U.S. economy if China invades Taiwan and reduces access to TSMC chips. "We're going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors," Lutnick said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums. The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike. "I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay," Trump said. The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his "most-favored-nation" policy. More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx. Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. The health-care framework would "make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase," according to a White House fact sheet. It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage "directly to the American people" instead of giving "big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments," the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks. Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons "in plain English" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates. It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid "to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills." A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. The White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies. Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations. "Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here." Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said on Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions. "Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing," Shaheen told reporters. "This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on," the White House official said. "It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

President Donald Trump is asking Congress to pass legislation to implement health care reforms he unveiled Thursday aimed at lowering drug prices and insurance premiums, as he moves to address one of his party's political liabilities ahead of midterm elections.

“I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay — have to do it right now so that we can get immediate relief to the American people,” Trump said in a video message, calling his proposal “The Great Healthcare Plan.”</p>

Last fall, OpenAI sent shockwaves through the software industry. A new wave of announcements from Anthropic this week revived fears that generative AI could undermine the economics of traditional software companies. On Sunday, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences, which includes HIPAA-ready enterprise tools. The next day, it unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles document generation and file management. That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted. "While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. For years, SaaS companies have justified recurring subscription fees by packaging productivity features, analytics, automation, and domain expertise into proprietary tools. But AI threatens to flatten that value proposition by turning many of those features into on-demand capabilities accessible through a single interface. An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being "squeezed" by AI-driven competition. Perhaps most concerning for investors is that AI's reach now appears to be extending into vertical software, an area long viewed as relatively insulated because of regulatory complexity and domain expertise. RBC analysts said Anthropic's healthcare-focused tools suggest that assumption may no longer hold. "We've viewed vertical software as one pocket of software that is likely to be viewed as 'AI-proof' (for now), given the deep domain, regulatory nuance, and workflow expertise required to be successful," RBC's note stated. "That said, recently announced Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences suggests the AI bear narrative contagion could spread to some vertical names, and they may prove to be less defensive (at least from a multiple perspective) than originally thought." The analysts warned that the AI overhang on software "may remain" and "could spread" as Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google accelerate their pace of announcements.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast. Jimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets. Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: "We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform." In June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies. "Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money," he added. "That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense." In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure "while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement." Donaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses. In 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider. Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store "burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise. "That equity investment is now presumptively worthless," Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners." As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded "Saks at Amazon" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. Amazon wrote that it "hopes" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may "seek more drastic remedies" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way. Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store "burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise. "That equity investment is now presumptively worthless," Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners." As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded "Saks at Amazon" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. Amazon wrote that it "hopes" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may "seek more drastic remedies" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way. Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the co-owners and founders of boutique staffing agency The Grapevine, Lori Zuker Briller and Rachel Zaslansky Sheer interview "thousands" of candidates each year. Their goal is to match strong candidates with "cool, unique and interesting" roles as varied as executive assistant, estate manager and personal chef, Briller tells CNBC Make It. Drawing on 20 years of running The Grapevine, Sheer and Briller shared their top hiring insights in their upcoming book "Straight From the Grapevine: How to Crush Your Job Search." Candidates should take a hard look at their profiles and ask themselves, "Who are you online? If a candidate's social media posts or online content don't align with the image they present in interviews, that can be a "definite red flag" for hirers, according to Sheer. In Briller's view, it's best to avoid posting, liking or sharing any content that could call your professionalism into question, particularly on career-focused platforms like LinkedIn. Recently, Briller says she's seen an uptick in candidates sharing controversial or overly negative opinions on LinkedIn. "There's a lot of ranting going on," Briller says, particularly about people's frustrations with past jobs or the hiring process. Even if your view is justified, venting about a negative job experience online could make you seem like a "disgruntled employee," career coach Eliana Goldstein previously told CNBC Make It. According to Goldstein, expressing resentment or anger in a social media post could cause hirers to question your attitude and professionalism. It's best to discuss those feelings "with people you're really close to and trust," rather sharing them on the internet, she says. Similarly, Briller advises the job seekers she works with to talk about their career challenges with friends and colleagues, instead of "putting every thought out there" online. She tells candidates, "Look, it's not my place to have an opinion. But just be careful, because hiring parties, HR people might see that as problematic." Some candidates are "really resistant" to this advice, Briller says: "They're kind of like, well, it shouldn't be any of their business." Still, job seekers need to accept that their online presence is fair game in the hiring process, Sheer says. Want to get ahead at work with AI?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grok will no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on X, after widespread global backlash. "We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis," X's safety account said in a blog post on the platform on Wednesday. "This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers." The change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor, Rob Bonta, said he launched an investigation into sexualized AI deepfakes, including those of children, generated by Grok. Bonta said that there had been a flood of reports in the last few weeks that Grok users were taking pictures of women and minors they found online and using the AI model to undress them in images. "xAI can and should put better safeguards in place to protect children and women from the harms of sexually explicit materials being generated without their consent," a representative of the California Attorney General's office said in a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday after Grok's changes. xAI develops Grok and also owns the social media site X, where the chatbot is integrated to respond to users when tagged. In Wednesday's blog post, the social media company reiterated that image creation and the ability to edit any type of image via Grok on X will now only be available to paid users as an additional safety measure. The company restricted non-paying users last week after complaints from officials globally, but it was criticized for being insufficient. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the time that it "simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service." Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, said that the UK government wanted "any excuse for censorship" in response to a post questioning why AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT were not being looked into. On Wednesday, a few hours before X's official account posted about the ban on creating sexualized images, Musk asked users to try to get around the AI model's image restrictions. Grok is also available as a stand-alone web and mobile application. xAI could not be reached for immediate comment. They include automatically denying user requests containing words on a blocklist, training future versions of Grok on datasets free from explicit content, and using "secondary AI models" to detect and block intimate content before it is generated. "On one side are organizations prioritizing responsible AI and safety frameworks," she said. "On the other, are organizations positioning themselves as protecting freedom of expression by resisting regulatory control."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The investment forms part of a broader $162.5 million capital expenditure programme for 2026, subject to board approval and funding availability, according to Reuters. Caledonia, which currently operates the 80,000-ounce-per-year Blanket mine, is advancing the Bilboes gold project, a development estimated to cost $584 million in total. DON'T MISS THIS: US suspends visa processing for 75 countries, including Nigeria The company expects first production in late 2028, ramping up to a steady-state output of around 200,000 ounces annually from 2029 for at least a decade. The project will be financed through a combination of non-recourse senior debt, cash flows from existing operations and alternative structures such as streaming agreements, under which investors provide upfront funding in exchange for future metal deliveries. The expansion has also been helped by a recent policy reversal by Zimbabwe's government, which scrapped plans to double gold royalty rates and alter the tax treatment of capital expenditure. Mining is Zimbabwe's biggest export earner, generating more than 60% of the country's foreign exchange from gold, platinum and lithium. But years of poor regulation have left a heavy environmental toll, with both artisanal and large-scale miners responsible for polluted waterways, abandoned pits and degraded land, especially across Manicaland, Midlands and Mashonaland West.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The RDF said the engineers will focus on rehabilitating critical infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Melissa, which struck the Caribbean in late October 2025 and left large sections of Jamaica's road networks, drainage systems, public buildings, and utilities severely affected. The deployment is being carried out under a bilateral cooperation agreement between Rwanda and Jamaica that allows Kigali to provide technical and disaster-recovery support when major emergencies occur. “It is these values that earned you this responsibility,” he said, calling on the officers and other ranks to uphold and safeguard the RDF's core values at all times. The Jamaica deployment reflects a growing trend in which African militaries are increasingly used not only for peacekeeping and counterterrorism, but also for humanitarian engineering and disaster-recovery missions abroad. African militaries increasingly operate abroad in roles that combine security with humanitarian protection, though dedicated disaster-relief deployments remain rare. South Africa is one of the few African states with a documented record of sending military aircraft, engineers, and logistics units to support disaster responses in neighbouring countries such as Mozambique after major cyclones. Most other African overseas deployments take place through UN, AU, and regional peacekeeping missions, where countries like Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda are tasked with protecting civilians and securing humanitarian access. In that context, Rwanda's engineering mission to Jamaica stands out as a rare example of an African military deploying specifically for post-disaster infrastructure recovery rather than conflict stabilisation. For Rwanda, which has built a reputation through UN and bilateral deployments across Africa and the Middle East, Jamaica represents a further expansion of its security diplomacy beyond the continent. By sending engineers rather than combat troops, Kigali is also projecting soft power through infrastructure rebuilding, technical expertise, and rapid disaster response, tools that are increasingly shaping how African states engage with partners in the Global South.
