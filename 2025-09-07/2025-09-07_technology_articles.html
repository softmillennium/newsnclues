It's not often we see a repair video that includes no repairing, but that's exactly what happened when an Asus TUF RTX 4090 landed on the legendary desks of Northridge Fix. As such, they sent it in for repair with a brief note explaining: "The device does not display from any output." When it was opened up to be inspected, Alex, our host, found something truly harrowing. There were no GPU core or VRAM chips on the PCB. Alex went on to explain how this has become a common occurrence, saying that his repair shop receives dead RTX 4090s like these all the time with stripped internals. Even then, some of these bad actors have started to price these hollow 4090s "properly" such that no one would expect a too-good-to-be-true scam, so the trap evidently still works. GPUs like this largely come from underground modding operations in China, where many high-end GPUs are not easy to import. Skilled technicians take existing gaming-grade GPUs, like a 4090, and surgically remove their core and VRAM so put them on custom PCBs with upgraded components-most often higher VRAM capacity. There's a whole history of such incidents, like last year when someone received an MSI RTX 4090 in Hong Kong without a cord and only two VRAM chips onboard. Perhaps the most insane case was when someone bought a working 4090 from eBay, removed its core and VRAM, and returned it to the seller, essentially performing a reverse-scam of sorts. Therefore, it's important to stay vigilant while buying used GPU, especially high-end ones. That's what Alex reiterated at the end of his video. Make sure to stress-test the GPU to ensure there's no hidden weaknesses that might pop up later and spoil your purchase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's been a lot of chatter heading into the new NFL season about how artificial intelligence will be an innovative new sideline tool for coaches and players, thanks to the league's partnership with Microsoft. We checked back in with the NFL to clarify just how AI can and will be used during games, just to make sure humans and not chatbots will still be the deciding force when it comes to calling plays. First, the NFL stresses that its Sideline Viewing System, with a new GitHub Copilot feature from Microsoft, is mainly a filtering tool for the sideline and booth Surface tablets used by players and coaches. Copilot is also enabled in analytics devices used in the coaches booth, where teams have access to specific game data within a “bespoke build” of Microsoft Excel. “The technology tools coaches use on game days are primarily governed by the NFL's electronic device policy which states that only league-issued technology can be used by team staffs on sidelines/the coaches booths (prohibiting devices like smartwatches, cellphones, and personal computers). Club committee guidance informs the approval process of what is league-issued. Our committees of coaches, front office executives, and owners have historically focused on innovations that serve all clubs equitably and emphasize enhancing processes over determining in-game outcomes. Through our Microsoft partnership, we feel AI can streamline these processes, but cannot be a substitute or supplement for coaches developing adjustments and strategies on game day.” And there's no bigger play in Seattle football history to revisit than the play that cost the Seahawks a second Super Bowl title 10 years ago. Rather than hand the ball to running back Marshawn Lynch, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll opted for a pass play, and quarterback Russell Wilson's throw was intercepted. But AI is such a hyped commodity now it makes sense to use it for its take on that play, and much like the human analysts, fans and players who have dissected Carroll's decision, AI wishes he would have run it to Lynch, too. Here's the prompt we fed to OpenAI's ChatGPT-5 and Google's Gemini 2.5: Both bots do a good job of quickly generating the facts around the play and analysis of Lynch's power in such a situation. It remains one of the most second-guessed play calls in NFL history.” As the NFL kicks off a new season, and AI becomes even more ingrained in certain aspects of team decision making, here's to hoping Seattle fans have reason for more positive prompts about future play calls.

It also doesn't load 400MB of JavaScript or whatever. Apple: How did the hinge break?Customer: I don't know, I just opened it one day and it came off. The only thing "Apple" here is that it's not exposed as a public API. Edit: not forgetting the classic Miles Davis door: https://youtu.be/wwOipTXvNNo ("It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.") Is it a backup if the magnet for closed lid detection fails? Is it some kind of input for the brightness sensor or True Tone? Is it for warranty investigation, that if the hinge breaks they can figure out if it was physically pushed too far, or was repeatedly slammed open and shut like a toy? If you have a Hall effect sensor, getting angle data from it is pretty much free, because the Hall effect produces a continuously varying signal, you need thresholding logic to turn it into a binary output.Given Hall effect ICs are so cheap and plentiful there no reason to use anything else. Also given they mass-produced ICs it's probably cheaper to buy a fully featured Hall Effect IC, because the manufacturing cost between a basic IC and an advanced IC is almost certainly zero these days.In short, modern IC manufacturing has just made magnetic angle sensors as cheap, if not cheaper, than dump non-angle sensing Hall sensors.

I can't fathom why this isn't a bigger priority for everyone else: much like "trackpads that don't suck", it's a huge quality-of-life thing which keeps tons of people on Macs because they want it to Just Work without ever thinking about it. This is in contrast to S3 sleep, which basically halts all activity. Sounds all good in theory, but as soon as you allow code to be run while in sleep, it's easy for some runaway app (OS or third party) to eat through your battery even while your laptop is "sleeping". There's also wake on LAN which if enabled can rouse the machine from sleep after it's successfully entered a sleep state. So anyway that killed one of my laptop's batteries. So much for supporting Internet freedoms...Windows comes with a utility that'll tell you what process denied a sleep request, super useful.I've actually ran into MacBooks not sleeping a few times, but it is much rarer.It is unfortunate because back on the mid 2000s windows had the best functioning sleep code, but then they tried to catch up with iPad's # instant on and chasing perfection led to the current mess.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France's most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. It is reportedly in the process of raising another round that would value it at $14 billion, up from about $6 billion in June, 2024. “Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025. Mistral AI, which offers open-source AI models, has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn't a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company's openness versus OpenAI's typically closed approach. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France's top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store. In July 2025, Mistral AI updated Le Chat with new features that bring it closer to rival full-stack AI chatbots: a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. This update also includes the addition of Projects, which lets users group chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces. This comes in addition to Mistral AI's suite of models, which includes: In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest. In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with incumbents like Windsurf, Anysphere's Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google's DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers. Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which has caused persistent controversy due to his previous role. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license. Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat's Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month. On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Overall, however, Mistral AI's revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources. In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP's entire text archive dating back to 1983. Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France's army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. In June 2025, it was announced that beginning in 2026, Mistral will launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, Mistral Compute. In July 2025, it announced AI for Citizens, “a collaborative initiative to help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services, catalyzing innovation, and ensuring competitiveness.” In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce. The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation. In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others. This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A more powerful ‘Tiny11 core Builder' has also been released, but this 'quick and dirty development testbed' won't be for most users. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Windows bloat hater NTDEV has released an updated version of Tiny11 Builder, a tool which facilitates the creation of minimal and decluttered Windows 11 installs. NTDEV says that Tiny11 Builder is now ready for Windows 11 25H2, despite Microsoft's whack-a-mole attempts to push unwanted apps onto your storage. It's been quite a while (and for that I deeply apologize), but the new release of tiny11 builder is finally here!simplifying the process a bit while also tackling apps like Copilot, the new Outlook and Teams (they're like whack-a-mole!). The latest release of Tiny11 Builder is claimed to be compatible with “all Windows 11 SKUs, all languages (at least in theory), for both x64 and arm64.” Moreover, it has been tested on the latest Windows 11 24H2, 25H2, as well as Canary Build 27934 releases. When executed, the script will pare down a fresh official Windows ISO which can be grabbed directly from Microsoft. There is just one executable required, if you wish to sidestep the Windows 11 system requirements. In such a case, you will use oscdimg.exe, which is provided in the Windows ADK, and is used to create bootable ISO images. Last but not least, an “unattended answer file” is included in the distribution, so that users can enjoy a zero-friction bypass of the Microsoft Account OOBE. There's also a more powerful ‘Tiny11 core Builder' being made available alongside this new release. But please be aware that this core release is flagged as being “for testing purposes only,” and “a quick and dirty development testbed.” The core release can make Windows 11 images much smaller, it is claimed, but sacrifices some serviceability features.

Large tech companies showed signs of large hiring sprees: Software publishers like Microsoft and Oracle have collectively added 16,100 jobs in the past year, signaling ongoing strength in areas linked to cloud computing and enterprise software. But other marquee-name companies like computer-systems designers such as IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton have shed 28,800 roles, reflecting a tilt toward automation and project-specific staffing. “Only three states, Maine, Delaware and Idaho, saw tech job postings increase in August. Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, attributes this trend to increased corporate investment in technology infrastructure and automation rather than direct employment. While some segments remain resilient, the disparate nature of job growth is clear. The CompTIA analysis underscores the broader narrative of an industry undergoing structural transformation, shifting gears from hiring sprees to strategic investments in technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fast food firm quickly fixed vulnerabilities of whopping proportions, but didn't acknowledge the white-hat hackers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ethical hackers BobDaHacker and BobTheShoplifter have detailed their claim that they uncovered “catastrophic” vulnerabilities in multiple platforms hosted by Restaurant Brands International (RBI). While RBI may not be a very familiar name, this lax security means that systems powering mega brands like Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, with over 30,000 locations worldwide, and all were almost trivially easy to hack. The vulnerabilities found were a big deal, as we will detail below, including allowing the duo to access employee accounts, ordering systems, and listen to recorded drive-thru conversations, among other exploits. Firstly, it is claimed that the ‘Anyone Can Join This Party' signup API allowed anyone in, as the web dev team had “forgot to disable user signups.” Subsequently, using GraphQL introspection, an “even easier signup endpoint that completely bypassed email verification” was unearthed. After authentication, the white-hat hackers were able to uncover store employee personal information, internal IDs, configuration details, and more. Furthermore, a GraphQL mutation called createToken allowed the (thankfully) ethical due to “promote ourselves to admin status across the entire platform.” RBI's catalog of security errors didn't end there.

It apparently crossed their minds to “give a 5-star review to a bathroom in Tokyo while sitting in your pajamas in Ohio,” but as staunchly white-hat operatives, that, of course, didn't happen. Last but not least, the BobDaHacker blog insists that “no customer data was retained during this research,” with responsible disclosure protocols followed throughout the process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Undersea breaks on SEA-ME-WE 4 and IMEWE systems disrupted Microsoft's Middle East transit over the weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Microsoft was forced to reroute Azure traffic on Saturday, September 6, after two major submarine cable systems were severed in the Red Sea, triggering latency spikes and degraded performance for cloud users across South Asia and the Gulf. Those reroutes currently remain in effect, with Microsoft noting that they expect “higher latency on some traffic” into September 7 as regional carriers continue to triage routes. From a technical perspective, these aren't just any cables: They're two of the main long-haul systems connecting Asia to Europe, carrying traffic not only for consumer Internet but also hyperscalers like Google and Meta. Losing just one of these critical pathways can overload alternate routes, spike latency, and increase packet loss across various cloud-dependent applications, such as multiplayer gaming and large file downloads. Microsoft engineers have rerouted traffic via alternative, longer paths while monitoring network telemetry. Repair ships for undersea cables are scarce, however, and the Red Sea remains a geopolitically sensitive area, making any physical repairs an inevitably slow process. Such repairs can take weeks because repair crews must precisely locate themselves above the damaged cable. In February 2024, multiple submarine cables, including AE-1, SEACOM, and EIG, were damaged by an unknown cause. Due to the sensitivity of the location, cable operators are currently unable to give a timeline for full repairs, but it was reported in July 2024 that repairs were completed on the AAE-1 cable. As of now, Azure remains operational, but enterprises reliant on cross-region connectivity between Europe, South Asia, and the Middle East should brace for slower connections in the meantime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As much as I love my makeshift smart home, the idea of a house where everything is internet-connected sometimes borders on the absurd. It's tales of this last one that I'm going to regale you with today, since I know you're simply burning up inside (pun intended), not knowing whether you should throw your tried-and-true toasting machine of choice in the trash and take one giant, crumb-laden step into the future. This is where the smarts come in. To be honest, I didn't even realize how many different things there were to toast until I started tapping through the pages on the R180. There's an option for white bread, of course, but also waffles, hamburger buns, English muffins, bagels, and (my favorite) LARGE bagels. There's even an option for pancakes, which I'm told can be bought frozen at the store, a fact I did not know. And speaking of frozen stuff, there are options when you're getting toasty to cook something that's fresh, frozen, or to reheat. You don't need a smart toaster. It's hard to say what separates all of these options from one another, but it's clear that Revolution did actually focus on the heating element of the R180 and not just the flashy screen stuff. That's evidenced by the fact that this toaster has a copyrighted heating tech called InstaGLO, which Revolution claims “heats in seconds” and sears bread rather than roasting the life out of it. For your bread-and-butter white toast (I'll see myself out for that double entendre), it does a good job. It did an okay job with Pop-Tarts, but let's be honest, that's pretty hard to mess up. Unrelated to the toasting process, I did wind up with a tummy ache, but I think that's what's supposed to happen when you put that many preservatives in your body. This level of variability between toast outcomes, while not ideal if you don't choose the right setting, is kind of a sign that the toaster is working. There are differences in the preset toast settings, and they have a demonstrable difference on the final product. For shits and giggles, I decided to try and toast a piece of the brioche bread under the artisan bread setting. How do I know who made this bread? Maybe it came from a family of bakers in Brooklyn. Maybe there's an independent bread seller going door-to-door trying to grow their gluten empire. On one hand, yikes, but on the other, there's clearly a major difference in heat and timing between settings that makes presets more tailored to certain things. Altogether, I tested three different things: Pop-Tarts (since there's a specific pastry setting for that), gluten-free bread (there's also a setting for that), and brioche white bread. It did a pretty decent job toasting all three of those and was responsive when I selected the browness level. I'm not sure who needs to optimize their Pop-Tart toasting, but if that's your jam, then your time has finally arrived. An unexpected perk of toasting with this thing is that there are no jump scares. Again, as with any proper smart appliance in 2025, there are lots of things you absolutely do not need, but since the internet is inside this thing… why not, I guess. One of those things that you don't really need is the weather. By entering your city into the toaster, you can get local weather. Revolution claims that this toaster does not collect data on you, though I can't verify if that's true or not. If you're buying this smart toaster, you're going to have to just take their word for it. smart feature is a digital photo album that you can set to cycle through pics when you're not busy toasting stuff. I uploaded some of myself to the toaster using the provided QR code, and, honestly, this screen is kind of nice? One thing I don't love about the smart features is that there's no way to do certain stuff via an app or some kind of web-based interface. Using the touchscreen works surprisingly fine, but sometimes there are things you'd rather do on your phone, like enter your Wi-Fi network. When I went to enter my office Wi-Fi into the toaster, it said that it was connected, but I couldn't actually go online because of added security. With a phone, I may have been prompted to enter the necessary credentials and would have been able to get online without using my colleague's hotspot. That's a minor complaint, to be clear. Most people won't encounter that problem since they'll be setting these things up at home, but the option to use a phone or another device would have been nice. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what anyone wants out of a smart toaster or if anyone wants anything at all. There are mostly two camps of people when they witness the R180. and then mildly entertained by the existence of a smart toaster. The other is near-viscerally offended that smart appliances have gone this far (i.e., did we really need to reinvent toast?). One friend of mine told me he “had to go to the doctor” after seeing me post about it on my Instagram. No matter which camp you belong to, both share one thing: they're equally as disgusted by the price. For everything that it does right, or does uniquely, no one needs a smart toaster, and no one needs to spend hundreds of dollars toasting bread. Okay, maybe if you buy one of those fancy Japanese ones that steams at the same time (those are notably $100 less than this, by the way). You can tap and swipe your way into a bready bliss. I'll be on the sidelines turning bread into that nice crumbly stuff the old-fashioned way, one toasty jump scare at a time. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.
