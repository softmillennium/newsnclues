                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass casualty events—Manchester Arena (2017), Route 91 Harvest, and Astroworld—weren't just disasters; they were alleged nodes in a calculated trauma-engine psyops system. Live Nation and Clear Channel/iHeartMedia are implicated as the dual hubs of this infrastructure, producing environments where tragedy becomes a scripted rebirth followed by commercial monetization. Media saturation, crisis PR, and celebrity rehabilitation formed a coordinated post-trauma blueprint. Anouska de Georgiou—a figure already linked to intelligence networks and the Epstein circle—emerged strategically in these crises. Positioned within Ariana Grande's aftermath narrative and speculation suggests she functioned as the “grief architect”: arranging public emotion through proximity to trauma. Her role bridges psyops and celebrity culture manipulation. A shadowy syndicate of attorneys—including Gloria Allred and John Branca—pulled legal strings from behind the scenes. Armed with crisis lawyers, investigators, and a willingness to deploy 5150 psychiatric interventions, they allegedly turned trauma into leverage—monetizing death, silencing dissent, and commanding estate outcomes. Timing and narrative control—paired with the trauma engine's momentum—give the impression that public empathy was manipulated in service of estate flooding and financial extraction. Public grief, audiences, and even victims were channeled through corporate machinery—protected from scrutiny, sanitized for consumption. Born with a copy of "Atlas Shrugged" in hand, Justin showed early signs of his future as a conservative firebrand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The haunting theatrical experience "Dark Tales Told on a Cold Autumn Eve" is returning to Cape Cod stages this October. The play, created by playwright Jim Dalglish and co-directed with Jennifer Kangas, brings Cape Cod's supernatural lore to life through a series of chilling, original tales, according to a community announcement. First produced in 2018 at Cotuit Center for the Arts, "Dark Tales" is back by popular demand, reimagined and expanded. Pirates, witches, mooncussers, selkies, Pilgrims and politicos emerge from the shadows, each with a story to tell. Inspired by Poe, Hoffmann, Saki and Irish ghost story podcasts, Dalglish blends original storytelling with Cape Cod legends to create an immersive theatrical event. Audiences will be transported to chilling and iconic local settings, including P'town Harbor, Three Sisters Lights, Horseleech Pond, White Cedar Swamp, the Nauset Moors and even a famous compound in Hyannis Port. The group's mission is to produce new plays written by Cape Cod playwrights. Visit the website and find out more about Helltown Players at https://www.helltownplayers.org. This story was created by reporter Beth McDermott, bmcdermott1@gannett.com, with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Journalists were involved in every step of the information gathering, review, editing and publishing process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural has unquestionably been the go-to resource for mythological content. A highly underrated series that ran for five seasons, Lost Girl follows the antics of Bo (Anna Silk), a member of the Fae community. Though not aware of it in the beginning, Bo is a succubus, a type of Fae who feeds on chi. One night after killing a date rapist, her activities get noticed by the local Fae government. Lost Girl functions like any good supernatural series with monster-of-the-week episodes and mythology arcs. While trying to figure out her past, Bo also works as an investigator, using her succubus powers to make a living. Lost Girl set itself apart from others of its kind by not putting moral constraints on its female characters. Bo is sexually liberated and established as bisexual in the first episode. Her sexuality isn't subjected to the male gaze but instead an exploration of where Bo's heart truly lies. Women are not just objects like in some of Supernatural's worst mistakes. They are complex and refuse to play by anyone's rules but their own. These aspects make for an incredibly developed world, and is why Lost Girl works. After a pilot episode full of exposition, fans are free to experience the story as Bo does and find out all the secrets that have been hidden from her for her entire life. Any good supernatural series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer needs to have an established mythology, but Lost Girl goes the extra mile. The series redefines traditional supernatural myths by adhering to an entirely new set of rules. Bo is a succubus who stems from the type of Fae who feeds on the life force of others. There are many other types of classes that Bo meets along her travels, including Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried), a werewolf, and Tamsin (Rachel Skarsten), identified as a Valkyrie. Every episode, Bo meets another form of Fae, each derived from different mythologies, such as Norse and Celtic. The Fae are divided between “Light” and “Dark.” Bo's presence in the new city demands that she choose a side, but she ultimately chooses to be unaffiliated. This is forbidden by Fae law, but since no one can conclude where she came from, enticing her to one side or the other is all they can do. A celebration of empowerment and sex positivity, Lost Girl didn't overstay its welcome, deciding to conclude after five seasons. The show was groundbreaking, and there has been nothing like it since.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Sager is a contributing writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared in Parade, The New York Post, Seventeen, PopCrush and more. The Smurls led a normal, quiet life in their West Pittston, Pa., duplex for over a decade until strange occurrences began. The horror franchise's latest release follows Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) as they take on a demon that terrorizes patriarch Jack Smurl (Elliot Cowan) and his wife Janet Smurl (Rebecca Calder), while also targeting their four daughters: Heather (Kila Lord Cassidy), Dawn (Beau Gadsdon), Shannon (Molly Cartwright) and Carin (Tilly Walker). Here's everything to know about the Smurls' experiences and where they are today, three decades after their lives were changed forever. Janet, Shannon and Heather were in the kitchen, and Janet was pinning the collar onto Heather's confirmation robe when a ceiling light, which was affixed to the ceiling with two chains and several eye hooks into a beam, crashed down onto the kitchen table without warning. In particular, the accordion-style closet door in Jack and Janet's bedroom opened and shut rapidly on its own. According to the 2020 documentary Devil's Road: The True Story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, Jack and Janet claimed that their bed shook and they saw a black shadow lurking around their bedroom. In another instance, Janet was reportedly yanked out of bed and on a different night, the couple levitated "as high as the ceiling," Ed recalled. The occurrences grew more aggressive over time, with the Smurls' 75-pound German shepherd getting slammed into a wall and Jack getting attacked while praying. Jack also claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the spirit, which Ed later deemed a succubus, on several occasions. Jack and Janet initially sought help from their local Catholic Church. "We went to our local priest and said, 'Father, there's something very strange going on here,' " Janet recalled on Larry King Live. They then reached out to the Warrens by phone for assistance. The Warrens attempted to vanquish the succubus with prayer, crosses, holy water and a police officer with them for protection. Ed claimed that the demon attacked him and "threw [him] back 10 feet" and was too strong for them to defeat on their own. They approached the Catholic Church again for help, but were denied once more. "You can not even imagine what has gone on in this home," Lorraine said in a press conference. The Smurl family's house is still standing in West Pittston. Richard Bridle purchased the property and initially had difficulty renting it out due to its notoriety, he told UPI. There is a stigma attached to the house," Bridle explained, adding that he thought the haunting claims were "ridiculous." The patriarch of the family, Jack, led a quiet life after becoming a reluctant media sensation from the hauntings, working for the Topps Chewing Gum company in Duryea, Pa., for over 30 years and remaining active in his local church. He died at age 75 on June 22, 2017, per an obituary. His daughter Carin told the Citizens' Voice, "It was so quick. We didn't expect it because he had been doing so well. He told my mom ... one of his biggest regrets was that he wasn't going to make it to their 50th anniversary." As for the couple's daughters, Heather and Dawn live private lives. Dawn also raised her son Mark Glowinski II in Wilkes-Barre, and he has gone on to play as an offensive linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, New York Giants and Indianapolis Colts, WVIA News reported. Similarly, Shannon has a life outside of the public eye — working in health, per her LinkedIn — but she revealed on X that she's still interested in the paranormal and ghost hunting. "That we did it for fame or money is the most ridiculous statement ever. We were a normal family with normal lives that went through a tragedy and prevailed by staying strong and faithful," she told Citizens' Voice in 2016. Carin added, "We never made money from the book or movie. Who would want to go through all that media and public bashing?" "The reason I have been involved in paranormal investigating is so no one has to go through what we did," she said. "In me they get judge-free, discreet, legitimate, honest, professional help and counseling. No one going through tragedy should be treated like we were."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Europa, one of Jupiter's four large moons, has long been a focal point in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean hidden beneath a thick icy crust. Until recently, scientists believed Europa's surface interactions with Jupiter's intense radiation created abundant oxygen that could replenish this ocean and support life. However, new measurements from NASA's Juno mission suggest the quantity of oxygen produced on Europa is far lower than previously estimated. This revelation shakes up assumptions about the moon's biological potential and invites fresh scientific scrutiny. Europa's allure as a possible cradle for life arises from several factors: Contrary to earlier assumptions, direct measurements from the Juno spacecraft report Europa generates about 12 kilograms (26 pounds) of molecular oxygen per second from the dissociation of water ice on its surface. This is significantly less than prior estimates, which suggested up to 1,000 kilograms per second. Juno's Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) instrument detected charged oxygen and hydrogen ions emanating from Europa's surface. By flying close to Europa, Juno measured molecular species created when radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere bombards the icy surface, splitting water molecules. This direct measurement contrasts earlier inferences based on indirect observations and theoretical models, providing an unprecedented glimpse into Europa's atmospheric composition and its interaction with Jupiter's harsh environment. Europa's surface is bombarded by intense ionizing radiation trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. This radiation breaks apart water molecules in the ice (radiolysis), releasing oxygen and hydrogen. Despite this, life might still thrive through other chemical processes independent of oxygen levels. Scientists propose that water-rock interactions on the ocean floor could generate chemical energy sufficient to support microbial life. Understanding these processes is vital for assessing the moon's overall chemical landscape. Europa remains a primary candidate for future life-seeking missions despite these challenges. These missions aim to resolve remaining questions about hospitability thresholds and inform life detection efforts. The discovery that Europa produces far less oxygen than previously thought reshapes scientific perceptions of extraterrestrial habitability. Understanding Europa's true potential will illuminate pathways for finding life beyond Earth. Oxygen can serve as an energy source for life through metabolic processes similar to those on Earth. NASA's Juno spacecraft directly measured charged oxygen and hydrogen ions during a close flyby. It may limit energy sources but does not rule out alternative life forms or habitats. NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's JUICE missions are planned for detailed investigations. Yes, despite lower oxygen levels, its subsurface ocean and geologic activity make it a prime target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pilots reported that these craft dropped from 60,000 feet to sea level in seconds, then stopped instantly. Lazar's reactor theory, warping space instead of flying through air, offers a possible explanation. In 2017 and 2020, the US Department of Defense officially released Navy cockpit videos showing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Back in 1989, Bob Lazar described UFOs at S-4 that could hover, dart instantly, and make sharp-angle turns without inertia. The most famous video shows a white, oval-shaped craft accelerating with no visible exhaust or wings. Pilots reported that these craft dropped from 60,000 feet to sea level in seconds, then stopped instantly. Lazar's reactor theory, warping space instead of flying through air, offers a possible explanation. The Pentagon videos show UFOs with no heat signatures or fuel trails. Some physicists suggest the craft's ability to withstand G-forces could mean a form of inertial shielding, exactly what Lazar claimed UFOs achieved by generating a strong gravitational field around them. For many, this coincidence keeps his claims alive in both UFO circles and scientific discussions.</p>

A “reading," for those of you not fluent in psychic-speak, is what you get when a psychic connects with the energy of your departed loved ones on the Other Side and provides you with the specific details they are shown. As in ... an afterlife (hence, the title of our book). My cynical friends — especially the hard-nosed journalists — wanted to know: Did I actually believe in this hocus pocus? I first interviewed John for a 1999 PEOPLE cover story, as the blockbuster film, The Sixth Sense (“I see dead people”) mesmerized audiences. At that time and in the years to follow, I've seen him give some wild, otherwise unexplainable readings. He provided unique nicknames, revealed family secrets, knew people's last words before they died. A tipping point for this question would come during the phone call that night. Right around the time I first interviewed John, FBI agent Robert “Bob” Hilland, Edward's co-author of the new, crime-memoir, Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice, was grappling with that same question. “I heard him on the radio and thought he was a fraud,” Bob told me, as we sifted through boxes of dusty files, diaries, photos, hand-scrawled notes and news clippings at his home in 2022 — research to help me co-write the book. Hilland was working on a dead-end cold case that stretched back to the 70s involving a man, John Smith, whose two wives went mysteriously missing. After hearing John on the radio, he set up a meeting with him at his Long Island office. “I was going to either bust him ... or get help on the case,” said Bob. Instead, John gave Bob details that rocked his world — specifics about the murder case that would help the agent put Smith behind bars, and the clincher: a secret about Bob's family, courtesy of his departed grandfather, who “came through” to John, that Bob verified later with his parents. For the next two decades, the unlikely duo secretly sleuthed together on an array of front-page crimes happening in real time — missing Yale student Annie Le; newlywed George Smith murdered on a cruise ship; missing 5-year-old Noah Thomas, who disappeared in a rural town in Appalachian Virginia. I say “unlikely” duo because it's not like you'd expect a ballroom-dancing, pop culture nerd who talks to dead people to team up with a 6'8” former football playing, no-nonsense lawman who thrived in a black-and-white, just-the-facts Dragnet world. “Think: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins,” he'd say, with a laugh. And yet, underneath at their core, the sameness of these two men resonated. Both are wicked smart brainiacs on a tireless quest to do good in the world. Since he was a teen, John has tried to help people by reminding us we are all connected and that love doesn't die. (After taking my oncologist brother to a John event, he then gave several patients in the final stages of cancer comfort, describing what he saw.) He reminds me of Gary Cooper's honorable Sheriff in High Noon. They are also two alpha-males who get teary when talking about missing little Noah, and how they felt his sweet innocence as Bob searched for him in the dark, after midnight. During our Zoom interviews for the book, it was difficult not to get swept away by their determination to find truth, a body, some peace. I got so riled up by one unsolved case, I wanted us three to grab shovels, hop on a plane, and dig for one victim's body in a faraway location not yet tried. I said, “But it would be a great ending for the book!” Let it go for now, you guys,” said John. Besides, that was one of the big lessons Bob learned during their partnership, says John—to let go when it was time and trust the universe's mysterious ways. Which leads me back to that phone call in 2003. The woman on the other line getting a reading was my friend, Norris Church Mailer — wife of literary lion, Norman Mailer — calling in from Provincetown, Mass. The reading was going swimmingly, as John connected with Norris's deceased father and gave her a list of specific details that awed her, until ... we hit a glitch. “It's your mom,” John said, “she's showing me the chocolate.” But Norris's mother was alive and well, she informed him. What John didn't know was that my mother had passed a decade earlier. He didn't know that I pitched that first Sixth Sense interview with him to my PEOPLE editors in the hopes he'd connect with her. He also didn't know that a few days before the phone call with Norris, I stood at my mother's grave in Toronto and had a stern talk with her. “I've known John for four years now and I've been working side-by-side with him on this book for the last three months. I fished out a Coffee Crisp, her favorite Canadian chocolate bar, from my pocket and broke it in two. Popping one half in my mouth, I placed the other on top of her gravestone. Sharing chocolate was one of our beloved mother-daughter rituals. Does an afterlife exist in some energetic form, and if so, can we connect with those energies? The only indisputable evidence I've seen so far that makes me think yes is what I've seen John Edward do.</p>
