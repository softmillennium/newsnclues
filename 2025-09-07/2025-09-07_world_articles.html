                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• RFK Jr. defends leadership: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  dismissed his intense grilling by senators on Thursday as “theater,” and said he did not think federal government health agencies have had any great successes. • Sanctions on Russia: President Donald Trump signaled today that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state said today that Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is “flat wrong” after he defended his decision to remove vaccine mandates in the state. Public schools should absolutely require children to be vaccinated,” said Schrier, a former physician, after Ladapo said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that the issue is a matter of parental control over what happens to their children's bodies. “When that freedom to not vaccinate their own children and put them at risk comes up against another child's freedom to go to school knowing that they will not get measles or polio or whooping cough, then we have a real problem.” Florida announced last week that it will be the first state to move to end immunization requirements for everyone, including schoolchildren, that have been in place since the 1980s. Ladapo claimed his decision was “based on data and common sense,” yet in the interview with CNN,  said his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandate. The statement blamed Boston's Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city polices that it said “not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” vowing that DHS will arrest criminals released by local authorities. “Under President Trump and (DHS Secretary Kristi) Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. The Justice Department sued Wu earlier this month over Boston's sanctuary policy, which limits cooperation with federal immigration efforts. It's about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate,” Massachusetts Gov. CNN reported last month that Trump administration officials had discussed a major immigration enforcement operation in Boston in the coming weeks, according to two sources familiar with the talks. CNN has previously reported that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace and was contemplating how involved he should be in brokering a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders. Russian attack: Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine said Sunday that Russia is “escalating” following its largest air attack of the war overnight. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these. The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.” Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war overnight into Sunday, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time. An infant was among at least two people killed in drone strikes on several residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv's city office said. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said she hasn't seen any indication the Trump administration is preparing to imminently send National Guard troops into Chicago, as she accused President Donald Trump of “essentially declaring war on a major city in his own nation.” She said personnel there told her they've only been asked to provide “office space for ICE” as Chicago braces for a federal immigration crackdown. “No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to in order to support troops into Chicago,” Duckworth said today. She called Trump's social media post on Saturday saying Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR”  as “not normal.” “And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the president of the United States.” Duckworth said she and her Democratic colleagues in Illinois, Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents part of the Chicago suburbs, asked the Department of Homeland Security for more information about what they were preparing, but did not hear back. The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its crime and immigration efforts, focusing their attention on Chicago. Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, a doctor, defended Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after a tense hearing leading to criticism from other Republican senators who are also physicians. But I think that you know this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines,” said Marshall, who practiced for over 25 years. “President Trump chose Robert F Kennedy Jr., to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing,” Marshall said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” Marshall, who is an OBGYN, also commented on an upcoming report from HHS linking people taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism in children. Marshall said he recommends patients to not take anything during pregnancy because “we don't know what we don't know” and said he wants “gold standard studies to help us figure this out.” He, however, did add “as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.” “There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,” Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement Friday. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN's Manu Raju that the city doesn't need federal troops after former President Donald Trump threatened to send the National Guard. Wes Moore instead announced a surge of state law enforcement to fight crime. The World Health Organization made a public show of support for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today, with its leader saying in posts across social media feeds that the American agency's work is “invaluable and must be protected.” “When I was Ethiopia's Health Minister, I sent a team to Atlanta to learn from the US CDC, and a significant part of what the Ethiopian Public Health Agency does is based on these best practices,” wrote Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who serves as WHO's director-general. Florida's surgeon general said today his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandates and defended the state's decision to do so, saying,“it's really about ethics.” “I mean, is it appropriate for a government or any other entity to dictate to you what you should put in your body? No, it's absolutely not appropriate,” Dr. Joseph Ladapo ​told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “You have sovereignty over your body.” Last week, Florida announced that it will be the first state to seek to remove immunization requirements for everyone, including school children, which have been in place since the 1980s. Florida, like all US states, grants exemptions from immunizations for medical and religious reasons. The vast majority of these children were exempt for non-medical reasons. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department will issue rebates if the Supreme Court upholds a ruling that President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were an overstep of power, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today. “We would have to give a refund on about half of the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” Bessent said during an appearance on NBC News' “Meet the Press.” He added that, “If the court says it, we'd have to do it.” But there are “numerous other avenues” that can be taken instead of rebates, Bessent said, without citing details. Tom Homan, White House border czar, defended President Donald Trump's “Chipocalypse Now” social media post from a day earlier, which said Chicago “will find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” “I think his words are being taken out of context. Democratic officials in Chicago and Illinois condemned the post Saturday, with Gov. JB Pritzker calling it “not normal.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and US Rep. Mike Quigley, who represents part of the city, described the post as an example of authoritarianism. CNN previously reported the Trump administration's plans to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, and that officials there were bracing for it to begin as early as Friday. Asked  how many National Guard troops would be in Chicago, Homan declined to respond, saying that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.” Asked whether there will be any action in Chicago this week, Homan responded “absolutely,” adding, “you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.” Hyundai immigration raid: He was also asked by CNN whether there will be more extensive immigration raids, like the one at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia that led to 475 arrests. “The short answer is, yes, we're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan said. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defended his leadership earlier in an interview on “Fox and Friends,” as we just reported. Jerome Adams, who served as US surgeon general during President Donald Trump's first administration, called for Kennedy to be fired as controversy continues to swirl over his handling of vaccine approvals. Adams' comments came after a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill last week, where Kennedy was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans about his views on vaccines and the recent exodus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the resignation of its director, over tighter vaccine policies Kennedy was pushing. “I'm deeply concerned about the health and safety of our nation under RFK's current leadership,” Adams told Blackwell, later adding: “I absolutely believe he is uniquely damaging the credibility of federal agencies like the CDC, (National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration) and he's putting us at risk.” Read here for more on the RFK Jr. hearing and Adams' remarks. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decried his intense grilling by senators from both parties over major shakeups at the top health agencies as “theater” and defended his leadership. And, you know, they're not the kind of debate or open conversation that democracy would give us at its ideal,” he told “Fox and Friends” on Sunday. His interview on the conservative cable network show continued some of his first comments after a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. Kennedy accused senators on the panel that played a role in his confirmation of being beholden to pharmaceutical companies, without citing evidence, saying “they don't want to hear the answers to the questions that they ask me. They want to make a little speech and then shut me down.” Defending his ousting of Dr. Susan Monarez as director of the CDC, which led to the resignation of several other top health officials, Kennedy told Fox News “we need new blood, and we need new people who are committed to public health and integrity and gold standard science, and the Trump administration is going to make sure that happens.” Pressed on what he sees as the last great success of federal government health agencies, Kennedy answered: “I don't think there have been successes,” claiming that the infiltration of pharmaceutical companies have led to a “series of bad decisions.” After weeks of warnings, Chicago could be the next US city to see National Guard troops rolling through its streets. Local leaders were preparing ahead of this weekend – from the governor bracing for a court fight to parade planners postponing – even while it was not clear troops whether will show up. Officials in Illinois had heard the National Guard will be in place by Friday and ready to act Saturday – in step with an expected immigration enforcement swell – but no one from the Trump administration has told the state of its plans, Democratic Gov. Meanwhile, there are “no immediate plans” to send soldiers to Chicago, Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday after President Donald Trump the prior day called it “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far” following a violent Labor Day weekend and said the feds were “going in,” though without saying when. Read more here on how Chicago was preparing for this weekend. Just ahead of the weekend, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders in the Oval Office Friday and also took questions on a variety of topics from reporters. CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo, Elise Hammond, Samantha Waldenberg, Kit Maher, Aditi Sangal, Jennifer Hansler, Alayna Treene, Donald Judd, Haley Britzky and David Goldman contributed reporting to this post. As we've reported, President Donald Trump is heading to the US Open men's final today after starting his day at the White House, an administration official has told CNN. According to the White House schedule, he'll get there at around 2 p.m. President Donald Trump reposted a meme on social media Saturday saying in part that Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR.” The president's post comes as he has ramped up his rhetoric against Democratic-led cities, with a direct target on Chicago. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Pritzker responded on social media Saturday calling out the president's post as “not normal” and said that his state would not be “intimidated” by the president. Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments and headlines from President Donald Trump's administration. We'll bring you the latest on that, when it happens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire. “We are in a race now between how long can the Ukrainian military hold up, versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.” Bessent argued that expanded tariffs could increase pressure and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin ceasefire negotiations sooner. Bessent's remarks follow the Trump administration's recent move to impose 50% tariffs on India over its continued oil purchases from Russia. The comments came hours after Russia carried out a record attack on Ukraine, killing at least four people and setting fire to a government building in Kyiv. Sonya Bandouil is a North American news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire. Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine on Sept. 7, killing at least four people and injuring more than 40, prompting swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners. Russian forces launched missiles, drones, and glide bombs across Ukraine. "During this war, Ukraine has already reached the level where nearly 60% of the weapons we have, weapons in the hands of our warriors, are Ukrainian-made, and they are strong weapons, many of them cutting-edge," Zelensky said in his evening address. Putin seemingly contradicted Fico on Sept. 3, a day after his meeting with the Slovak leader, again inviting Zelensky to Moscow for a meeting. Days later on Sept. 5, Putin said that he "doesn't see much point" in a meeting with the Ukrainian president. Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia with drones on Sept. 6, injuring 15 people and destroying a kindergarten, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Reuters on Sept. 5 withdrew a video in which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were shown discussing whether humans could live to 150 years old, after China's state broadcaster revoked permission to use the footage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage of raid by US immigration officials showed detained workers in handcuffs and with chains around their ankles South Korea has said negotiations with the US to secure the release of its nationals detained in a raid by US immigration officials on a Hyundai plant in the state of Georgia have been “concluded” and that they would soon be freed and flown home. It follows the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a Hyundai-LG battery site being built in the southern US on Thursday. Footage of the raid released by US authorities showed detained workers, in handcuffs and with chains around their ankles, being loaded on to an inmate transportation bus. “As a result of the swift and united response … negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded,” Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to South Korea's president, Lee Jae Myung, said on Sunday. Once these are completed, a chartered flight will depart to bring our citizens home,” he added. Scrambling to contain the fallout, a senior executive at electric vehicle battery maker LG Energy Solution flew to Georgia on Sunday morning. “The immediate priority now is the swift release of both our LG Energy Solution employees and those of our partner firms,” executive Kim Ki-soo told reporters before boarding a plane. LG Energy Solution has said 47 of its employees had been arrested – 46 South Koreans and one Indonesian. The company has also said about 250 of those arrested were believed to be employed by its contractor, and most of them were South Koreans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seyyed Abbas Araghchi says European nations should engage constructively and not facilitate ‘America's excesses' Iran is ready to form a real and lasting agreement that includes strict monitoring and limits on its domestic uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, its foreign minister, Seyyed Abbas Araghchi, has said. He warns: “If this short opportunity to change course is missed, it will have consequences that could be unprecedentedly destructive for the region and beyond.” Iran is still hoping Europeans can be persuaded to defer snapping back sanctions at the UN security council, arguing that Europe will not benefit from such a move since it will only leave the US in the driving seat on negotiating any new nuclear deal, and Europe isolated. But the conservative-dominated Iranian parliament is still discussing a bill that would require Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions were restored, a move that would free Iran from all requirements to allow UN weapons inspectors into Iran and so shut off all independent access to its nuclear sites. Araghchi's Guardian article is a reproach to the traditional European powers on Iran – France, Germany and the UK – challenging them to explain why it is in their self-interest to have shifted away from being mediators for an multilateral agreement between Iran and the US, and instead “become a facilitator of America's excesses”. Araghchi met with the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in Doha last Thursday. He claims European leaders have made a huge mistake if they think that by being tough with Iran, the US president, Donald Trump, will stop viewing them as secondary actors and give them a place on the world stage. Washington's message is clear: to gain a foothold, the three countries must demonstrate unwavering loyalty.” “Israel may present itself as capable of fighting on behalf of the west, but as we saw in June, the truth is that Iran's powerful armed forces are once again ready and capable of defeating Israel to the point where it will be forced to turn to ‘Grandpa' for salvation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France's government is once again on the verge of collapse. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces near-certain defeat in a confidence vote over a disputed austerity plan, a showdown that threatens President Emmanuel Macron's authority at home and casts doubt on Paris' ability to deliver on its ambitious promises abroad – including security guarantees for Ukraine. Bayrou has staked his survival on a confidence vote scheduled for Monday, September 8. But the plan – which includes reducing public holidays and raising healthcare contributions – has triggered anger at home. Trade unions are preparing strikes, while opposition parties from the far left to the far right have pledged to vote against Bayrou. Francois Bayrou is one of the most familiar names in French politics. As president, Macron briefly made him justice minister, and after Michel Barnier was forced out in late 2024, Bayrou was elevated to prime minister to hold together Macron's fragile coalition. But with his budget collapsing and support evaporating, the man once hailed as a stabilizer is now being blamed for dragging Macron further into crisis. The mechanism has existed since 1958 and is legal, but risky: once Article 49.3 is triggered, opposition lawmakers have 24 hours to file a no-confidence motion. Bayrou's decision to use 49.3 turned his €44 billion austerity plan into a survival gamble. The package included unpopular measures such as cutting public holidays and raising healthcare charges. Instead of rallying deputies behind him, the move united nearly every opposition faction. What was meant to be a show of strength turned into political suicide. Or he can gamble on snap elections, which polls suggest would hand more seats to Le Pen's National Rally. With Macron's approval ratings already scraping historic lows, either choice would deepen the sense of a weakened presidency. Commentators warn that if markets lose confidence in France's ability to control its 5.4% of GDP deficit and 110% debt-to-GDP ratio, the country could face a crisis reminiscent of Britain's “mini-budget” turmoil under Liz Truss. On foreign policy, Bayrou has been a vocal supporter of Kiev. In March 2025, he openly criticized Washington for pushing Ukraine to negotiate peace with Moscow, calling such demands “unbearable.” He argued that pushing concessions would humiliate Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and amount to rewarding Russia. Inside Macron's government, Bayrou has been one of the strongest advocates of sustained European backing for Ukraine, insisting that Paris must stand firm. That damages the bloc's credibility as a reliable funder at a time when Germany is reluctant to shoulder the costs alone. Macron has also styled himself as the champion of “strategic autonomy,” calling together with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for a stronger European defense role. But as the Financial Times has noted, those ambitions collide with weak finances and political divisions. With France paralyzed, the EU's claim to speak with one voice looks hollow, and existing rifts – from Hungary's open skepticism to Slovakia's resistance on energy and sanctions – are harder to conceal. Bayrou's downfall would leave Macron weaker at home and less credible abroad. France's ability to anchor the EU's Ukraine policy looks shaky, Kiev's guarantees are cast into doubt, and Moscow can argue convincingly that Europe's talk of peace is inseparable from its rush to militarize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No sirens were sounded, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that the incident was under review. It is rare for sirens not to warn of incoming projectiles in Israel, which has a multi-layered system to defend against missiles and drones. The vast majority of drones fired by the Houthis in Yemen have been intercepted before striking Israel. Israel strikes Yemen after Houthis fire new type of missile Videos shared on social media showed shattered windows and glass-covered floors at the airport's arrival hall. Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's emergency response service, said that they received a report at 2:35 p.m. local time about a drone that fell in the Ramon Airport area. MDA said two people sustained minor injuries as a result of the attack. In early May, a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis penetrated Israel's air defenses and struck Ben Gurion international airport near Tel Aviv, halting flights for about 30 minutes. Israel's long-range Arrow interceptor missile failed to stop the Houthi projectile before it hit. Israel says it has ‘fully' disabled Yemen's main airport in escalating strikes on Houthi rebels Israel and the Houthis have engaged in an escalating long-range conflict since the Iran-backed rebel group began targeting Israel in what the group's leaders say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. After the Houthis fired a ballistic missile armed with a new type of cluster warhead in late August, Israel carried out a strike that killed the group's prime minister and other senior officials. Asked if the Houthi's military chief and defense minister were killed, the official said, “If they are not dead, we will continue to hunt them down.” Israel has also carried out strikes against Houthi military targets and civilian infrastructure the IDF says is used by the rebel group.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is the main reason given for why we should save more for retirement and retire later. It is also why Stephen Harper's government felt that Old Age Security pensions should start at 67, rather than 65. When an important long-term trend suddenly reverses, it is natural to wonder why. The following reasons represent my personal views on this subject, supported by statistics, where available. COVID-19 was one obvious factor contributing to stalled longevity, but it only explains the dip in life expectancy in 2021 and 2022. Another factor is that, for many years, medical advances have prolonged lives. But perhaps that low-hanging fruit has already been picked, and further increases in longevity will be harder to come by. The increasing use of opioids in recent years –⁠ especially fentanyl –⁠ is also leading to younger deaths. There were 7,146 toxicity deaths in 2024, and while this represents just slightly more than 2 per cent of all Canadian deaths during this period, those affected were younger, in age groups where mortality rates are usually low. MAID now accounts for one death in every 20 in the country, and while there's no way to know exactly how much longer people would have otherwise lived, it's possible that it is contributing to the longevity changes we are seeing. In spite of these demographic headwinds, my best guess is that life expectancy will resume its upward trend, but more slowly than was the case before 2015 and more slowly than demographers and actuaries would have expected a few short years ago. If so, it means that life annuities are currently more expensive than they should be, since insurance companies build future improvements into mortality assumption when determining pricing, and may have built in more than they should.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks against Russia's energy infrastructure in an effort to put economic pressure on Moscow and undermine its ability to finance the war. The "8-N" control station sustained multiple strikes, with a fire erupting near its pumping station and tank farm, according to Ukraine's military. The facility is part of the "Steel Horse" oil pipeline complex, which has a pumping capacity of 10.5 million tons and is considered strategically important for transporting fuel to Russian forces, according to the General Staff. Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, said the "8-N" facility is also strategically important for transporting oil products from Belarusian refineries to Russia, particularly from the Mozyr and Novopolotsk plants. Located roughly 500 kilometers (311 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, the refinery is among the largest in southern Russia, producing over 6 million tons of fuel annually. Photos and videos circulating on social media appeared to show a large fire rising from the refinery in Krasnodar Krai. Officials in the Krasnodar Krai previously claimed that a technological workshop had caught fire at the refinery, adding that no casualties had been reported. Beyond targeting oil infrastructure, Ukraine's General Staff said Ukrainian forces also struck Russian personnel positions and logistics depots in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has intensified long-range strikes against Russian energy facilities, targeting refineries and depots to cut into Moscow's war funding. Kyiv has previously struck the Ilsky Oil Refinery on multiple occasions — most recently on July 7 when a drone struck one of the facility's technological workshops, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. Krasnodar Krai, a strategic region along Russia's Black Sea coast, has increasingly come under Ukrainian drone attacks as Kyiv extends the range of its strikes deep into Russian territory. In August alone, Ukraine struck at least 12 refineries, shutting down facilities representing over 17% of national processing capacity, or 1.1 million barrels per day. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire. In addition to missile production, Russia plans to manufacture a range of modern military hardware by the end of 2025, including 57 combat aircraft. Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine on Sept. 7, killing at least four people and injuring more than 40, prompting swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners. At least eight Ukrainian regions, as well as the city of Kyiv, came under attack over the past 24 hours. Russian forces launched missiles, drones, and glide bombs across Ukraine. "During this war, Ukraine has already reached the level where nearly 60% of the weapons we have, weapons in the hands of our warriors, are Ukrainian-made, and they are strong weapons, many of them cutting-edge," Zelensky said in his evening address. Putin seemingly contradicted Fico on Sept. 3, a day after his meeting with the Slovak leader, again inviting Zelensky to Moscow for a meeting. Days later on Sept. 5, Putin said that he "doesn't see much point" in a meeting with the Ukrainian president. Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia with drones on Sept. 6, injuring 15 people and destroying a kindergarten, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Reuters on Sept. 5 withdrew a video in which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were shown discussing whether humans could live to 150 years old, after China's state broadcaster revoked permission to use the footage.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Sunday announced his intention to resign as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in the recent House of Councillors election. Ishiba recently dispatched economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa to Washington, where both countries signed a memorandum of understanding and a relevant executive order was issued by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ishiba had previously said that he would make a decision on whether to resign at an appropriate time, “after doing what needs to be done.” “Now that negotiations concerning U.S. tariff measures have attained certain results, I believe this is the appropriate time to step aside and make way for my successor,” Ishiba said. Following the ruling parties' defeat in the House of Councillors election in July, four key LDP executives, including Moriyama, expressed their intention to resign from their posts to take responsibility. There had been growing calls among LDP lawmakers to hold a party presidential election before Ishiba's term of office expired.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A transit of the Taiwan Strait by Canadian and Australian naval vessels “sent out wrong signals and heightened security risks,” China said Saturday, as Western militaries continue to assert their right to pass through the disputed waters despite repeated protestations by Beijing. The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec, accompanied by the Australian destroyer HMAS Brisbane, transited the waters separating democratic Taiwan from China's east coast on Saturday morning, closely followed by Chinese naval and air forces. In a statement, Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesman for the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, called the transit “provocative,” and said his forces “remain on high alert at all times” to “resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty.” Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence said 21 Chinese aircraft, including drones, as well as six warships, had been detected in the Strait on Saturday, adding it was “closely monitoring” the situation. In recent years, the United States and allied militaries have asserted their right to transit the strait as part of “freedom of navigation” exercises, infuriating Beijing, which has increased its military presence in the sensitive waters as part of a pressure campaign against Taiwan, which China claims sovereignty over. The Canadian military does not typically publicize or comment on such actions, but Saturday's transit appears to be the first since February, and the first under Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has attempted to repair relations with Beijing that frayed under his predecessor Justin Trudeau. HMCS Ville de Quebec, a Halifax-class frigate, has been deployed to the Western Pacific since April, on what Ottawa describes as a “forward-presence mission to the Indo-Pacific region to promote peace, stability, and the rules-based international order.” Canadians stand guard for subs in the Western Pacific as Ottawa brings more naval power to tense waters In a statement, General Romeo Brawner, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said the drill “reaffirms our collective resolve to protect our seas and uphold a rules-based international order.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>
