                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team great Michael Bradley joked that he didn't need all the attention on him Saturday. The team honored the American soccer great prior to kickoff of its friendly against South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium, a short drive away from Bradley's hometown of Princeton, N.J. You know, football has taken me a lot of places throughout the world, but whenever people ask where's home, it's still, it's still New Jersey,” Bradley said Saturday. “Honestly, for any of you who know me, I'm excited, but I don't need [the celebration], but for the people who love me and for the people who have supported me every step of my career, then it's nice to share with them.” Bradley retired from professional play in 2023 and quietly entered the coaching ranks, which eventually led to him being hired as the Red Bulls II coach earlier this year. His name remains one of the most prominent in USMNT history. He ranks second all time for the national team in assists with 23. That list includes center back Tim Ream, who served as captain Saturday night against South Korea and previously played with Bradley on the national team. “Just watching him, and knowing how professional he was, and the leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together, is something that I always left camp in awe of, really,” Ream said earlier this week. Bradley had been around the national team a bit this week while they were training in New Jersey at the Red Bulls' facility and said that it was good to see so much soccer happening at the facility, with the two Red Bull squads and the USMNT training all in one place. However, he didn't feel the need to impart any wisdom while crossing paths. “Generally speaking, these guys don't need me telling them what to do,” Bradley said, before expressing confidence in the direction of the program. “They're going in a good way,” he continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It probably did not take a formal ceremony this weekend to ensure no San Diego Wave player would ever wear the number 13 again. Not when that player—Alex Morgan—was the club's first big star, first to score a hat trick and 15 goals in a season, and first former player to join the ownership group. And that is just a quick overview of Alex Morgan's life since 2022. The reality of Alex Morgan is that she has been in our lives since the turn of the 2010s, and there is no sign of her leaving any time soon. Few have had the staying power of Morgan. She has since found time to become a Wave minority owner, and it certainly appears she will be more than a figurehead. It is easy to remember the famous Megan Rapinoe to Abby Wambach equalizer against Brazil in the 2011 World Cup quarterfinals. The most important goal along the way came from a 21-year-old Alex Morgan, a stoppage time winner in November of 2010 to lift up a wrecked U.S. team in the intercontinental playoff away leg in Padua. Remember the epic Olympic semifinal at Old Trafford when Canada led three times only to be undone by a resilient U.S. side and some questionable officiating? It was Morgan who beat Erin McLeod with a header in stoppage time of extra time to send the U.S. through a gold medal match they would win over Japan. When the National Women's Soccer League kicked off in 2013, Morgan was a clear choice to be one of the faces. The Thorns made her one of three Americans “allocated” by U.S. Soccer. But the new owners knew that it was time for Morgan to move on from Portland, and they wanted her as the cornerstone. Her tenure in Orlando was a bit hit-and-miss from a soccer perspective, but her presence in the inaugural Pride team made the club an immediate marquee attraction. And Morgan wanted to live in California again. In the Wave's first regular season home match, Morgan scored four goals. She rarely turned down an interview, even in the worst of times after big losses. Time will tell the story, but early on in her life as an owner, it appears Morgan will still be available, still willing to put her face on the sport she has carried at times. But perhaps Morgan's greatest contribution to the NWSL was carved out behind a keyboard. Morgan posted a screenshot of an email then-commissioner Lisa Baird had sent to Mana Shim, informing her that a prior investigation into Riley was closed and would not be revisited. From that moment on, there were no more denials. Baird's tenure as commissioner was no longer viable and she soon resigned under pressure. Much of the NWSL's explosive growth in the four years since can be traced to that moment of reckoning. It was just Alex Morgan, delivering for the sport as she has always done. The club paid hefty sums to draft, sign, and extend Thompson. The playoff field has its first confirmed guest, and transfer rumors are swirling over... The club paid hefty sums to draft, sign, and extend Thompson. Gotham has not had a lot to cheer about in 2025, especially as it...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The process of getting your US visa approved can be quite difficult and anxious. However, one Indian couple has opened up about their interview experience following approval of their B1/B2 visas for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Like many other candidates, their visa interview at the US embassy in New Delhi started with a lengthy wait as hundreds of applicants waited in queues for interviews and biometric scans. “I saw many people fainting because of the heat, which was concerning. I really hope it didn't affect anyone's interview,” they said. “We'd really love to visit for the World Cup next year,” they stated. The applicant mentioned that they had been working for four months and provided a quick overview of their function and duties there. “I also told her about my previous work experience, which spans over six years,” the applicant revealed in the post.

The applicant spoke of their love of travel and claimed that they had just returned from a honeymoon trip to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the United Arab Emirates. The officer smirked and stated, “So it's your fault.” The official finally responded, “Congratulations, your visas have been approved.” Disclaimer: This story is based on a social media post and Hindustan Times has not independently verified the user's claims.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jude Bellingham could make a partial return to Real Madrid training in the coming days as he continues his recovery from shoulder surgery, a report has revealed. A return towards the end of October has been suggested and all the signs suggest Bellingham is making a healthy recovery. While most of his teammates are away on international duty, MARCA state Bellingham is planning to step up his return to the grass. If all goes according to plan, Bellingham could even feature in light team training, having insisted to club officials that he is feeling in excellent shape after his surgery. Indeed, it is claimed that medical staff have even had to try and calm Bellingham down and delay his comeback plans, fearing the Englishman's optimism could actually work against him. They do not want to risk aggravating an issue which could require another lengthy spell on the sidelines. All eyes will be on Bellingham's role in the Madrid side under Alonso. Having played in an advanced midfield role at the Club World Cup, he is expected to take on a deeper position this year following the departure of Luka Modrić. “I see him as a midfielder,” Alonso said of Bellingham when asked whether there could be more minutes as a second striker this year.

HARRISON, N.J. – Nine months out from a World Cup, it is unrealistic to expect most national teams to be the finished product, especially in a friendly where experimentation should be encouraged. World Cup-bound teams, though, should be offering a preview of what that finished product might be and in the U.S. men's national team's case, that might be the organized chaos head coach Mauricio Pochettino described as the ideal look for his team. As the USMNT dragged themselves through a 2-0 defeat to South Korea on Saturday, though, organization and stylistic chaos were in short supply. "I think we should learn a lot," Pochettino said post-match – before trying to focus on the positives. He was not necessarily wrong when listing some sources of optimism. The USMNT outshot South Korea 17-5 and generated 2.27 expected goals to the opponent's 0.74, and in a second half that saw Pochettino form a back three with Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon and substitute Chris Richards, the hosts conceded just one shot on target. It was a game of moments in some ways, the visitors making the most of their four shots on target with two first half goals and the USMNT perhaps unlucky not to have a goal of their own. "Overall, I think we were better than South Korea but [in] the end, if you are not clinical in your own area and then in the opposite box, it's difficult and because we create more chances, we have the feeling that we controlled the game but in some actions, we concede," Pochettino said. I am so pleased in the way that we are evolving from the Gold Cup today with different players, different roster from the Gold Cup but also the players [are] starting to understand what we want from them. The capacity to be [in] the game after 2-0, that was difficult against a team that was really good." Those small moments were costly, though, and did nothing to help Pochettino's case on Saturday. The head coach had deemed this month's friendlies, which includes a Tuesday clash against Japan, as the last chance to vet inexperienced players but Saturday's performance suggested that Pochettino's experiment has perhaps already run its course. The performance offered fresh reminders of well-known USMNT habits, both in defense and attack. The USA's backline still looks fairly uncomfortable without Richards, who could not start because of a small issue he arrived to camp with, and Antonee Robinson, who got this international break off. Sergino Dest is a thrill to watch with the ball at his feet and the opponent's goal in his sights but is lax in defense, most notably on Son Heung-min's 18th minute goal. Heung-min Son strikes to give Korea Republic the lead against the USMNT 💥…and against his former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino 😏 pic.twitter.com/Gh98ve6kfD The player singled out the most was Blackmon, who did not impress on either goal in his USMNT debut and has done little to unseat Ream or Richards. Midfielder Tyler Adams argued that first impressions are can be deceiving, using himself as an example. "It's not always easy to come into a national team. That's the difference of playing with the national team compared to playing in your club in Europe where you can get comfortable every single day." Pochettino, perhaps fairly, that playing time is the only way to truly vet their talents, the disjointed performances a natural result of the mix-and-match approach the head coach has taken to preparing this team for a World Cup on home soil. "We are testing too many things," Pochettino said. Sometimes, though, those tinkers come when it's too late and for a notable chunk of time, create an untenable game state. Pochettino's USMNT may have recovered well from a 2-0 deficit but the 2-0 deficit itself raised alarm bells, the organized chaos he teased pushed to the wayside by chaos from a lack of defensive organization. There is a constant sense of catch-up the USMNT seems to be playing in this period of experimentation, a valiant project but one that may have lasted a few weeks too long. With each passing performance, preconceived notions seem to be winning the battle. "We knew the idea, I think our rules got a little bit twisted," Adams said. "They found some issues pretty easily in the first half. We said if we would go three in the back -- Diego [Luna] stepped out, Josh [Sargent] joined them in, Christian [Pulisic] to man-to-man and I think we were just missing triggers on a lot of them and then we were a little bit too late to jump. Saturday's outing deserves some of the leniency of a friendly match but even then, it is the latest sign of a worrying trend – the USMNT have been outscored 11-2 in their last seven first halves against opponents ranked in the top 25 and Pochettino has just one win against a team ranked in FIFA's top 30. The trend predates Pochettino, his predecessor Gregg Berhalter not boasting a terrific record against top 20 opponents – he had five wins in that category, four against Mexico. It forces the question: Was there anything new and of value to be gathered from the USMNT's latest loss, or was it another bump in the road that only added additional hand-wringing as this group's high-stakes summer inches closer and closer?

Trump has built the bulk of his second term's domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate. He'll be watching the men's final between second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and No. 1 seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, 24, of Italy, from Rolex's suite. That includes tirelessly promoting cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties around the country and the world that bear his name. Any negative reaction to Trump's presence won't be shown on ABC's national telecast, per standard policy, the U.S. Tennis Association says. “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organization said in a statement. Trump was once a U.S. Open mainstay, but hasn't attended since he was loudly booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign. Trump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Alcaraz said before the final that having Trump on-hand would be a privilege and “great for tennis,” but also suggested that such sentiment went for any president watching from the stands. “I will try not to be focused, and I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump's attendance. “I don't want myself to be nervous because of it.” Trump golfed at the Virginia club outside Washington on Saturday, as he has many recent weekends once the summer weather turned too hot for playing near Mar-a-Lago. Having a sitting president attend is unusual and, before Trump, hadn't happened since Clinton went to the 2000 tournament. Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended the event's opening night in 2023.</p>

He wandered, alone, after his U.S. men's national team lost 2-0 against South Korea. The thousands of fans still there were Koreans. “It was like a home match,” South Korea head coach Hong Myung-bo said through an interpreter after the match.

The USMNT, over the past three years, has now been a quasi-away team on home soil against opponents from all five major soccer continents, with respect to Oceania. They drowned out one solitary section of USMNT supporters, who, with the help of a stadium emcee and a drum, tried to build up to the game with a rhythmic clap; several seconds in, the claps could not be heard. They came in national team jerseys with the names of their heroes, Son Heung-min or Park Ji-sung, printed on the back. They came in Tottenham Hotspur and LAFC jerseys for Son. There were Bayern Munich and Napoli kits for Kim Min-jae. Occasionally, amid the seas of red, a Christian Pulisic jersey would appear. They roared when Korean players emerged for warmups and bowed to all sides of the arena. But when the game began, they only had one team to cheer for. U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino was asked about them after the match, and a couple months ago, during the Concacaf Gold Cup, he might have launched into a spiel about how U.S. fans needed to bring more passion. “I want to be positive for now,” he said. Part of the trend is irreversible, inescapable in a country as diverse as the U.S., a country with so many immigrant communities that feel drawn to their native country's team because it represents a touchpoint with home. But part of it, too, is about the dullness of this current USMNT and its monotonous, meaningless runway toward the World Cup. And the U.S. team played soccer that was equally uninspiring. Korea, meanwhile, launched a regular cadence of attacks, and fans leapt from their seats each time. They then erupted when Son scored the opening goal. They erupted again when Lee Dong-gyeong doubled the lead. And then, for minutes after the final whistle, they stayed put. They whipped out cameraphones as the Korean players took a lap of honor. They waved, and screamed, and craned their necks for a clear sight of those players, who clapped back at them, then bowed to acknowledge the support. One team (and their fans) seem ready for the World Cup… And their U.S. counterparts, outnumbered and beaten, trudged back to a locker room, far removed from any World Cup excitement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino said his team was "better than South Korea" because it created more chances and allowed just one shot on target in the second half. Midfielder Tyler Adams added that getting new faces into the national team and bringing back some old standbys was a positive. "I don't think it was a bad performance," the U.S. captain added. - USMNT player ratings: 3/10 for Poch as defensive issues exposed - U.S. to continue World Cup prep vs. Uruguay, Paraguay - World Cup: Who has qualified, and how rest can make it Lee Jae-Sung, under zero pressure, found U.S. defender Tristan Blackmon on an island, and his through ball found Son in stride to fire past goalkeeper Matt Freese in the 18th minute. Then just before halftime a clever combination put Son through on goal. On both goals, the U.S. backline was stretched too far apart, leaving defenders isolated. "There were moments where guys were getting pulled [out] a little bit more than we usually do and a little bit more than we work on," Ream said. "And again, it's one of those things that you look at a few guys who it's their first game back with the national team. While Blackmon is deserving of criticism, this goes beyond one player making his U.S. debut. Sergiño Dest didn't offer much help defensively, showing that for all of his attacking ability, he can still be a defensive liability. "I think our roles got a little bit twisted," Adams said. "They found solutions pretty easily in the first half. ... And I think we just missed our [defensive] triggers on a lot of them and we were a little bit too late to jump, and when you're too late to jump, you end up chasing shadows, and that's what it felt like at times." With the two-goal cushion, South Korea never had to open up and have its defense exposed. All of this is why it's hard to take too many positives away from the match. It's also difficult to not feel alarm over the direction this U.S. team is heading. It's hard to think of any match since then.

But the 2026 World Cup will be littered with such players. It's not like the U.S. will get a break from that kind of competition next summer. Pochettino even went so far as to say that results won't be important until next summer's World Cup, recalling how the 2002 Argentina team he was part of entered the tournament on a roll, only to flame out in the group stage. Granted, pre-World Cup form isn't a guarantee of anything. Generating some momentum will not only do that, but also instill some confidence in a side that is at a low ebb. "But I understand [Pochettino's] thought process and we talked about it in there is you could still have good performances and not necessarily get the result. But yeah, I think at a certain time it's important to have some results." Combined with the coaching change that saw Pochettino hired, this cycle is anything but normal. The combinations of players aren't always making sense, either. Last cycle, the pairing of Tim Weah and Dest on the right side worked because Weah is a player willing to track back and provide some defensive protection. You don't want Pulisic having to track back anyway. But it was no accident that South Korea's first goal came from Dest's side. In many ways, Pochettino is taking an immense gamble. That runs the risk of encountering scenarios at the tournament that he didn't prepare for with his first-choice players, all because he's giving reps to performers that are long shots to make the squad. For now, Pochettino insists that wins are just around the corner. "I think the results will arrive soon for sure," he said. The hope is that it starts on Tuesday against Japan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HARRISON, N.J. — If ever there were an example of statistics not telling the story of a soccer game, then what we saw on Saturday was it. They had twice as many corners and fouls. "Overall, I think we were better than South Korea," U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said afterward. Unfortunately for Pochettino and his players, that's not even close to being true. Son then set up a second goal for Lee Dong-gyeong before the first half was even finished. The day before Saturday's match, Pochettino said that results during this international window — the U.S. will face Japan in Columbus, Ohio on Tuesday — were secondary to "how we are going to compete." Yet while the Americans showed more fight than they did the last time European-based stars like Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah were with the squad in March, when they were upset by Panama in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals, they looked every bit as disjointed. The Koreans, to be fair, are a far tougher foe. Pulisic was as ineffective as he was last spring despite skipping the Gold Cup over the summer to physically and mentally refresh, and despite another strong start to the season with Italian titan AC Milan. "We need to be sharp at all times, you know?," said Sergino Dest, who made his first international appearance since undergoing ACL surgery 18 months ago. On both Korean tallies, the U.S. back line was carved open far too easily. 1 center back Chris Richards on the bench because of what Pochettino suggested was a minor physical issue, 29-year-old MLS lifer Tristan Blackmon made his USMNT debut and was caught out on Son's opener. (Richards eventually came on with 28 minutes of regular time remaining.) "We utilized our speed," said Korean manager Hong Myung-bo. "The opponent wasn't prepared for this, maybe." "Now," Ream said, "You're having to chase the game." "I am very disappointed about the result," Pochettino said. "When you lose, it's difficult to find positive things." When I asked Pochettino when winning some of the nine remaining friendlies before next summer's U.S. co-hosted World Cup becomes more important than competing or moral victories, the former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss didn't hesitate. "That is my message to the fans," he added. "We are going to arrive [at the World Cup] in a very good condition. And with the help of the fans, I think we are going to be very, very difficult to beat." That certainly wasn't the case on Saturday. "I would like to win games before the World Cup," Adams said. "I think at a certain time, it's important to have some results."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Northern Ireland have lost their past nine meetings with Germany Conor Bradley is looking forward to the challenge of facing his new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz when Northern Ireland play Germany in World Cup qualifying on Sunday. Wirtz joined the Anfield club from Bayer Leverkusen in a £116m deal in June and has started three Premier League games for Arne Slot's side. There's a reason we bought him for the money we did," said Bradley, whose first Northern Ireland goal came against the Scotland side of Liverpool team-mate Andy Robertson in March 2024. Bradley [right] made his comeback from injury as a replacement for Wirtz against Newcastle United last month Having played just 10 minutes for Liverpool this season because of injury, Northern Ireland's win over Luxembourg on Thursday evening represented Bradley's first start of the 2025-26 campaign. "It was really disappointing to pick up the injury when I did," he said. "Shocked, probably, to start with," he said of his reaction to hearing news of Slovakia's win after coming off the pitch in Luxembourg. "I think you can look at it both ways. Obviously, that means the group's wide open now which is good for us [and] if we can get a positive result it's only good for us." "They've got some top players, so it's always nice going up against top players and seeing where you're at compared to them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Mexico and Japan National Soccer teams battled it out in a friendly game at the Oakland Coliseum Saturday night. Alexis Nacaspaca felt he needed to attend the game. "It's been years since Mexico played here," Nacaspaca stated. He has lived in the Bay Area for about half his life, moving here from Mexico when he was 14 years old. While this is supposed to be just a fun event, in the current political climate, he can't help but still be concerned about immigration authorities showing up to an event like this. But of course, we are worried about it." Back in June, when Mexico played a Gold Cup match in Los Angeles, the Mexican President urged U.S. officials not to target people attending the game. CBS Bay Area's Amanda Hari asked Nacaspaca if he feels safe at the game. "Um, that's a difficult question," Nacaspaca said. "I don't know how to answer that." Kanata is on the other side of the match-up, excited to show up and rally for Japan. "We are born and raised in Japan, so we have to show support," Kanata exclaimed. He believed Japan could win, but ultimately, it didn't matter. "I just want to see a good game." Nacaspaca agrees, saying it's about the experience and being together. "It's a friendly game, we just get to hang out, have fun, enjoy the music, enjoy the food," said Nacaspaca. Both teams could end up back in the Bay Area in 2026 for the FIFA World Cup.</p>
