                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They found that treating the male mice in their study with estrogen or estradiol and antioxidant agents eliminated this rapid cell aging. To reduce the intake of carbohydrates and support the supply of fats, therefore, the keto diet promotes consumption of “high fat, very low-carbohydrate foods such as animal proteins, full-fat dairy, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables,” according to Routhenstein. People on the keto diet are encouraged to eat fewer carbohydrate-rich foods such as grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes, and added sugars. As a long-term eating regimen, the keto diet is associated with several risks. In addition, the diet may lead to disordered eating and social isolation. Much of the research regarding diets has focused on males' responses to their effects. “It would be interesting,' he said, “to assess the effects of diet on male and female sex hormones, such as estrogen for women and testosterone for men, and how diets may play a role in increasing or decreasing levels to a certain extent, and how that impacts the role these hormones have on their specific genders' physiology.” Ng noted that the insights suggested in this study of mice, however, must be viewed as preliminary. “Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” Ng said. “There is much more heterogeneity in the findings of effects in humans, and gender effects are likely more varied as well, compared to mice data across genders,” he noted. “If these results can be replicated in human beings, there is the possibility of this specific effect reducing the age acceleration in males, although this would, of course, have to be weighed against known side effects of estrogen therapy in men,” said Ng. He added that it is unknown whether this therapy would need to be continued after the person had discontinued a keto diet. “I think a purely anti-oxidant approach could also help reduce the aging effect to some degree,” hypothesized Ng. “In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” Routhenstein pointed out. “[T]o remain in true ketosis, carbohydrate intake must stay extremely low, something that is very difficult to maintain long term without compromising nutritional adequacy. “The potential risks outweigh the benefits, especially when more balanced, sustainable approaches are available and have been shown to improve heart health, inflammation, and longevity,” Routhenstein concluded.
