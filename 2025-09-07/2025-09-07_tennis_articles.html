                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Not sure if we can get on the court for pictures -- the rain is coming in,” Sabalenka said with a real sense of urgency. No matter, for the hard work was done. Sabalenka had just won her fourth Grand Slam singles title, equaling Naomi Osaka. Only Iga Swiatek, with six, has more among active players not named Venus Williams. How has Sabalenka's success the past three years raised her own expectations? “I think we all have really high expectations, but I'm trying to shift my focus on myself and developing as a player,” she said. “Every time, I'm trying to play my best and see how far I can go in this sport. I hope to do it many more.” “I don't want to put a limit on it. I just want to focus on becoming a better player and see how far I can get. Hopefully, I can win many more, but who knows? After winning her first major title of the year, Sabalenka repeatedly said she was speechless in interviews on-court, with ESPN interviews and reporters, yet she somehow managed to find the words to express her thoughts on this emotional victory. What exactly were you feeling and thinking at that moment? After earlier this season in the Grand Slam finals, it was super emotional. For me, winning this title means a lot. I didn't let them take control of me. I was just fighting and playing really great tennis on court today. By your standards, you were a little conservative today -- only one ace and 13 winners. We definitely have a tactic against Amanda. I felt like giving her some space and stopping my arms, making the game slower, would only benefit her. And this match I was just trying to put back all the speed and pressure she was putting on me. And the serve, whenever you give her an angle she's a great returner. Even though you were playing an American in the American Grand Slam, the crowd supported you. And I feel like that throughout the years. Crowd was definitely not on my side. Every year I come, it's more and more support, so I'm really excited for the next years and I hope it's going to be even more than it was today. I saw you sipping some champagne earlier. How will you celebrate with your team tonight? What does your fall schedule look like? I'm going to stay in New York for a little while. Then I'll go back [home] to Miami and then I think to Dubai in preparation for the Asia Swing. For now, we are planning to attend both [WTA 1000s in Beijing and Wuhan, China].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeline Vandromme, 17, became the first Belgian in 14 years to win a girls' Grand Slam title -- and extended her winning streak at all levels to 23 matches and 33 sets -- after defeating Lea Nilsson in the US Open final. Czech sisters Alena and Jana Kovackova took the girls' doubles crown. 14 seed Jeline Vandromme continued her superb summer form by capturing the US Open girls' singles title with a 7-6(2), 6-2 defeat of qualifier Lea Nilsson in the final, coming back from 4-2 down in the first set. Watched by compatriot and former World No. 1 Kim Clijsters, 17-year-old Vandromme became the first Belgian girl to lift a major trophy since An-Sophie Mestach at the 2011 Australian Open, and first to do so at the US Open since Kirsten Flipkens in 2003. She is the fifth Belgian girls' singles Grand Slam champion in the Open Era following Mestach, Flipkens, Justine Henin (Roland Garros 1997) and Nancy Feber (Wimbledon 1993). A classically-trained pianist who was a student at the Conservatory of Bruges, Vandromme has said that only one thing links her two passions: "You have to be disciplined in both things, and you have to practice a lot, every day," she told itftennis.com this week. The discipline has been on show in her nascent tennis career lately, as Vandromme is now on a 23-match winning streak at all levels. She spent July and August playing the ITF World Tour, collecting three consecutive titles -- the Roehampton ITF W35 as a qualifier, then back-to-back ITF W15s in Monastir -- and cutting her PIF WTA Ranking from No. She's also now won 33 sets in a row. Following that, she won both Monastir events and the US Open title without the loss of a set. Her run in Flushing Meadows included a 6-3, 6-2 third-round defeat of Australian Open girls' finalist Kristina Penickova and a 6-3, 6-2 semifinal win over Roland Garros girls' finalist Hannah Klugman. A post shared by US Open (@usopen) Nilsson was the first player to stretch her as far as a tiebreak since the Roehampton final -- appropriately, given the 17-year-old Swede's battling run this week. After losing a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 heartbreaker to Nadia Lagaev in the third round of the Repentigny junior event in Canada the previous week, Nilsson caught a 7 a.m. flight to New York the following morning -- and had to play her first qualifying match that afternoon, which she eked out 5-7, 6-1, [10-7] over Ireland O'Brien. But she still had the energy to dish out two of the main draw's biggest upsets, taking out No. Nilsson was the first Swedish girl in a junior Slam final since Sofia Arvidsson at the 2001 Australian Open, and was bidding to become the first qualifier ever to win the US Open junior title. She has a WTA ranking of No. A nip-and-tuck first set saw Vandromme struggle to find the balance between power and safety as Nilsson delivered solid defense with a few excellent net forays mixed in. Vandromme fired five winners -- nearly half her first-set total of 11 -- in the first game alone but was nonetheless broken, and reined in her aggression to reel Nilsson in from 4-2 down. Once Vandromme had the tiebreak under her belt, though, she loosened up and showed what she was capable of in full flow. Boasting a major weapon in her forehand, Vandromme danced around it with beautiful footwork to unload repeatedly and raise her tally of winners to 25. "Lea played an incredible week and today also. Then I kind of forgot the score. But when the adrenaline takes over, then all I just felt was energy. Yeah, the will to win every point was so big that I don't feel any fatigue or pain." Vandromme didn't have much time to celebrate her singles win: it was into the shower, a change of clothes and a quick bite to eat on the exercise bike before she was back out on court for the girls' doubles final alongside Lithuania's Laima Vladson as the No. However, Vandromme was denied the double crown by Czech sisters Alena and Jana Kovackova, the No. It's a second major girls' doubles title for 17-year-old Alena, who was the 2023 Wimbledon champion alongside Laura Samson, and a first for her younger sister Jana. 642, having compiled a 24-7 pro record including two ITF titles this year. Jeline Vandromme, 17, became the first Belgian in 14 years to win a girls' Grand Slam title -- and extended her winning streak at all levels to 23 matches and 33 sets -- after defeating Lea Nilsson in the US Open final. Czech sisters Alena and Jana Kovackova took the girls' doubles crown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka held off Amanda Anisimova in straight sets, adding a fourth major championship to her career and securing back-to-back US Open titles. Back in January, Aryna Sabalenka was looking for her third straight Australian Open title but lost a three-set final to Madison Keys. Sabalenka won a first-set tiebreak against Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros final, but stumbled badly, losing a second consecutive major championship match in three sets. “After French Open I figured that, ‘OK, maybe it's time for me to sit back and to look at those finals and to maybe learn something,'” Sabalenka said Saturday night. I thought that everything going to go easily my way, which was completely wrong mindset. With a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win over Amanda Anisimova, Sabalenka became the first woman to defend her US Open since Serena Williams in 2014. 1 player all season long, but she broke through with her first major title of the year in the final Grand Slam. “There was a few moments when I was this close [pinching together thumb and index finger] to just letting go,” she said afterward. “But I was like, `Come on, you cannot do that. “All those tough lessons worth this one,” she said, succinctly summing up her year in seven words. Melbourne 🤝 New York@SabalenkaA is a four time Grand Slam champion!#USOpen pic.twitter.com/nTqnIkxg6x She now has two titles each at the US Open and Australian Opens, reminiscent of Naomi Osaka's run from 2018-21, except she accomplished it in three years instead of four. She received a record prize of $5 million for the effort. Her winning percentage is an impressive .794, second only to Iga Swiatek among active players. Anisimova came in with a 6-3 head-to-head record against Sabalenka, but their 10th meeting was something different. Anisimova typically plays an all-or-nothing, hit-or-miss game and in deep runs at Wimbledon and this US Open, it's been working. Ultimately, the difference was Sabalenka's execution on break-point opportunities, winning five of six. Ever since the passing of her father, Aryna Sabalenka has worked to put her family's name in the history books. It was hard not to think back to that Wimbledon final when Anisimova lost the first two games -- the last point was a nervous-looking forehand that gave Sabalenka a service break. Sabalenka, having won nine of 11 points, was up 2-0, 30-love when Anisimova settled down. Let the record show that a fierce forehand down-the-line winner gave her a breakthrough game at the 15-minute mark. After a routine hold (and a blistering body serve that nearly hit Sabalenka), Anisimova held -- and then broke Sabalenka's hefty serve again. Sabalenka came right back with a second break to even it at 3-all. Anisimova broke and held, forcing Sabalenka to serve her way into a tiebreak. Coming in, Sabalenka had won 20 of 21 tiebreaks this year. The final result was predictable -- Sabalenka converted her third match point when Anisimova's service return missed. Sabalenka immediately collapsed to the court and when she stood up there were tears in her eyes. The hard work we put in, like, I deserved to have a Grand Slam title this season. “So when I fell, it was like truly emotions, because it means a lot to defend this title and to bring such a great tennis on court. And to bring the fight and be able to handle my emotions the way I did in this final, it means a lot. Aryna Sabalenka held off Amanda Anisimova in straight sets, adding a fourth major championship to her career and securing back-to-back US Open titles.</p>

Anisimova said she effectively had to serve blind, going off feel and hoping for the best against Sabalenka, who capitalized on the openings. Another telling stat: she won only 10 points on her second serve (36%) all match, including just two in the lopsided opening set.“There was no way of adjusting, because I could not see the ball when I was serving,” she said. “That was a huge shock to my system, because I knew if I can't hold my serve, it was going to be very tough to stay in the match.”Despite her struggles, Anisimova kept herself competitive with her ground game, hitting more winners than Sabalenka (22 to 13). But she also racked up more errors and never settled into a rhythm as Sabalenka powered to her fourth Grand Slam title.
