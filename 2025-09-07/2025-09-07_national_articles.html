                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Sanctions on Russia: President Donald Trump signaled today that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. • US Open final: Trump arrived in New York for the US Open men's final match where he was booed by the crowd. • RFK Jr. defends leadership: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  dismissed his intense grilling by senators on Thursday as “theater,” and said he did not think federal government health agencies have had any great successes. President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social today that he is issuing his “last warning” to Hamas to accept a hostage and ceasefire deal. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one,” the president wrote. Trump's comments on social media come just days after he told reporters that the White House is “in very deep negotiations with Hamas” to secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages and warned of a “tough situation” ahead. President Donald Trump arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium and was booed by the crowd. Follow our live coverage of the US Open men's final. Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state said today that Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is “flat wrong” after he defended his decision to remove vaccine mandates in the state. Public schools should absolutely require children to be vaccinated,” said Schrier, a former physician, after Ladapo said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that the issue is a matter of parental control over what happens to their children's bodies. “When that freedom to not vaccinate their own children and put them at risk comes up against another child's freedom to go to school knowing that they will not get measles or polio or whooping cough, then we have a real problem.” Florida announced last week that it will be the first state to move to end immunization requirements for everyone, including schoolchildren, that have been in place since the 1980s. Ladapo claimed his decision was “based on data and common sense,” yet in the interview with CNN,  said his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandate. The statement blamed Boston's Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city polices that it said “not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” vowing that DHS will arrest criminals released by local authorities. “Under President Trump and (DHS Secretary Kristi) Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. The Justice Department sued Wu earlier this month over Boston's sanctuary policy, which limits cooperation with federal immigration efforts. It's about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate,” Massachusetts Gov. CNN reported last month that Trump administration officials had discussed a major immigration enforcement operation in Boston in the coming weeks, according to two sources familiar with the talks. CNN has previously reported that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace and was contemplating how involved he should be in brokering a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders. Russian attack: Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine said Sunday that Russia is “escalating” following its largest air attack of the war overnight. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these. The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.” Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war overnight into Sunday, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time. An infant was among at least two people killed in drone strikes on several residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv's city office said. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said she hasn't seen any indication the Trump administration is preparing to imminently send National Guard troops into Chicago, as she accused President Donald Trump of “essentially declaring war on a major city in his own nation.” She said personnel there told her they've only been asked to provide “office space for ICE” as Chicago braces for a federal immigration crackdown. “No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to in order to support troops into Chicago,” Duckworth said today. She called Trump's social media post on Saturday saying Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR”  as “not normal.” “And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the president of the United States.” Duckworth said she and her Democratic colleagues in Illinois, Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents part of the Chicago suburbs, asked the Department of Homeland Security for more information about what they were preparing, but did not hear back. The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its crime and immigration efforts, focusing their attention on Chicago. Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, a doctor, defended Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after a tense hearing leading to criticism from other Republican senators who are also physicians. But I think that you know this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines,” said Marshall, who practiced for over 25 years. “President Trump chose Robert F Kennedy Jr., to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing,” Marshall said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” Marshall, who is an OBGYN, also commented on an upcoming report from HHS linking people taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism in children. Marshall said he recommends patients to not take anything during pregnancy because “we don't know what we don't know” and said he wants “gold standard studies to help us figure this out.” He, however, did add “as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.” “There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,” Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement Friday. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN's Manu Raju that the city doesn't need federal troops after former President Donald Trump threatened to send the National Guard. Wes Moore instead announced a surge of state law enforcement to fight crime. The World Health Organization made a public show of support for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today, with its leader saying in posts across social media feeds that the American agency's work is “invaluable and must be protected.” “When I was Ethiopia's Health Minister, I sent a team to Atlanta to learn from the US CDC, and a significant part of what the Ethiopian Public Health Agency does is based on these best practices,” wrote Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who serves as WHO's director-general. Florida's surgeon general said today his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandates and defended the state's decision to do so, saying,“it's really about ethics.” “I mean, is it appropriate for a government or any other entity to dictate to you what you should put in your body? No, it's absolutely not appropriate,” Dr. Joseph Ladapo ​told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “You have sovereignty over your body.” Last week, Florida announced that it will be the first state to seek to remove immunization requirements for everyone, including school children, which have been in place since the 1980s. The American Medical Association “strongly opposes” this change, a member of the Association's board of trustees told CNN in a statement. Florida, like all US states, grants exemptions from immunizations for medical and religious reasons. The vast majority of these children were exempt for non-medical reasons. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department will issue rebates if the Supreme Court upholds a ruling that President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were an overstep of power, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today. “We would have to give a refund on about half of the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” Bessent said during an appearance on NBC News' “Meet the Press.” He added that, “If the court says it, we'd have to do it.” But there are “numerous other avenues” that can be taken instead of rebates, Bessent said, without citing details. Tom Homan, White House border czar, defended President Donald Trump's “Chipocalypse Now” social media post from a day earlier, which said Chicago “will find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” “I think his words are being taken out of context. Democratic officials in Chicago and Illinois condemned the post Saturday, with Gov. JB Pritzker calling it “not normal.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and US Rep. Mike Quigley, who represents part of the city, described the post as an example of authoritarianism. CNN previously reported the Trump administration's plans to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, and that officials there were bracing for it to begin as early as Friday. Asked  how many National Guard troops would be in Chicago, Homan declined to respond, saying that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.” Asked whether there will be any action in Chicago this week, Homan responded “absolutely,” adding, “you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.” Hyundai immigration raid: He was also asked by CNN whether there will be more extensive immigration raids, like the one at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia that led to 475 arrests. “The short answer is, yes, we're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan said. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defended his leadership earlier in an interview on “Fox and Friends,” as we just reported. Jerome Adams, who served as US surgeon general during President Donald Trump's first administration, called for Kennedy to be fired as controversy continues to swirl over his handling of vaccine approvals. Adams' comments came after a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill last week, where Kennedy was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans about his views on vaccines and the recent exodus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the resignation of its director, over tighter vaccine policies Kennedy was pushing. “I'm deeply concerned about the health and safety of our nation under RFK's current leadership,” Adams told Blackwell, later adding: “I absolutely believe he is uniquely damaging the credibility of federal agencies like the CDC, (National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration) and he's putting us at risk.” Read here for more on the RFK Jr. hearing and Adams' remarks. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decried his intense grilling by senators from both parties over major shakeups at the top health agencies as “theater” and defended his leadership. And, you know, they're not the kind of debate or open conversation that democracy would give us at its ideal,” he told “Fox and Friends” on Sunday. His interview on the conservative cable network show continued some of his first comments after a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. Kennedy accused senators on the panel that played a role in his confirmation of being beholden to pharmaceutical companies, without citing evidence, saying “they don't want to hear the answers to the questions that they ask me. They want to make a little speech and then shut me down.” Defending his ousting of Dr. Susan Monarez as director of the CDC, which led to the resignation of several other top health officials, Kennedy told Fox News “we need new blood, and we need new people who are committed to public health and integrity and gold standard science, and the Trump administration is going to make sure that happens.” Pressed on what he sees as the last great success of federal government health agencies, Kennedy answered: “I don't think there have been successes,” claiming that the infiltration of pharmaceutical companies have led to a “series of bad decisions.” After weeks of warnings, Chicago could be the next US city to see National Guard troops rolling through its streets. Local leaders were preparing ahead of this weekend – from the governor bracing for a court fight to parade planners postponing – even while it was not clear troops whether will show up. Officials in Illinois had heard the National Guard will be in place by Friday and ready to act Saturday – in step with an expected immigration enforcement swell – but no one from the Trump administration has told the state of its plans, Democratic Gov. Meanwhile, there are “no immediate plans” to send soldiers to Chicago, Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday after President Donald Trump the prior day called it “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far” following a violent Labor Day weekend and said the feds were “going in,” though without saying when. Read more here on how Chicago was preparing for this weekend. Just ahead of the weekend, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders in the Oval Office Friday and also took questions on a variety of topics from reporters. CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo, Elise Hammond, Samantha Waldenberg, Kit Maher, Aditi Sangal, Jennifer Hansler, Alayna Treene, Donald Judd, Haley Britzky and David Goldman contributed reporting to this post. As we've reported, President Donald Trump is heading to the US Open men's final today after starting his day at the White House, an administration official has told CNN. According to the White House schedule, he'll get there at around 2 p.m. President Donald Trump reposted a meme on social media Saturday saying in part that Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR.” The president's post comes as he has ramped up his rhetoric against Democratic-led cities, with a direct target on Chicago. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Pritzker responded on social media Saturday calling out the president's post as “not normal” and said that his state would not be “intimidated” by the president. Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments and headlines from President Donald Trump's administration. We'll bring you the latest on that, when it happens.</p>

A knife-wielding man was shot dead during a police pursuit in New York City after entering a police precinct and slashing an officer in the face with a 14-inch blade, authorities said Sunday. The attack unfolded just before 5:30 a.m. at the 73rd Precinct in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood when a man entered the building through an employee entrance, NYPD Chief of Patrol Philip Rivera told reporters at a briefing. When a female officer stopped the man and told him to go out and enter through the front door, the man pulled out "a large butcher knife" and slashed her in the face, Rivera said. An officer used a taser as the man escaped, but the device was not effective in stopping him, Rivera said. Rivera said the individual used a 14-inch-long butcher knife to slash the officer in her face. Several officers then opened fire on the knife-wielding man, striking him numerous times. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Rivera said the female officer was in "good spirits" at a hospital. The officer who was slashed in the face was treated at a hospital, where she is recovering and in "good spirits," Rivera said. "This situation could have turned out very differently," he said. Rivera said investigators had a tentative identification on the knife-wielding man, but could not immediately release it to the public. Police said the incident remains under investigation.

One of California's most notorious killers is back in the spotlight as a new documentary revisits his crimes and uncovers even darker secrets. Joseph Naso, the former photographer convicted in 2013 of killing four women, is now claiming he actually killed 26 women. The bombshell confession comes from a fellow death row inmate, William Noguera, who spent more than a decade building trust with Naso inside California's infamous San Quentin State Prison. The chilling revelations are featured in a new Oxygen documentary, "Death Row Confidential: Secrets of a Serial Killer," premiering Sept. 13. "He's guilty of more than anyone knows," Noguera says during a preview of the new series. "He told me everything, and I wrote all of it down." Convicted serial killer Joseph Naso, left, with his legal advisor Pedro Oliveros appears in front of Judge Andrew Sweet in Marin Superior Court on Friday, Nov. 22, 2013, in San Rafael, California. He was a father of two, Little League coach, and school photographer by day – and a sadistic killer by night. Investigators found photographs of what appeared to be dead women among his belongings, along with what investigators dubbed a "hit list," containing ten cryptic descriptions of female victims. Even after a jury handed down a death sentence, Naso continued to maintain his innocence in interviews, including an exclusive interview with KGO. Noguera, who is also on death row for a 1983 murder, was assigned to assist elderly prisoners as part of a prison disability program, which is where he connected with Naso. Over 10 years, the two developed what was described by several media outlets as an "unusual" relationship. "When I told him, 'Well, look, they got you because a list of 10,' he started laughing," Noguera recalled. Yeah, I killed them women, yes. Noguera disclosed even more disturbing details, noting that Naso's claims of killing 26 women may be supported by something reportedly found in the search of Naso's home. Noguera told the outlet, "They found a coin collection with 26 gold heads. Determined to document everything, Noguera compiled a 300-page dossier filled with cryptic clues, locations and partial confessions. He passed the files to retired FBI task force investigator Ken Mains, who took on the case pro bono. In one ploy, Noguera convinced him to put a confession in writing, dangling the possibility of a prison transfer to get closer to his sons. In his own words, Naso reportedly described luring a woman through a modeling ad, driving her home, killing her and dumping her body under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. Accused serial killer Joseph Naso, left, talks with his legal advisor Pedro Oliveros as the prosecution made their opening statement on Monday, June 17, 2013, in Marin Superior Court in San Rafael, California. She had answered a modeling ad, and her bike was later found chained near the exact spot Naso described. Working together, Detective Mains and Noguera linked Naso to several cold cases, including Connes'. "But now they know what really happened to her," Noguera said. Naso, who was dubbed the "Alphabet Killer," gained his grim nickname after being found guilty in 2013 of murdering four women whose first and last names began with the same letter. The victims included Roxene Roggasch, 18, Carmen Colon, 22, Pamela Parsons, 38, and Tracy Tafoya, 31, with their deaths occurring between 1977 and 1994. Authorities had previously investigated Naso in connection to the unsolved "Alphabet Murders" of three young girls in his hometown, Rochester, New York, in the 1970s. However, DNA evidence ruled him out as a suspect in those cases. Investigators also uncovered a diary detailing more than 100 sexual assaults dating back to the 1950s, many involving underage girls. With the new claims emerging, law enforcement agencies across California and the FBI are now re-examining unsolved cases. "Our two minds, cop and convict, working together. As the documentary reveals, Naso's crimes may stretch further than anyone ever imagined — and his disturbing legacy continues to haunt both investigators and families seeking closure.

President Donald Trump arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City for the U.S. Open men's singles final on Sunday between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. It's Trump's first visit to the Grand Slam tennis tournament since before he got into the White House. He was seen at the event in September 2015 – months after he announced his run for president the first time.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Sinner and Alcaraz have cemented themselves as the two top stars in the post-Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal eras. Novak Djokovic has proved that he could still win Grand Slam titles as well but he hasn't won since the 2023 U.S. Open. He reached the semifinals in each Grand Slam tournament this season. While U.S. Open broadcasters were reportedly ordered to avoid showing disruptions in the crowd over Trump's presence, Alcaraz welcomed the possibility of seeing Trump in the crowd. Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump attend the Williams sisters' match on day nine of the 2015 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sept. 8, 2015.

When it comes to reports surrounding her romance with Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson doesn't have time for PR stunts. During an appearance at the 51st Deauville American Film Festival in Deauville, France on Friday, Anderson — who gave an acceptance speech after receiving the festival's Deauville Talent Award — seemingly shut down rumors that she and her "The Naked Gun" co-star orchestrated their romantic chemistry to drive ticket sales. "I do not and will never feed into PR stunts," she said during her speech, per People. I'm superstitious when it comes to love. And I'm not comfortable sharing any shred of my romantic life." Pamela Anderson said she would never participate in a PR stunt, alluding to reports that her relationship with Liam Neeson was a publicity strategy. There are no silly games being played. I'm here on this journey, not for money or for fame, but to see what I'm made of in truth, hard work and to leave behind an honest legacy my family can be proud of," she concluded. The 58-year-old actress and the 72-year-old actor made headlines with their flirty exchanges and public displays of affection throughout "The Naked Gun" press tour, which kicked off in July. Anderson and Neeson made headlines with their flirty exchanges and public displays of affection throughout "The Naked Gun" press tour. Since then, reports have circulated that the pair's romantic connection was a calculated PR strategy to promote the film. In a report published by TMZ last month, sources alleged that Anderson and Neeson's PR teams, along with the movie's studio, Paramount Pictures, orchestrated the duo's alleged fake relationship while "The Naked Gun" was in production. TMZ reported that Anderson and Neeson had not seen each other from the time that filming wrapped in July 2024 until the press tour began. In addition, the outlet reported that Anderson and Neeson never had a one-on-one date, and their dinners together were strictly business with personal assistants present. While speaking with People, a source slammed the allegation as "ridiculous." The couple's connection is "genuine," a source told People. However, an insider told People that the connection between Anderson and Neeson is "genuine." "Everything between them has been genuine. Neither would ever take part in a publicity stunt. "Their relationship isn't just for show," another source told the outlet. There's no incentive for either of them to stage something like this."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A mass Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine's capital Sunday has killed at least two people and left smoke rising from the roof of a key government building. Ukraine's Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, released a video message of her speaking from inside a government building in Kyiv which had been damaged by Russian strikes.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia hit Ukraine's capital with drone and missiles Sunday in the largest aerial attack since the war began, killing four people across the country and damaging a key government building. Russia attacked with 810 drones and decoys, Ukraine's air force said, adding it shot down 747 drones and four missiles. Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's government headquarters. It was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center. Police blocked access to the building as fire trucks and ambulances arrived. Yuriy Ihnat, an air force spokesperson, confirmed to The Associated Press that Sunday's attack was the largest Russian drone strike since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Hits from nine missiles and 54 drones were recorded at 33 locations across Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that four people were killed and 44 wounded. “Together with France, we are preparing new measures to strengthen our defense,” Zelenskyy said. Marcon earlier on Sunday accused Russia of “striking indiscriminately” and said Moscow “is locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also condemned the attack. “These cowardly strikes show that Putin believes he can act with impunity. Now, more than ever, we must stand firm in our support for Ukraine and its sovereignty,” Starmer said in a statement. Smoke rises from the Cabinet of Ministers building after a Russian strike in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sunday, Sept. 7, 2025. Those killed were a mother and her 3-month-old child, whose bodies were dug out of the rubble, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration. At least 10 locations in Kyiv were damaged, he added. Direct drone hits struck a nine-story residential building in Kyiv's Sviatoshynskyi district and a four-story residential building in Darnytskyi district. “I just have no more words left to express what I feel towards Russia,” said Olha, a 77-year-old Kyiv resident whose apartment was damaged. She didn't give her last name. “Although I'm an ethnic Russian myself, from outside Moscow. And I've never thought my people would be capable of this.” “Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have started long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” he said. Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko posted a video of herself inside the damaged government building, where she said a fire covering 800 square meters (8,600 square feet) was put out. The Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that it used “high-precision weapons” and drones to strike drone assembly and storage sites, military air bases in central, southern and eastern Ukraine, an industrial facility and a logistics facility on the outskirts of Kyiv. The ministry said that “all designated objects were hit” and claimed that “no strikes were carried out on other objects within the borders of Kyiv,” in what could be a reference to the damaged government building. Sunday's attack is the second mass Russian drone and missile attack to target Kyiv in the span of two weeks, as hopes for peace talks wane. It comes after European leaders pressed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to work to end the war after 26 of Ukraine's allies pledged to deploy troops as a “reassurance force” for the war-torn country once the fighting ends. Moscow has repeatedly objected to any Western troop deployments to Ukraine and pushed back against a Putin-Zelenskyy summit, saying lower-level talks must take place first. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted a total of 100 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Azov Sea between 8 p.m. Saturday and 6:30 a.m. Sunday. In the Krasnodar region, falling drone debris sparked a brief fire at an oil refinery, local authorities said. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that drone debris struck a four-story building in Sviatoshynskyi District.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doors are open to NAM's Market, in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, Aug. 30, 2025. Norm Nixon, an associate pastor at Union Temple Baptist Church, poses for a photo in the sanctuary during an Aug. 23, 2025 seniors' party hosted at the church in Washington. Demonstrators protest against President Donald Trump's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington during a march on Saturday, Sept. 6, 2025. And they don't see them patrolling on this side of the Anacostia River, either. “We do need protection here,” said Mable Carter, 82. “I have to come down on the bus. There might be military units patrolling Union Station and public spaces where tourists often come, she said, but “none of them over here. Ain't nobody doing nothing on the Mall. Carter wants to see more police in this area — the city's own police, under the direction of Chief Pamela Smith. “I'd rather see them give her a chance. The Pentagon, when asked if there were plans to deploy the National Guard to higher crime areas like Anacostia and who determines that, sent a list of stations where the military units were present as of Thursday. Over the course of two weekends east of the river, in conversations with groups and individuals, including a senior's gathering at Union Temple Baptist Church, a theme emerged. This year's homicides in the district, as of Friday, were at 104, a 17% decrease from 126 as of Sept. 5 last year. But, more than 60% of them are in the two wards that are almost exclusively east of the Anacostia River, including 38 in Ward 8, according to the Metropolitan Police Department crime mapping tool. That proportion is about the same as it was in 2024 when there were 187 homicides citywide for the year. One of the most notable murders was a double homicide that left two teens lying dead on the street and a third man wounded. He said a group of teenagers attempted to rob his store after casing it throughout the day. “I didn't see a weapon,” he said, adding that no patrol officers responded. The store owner said he has been here about 10 years and been victimized multiple times but thinks it is getting worse now. He does not give his last name out of fear. “What worries me is to make sure they're not coming back,” he said. When he heard of the federal law enforcement and National Guard arrival, “To be honest, I said that's good — but that's not over here. The city says crime is down but I don't see it.” A block away, Rosie Hyde's perspective is different. Samuel Johnson was killed about three miles away on April 20, 1991. Hyde, a retired probation officer for the city, said her son died during that epidemic of gun violence. “That tells you the rampage with guns is nothing new.” Homicides topped 400 annually in 1989 and stayed there through 1996, according to the district's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Hyde believes Trump is after the optics in areas where he will get attention — at the train station, on the Mall, in areas with a concentration of tourists. “They haven't been over here like that,” she said. Farther east is the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum. The plaque outside says as much about this moment as it does about history: The museum, it says, “aspires to illuminate and share the untold and often overlooked stories of people furthest from opportunity in the Greater Washington, D.C. region.” Federal agents are in this area working with local authorities, including FBI agents and Border Patrol, as well as Metro Transit Authority police. Along Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Anacostia, new buildings mix with older ones and small groups of people mill about, drinking from bottles and with the occasional smell of marijuana. At one point, a large group of National Guard members climbs out of a van at the Anacostia Metro station, but they catch the train heading west back beneath the river. Norm Nixon, an associate pastor at Union Temple Baptist Church, said there are federal agents around, but their presence is not constant and no military uniforms are seen on the streets. He said local officers who try to push community policing — communicating with residents and acknowledging their concerns — will probably get blowback because of the federal presence. He, like others, questions why Trump decided to federalize the city when violence is present virtually everywhere, including in rural areas where drugs and economic hardships have created fertile ground for lawlessness. “The president needs to have these initiatives to make it seem like something is happening, almost like he's got to make news,” Nixon said, adding that he is also concerned about the focus on rousting the homeless population. “Washington, D.C., is easy because it is federal and he has the authority to do what he's doing,” Hancock said. “It is a federal city so he can just take over.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has promised to remove millions of people from the United States in the largest deportation program in American history. But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts. For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny: The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua. “We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said. President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil. The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan. Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won't take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands. Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel. Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back. Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.” A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge's temporary order. The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe. The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole. Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S. As a result, it's possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge's order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years. It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first. Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion, suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights. In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration's efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole. Cobb said the case's “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A Maryland resident who traveled to El Salvador came home last month with an unwelcome souvenir: larvae of the New World screwworm burrowing in their flesh. The patient has since recovered from the painful parasite, and Maryland health officials confirmed that there's no sign of transmission to anyone else. But the case is historic: It's the first time in more than half a century that a human in the US has been infected by a screwworm. One that could rattle the backbone of American agriculture. For the past two decades, screwworms were held at a distance by an invisible barrier along the Panama-Colombia border by a joint US-Panama program that regularly floods the region with sterile flies. Since 2023, screwworm has resurged through Central America and into Mexico. Because the flies lay their eggs in any open wounds, infestations escalate fast: A single cut can attract wave after wave of flies. And since cattle are kept in confined herds, outbreaks can ripple through dozens of animals. Screwworm outbreaks can spiral rapidly, crippling entire herds. Cows are expensive to raise, feed, breed, and slaughter — that's why the American livestock industry treats screwworms as a nightmare scenario, worse than mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease. In Texas alone, a screwworm outbreak could drain as much as $1.8 billion a year from ranchers and the wider economy, according to an estimate by the US Department of Agriculture. The US has a history of eliminating these flies before. Earlier this year, the USDA also announced its $8.5 million plan to build a plant in south Texas. But is a 20th-century toolkit enough to fight off this emerging threat? Climate change is warming habitats, increasing possible places where screwworms can thrive. Industrial livestock farming has scaled up enormously, meaning a single outbreak could speak through herds faster than ever. Meanwhile, the Trump administration pushed out around 15,000 USDA employees and terminated a screwworm monitoring project. And parasites don't wait for paperwork. The New World screwworm is a parasitic fly found today across parts of South America and the Caribbean. They have shiny blue-gray bodies and look similar to house flies that swarm your local dumpster. Female screwworm flies are attracted to warm-blooded animals, and lay their eggs in open cuts or natural openings like ears or nostrils. Upon hatching, the larvae twist into flesh like corkscrews tearing deeper as they feed, causing extreme pain and tissue damage. What makes screwworms particularly brutal is they only consume living flesh. A single infested wound becomes a beacon for more flies, leading to layer upon layer of larvae literally eating the host alive. Infestations in humans are excruciating and disfiguring, but rarely fatal with treatment. In animals, it's a different story: A single untreated wound can host thousands of larvae that literally eat a cow from the inside out, leading to blood loss, infections, and collapse. But there's an achilles heel: Female screwworms mate only once in their life — a unique biological quirk that has underpinned the US's control strategy for decades. Screwworms once terrorized the American South and the Western US, and killed millions of dollars' worth of cattle each year. If they could find a way to get the female flies to mate with sterile mates, they could stop the flies' population in its tracks. And that's how the sterile insect technique (SIT) was developed. The SIT is fairly straightforward: Rear huge numbers of screwworms in a lab and sterilize the pupae through radiation (a discovery from the post-war atomic age when scientists realized they could make flies infertile without killing them). Then these freshly sterilized pupae are packed onto twin-engine planes, timed so the flies hatch in the air. If you do that at a sufficient scale and for a long enough time, the population will eventually collapse. Ranching groups pushed the USDA for eradication, Texas cattlemen even wrote letters to USDA urging the agency to expand SIT. And unlike today's debates around genetically modified mosquitoes, screwworms never stirred much controversy. The technique was targeted, pesticide-free, and spared other insects, which is why it was an unusually “green” pest control, said Max Scott, a professor of entomology at NC State University. The Pan-American highway famously stops there, the region is sparsely populated, treacherous to cross, and light on livestock. It's exactly the kind of chokepoint where a biological “firewall” can hold. Planes drop off millions of sterile flies each week, and inspectors patrol the frontier town (not the deep Darién itself) to spot infestations, pluck out maggots manually, and treat wounds with insecticides — because SIT only works if you also knock down active infestations. The program costs about $15 million annually and is funded mostly by USDA, with Panama contributing a small share. Smuggling of cattle through Central America seeded fresh outbreaks in new regions, and climate shifts — higher temperatures and humidity — aided their spread. By spring 2025, Mexico was reporting detections as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, a stretch of land far wider and difficult to contain than the narrow Darién. But even at maximum capacity, the plant can only do so much. It's also building a factory in Edinburg, Texas, with three times that capacity. Congress is trying to lock this in with the STOP Screwworms Act, a bipartisan bill that would formally authorize USDA to build and fund the new Texas facility. This is a lot of mobilization for a freaky bug, but it underscores how differently the US treats livestock threats. Bird flu has killed more than 160 million birds in the US since 2022, according to the Coalition to Stop Flu, and USDA recently rolled out a $1 billion package to shore up defenses. The strategy there is still mass culling of chickens and relief checks to producers — much more reactive than proactive. The poultry industry is just as powerful, but it's split on bird flu strategy – with many producers fearing that widespread vaccination could jeopardize US export markets. That caution shows up in the USDA's new $1 billion bird flu package: half a billion for biosecurity, $400 million in financial relief, and just $100 million — 10 percent — for vaccines. Right now, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat screwworms in people or animals, though the agency says it has “multiple regulatory pathways” to fast-track reviews and authorize drugs. There are promising genetic tools that improve on SIT, but they will need regulatory approval and public trust before they fly. And even with fresh funding, the USDA may not be able to aptly execute its ambitious plans, given that 15,000 of the agency's staff were let go earlier this year. In the end, it's not just biosecurity at stake, it's also a major source of our food supply and a slice of our economy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an outspoken opponent against what she describes as rich elites, stayed at several swanky hotels while rallying across the country with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, a Washington Examiner review of the congresswoman's campaign spending receipts has found. According to Federal Election Commission filings, her high-end hotel stays, which coincided with stretches of the Democratic Socialist duo's cross-country trek to rail against the ultrawealthy, cost thousands of dollars in campaign funds. Ocasio-Cortez's spending spree at opulent locales appears to conflict with the congresswoman's rhetoric about class disparity, an anti-affluence message she repeatedly delivered during the tour. In mid-March, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign splurged $3,508.92 on a stay at Vdara Hotel & Spa, a luxury property situated on the Las Vegas strip in Paradise, Nevada. Days before the donor-funded disbursement date, as listed later in an expenditure report, Ocasio-Cortez appeared alongside Sanders at a stop in North Las Vegas, where they both bashed the luxurious lifestyles of billionaires and “oligarchs” purportedly taking over the country. Speaking on access to affordable housing and income inequality among working-class Americans, she said, “We don't have to live like this anymore, Las Vegas. Ocasio-Cortez was photographed flying first-class to the Las Vegas town hall. Ocasio-Cortez reported the travel expense shortly after a one-day Salt Lake City rally with Sanders. There, they preached about the plight of “everyday, working Americans like us” struggling to make ends meet. The following day, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders joined forces again at a “Fight the Oligarchy” junket in Nampa, Idaho, approximately a half-hour drive from nearby Boise, to call for a federal “living” minimum wage and lament rising rent costs nationwide. Around this time, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign disclosed spending $1,534.90 at the award-winning Hotel Renegade in downtown Boise. A newly built boutique getaway inhabiting over 5,100 square feet of event space, including a rooftop ballroom, Hotel Renegade has received AAA's distinguished four-diamond rating. Sanders, the congresswoman's travel companion and fellow climate change activist against carbon fuels, previously faced criticism for spending more than $221,723 on private jet flights over the course of their anti-oligarchy campaign. According to Sanders, the public depends on his timely arrival. “Think I'm going to be sitting on a waiting line at United [Airlines] while 30,000 people are waiting?” Sanders said, referring to an expectant audience. Between April and June, the senator's campaign committee paid Ventura Jets, a private airline charter on Long Island, an additional total of $229,173, according to campaign disclosure data reviewed by the Washington Examiner. In 2019, Forbes magazine reported that Sanders, an owner of three homes, amassed a $2.5 million fortune from real estate, investments, government pensions, and book earnings. On the fundraising front, Ocasio-Cortez has outraised her congressional counterparts by a wide margin, with a whopping $15.4 million accrued in contributions this election cycle, well ahead of the 2026 midterms. Her record-breaking haul has left some observers speculating that Ocasio-Cortez may be eyeing higher office, whether that be a seat in the Senate or a White House run in 2028. Many left-wing media outlets have touted her as a top presidential contender. The Washington Examiner contacted Ocasio-Cortez's and Sanders's campaigns for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and his top political advisers are plotting an aggressive push to oust one of his most persistent Republican adversaries: Rep. Thomas Massie. And House GOP leaders won't stand in Trump's way. In interviews with CNN, five members of House GOP leadership declined to offer their backing for Massie's reelection bid – and Johnson would not say if he'd support his colleague. “He is actively working against his team almost daily now and seems to enjoy that role. So he is, you know, deciding his own fate,” Johnson told CNN, delivering a firm message that party leaders would not intervene to protect Massie in the escalating feud with Trump. While Johnson said his job is to “lead the incumbent protection program,” the speaker chided Massie for waging “unfounded attacks” against him. And some people make that very difficult for me.” The lack of support among House GOP leaders is a reflection of months of mounting frustration with the Kentucky Republican as he's personally antagonized both the speaker and president in a series of fights – most recently in trying to force a vote on a bill to release the Epstein files over intense opposition from Johnson and the White House. Trump and his team are still searching for a candidate who can go toe-to-toe with the 54-year-old Massie, who has burnished a brand of a party maverick not afraid to break from his leadership and the president of his own party – namely on issues of government spending and budget deficits. Trump has met with state Sen. Aaron Reed, who has privately expressed interest in a primary challenge against Massie, according to three sources familiar with the meeting from earlier this summer. But Trump still has yet to signal he'd endorse Reed, a former Navy SEAL who is staunchly conservative, as the presiden'ts team is weighing other potential challengers ahead of the January 9 candidate filing deadline, according to the sources. But Trump allies fully expect the president to put his muscle behind a candidate after his outside group pummels Massie with millions in attack ads. And he claimed that Trump was trying to spare some of his allies and donors from “embarrassment” by shielding the files. “The speaker's position depends on him rubber stamping, not just rubber stamping, but reinforcing anything Donald Trump wants, even if Donald Trump is wrong,” Massie said. Trump and his political advisers are girding for a blockbuster primary fight next year. A pro-Trump super PAC called “MAGA Kentucky” has reserved $1.6 million in ads this summer, according to AdImpact data reviewed by CNN. The group is being led by Chris LaCivita, Trump's 2024 campaign co-manager, and pollster Tony Fabrizio. And there could be a lot more anti-Massie money to come. With the May primary still months away, Massie has yet to spend much on air, having spent just $418,000 on ads this year. Whether he gets some outside help – including from the world's richest person, Elon Musk, who posted on X in June that he'd help Massie as he was railing against Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act – remains to be seen. In his more than a dozen years in Congress, Massie has never been a leadership loyalist, opposing plenty of party priorities on the floor under several GOP speakers – and even unsuccessfully sought to oust Johnson from the speakership last year. He retains staunch support from fellow conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also voted against Trump's megabill earlier this year. “I'm a big supporter of Thomas Massie,” Paul told reporters in July, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. “He's a man of principle who votes against the deficit like I do, whether it's Republicans proposing spending or Democrats.” Even so, other GOP colleagues working with Massie on the Epstein push said they wished he'd taken a different approach with Trump. “I will tell you that I like Thomas on a lot of positions,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who has long demanded the Epstein files be released but has yet to sign onto Massie's push to force a vote in defiance of the White House. “But I think that the way that this has kind of flushed out between his personal relationship with the president is unfortunate to see unfold.” Luna declined to say whether she'd back Massie's reelection. “There's a way that you can debate and disagree with people, but the moment that you get personal and the moment that you start doing things for reasons other than what you're telling the public, I think that kind of crosses the Rubicon,” Luna said. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican who has supported Massie's bill but said he will not go against his own leadership to force a floor vote, said he wished his colleague had made it a “less confrontational” issue. Massie has fended off every previous challenger in his district, a fiercely independent, deeply conservative stretch of Northeastern Kentucky that is known to local political operatives as the “Wild West” of the state. It's also an extremely expensive district for anyone running for office: It's split into four media markets in three different states. Still, senior Republicans believe Massie could be vulnerable given the right candidate. “I would not underestimate the president's grip on the base,” said one senior House GOP lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity to freely discuss a colleague's political future. Massie would not be the first Republican targeted for defeat by Trump. Last March, then-Rep. Bob Good of Virginia was ousted in an ugly primary after sparring with GOP leadership and backing Trump's opponent, Ron DeSantis, in the 2024 presidential primary. Some Republicans believe the Massie vs. MAGA primary will be even nastier, given the Kentucky congressman's repeated votes against Trump priorities — including his signature tax and spending cuts bill — and his disparagement over Trump's handling of Epstein. On the leadership level, top Republicans are typically reticent to publicly criticize their own members. But some, like House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, struck a note of disappointment about Massie's rogue push to defy Johnson over the Epstein vote. As for his reelection, McClain said leadership tends not to get involved in primaries and stressed she simply wants to keep the GOP majority. “I work with every single member of our team,” Emmer told CNN when asked about how party leaders would handle the White House's efforts to oust Massie. “I have to work through their relationships with each other. I leave all of our members to take care of their own business, both in the policy arena and in the campaign.” “I thought about this yesterday in our press conference with the survivors,” Massie said, referring to an emotional, 90-minute event where nearly a dozen women spoke about how Epstein abused them when they were children. I think it's kind of petty for me to complain about some political race that I have to be in when there are other people who are making much greater sacrifices.” CNN's Steve Contorno, Alison Main, David Wright and Casey Riddle contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles police and the California Highway Patrol are providing taxpayer-funded security for former Vice President Kamala Harris — a move that has infuriated the police union and some Republican lawmakers. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after President Donald Trump revoked her Secret Service detail earlier this week. The CHP is authorized to provide security for current and former California constitutional officers when a threat assessment deems it necessary. Harris, a former state constitutional officer, is receiving protection coordinated by the agency in response to current concerns, sources told the Washington Examiner. “This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” she said. It's unclear if they will be with her when she starts on her nationwide book tour, which begins at the end of the month in New York City. “This temporary coordinated effort is in place to ensure that there is no lapse in security,” LAPD Communications Director Jennifer Forkish, told the Washington Examiner. Spending money to protect Harris isn't sitting well with some, including the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers. “Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,” the union said in a statement. It added that Bass “should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.” Assemblyman Carl DeMaio (R-CA) also had an issue with it. “It will reduce public safety plain and simple,” he told the Washington Examiner. Steve Hilton, who is running as a Republican candidate for governor, called Harris's new security “completely outrageous and a corrupt abuse of public resources.” The Secret Service usually protects a former vice president for six months after they leave office, but former President Joe Biden had signed an order extending Harris's protection for a year beyond that. Without the extension, Harris's protection would have ended in July. Trump also pulled protection from Mike Pompeo, one of his former secretaries of state; former aide Brian Hook; John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser; and Anthony Fauci, who received death threats when he oversaw the COVID-19 pandemic. Kaivan Shroff, a Democratic commentator and alumnus of the Hillary for America digital team, told the Washington Examiner that securing Harris's safety is paramount. “Yes, protecting our first black woman vice president, despite Trump's antics, is a good use of funds,” he said. “Kamala Harris — like many Democrats — has a target on her back because of the rhetoric Trump, Vance and other MAGA electeds use. The reality is that less than 3 months ago, a deranged Trump supporter murdered Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot their dog.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intensifies his drive to reverse decades of vaccine policy, the medical profession joins a growing list of fields and institutions facing unprecedented threats from the federal government under President Donald Trump. But this time the administration may have chosen an adversary with more capacity to fight back than the law firms, major universities and media organizations it has targeted so far. Medical groups fear that Kennedy's wide-ranging actions — such as firing all the members of a prestigious advisory committee that advises the federal government on vaccine policy; narrowing access to the latest Covid vaccine; and pledging to soon release a study that will probably reexamine the widely debunked claim that childhood vaccines cause autism — will trigger a resurgence of deadly diseases, particularly among children. I could never imagine that something like this would ever happen. Medical groups are expressing increasing alarm that Kennedy's rhetoric and actions will increase the already-growing number of parents demanding medical or religious exemptions from state vaccine mandates for school attendance and potentially encourage conservative states to repeal those mandates altogether. That concern became much more immediate last week after Florida's Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis announced their intent to eliminate all state vaccine mandates, including those for school attendance. If implemented, that will make Florida the first state to do so. But the medical profession may have more advantages than most. Surveys also consistently show that most Americans believe the major childhood vaccinations are safe and should remain a requirement for children to attend school. “At the moment (Trump) seems to be enjoying it but … how important is it for him to keep the fringe part of his base happy?” said Drew Altman, president of KFF, a nonpartisan think tank focusing on health care issues. At some point this (will) turn off a large segment of the American people, and he may decide this is no longer in his interest.” The key question in how this debate unfolds may be whether the disparate and often fractious medical interests can unite effectively in common action. “We need the organizations that represent America's physicians to stand up, both for the sake of (influencing) policy and for the sake of giving guidance to their patients,” said Leslie Dach, chair of Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that focuses on health care access. Many of the institutions Trump has targeted most aggressively in his second term present a similar profile. But the share of Republicans who expressed trust in them was only about half that, at 22%. A few have fought him in court, with some law firms and Harvard University winning strongly worded lower court decisions invalidating Trump moves against them. Medical professionals may be in a better position to try. Confidence in the overall “medical system” — a more expansive and amorphous concept — has also declined somewhat since Covid. By contrast, only about two-fifths of all Americans said they trusted either Kennedy or Trump for vaccine guidance. KFF surveys have also found that the vast majority of Americans remain convinced that the major childhood vaccinations are safe, and about four-fifths of parents (including three-fourths of Republicans) continue to support the requirement that students receive vaccinations to attend schools. Robert Blendon, an emeritus professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the backlash among Republican voters against public health decisions during Covid, such as vaccine and mask mandates, created a constituency within the GOP for challenging federal vaccine policy — but that medical professionals still have standing to sway it. “Republicans hold a belief (that) real mistakes were made by the CDC and public health authorities, and that has really opened up this opportunity for Kennedy,” Blendon said. Blendon said the key for medical interests will be to focus their message on personalizing the potential impact of Kennedy's policies — particularly for influencing voters in Trump's electoral coalition. “They are not going to be that influenced when scientists say it's really bad for the world,” Blendon said. It remains uncertain, though, how forcefully medical groups will press those arguments. One reason universities, law firms, media organizations and even the clean energy industry failed to unite in robust opposition to Trump's actions is that many preferred to stay quiet for fear the Trump administration could retaliate by threatening other federal funding, licenses or contracts. Trump holds similar leverage over medical professionals with his ability to influence federal reimbursement rates, particularly for Medicare — which Kennedy has already signaled he hopes to reexamine. Pediatricians and other physicians “will be incredibly more trusted by parents than these various government people,” Blendon said. The leading medical industry and professional associations mostly kept mum during Kennedy's contentious confirmation hearings, Trump's moves to slash federal funding for medical research, and even during congressional passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will revoke health insurance from more Americans than any single bill ever. But medical groups are now issuing more urgent alarms about the flurry of anti-vaccine actions from Kennedy that culminated in last month's dismissal of Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently confirmed director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has said she refused to rubber-stamp Kennedy decisions that could reduce vaccine access. The pediatricians have also launched a website to rebut Kennedy vaccine claims and published their own recommendations for childhood vaccination, which continues to encourage the Covid vaccine for young people. Other groups that have pushed back especially forcefully against Kennedy include organizations representing immunologists, public health professionals and nurses. Its members are more vulnerable than pediatricians to possible changes in federal payment systems because pediatricians would not be directly affected by reimbursement rates for Medicare, which serves seniors. And early on, the AMA appeared especially leery of confrontation with Trump. But, as documented in a recent Politico story, the group faced mounting dissent over its hands-off approach that culminated in an open rebellion at its June annual meeting from critics demanding more forceful pushback to an array of Trump policies. A senior executive at one of the leading medical professional trade associations, who asked not to be identified while discussing internal conversations, said that all the leading groups are trending in that direction. Early in Trump's term, the official said, “people were trying to find their footing” and “figure out how to play a constructive role in health policy and also stand up to the things that are really out of bounds.” In addition, the official added, groups were hesitant about engaging because “this administration has a history of punishing people that disagree with them.” Now, though, the official said, “things are shifting” because Kennedy's actions have grown so alarming. “Groups are going to feel … that they can't sit it out anymore,” the official said. Medical professionals may have retained more public trust than other experts, but all forms of expertise have lost ground with the public in recent years, noted Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Young people, particularly men, are drawn to a kind of DIY ethos around decisions where they might once have deferred to credentialed experts, Cox said. “This younger generation has grown up with access to all the information that they could ever want or need and that feels more natural and comfortable to them” than relying on experts, Cox said. And those are the people I can put my faith in.' Those libertarian-ish attitudes have seeded the ground for Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement and created the energetic constituency he brought into Trump's electoral coalition. But as Offit pointed out, such attitudes directly collide with the core tenet of public health, which is collective action to protect the most vulnerable. “The current zeitgeist is medical freedom: ‘I'm going to do my own research, I'm going to make a decision that is best for me and my child,'” said Offit, who was recently blocked from participating in a federal vaccine policy advisory committee. Those competing instincts are now colliding most consequentially in the nation's classrooms and playgrounds. Public health experts say that to achieve herd immunity against the most dangerous childhood diseases, such as measles, about 95% of all schoolchildren must be vaccinated. These trends mean the vast majority of parents who continue to believe in vaccines cannot fully protect their children if enough people around them choose not to vaccinate their own. That threat will only rise if Kennedy takes further actions that encourage more parents not to vaccinate their children — or inspire more red states to consider rescinding their school mandates. In that way, the risks that Kennedy's decisions could impose on average families are far more tangible than the implications of most debates about Trump's second-term priorities. But even at last week's Finance Committee hearing, several GOP senators sharply challenged Kennedy's direction — a rare moment of open Republican dissent to Trump. And on Friday afternoon, Trump took a conspicuous step away from vaccine skepticism, telling reporters, “You have to be careful when you say people don't need to be vaccinated. With the medical profession stirring in opposition, cracks opening in Republican support and polls showing that most Americans don't share Kennedy's hostility to vaccinations, Trump eventually may view his lightning rod HHS secretary as too great a threat to his own political health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance dismissed the Democrats' potential presidential nominees for 2028 by saying they all try to “mimic” President Donald Trump, which he suggested is bound to fail. Vance, widely seen as the Republican Party's top candidate for 2028 should he decide to run, laughed off the potential challengers in an appearance on Fox News's My View with Lara Trump Saturday night. “I don't think much of the modern Democratic Party. While not mentioning specific Democratic lawmakers, Gov. That has included Newsom ramping up his social media presence, frequently parodying Trump with the all-caps statements that the president uses, as well as launching a merchandise shop that features many of the slogans Trump has on his signature hats, only with Newsom's name swapped in. Other prominent Democratic governors have tangled with Trump this year as well, in what has become a preview of the 2028 race. Wes Moore (D-MD) and JB Pritzker (D-IL), who Trump has targeted over crime in their cities. Both Moore and Pritzker have deflected on potential 2028 bids, with Pritzker recently urging his party to focus on the 2026 midterm elections. Vance briefly touched on those midterm elections on Saturday, suggesting that “anger” from voters wins the off-year races. He contended that Trump supporters aren't “angry” and stressed the importance of getting out and voting in 2026 in order to ensure Republicans hold on to their small majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
