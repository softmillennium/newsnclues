                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the United States Tennis Association's attempt to censor the U.S. Open audience's reaction to Donald Trump‘s presence at Sunday's Men's Final, the stands were filled with a passionate response. Trump was met with a mix of both boos and cheers as he stepped out from the Rolex Suite at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to greet the crowd gathered to watch Jannik Sinner of Italy take on Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. According to a pool report, the stadium was around 10 percent full when Trump stepped out from his suite to wave, with no PA announcement preceding his appearance. The memo asked “all broadcasters to refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions in response to the President's attendance in any capacity.” Shortly after, Trump was met with a similar reaction from a more filled-out crowd as he stepped out for Sgt. Maj. Carla Loy's performance of the national anthem. .⁦⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ appears briefly before the not yet crowded stadium at the ⁦@usopen⁩ and is greeted with cheers and boos. Shown on ABC, ESPN Unlimited and other platforms of the sports giant, the dramatic battle between Carlos Alcaraz (who won the U.S. Open title in 2022) and Jannik Sinner (who won Wimbledon two months ago) was set to start at 11 am PT/2 pm ET. Having won in 2024, Aryna Sabalenka remains the U.S. Open's women's champion. The Belarusian player defeated Amanda Anisimova in straight sets earlier today. Sabalenka was applauded and received a standing ovation for her hard fought second consecutive Ashe victory. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. That's NY tennis – filled with rich who only care about Wall Street gains. Are we in the US or North Korea?? It was Most likely the cheer track piped in over the PA speakers that his handlers keep pushing on arenas and stadiums when he shows up. Anyone remember when being a “career politician” was considered a negative slur, well I'll give anything for one right now instead of this no experienced hack wannna be dictator. I find it hard to believe they were openly cheering for this thing in NYC. They are typically ashamed to do so in polite society. Voter registration since the 2024 election overwhelmingly favors republicans, so you might want to rethink this “everyone is a fascist” bluesky tier conspiracy theory. Maybe people who want to vote in the next primaries to make sure the Republicans choose a more moderate and sensible candidate next time. If ABC muted a crowd with Biden just imagine what the reaction from FOX and the right would be. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poetic License, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in a prime Saturday night slot, is evidence of the emergence of a major triple threat talent (also a producer with Olivia Rosenbloom under their Jewelbox Pictures banner). That's the headline but it is not meant to take away from the achievements of Raffi Donatich, whose supremely intelligent and raucously amusing screenplay is her feature writing debut, or a cast that just kills it. In fact this is the kind of ensemble where you can imagine every one of them, ala American Graffiti, being remembered for their collective early work in this engaging sleeper of a comedy that quite frankly caught me by surprise with so many LOL moments, building to true unbridled hilarity by the time it ends. Poetic License could be the true discovery of this year's TIFF. Donna Langley At TIFF Talks Shifting Audience Tastes & Their Embrace Of Horror Not least among its charms is yet another memorable performance from Apatow's mother, Leslie Mann who has proven time and time again she is one of the best out there, and here gets a dream role as Liz Cassidy, a wife and mother in a bit of a life crisis, about to be an empty nester with her daughter Dora (Nico Parker) wanting to move away and no longer looking for comfort from Mom. Looking for her own worth, she joins a poetry class as an auditor where she first meets a couple of students, the dynamic self-possessed Ari (Cooper Hoffman) and his best friend, buttoned up Sam (Andrew Barth Feldman), who is facing the prospect of joining Morgan Stanley, the brokerage firm he keeps referring to as Tracy Morgan. Encouraging Liz to be more active in the class than as just an auditor, the three eventually become fast friends, and Liz finds herself enveloped in their world, as both slowly develop feelings for this much older married woman. That would be what develops into the main plot here, but for much of its early running time, this is a movie simply about people trying to grow up and find their place in the world, and that isn't limited to the young, but everyone including Liz. Donatich's whipsmart script is character-driven, witty and wise in giving each of them a distinct personality as their decisions start to careen out of control. It also makes sly comments on colleges themselves with one reference to the ‘Cryptocurrency Department'. Mann gets a role that starts as one thing, a woman realizing her life at the moment isn't adding up to what she hoped, and trying to move on (a dialogue-less scene where she is deciding which of Dora's old clothes to donate is priceless and poignant). The sly attraction that Sam and Ari begin to feel for her is not pronounced, it just is, coming to a head one night when they all get high, innocently enough, but with consequences. Hoffman, so great in Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza, and just as fine here, creates a portrait of a self-confident, sharp-talking guy who thinks he has the answers, but doesn't. Feldman, who made a real impression with Jennifer Lawrence as a 19-year-old losing his virginity in No Hard Feelings and has just replaced Darren Criss in the Tony-winning Maybe Happy Ending, is the perfect combo of nervous energy and sheer confusion as Sam. And if they ever decide to do a remake of The Graduate (which let's hope they never do), he is your Benjamin. There are so many others with their moments, including My Old Ass breakout Maisy Stella as Sam's girlfriend, who becomes shocked when she realizes he may be fancying the mother of a classmate, and the certified scene stealer here, Martha Kelly (Euphoria), who delivers pitch perfect deadpan stream of consciousness as the professor offering TMI in the poetry class where some this movie's most amusing and even affecting scenes take place. The mark of a brilliant director might be counted on how many actors get their moments in smaller roles, and this film is full of them, notably Steve Coulter in for one memorable scene as a seatmate whose nose cold causes consternation for Liz at a dinner party. It would be nice if this deserving film gets a theatrical release, even if movies like this seem to head to streaming more often than not these days. Sitting in the Royal Alexandra Theatre last night, hearing all that convulsive laughter once again, made me think comedies are made to be experienced in a theater. In the meantime, Maude Apatow's impressive first film is a keeper, no matter where you find it.

Before you judge the premise of Jonatan Etzler's wickedly assured “Bad Apples,” a ripe and unpredictable satire about the prevailing evils of “the greater good,” please keep in mind that 10-year-old Danny (played by extraordinary newcomer Eddie Waller) is easily one of the most demonic movie kids this side of Damien, and was an obvious problem for the whole population of Ashton Brook before his sudden disappearance. Hair shaggy, uniform untucked, his face like an arrow pulled taut, Danny held back the whole class with his antics. Related Stories ‘Rose of Nevada' Review: Mark Jenkin's Singular Cornish Folk Tale Is Haunting Aesthetic Nirvana  ‘I Swear' Review: Robert Aramayo Brings a Star-Making Performance to the Story of a Real-Life Hero And it's not like Maria wanted to kidnap the boy. She only went over to his house for a welfare check, but Danny was hurt in the scuffle that ensued, and when he woke up on the way to the hospital he threatened to tell everyone that Maria had attacked him. All of the parents already blamed the hard-working Maria for every problem in their children's lives (“You look like you don't care,” one of them murmurs off-camera, indifferent to the fact that Ashton Brook won't budget the money to get students like Danny the extra support they need), and there was just no way she was going to lose her job for the crime of trying to do it well. The Ashton Brook community is elated that Danny has disappeared. The boy's father, an exasperated man at the mercy of an Amazon-like delivery job that docks him for every second he so much as thinks about his son, is the only person who even wants to go through the effort of looking for him. The other kids have never been happier or more prepared for the standardized tests that will determine their futures, which means their parents are suddenly in love with Maria, and her overbearing principal is sorry for misjudging her. Even the ex who left her for another woman after they moved in together, and works as the head teacher at her school, is starting to look at Maria with new eyes. Things aren't so bad for Danny, either. Sure, nobody wants to be trapped inside a windowless basement, but there are worse things than playing “FIFA” all day, and it isn't long before he starts to benefit from the one-on-one lessons that Maria provides him when she gets home from work (whether dyslexic or simply neglected, he needs the kind of attention that Ashton Brook never bothered to provide). That “Bad Apples” is so much fun to hem and haw about is a testament to Ronan's typically excellent performance, which showcases both her low-key comic charm and also her pronounced talent for ambivalence. So credible and sympathetic that you can't help but start to second-guess your own feelings of right and wrong, Ronan mines a wince-inducing vein of mordant humor from how clearly Maria cares about all of her students (in stark contrast to the parents, who each only care about one of them), and from how sincerely she keeps trying to make the best out of a deranged situation. There's a part of you that hopes — and even thinks — that she might just be able to break through to Danny and strike a bargain that protects them both at the end of this. But that wouldn't make for much of a social commentary, and “Bad Apples” has too many diabolical tricks up its sleeve to settle for anything so predictable. “Bad Apples” may never be quite as sharp-tongued or audacious as its cast is clearly itching for it to be, but it's satisfying all the same to watch the film bend further towards satire as it goes along, and, crucially, to do so in a way that never loses sight of the fact that it's about a kidnapped child. Etzler guides the story around a series of very tight corners with a steady hand and a rich eye for detail (that Maria keeps her TV on the coffee table is such an efficient display of sadness), and the plot doesn't begin to strain the limits of believability until the situation has grown absurd enough to allow it. Even the film's relentless forward charge — its preference for strict point-making over a more learn at your own pace curriculum — helps to reaffirm its larger argument that schools have been conditioned to process children rather than enrich them. Obvious as that opening sequence at the cider mill might be, there's a lingering queasiness to its Wes Anderson-like top-down shots of apples being funnelled through a big machine that shuts down the second an irregular object is thrown into the mix. Whether it's a McIntosh rolling through a mill, or a student being pushed from one grade to another, the system exists to serve its masters with efficiency, and there are precious few rewards for anyone who slows it down in order to pay special attention to one of its products. It works by making collective interest and self-interest seem like one and the same, until even the people we trust with our children are convinced that removing a problem might be easier than solving it. The shrewd, pointed, and comically unforgiving “Bad Apples” suggests that it also takes a village to leave one behind. “Bad Apples” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

She's sweet, hard-working, and a brilliant chef in her own right. Everyone in the film sees it; Her lesbian best friend (played by Kate Berlant) and her boyfriend (Eric Rahill of the magnificent “Rap World”) can't help but dote on her, and who could blame them? One day, she finds herself the new face of Gourmaybe after one of her signature vegetarian recipes goes viral.

The cast includes Kate Berlant, Vanessa Bayer, and Connor O'Malley. There is an all-time runner about Better Help, Maddie's house is littered with incredible sight gags, and every time Berlant did so much as move her jaw it sent the whole theater to an uproar. There is a mean version of this project, the one I imagined walking in — a satire of wellness culture and feminine self-image that is brutal and shocking, with a higher joke density. But “Maddie's Secret” is a different and more tender thing. The film has far more in common with “All That Heaven Allows” and “Showgirls” than it does with “They Came Together” or “The Naked Gun”; A shot of Maddie's mother reflected in a television screen directly references Sirk's classic. The film is gorgeous, with a color grade that reminded me of how Nicholas Ray movies looked on a CRT. Though it is about many things, this is a movie most of all about bulimia, an epidemic that kills so many young girls and traps even more in a lifelong pattern of suffering. It treats eating disorders as a serious and crushingly universal experience. If the psychoanalytic rationale presented by the film can feel occasionally trite, it is no less astute or caring. By the time the story moves into the halls of an inpatient facility, it is strange to notice that “Maddie's Secret” has, without any fundamental shift in tone, begun to feel ultra-real. Yes, it is funny to meet an adult woman at the hospital who decorates her room with posters of boys and talks too much. Watching these women claw against institutional infantilization and a system of culturally instructed emotional regulation that is killing them broke my heart. None of this would work without Early's profound love for women. He plays Maddie with the grace of a mid-century diva. He wears that blond wig like it's real hair, with untamed flyaways and a style that's fighting its natural part. There is a sense, when Maddie visits a radically inclusive dance studio (even though she is just, in her words, an ally), that Early is welcoming in the girls from his past, giving them a space within his art. It cares about young women with eating disorders enough to believe they are worthy of such a massive canvas. It is rare, these days, to see something genuinely exciting on the indie scene. I am long desensitized to genre mashups and the unearned swagger of bad experimental cinematography. “Maddie's Secret” renewed my hope that this corner of the industry can go to new places, outside of what is edgy or trendy. It is an extremely accomplished debut and one of the boldest American movies I have seen in years. “Maddie's Secret” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

It will be his last as de Veer will not be returning for Season 4 of the hit anthology, blaming his exit on creative clashes with series creator, writer, director and executive producer Mike White.

No smear campaign distracted them,” he wrote across his social media channels Sunday morning. “Thank you, this means a lot to me in more than one way 🙏 I'm happy you connected with this melody cause it was an amazing trip making it.” He also was offered a ticket to last night's Creative Arts Emmy ceremony and had been invited by HBO to the Season 3 premiere. It was de Veer who went public and aired his grievances in the NYT interview a couple of days before The White Lotus‘ Season 3 finale, something White called “a bitch move” when asked about it by Howard Stern several days later. “It's about this firefly I met and filmed for an hour,” he said next to a video of the said firefly to his White Lotus music.

In truth, however, Romain Gavras' “Sacrifice” is both a little more fun and a whole lot messier than it sounds on paper. A propulsive (and hilarious) comedy that gradually melts into a dreamlike (and not so hilarious) modern fable, this hyper-stylized whatsit might be at its best when shooting fish in a barrel, but Gavras' film is much less interested in poking fun at easy targets than it is in leveraging its characters — terrorist and hostage alike — towards unformed ideas about truth, performance, and the cleansing power of death in the face of a society so ego-driven that it's impossible to tell the difference between heroes and clowns. Related Stories ‘Maddie's Secret' Review: John Early Plays a Woman with an Eating Disorder in a Comedy That's More Sincere Than Satirical Bob Odenkirk's Transformation Into John Wick Is Just Beginning And if “Sacrifice” reserves the brunt of its satire for such neoliberal sloganeering (familiar to anyone who's gone to a North American film festival over the last 15 years), Gavras' wild swing almost works because it also believes in those words with more conviction than the average movie would ever dare. Stories do have the power to change the world, Gavras and his co-writer Will Arbery (“Succession”) ultimately suggest; this one doesn't, but it's still willing to die in order to get that point across. “Golden Globe-loser” Mike Tyler (a bearded Chris Evans, delivering his funniest and most self-reflexive performance since “Not Another Teen Movie”), on the other hand, is too vain and on the verge of a nervous breakdown to affect any kind of real change. A grieving A-lister who literally flamed out on the red carpet of his most recent blockbuster by stripping naked and torching everything in sight, Mike has spent the last few months living at a monastery and/or getting a Turkish hair transplant, and the environmental gala represents his re-entry into the public eye. It's hard to be the most embarrassing thing at a party festooned with signs like “Make Earth Cool Again,” but our boy finds a way. Sitting on the toilet and soaking up his latest digital suicide, Mike isn't there to see Charli xcx treat the gala attendees to a cringe-banger about the environmental apocalypse (the “brat” iconoclast is in this movie for about five minutes, and still walks off with one of its biggest laughs), or to see it get interrupted by an army of machine gun-wielding child soldiers who are so fashionable and coordinated that the audience thinks they're part of the show. Affecting meaningful change — or suffering from the lack of it — has become so abstracted for the rich and powerful that everything feels like entertainment to them. She demands three sacrifices: Ben Bracken, a hired singer (Ambika Mod), and an unidentified “hero” to be chosen by applause-o-meter. And just when it was starting to seem like he might never get cast again! “Sacrifice” loses too much of its own steam after the action decamps from the incredible quarry set where it began, as Gavras challenges himself to see his usual fixations in a slightly different light. A nepo baby par excellence whose brilliant music videos have given way to a virtuosic but uneven trio of films about dispossessed French youth and their violent attempts at sociopolitical reclamation (the nascent “Our Day Will Come,” the incredible “The World Is Yours,” and the  exhausting “Athena”), Gavras has stayed relatively on-brand for his English-language debut. After the unyielding spectacle of “Athena,” it stands to reason that Gavras might want to slow things down a bit; to trade collective anger for a more character-driven tale, and impossible tracking shots for routine maximalism. But even with an assist from Arbery, Gavras remains a predominately visual filmmaker at heart, and watching him retreat into long-winded dialogue scenes and A24-coded surrealism endows the last hour of “Sacrifice” with the kind of square peg in a round hole discomfort that you might feel if Guy Maddin tried to make “Fight Club” (okay, bad example, that sounds awesome). Gavras seems to share in that discomfort himself, as he contrives a variety of ways — most of them arresting to look at but uninvolving to watch — to spiff up the straightforward “will he/won't he?” question of whether or not Mike will choose to jump into the volcano at the end of the movie (a “hero” cannot be pushed). The Kaufman-esque sequence that chases an ever-balding Mike through his movie roles and towards his destiny is great fun to watch, but ultimately calls our attention to the relative torpor that surrounds it. Later, Gavras leads us on a long detour into the underground bunker where Joan's father (John Malkovich) is holing up for the apocalypse, which is a marvel of set design, but a wasted opportunity to probe deeper into the space between action and self-interest. Joan and her dad are both convinced the world is going to end when that volcano erupts, but only one of them is willing to put themselves on the line in order to stop it. “Nothing is real until one faces death,” Joan insists in the flat monotone of a true believer, and “Sacrifice” is nothing if not a movie about what people are willing to give up in order to affect some kind of meaningful change. In his own roundabout and increasingly detached way, Gavras is taking aim at a culture more interested in telling a flattering story about itself than in making the world a better place, and “Sacrifice” — to its credit — is determined to engage with that disconnect on an elemental level. It would have been easy to steer a character like Mike through a personal awakening that led him to explode his ego, fall in love with Joan, and learn to believe in something bigger than himself without risking anything real, but Gavras is chasing a more profound and molecular kind of transformation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oasis will be back at the Rose Bowl for night 2 tonight. Decades after Noel Gallagher famously said his band was “bigger” than The Beatles, Oasis had a Beatle in the building, filming them like a proud musical father at their first concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Later in the night, when Liam Gallagher took lead vocals on the 1994 single “Whatever,” he added a few lines of The Beatles' Abbey Road track “Octopus's Garden” for an outro (as they've done live for awhile now), but Liam probably didn't expect to be performing live and in person for a Beatle. He made an OK gesture with his hand and simply responded, “Fabulous.” Watch the video here. Fans on social media were eating up the moment of McCartney — the only one standing in his section — filming Noel onstage, with one writing alongside the video: “Sir Paul McCartney watching Oasis tonight in Los Angeles. Night of legends.” Another wrote: “noel gallagher is gonna go home tonight to the news of paul mccartney recording him, do you understand how insane that is? Another posted throwback photos of the Gallagher brothers wearing Beatles shirts with the caption: “i wonder if these guys know paul mccartney just recorded them on his phone while watching them sing the music he inspired them to make.” In a 2021 interview, Noel reflected on the time, saying, “When Oasis started, we were so big we were compared to [The Beatles] size-wise and musically, embarrassingly, compared to them as well.” When the interviewer asked why it was embarrassing, he said: “Because we weren't as good as them.” Also in 2021, Noel Gallagher played a set at the 50th birthday of Paul's daughter Stella McCartney and even joined Sir Paul for The Beatles' “Birthday” and “I Saw Her Standing There.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As word spreads about the passing of Danny Virtue on September 4, 2025, at age 76, tributes have begun to roll in from countless cast and crew members who were touched by his work as a producer, stunt coordinator and horse whisperer on over 1,000 films and TV shows, ranging from “The Twilight Saga” to HBO's series “The Last of Us” to multiple Hallmark movies. Virtue died surrounded by his family, according to Stunts Canada, including his longtime love Charlotte, whom he married in late August — a touching milestone that their son and fellow stunt coordinator Marshall Virtue shared on Instagram. The couple were also parents to stuntman Clay Virtue, who died tragically in 2017. Despite his many awards and accomplishments, Virtue was notoriously humble. At the time of his death, he was working with Joel McCarthy on a documentary while battling stage 4 cancer, McCarthy shared on September 5 via Facebook. But basically, I just want people to remember me as a good friend. Polaha met Virtue on the set of “Jurassic Park: Dominion” and was struck not only by his expertise but by his dedication to helping others. He hosted a meaningful discussion with Virtue via Instagram Live in 2020, seen above. He taught me how to really ride a horse, but more than that, he engrained in me a sense of the stunt culture. Virtue worked on many Hallmark productions over the years, including “Big Sky River,” “Love in Paradise,” “Engaging Father Christmas,” and “Just in Time For Christmas,” per IMDb. Members of the Hallmark family who expressed sadness over the news of Virtue's death included Meghan Ory, who wrote in her Instagram Stories, “This is so sad. Actor and producer John Cassini, whose Hallmark movies include 2024's “Debbie Macomber's Joyful Mrs. Miracle” and 2021's “Making Spirits Bright,” wrote a lengthy tribute to Virtue, whom he'd known since 1990, when he guest starred on “Neon Rider.” “Curious Caterer” stuntman Lochlyn Monroe wrote a tribute post in which he called Virtue an “absolute legend” and “someone I looked up to as I navigated my journey through this crazy industry called ‘show biz'. In May, HBO featured Virtue's work with the cast of “The Last of Us” in a behind-the-scenes video, in which star Pedro Pascal said, “I consider myself incredibly lucky to have worked with him and to witness his brilliant relationship to horses.” Pascal shared the video on TikTok and expanded on his gratitude, writing, “Big thanks to Danny Virtue for teaching me how to ride without looking like I was clinging for dear life. Couldn't have made it through those stunt sequences in Season 2 without him. In a post announcing Virtue's passing, his son Marshall wrote, “He will be celebrated, and I'll share details about the service soon, as I know many people will want to pay their respects.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump administration officials are perplexed, as many people are, by House Speaker Mike Johnson's claims that Donald Trump was an FBI informant in the case against Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused and trafficked scores of underage girls. It's a terrible, unspeakable evil, and he believes that himself. According to five Trump administration officials and others close to the president, Johnson's “informant” claim on Thursday sparked widespread confusion within the ranks of Trump's government, with several senior officials blindsided or just completely perplexed by what the Trump-aligned House speaker could have possibly meant. “What the hell is he doing?” one senior Trump administration appointee told Rolling Stone, after being asked about the Johnson “informant” comment. Other Trump advisers say it's their understanding that Johnson was referencing past claims made in the media about Trump; however, these claims did not amount to the idea he was a federal “informant.” FBI officials, including deputy director Dan Bongino, did not reply to Rolling Stone's inquiries on Saturday about whether or not their boss Trump was a snitch for the feds. On Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said, “Less than one percent of those files have been released.” West Point Alumni Group Cancels Ceremony Honoring Tom Hanks Bruce Springsteen Convenes Original and Current E Street Band Members for Rare Performance In July, though, the Justice Department backtracked, issuing a memo asserting that Epstein died by suicide and that his long-awaited “client list” doesn't exist. Khanna along with 212 Democrats and four Republicans are pulling for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a discharge petition that calls on the DOJ to release all unclassified records related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking. The committee released 33,000 documents with no apparent revelations on Tuesday.Survivors are compiling a list of Epstein's associates based on their own stories while the Trump administration continues to assert that an Epstein client list does not exist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz faces off against Jannik Sinner today for the 2025 U.S. Open Tennis Championships men's title. The top two seeds were widely predicted to end up in the finals, and for tennis fans (and no doubt, tournament organizers), today's match is a dream come true. The Alcaraz vs. Sinner men's final takes place today, Sunday, September 7 at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT live from Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, Queens. If you want to watch the Sinner vs. Alcaraz match on TV, the U.S. Open men's final is airing live on ESPN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Springsteen had just performed “Thunder Road” with seven musicians, six of them representing a just-for-this-occasion combination of original and current E Street Band members—Steven Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious and Roy Bittan on keys, Ernest Carter and Max Weinberg on dual drums— plus longtime saxophonist Ed Manion. It was a thrilling finale to a day of on-stage panels, interviews and roundtable discussions featuring Springsteen himself, alongside many of the musicians and behind-the-scenes figures who played a role in the creation of Born to Run. The Born to Run symposium comes during a heightened period of legacy-building for Springsteen in advance of next month's Bruce biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere. And while that film (and the most recently announced box-set) focuses on Nebraska, it's been a backwards-looking year for Springsteen in more ways than one. But regardless of how many tidbits from throughout the day were first reported by Carlin, hearing those involved with the album discuss its backstory and mythology in-person made for an incredibly entertaining day for fans: There was former manager Mike Appel talking about hardballing both Time and Newsweek editors as he finagled for both covers with “no interview without the cover” policy (one he allegedly even extended to Playboy when they called asking for a Bruce interview). There was Jimmy Iovine sharing what Springsteen told him after they listened to Born to Run in its entirety on a rainy drive through New Jersey just a few weeks ago: “You peaked!” There was photographer Eric Meola talking about how tired Clarence Clemons and Springsteen were during the Born to Run photoshoot (“They're yawning in half the shots, exhausted. Yet in the other half, they're exuberant.”) And there were stories from former Columbia employees Paul Rappaport, Michael Pillot and Peter Philbin about fighting the uphill battle of advocating for an artist they believed in when he wasn't gaining traction in his earliest years. Should We Think of Joni Mitchell as a Jazz Singer? Bruce Springsteen to Release ‘Electric Nebraska' — and More — in Surprise Box Set Hear Bon Jovi Team Up With Bruce Springsteen for New Take on ‘Hollow Man' He reflected on having a Peter Pan poster hanging in his bedroom circa 1974, the one that inspired him naming the character in “Born to Run” “Wendy”: “Not sure what that [says about] my adult life; It actually explains quite a bit of it!” He admitted he stole the opening of “Born to Run” from “The Locomotion.” He reflected on his controlling tendencies in the studio during Born to Run and talked about how intimidated he was by seasoned session pros like the Brecker Brothers and David Sanborn: “I was young and insecure about anything and everything.” At one point, during a discussion of “Backstreets,” (a song “about those summer nights when you're left on your own,” he called it) Springsteen asked for the song's lyrics to be pulled up on a teleprompter. When that didn't immediately happen, Carlin asked him which lyrics he needed. (At his own solo show later that evening at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, Max Weinberg joked in-between songs about how earlier in the day various E Street Band members had compared and contrasted their respective hearing aids with one another backstage.) West Point Alumni Group Cancels Ceremony Honoring Tom Hanks Bruce Springsteen Convenes Original and Current E Street Band Members for Rare Performance The crowd laughed as Van Zandt played the riff as it sounded before he pointed out to Bruce that it was a minor chord. “For those of you who don't know music,” Springsteen said of the song's riff before Van Zandt sparked the change, “this would've changed history.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few if any filmmakers can build and breathlessly sustain visceral intensity with the command of Paul Greengrass, who brings documentary realism, kinetic energy and heart-pumping adrenaline to stories drawn from life or fiction, generally about people caught in explosive situations. That makes him an ideal fit for The Lost Bus, which plunges us into the 2018 inferno that ripped through Northern California's Butte County, decimating entire communities. About those flames: Greengrass, DP Pål Ulvik Rokseth (who shot the director's riveting 2018 lone-terrorist film 22 July) and an ace visual effects team led by Charlie Noble give the wildfire the qualities of an unrelenting supernatural force of destruction, without ever compromising its authenticity. The almost instantaneous spread from scattered ground fires caused by a fallen power line to an all-consuming blaze devouring everything in its path is terrifying, shooting out tongues of flame, candling trees and raining down burning embers as it grows like an uncaged monster. Most effective as an immersive ride through the raging elements. Venue: Toronto International Film Festival (Special Presentations)Release date: Friday, Sept. 19 (theaters), Friday, Oct. 3 (streaming)Cast: Matthew McConaughey, America Ferrera, Yul Vázquez, Ashlie Atkinson, Spencer WatsonDirector: Paul GreengrassScreenwriters: Paul Greengrass, Brad Inglesby, based on the book Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, by Lizzie Johnson Greengrass and co-writer Brad Inglesby (Mare of Easttown) adapted their script from journalist Lizzie Johnson's book, Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, and first-hand accounts of people who lived through the catastrophic events. But it also offers a balm in its portraits of bravery, heroism and resilience by focusing specifically on the inspiring stories of two people, bus driver Kevin McKay (McConaughey) and elementary school teacher Mary Ludwig (Ferrera). Weather reports predict an uptick in wind speeds and increased risk of fires after a long dry spell. Kevin grew up in Paradise and has only recently moved back there following the death of his father, from whom he was estranged for 20 years. Responsible for his 15-year-old son Shaun (played by the actor's own son, Levi McConaughey) and for the medical care required by his elderly mother Sherry (Kay McCabe McConaughey, you guessed it), Kevin is desperate for overtime shifts. In what seems like downbeat overkill, his sweet old dog's cancer has spread, forcing him to have the animal euthanized. Greengrass and his team of three editors, led by seasoned action hand William Goldenberg, cut back and forth between Kevin's personal difficulties and reports of rapidly escalating wildfires, the scramble to control them led by Cal Fire battalion chief Ray Martinez (Yul Vázquez). This part of the story is a compelling account of emergency management and the coordination required by firefighters, government and other organizations from across multiple counties to combat a blaze and make crucial evacuation decisions. What seems like dozens of fire trucks, air tankers and helicopters are mobilized, but strong winds allow for minimal progress. The movie's most sobering note is struck later when Martinez is informed that they have no more resources left to fight the fire, forcing him to announce that Cal Fire is now focused solely on saving lives. All this happens while a representative from Pacific Gas & Electric stands around making belated offers to help after stammering out lame justifications for not shutting down faulty power lines when the weather alerts went out. Anyone infuriated about the failure to adequately address climate change and the shortcomings in national emergency preparedness will find plenty here to stoke their anger. “Say hello to Kevin, he's our driver,” she tells the class, as if they're heading out on a fun excursion. Ferrera is wonderful here, bringing a shot of warmth, compassion and steady resolve that makes it all the more wrenching when Mary starts to lose it — panicking as she fears the worst possible outcome, her anticipation of defeat crushing. The script gets a bit schematic by giving both Kevin and Mary 15-year-old sons to fret about while they remain occupied with their younger charges. As different routes are revealed to be blocked or ablaze, Kevin becomes increasingly desperate, building to what could be a fatal decision as he plows through a path bordered by unpredictable fire. Bringing his characteristic flair for ramping up tension with handheld cameras and rapid cutting, Greengrass illustrates how easily the combination of lax safety standards and fire-friendly weather can build in what seems like a heartbeat into a mass-casualty event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The film's director and his star-studded cast got an amen and sustained applause Saturday night at the Toronto Film Festival for the world premiere of 'Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.' The world premiere for Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery on Saturday night at the Toronto Film Festival kicked off more like a religious service than a glitzy, star-studded affair when director Rian Johnson came on stage to introduce his latest murder mystery for Netflix. Can I get an Amen?” Johnson asked the capacity Princess of Wales Theatre audience with a dramatic call-back. He got those amens and sustained applause when the final credits rolled after a two hour screening. And what emerged with the first look in Toronto was a third Knives Out mystery for Netflix with a darker tone and a commentary on the role of faith and logic in today's divisive times. 'Rental Family' Review: Brendan Fraser Gets a Stellar Star Vehicle in Hikari's Clever Comic Heartwarmer 'The Lost Bus' Review: Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera Are Affecting as Modest Heroes in Paul Greengrass' Visceral Real-Life Wildfire Thriller I have a lot of complicated feelings about it. And you have a script at the end of it,” he explained. The latest Knives Out whodunnit will fit well in Trumpian times as it's set in a small town church riven by an ecclesiastical power struggle between one priest, played by Josh Brolin, who is more of a rapacious cult leader, and a second priest (Josh O'Connor), who shows his church members human grace and fallibility. As to how audiences for Wake Up the Dead ultimately solve the latest crime mystery with their own viewing, Johnson insisted his Knives Out films remain above all else entertainment. Daniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc, only in the third installment his character is gentler and kinder as he solves his latest mystery, rather than looking to nail a killer. Craig during the Q&A praised Johnson for pulling off the latest ensemble Knives Out mystery with Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Glenn Close and Kerry Washington and other heavy-hitters among the cast. “Putting this many stars into one film is literally the definition of herding cats. Wake Up Dead Man will be released on Dec. 12, in time for an awards run. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Last Rites is the seventh consecutive WB release to open north of $40 million this year, a first for any Hollywood studio and one of the numerous milestones achieved this year by the once-struggling studio. AMC Theatres Offers Horror Fans Cost-Saving "Slash Pass" Timed to 'The Conjuring: The Last Rites' 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' Review: Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson Return for a Concluding Chapter Full of Stale Scares On Saturday, it was on course to open to $75 million from 3,802 theaters, including a lion's share of higher-priced Imax and other premium large-format screens, which are a boon for the film in accounting for 40 percent of its total gross so far. Sunday's estimate of $83 million marks left Warners and New Line reeling, considering they had projected $35 million heading into the weekend, although other box pundits thought north of $50 million was more likely. It surpassed fellow New Line release It: Chapter Two ($92.5 million) to rank as the industry's top foreign bow of all time at the foreign box office, not adjusted for inflation, and Hollywood's second-largest horror bow of all time globally. The Conjuring: Last Rites stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are in their final turn as real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren, but that doesn't mean the franchise is going anywhere. Last Rites is billed as the ninth and final title in Phase One of The Conjuring Universe, which has become the top-earning horror franchise ever after collecting more than $2.3 billion in global ticket sales, not adjusted for inflation. Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy also star, with Atomic Monster's James Wan and DC Studios co-chief Peter Safran returning to produce. In 2013, the very first Conjuring movie opened to $41 million domestically, not adjusted for inflation. No subsequent title in the Conjuring Universe was able to topple that record until The Nun, which debuted to $53.8 million in 2018. Critics haven't been so kind to the new Last Rites movie — the same could be said for most installments — but audience reaction is promising. Disney's rerelease of the acclaimed 2021 filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda‘s groundbreaking stage musical Hamilton is singing to strong numbers, earning an estimated $3.9 million on Friday, including $850,000 in Thursday previews. Based on early returns, Hamilton is now on track to come in second for the weekend with a pleasing $10 million, slightly ahead of last weekend's 50th anniversary rerelease of Steven Spielberg's Jaws. Hamilton is booked in 1,825 theaters domestically, including over 100 premium large-format screens. Promoted as a one-week limited engagement, the run will likely be extended based on demand. Weapons took in $5.4 million domestically from 3,284 North American theaters for a domestic cume of $143 million despite fierce competition from Conjuring. People are well aware of Weapons‘ staying power, but Freakier Friday‘s stamina has also become a topic of conversation. Darren Aronofsky's star-studded Caught Stealing isn't as fortunate, at least so far.
