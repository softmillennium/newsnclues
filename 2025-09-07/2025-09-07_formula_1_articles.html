                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri P2 was within Oscar Piastri's grasp at the Italian Grand Prix before team orders resulted in his McLaren team mate Lando Norris reclaiming the position. Qualifying then saw him take third place behind Norris, which is where he remained for the majority of the Italian Grand Prix as he focused on managing his tyres around the high-speed circuit. However, an agonisingly slow pitstop for the Briton handed Piastri an unexpected P2 on track after he had changed onto fresh tyres first – this didn't last for long as he was ordered to hand the position back, prompting him to remark: “Is a slow pitstop part of racing?”. After enduring a long stint on medium tyres, the team asked Norris whether he would prefer to pit before or after his team mate. He agreed to go second as long as there was no threat of the Australian undercutting him, which is exactly what happened when an error led to a 5.9s stop when Norris swapped for soft tyres. Piastri reflected on the strategy choice, concluding: “We went so long that the soft seemed like a good tyre to put on, and we were just staying out for Safety Cars if we got any, but eventually Max got back into our pit window so there wasn't any point staying out much longer. His lead has now been cut to 31 points over Norris with nine rounds of the season remaining, and the tough weekend in Monza has given him plenty of points to focus on in his ongoing mission to claim his first title. “I think as a team we just didn't have amazing pace today,” he summarised. Maybe not the best opening lap or two either, which didn't really help things, but nothing too much to complain about.”</p>

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Italian Grand Prix

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Max Verstappen has a memorable pole position, but he had to do the fastest lap in 75 years of F1 history to take it. Behind him are the McLarens, and given their run of five straight victories, putting neither car on pole looks a little lacklustre – but the MCL39 thrives when it's presented with a sequence of medium-speed corners to attack, and Monza forgot to order any of those.

Behind the McLarens, Ferrari have looked spritely on home turf, and Charles Leclerc could very easily have been top of the pile, while Lewis Hamilton has some ground to make up after his Zandvoort penalty pushes him down to P10.

Post-session, Verstappen didn't sound hugely confident of maintaining his lead, given the race pace of his rivals in Friday's long runs – but he does have strategic cards to play, with a different tyre allocation to them – and everybody else on the grid – that could be crucial should chaos descend. All to play for then, at the Temple of Speed…

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Lando Norris was the driver to beat in Free Practice 3 at the Italian Grand Prix.

Lando Norris brought his Friday form forward by topping the timesheets during Free Practice 3 ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.

After setting the pace in second practice, Norris again held the quickest lap in the weekend's third and final hour by pumping in a time of 1m 19.331s at the wheel of the McLaren, putting him 0.021s clear of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc – who had a couple of big moments during the session – in P2.

Oscar Piastri slotted into third in the other McLaren, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen placing in fourth while the Mercedes of George Russell and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto followed in fifth and sixth respectively.
