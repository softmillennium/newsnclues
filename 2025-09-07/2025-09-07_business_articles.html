                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Current CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Antonio Neri rose from call center agent at the company to chief executive officer. Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, started off with a summer gig helping to unload trucks. It's a similar story for GM CEO Mary Barra, who began on the assembly line at the automaker as an 18-year old. Those are the kinds of career ladder success arcs that have inspired workers, and Hollywood, but as AI is set to replace many entry-level jobs, it may also write that corporate character out of the plot. The rise of AI has coincided with considerable organizational flattening, especially among middle management ranks. At the same time, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among those who forecast 50% of entry-level jobs may be wiped out by AI as the technology improves, including being able to work eight-hour shifts without a break. Looking at data between 2019 and 2024 for the biggest public tech firms and maturing venture-capital funded startups, venture capital firm SignalFire found in a study there was a 50% decline in new role starts by people with less than one year of post-graduate work experience: "Hiring is intrinsically volatile year on year, but 50% is an accurate representation of the hiring delta for this experience category over the considered timespan," said Asher Bantock, head of research at SignalFire. But Heather Doshay, partner at SignalFire, says the data should not lead job seekers to lose hope. "The loss of clear entry points doesn't just shrink opportunities for new grads — it reshapes how organizations grow talent from within," she said. If, as Amodei told CNBC earlier this year, "At some point, we are going to get to AI systems that are better than almost all humans at almost all tasks," the critical question for workers is how the idea of an entry-level job can evolve as AI continues to. "The ladder isn't broken — it's just being replaced with something that looks a lot flatter," Doshay said. In her view, the classic notion of a CEO rising from the mailroom is a perfect example since at many company's it's been a long time since anyone worked in an actual mailroom. The new "entry level" might be a more advanced or skilled role, but with the upskilling of the bottom rung, pressure is being created for new grads to acquire these job skills on their own, rather than being able to learn them while already on a job they can't land today. That should not be a career killer, though, according to Doshay. "When the internet and email came on the scene as common corporate required skills, new grads were well-positioned to become experts by using them in school, and the same absolutely applies here with how accessible AI is," she said. "The key will be in how new grads harness their capabilities to become experts so they are seen as desirable tech-savvy workers who are at the forefront of AI's advances," she said. But she concedes that may not offer much comfort to the current crop of recent grads looking for jobs right now. "My heart goes out to the new grads of 2024, 2025, and 2026, as they are entering during a time of uncertainty," Doshay said, describing it is a much more vulnerable group entering the workforce than ones further into the future. "Historically, technological advancements have not harmed employment rates in the long run, but there are short-term impacts along the way," Doshay said. "The entry-level careers of recent graduates are most affected, which could have lasting effects as they continue to grow their careers with less experience while finding fewer job opportunities," she added.Anders Humlum, assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, says predictions about AI's long-term labor market impact remain highly speculative, and firms are only just beginning to adjust to the new generative AI landscape. "We now have two and a half years of experience with generative AI chatbots diffusing widely throughout the economy," Humlum said, adding "these tools have really not made a significant difference for employment or earnings in any occupation thus far." Looking at the history of labor and technology, he says even the most transformative technologies, such as steam power, electricity, and computers took decades to generate large-scale economic effects. As a result, any reshaping of the corporate structure and culture will take time to become clear. "Employers can significantly reduce this gap by actively encouraging adoption and offering training programs to support effective use," he said. If predictions about AI advancements ultimately leading to superintelligence are proven correct, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, says the issue isn't going to be about whether the 50% entry-level jobs being wiped out is accurate, but that percentage growing to 100% for all careers, "since superintelligence can by definition do all jobs better than us," he said. In that world, even if you were the last call center, distribution center or assembly line worker to make it to the CEO desk, your days of success might be numbered. "If we continue racing ahead with totally unregulated AI, we'll first see a massive wealth and power concentration from workers to those who control the AI, and then to the machines themselves as their owners lose control over them," Tegmark said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has been on top of the rankings for a ridiculous 65 weeks now, even if he had to retire with illness when these two last met in the Cincinnati Open final. The Italian has been putting on a clinic in New York and is a favorite to retain his title and add it to his Australian Open and Wimbledon titles in an impressive 2025. Carlos Alcaraz, the current French Open champ, has been on his tail all season, and Cincinnati aside, these two usually put on one hell of a match and aren't afraid to go the distance. He made short work of Djokovic a few days ago, a player the Spaniard has struggled with in recent meetings. As of 2:05 p.m., we can still see huge lines outside the stadium as crowds filter in through the extra security. We wouldn't be surprised to see the start further delayed at this point, so you still have plenty of time to get yourself connected with one of the viewing options in this guide. In Australia, fans can live stream the Alcaraz vs. Sinner match for free via 9Now. Don't worry if you're not in Australia right now, as we can show you how to use a VPN in the next section of the article to get around geo-restrictions and watch for free as well. In the US, ESPN viewing options are available in five-day free trials through live TV streaming services like DirecTV and Fubo. If you're away from Australia right now, you can still tune into your free streaming option with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy tech tools that allow you to change your virtual location so your go-to websites and apps work from anywhere. They're popular services for those hoping to keep up with their usual services while traveling abroad or looking to upgrade their cybersecurity. It's a user-friendly option (even for beginners) and has an impressive suite of cybersecurity features. You can learn more in our NordVPN review. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs. Matches will be available in full through the new ESPN streaming service. Both tiers have US Open coverage, but Unlimited unlocks lots of extra coverage and full live streams from flagship networks. You can learn more in our ESPN streaming service guide and check out a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year. If you're looking for an even more comprehensive sports streaming option, a month-to-month live TV streaming service such as DirecTV or Fubo can help. DirecTV MySports, the service's new genre pack, includes 20+ popular sports channels traditionally found in cable packages and access to the ESPN streaming service app. Right now, users can also get $10 a month off their first two months of service. Fubo is another solid sports-friendly live TV streaming service with access to ABC and all of the necessary ESPN networks, in addition to more than 200 other live channels. Fubo Pro subscriptions start at $85 a month (plus a little bit more with required regional sports fees), but new users can get $30 off their first month of service after a five-day free trial. There's also a brand-new Fubo Sports package, which costs $56 a month, although it's only available in select markets right now. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moreover, on average, September has historically been the worst month for U.S. stocks. Investors seeking consistent income despite a volatile market can consider adding dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios. To this end, they can rely on the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who with their expertise can help select attractive dividend stocks with strong fundamentals. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first dividend pick is Archrock (AROC), an energy infrastructure company with a primary focus on midstream natural gas compression. In a recent research note, Mizuho analyst Gabriel Moreen updated the models and price targets for master limited partnerships (MLPs) and midstream companies. Moreen reiterated a buy rating on Archrock stock and modestly raised the price forecast to $32 from $31. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AROC stock with a price target of $27. Moreen said AROC continues to "distinguish itself with exceptional balance sheet flexibility," which allows it to deliver not only solid capital returns like its $28.8 million share repurchase in the second quarter, but also supports higher capital spending and dividend expansion. Notably, the 5-star analyst highlighted that AROC indicated that it expects its dividend to increase consistently with recent dividends per share growth, if the business performs. The analyst stated that AROC demonstrated strong operational momentum by raising its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) guidance for the second consecutive quarter, although there were some one-time items. Moreover, Moreen believes that Archrock's aggressive capex outlook stands out, as it clearly indicates that the company is seeing solid demand for new orders despite the volatility following "liberation day." 112 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Next up is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP), a leading global infrastructure company that owns and operates diversified, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, midstream and data sectors. BIP stock offers a dividend yield of 5.6%. Recently, Jefferies analyst Sam Burwell resumed coverage of Brookfield Infrastructure stock with a buy rating and a price target of $35. Burwell stated that BIP remains a "unique beast" with an expanding footprint. He noted three significant acquisitions since April – the Colonial Pipeline, rail car leasing with GATX, and the Hotwire fiber-to-home business, all of which were U.S.-focused and highly contracted. Additionally, all three have strengthened BIP's midstream, transport, and data businesses, respectively. "While BIP's broad footprint remains complex, we tend to view positively that the YTD acquisitions have been in the US and that most of the divestitures have been ex-North America," said Burwell. Burwell expects BIP's funds from operations (FFO) to grow at a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), excluding to-be-announced capital recycling. Burwell also expects solid distribution growth at about 6.5% CAGR through 2027. 848 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Another dividend-paying energy stock is Permian Resources (PR). The company declared a base dividend of 15 cents per share for the third quarter of 2025, payable on Sept. 30. Recently, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on Permian stock with a price forecast of $17. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.50. Mehta highlighted that Permian Resources continued to ramp its operations in the second quarter across the acquired assets from APA Corp. and other smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Moreover, the company announced new transportation and marketing agreements to enhance oil and natural gas netbacks, which are estimated to drive incremental free cash flow of over $50 million in 2026 compared with 2024. Despite the uncertainty around oil prices, the 5-star analyst remains bullish on Permian Resources, given its cost optimization efforts and focus on delivering higher free cash flow per share. The analyst noted management's commentary about PR's solid balance sheet, which allows it to make strategic investments without disrupting its capital allocation priorities, such as increasing cash on the balance sheet, share repurchases, and debt reduction. "We believe PR's focus on opportunistically acquiring high-quality assets along with consistent grassroots acquisitions can drive long-term shareholder value," said Mehta. 670 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea says it has finished talks with the US to return its citizens who were arrested in an immigration raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported, citing a senior presidential official. A chartered plane will be sent to the US if administrative procedures are completed, presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said on Sunday, per the report. It comes after nearly 500 workers were detained at a new Hyundai-LG battery facility on Thursday. "This, in fact, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security investigations," said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, during a press conference Friday. Hyundai, based in Seoul, is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers by revenue. The Georgia battery factory that was raided is still under construction and due to open in the first half of next year. It is part of a larger, $7.6 billion operation that includes a production plant for Hyundai's electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as autos for its Genesis luxury brand and sister company Kia. Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company." The company said that it is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate," including employment verification and immigration laws. Chris Susock, the North America chief manufacturing officer, is taking over the Georgia site, according to Hyundai, and ensuring that subcontractors are following regulations. "As we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with US law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect," the company added in its updated statement. Today, @ATFAtlanta joined HSI, FBI, DEA, ICE, GSP and other agencies in a major immigration enforcement operation at the Hyundai mega site battery plant in Bryan County, GA, leading to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety. "We are closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details," an LG spokesperson said. South Korea's foreign ministry had on Friday voiced its "concern and regret" over the matter, Yonhap reported. Since the start of Donald Trump's second presidency in January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have made arrests at a range of worksites across the country, including a meat-processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, a fire-equipment company in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and a Louisiana racetrack. Day laborers outside of Home Depot locations have also been targeted. The Hyundai raid comes after President Trump signed a bill into law in July that provides ICE with additional funding and resources to assist in the arrests of immigrants living in the US illegally, including enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 individuals. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most US imports from South Korea, including automobiles, in exchange for duty-free treatment on many American products. Update: 9/5/2025 — This story now contains an updated statement from Hyundai.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 300 South Korean workers detained following a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home, the South Korean government announced Sunday. Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said that South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers' release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as the remaining administrative steps are completed. U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided Hyundai's sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker Hyundai makes electric vehicles. South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun later said that more than 300 South Koreans were among the detained. But the one on Thursday is exceptionally distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site, state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project. Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. Agents focused their operation on a plant that is still under construction, at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs. Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday, adding that the investigation is ongoing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and the Middle East, experts said Sunday, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused the incident. There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users. Microsoft announced via a status website that the Mideast "may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea." NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said "a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries," which it said included India and Pakistan. It blamed "failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia." The South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate. Neither firm did not immediately responded to requests for comment. Pakistan Telecommunications, a telecom giant in that country, noted that the cuts had taken place in a statement on Saturday. Saudi Arabia did not immediately acknowledge the disruption and authorities there did not respond to a request for comment. In the United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, internet users on the country's state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. Anchors can cut subsea cables dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. It can take weeks for repairs to be made as the ship and crew must locate themselves over the damaged cable. The lines' cut comes as Yemen's Houthi rebels remain locked in a series of attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has responded with airstrikes, including one that killed top leaders within the rebel movement. Several were cut, but the Houthis denied being responsible. On Sunday morning, the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged that the cuts had taken place, citing NetBlocks. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sunk four vessels and killed at least eight mariners. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis sank two vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the rebels. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in which the Americans bombed three Iranian atomic sites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he will step down as leader of the world's fourth-largest economy amid growing political discord within his party. "I made a difficult decision to step down," Ishiba said during a press briefing, in comments translated by Japan's public broadcaster NHK. He added that it is his "strong wish" for members of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to overcome the "difficult divide" within the party. Ishiba indicated that he had been thinking about his position as prime minister since last year's election, but that it was a matter of finding the right timing. Ishiba described the U.S. tariff measures as a "national crisis." He added that he believes a "significant milestone" has been reached, after receiving a report from Japan's tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, on Saturday. "I have consistently stated that I do not intend to cling to this position, and that I would make a decision at the appropriate time after accomplishing what needed to be done.... Now that negotiations concerning U.S. tariff measures have reached a conclusion, I believe this is precisely the appropriate timing. I have therefore decided to step aside and make way for my successor," he said in comments translated by NBC News. Ishiba will continue his duties until a new successor has been found, he told reporters. The world's fourth-largest economy has been plagued with political uncertainty since the LDP lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election late last year. Pressure mounted when Japan's ruling coalition lost control of the upper house in July. Japan had struggled to reach a trade agreement with the U.S. and protect its massive auto sector from high duties. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to implement a trade deal with Japan, imposing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos. The deal was agreed to after months of negotiations, with Washington and Tokyo continuing to haggle over details for weeks before it was signed. Earlier this week, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July. Local media reports suggested many key members of the LDP had signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba had said that he intended to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the many places Kathy White, 66, has called home over the last decade are Mount Rushmore, New York's Hudson Valley, South Texas, and Kentucky. The only constant has been her 30-foot Itasca Sunstar motorhome. "You're on vacation in a way," she said, despite working relatively low-paid jobs, mainly managing activities and administrative tasks at campgrounds and parks. White is among many Americans living itinerant lives and paying the bills with seasonal work. So-called "work camping" has become popular among a broad swath of Americans, including retirees volunteering in exchange for an RV hook-up, Gen Z influencers pursuing #vanlife, and would-be retirees who need to fund their travel bucket list. The lifestyle can offer a sense of freedom, but it can be logistically challenging, and isn't necessarily cheaper than living in "sticks and bricks," as so-called "workampers" call traditional homes. So the Michigan couple bought an RV in 2020 to use for short trips planned around Matt's work schedule as a law enforcement officer. But the RV suddenly became their primary home when Matt left his job while struggling with health issues, Laurie said. "I knew that we couldn't continue in our current lifestyle without his income," she said. So the couple applied for work camping jobs from Montana to California. Their first seasonal job was five months working in a campground just outside Yellowstone National Park. They did administrative work, helped orient visitors, and cleaned cabins. "My view from the campground office was Electric Peak," said Laurie, 51. "It was just such a world of difference" from their lives in Blissfield, Michigan. They've had jobs fall through weeks before they were supposed to start, leaving them scrambling for work at the last minute. Their RV has broken down, putting them in a hotel for weeks. And they've felt too far from their adult children at times. "A lot of people argue in the work camping space that you can't make good money, you don't have health benefits, all of this stuff. Many work campers are older volunteers who do work in exchange for a place to park their camper and a hookup. They will reach their five-year "nomad anniversary" in October and plan to maintain this lifestyle for at least the next few years. Business Insider is covering the ways people are living outside traditional housing. When their house was still for sale, a Texas campground owner offered them unpaid work positions in exchange for a free campsite and electricity. They've since traveled beyond the state and done more unpaid work in exchange for a free site, food, and laundry. Patty said they mainly live off Shane's retirement money from the Air Force, but social media earnings also help cover living expenses. "We will work camp for a few months, and then we go and just travel for a few months without work camping," Patty said. She loves that work camping lets her get to know an area and meet lots of new people. The rise of remote work since the pandemic has also opened up possibilities for camping and traveling without committing to taking relatively low-paid seasonal jobs. Their leap into RV life was made possible by Childers' remote job as a customer success representative for a software education company. After several months on the road, Landrum, who worked as a handyman back in Detroit, began taking paid work camping jobs, including maintenance and cleaning at campgrounds and helping with American Crystal Sugar's annual sugar beet harvest in eastern North Dakota. These days, both Childers, 50, and Landrum, 40, are working seasonal work camping jobs since Childers was laid off from her remote job in February. "We get to stay in these amazing places that we could never afford for even a week, let alone staying for months at a time," Childers said. In early September, they'll head back to North Dakota for their fifth consecutive beet harvest. When Dave Hatton retired from 18 years as an elementary school teacher in Phoenix this past spring, he launched right into his next career as a photographer. Hatton, who just turned 60, began exploring his passion for landscape photography in the rural Southwest during the pandemic, and eventually realized that to do his best work in an affordable way, he needed to live on location. He wants to explore much of the West and Southwest. But with his wife still working as a teacher back in Phoenix, he doesn't have plans to live on the road full time. The work camping lifestyle doesn't come without significant challenges. These days, Kathy White said she's looking for one place, or maybe two, to settle down in. But she hasn't found "that perfect place" yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what kept the news desks busiest was bond market volatility, which could well spill over into next week. Over the last few days, we've had a slew of guests sharing their views on some of the most significant yield moves seen in the U.K. gilt market and across Europe in decades. And more could be to come next week… At the epicenter of European bond yield uncertainty is France. On Monday, there will be a confidence vote in the government, called by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou — and the ruling party is almost certain to lose. Rivals France Insoumise, National Rally and the Socialist Party have all claimed they will vote against the government. This raises the prospect of President Emmanuel Macron calling a snap election, although it is more likely he will seek to assign another centrist caretaker government. In a straw poll of clients, Nomura found that yields of French government bonds — or OATS — would need to move even more dramatically to cause a "major loss of international investor confidence." In a note, the bank pointed to the next rating review of France's sovereign debt by Fitch, due to take place on Sept. 12, as a key date to watch. Another inflection point this week will come when the ECB meets on Thursday amid the heightened market volatility. The central bank is expected to keep rates on hold at 2%, with HSBC predicting President Christine Lagarde will maintain a "dovish bias." The ECB itself stressed the need to stay "deliberately uninformative about future interest rates decisions" in its July account of its policy meeting. Market watchers expect Lagarde to be questioned about the uncertainty in France during her press conference, but economists predict she will avoid answering directly.
