                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Getting a little extra muscle in the conflict likely required having a bit of spare cash on hand, and archaeologists recently uncovered some of that loot in the form of a hoard of gold coins, which they found buried in a small pot in western Turkey. According to researchers led by the University of Michigan, the gold coins—which were originally discovered in 2023, but only recently okayed for publication by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism—depict a kneeling archer. The fact that this literal pot of gold was even found shows that an unlikely scenario befell the owner. “The discovery of such a valuable find in a controlled archaeological excavation is very rare,” said Christopher Ratte, professor of ancient Mediterranean art and archaeology and director of the Notion Archaeological Survey, the project that discovered the coins, in a statement. According to the Greek historian Xenophon, a single daric was equivalent to a soldier's pay for one month. Then, come the early fifth century B.C., it came under Greek control. That didn't last too long, however, as the early fourth century B.C. All this back-and-forth rule made Notion the front lines of conflict, with Greek historians chronicling the use of barbarian mercenaries during Athenian vs. Persian skirmishes. It is battles like these that could have warranted an army collecting enough daric to pay for additional assistance, but any sort of defeat could have meant that the owners of the coins weren't able to retrieve them, leaving... say... a pot of coins to be found centuries later. As Notion was an important military harbor, the coins could have been part of payment to help build out the waterfront. “This hoard,” Ratte said, “will provide a firm date that can serve as an anchor to help fix the chronology of the [entire sequence of coins].” “If it can be established accurately by other means, to allow us to fine-tune the chronology of the Achaemenid gold coinage,” said Andrew Meadows, former curator of coins at the British Museum and the American Numismatic Society and now at Oxford University, in a statement. “This is a spectacular find […] of the highest importance.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.
