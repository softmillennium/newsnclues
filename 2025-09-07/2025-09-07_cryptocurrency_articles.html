                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Catalini, co-creator of Facebook's Libra project, warned on Friday that Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc could succeed commercially but at the cost of crypto's decentralization ideal. The project promised to make payments as seamless as messaging, but it triggered immediate backlash from regulators concerned about financial sovereignty, systemic risk, and user privacy. Catalini, who served as Libra's chief economist, used his Sept. 5 thread on X to revisit the project's early compromises and explain why they matter now. He said the original open design, developed with Harvard economist Scott Kominers, was reduced to a short appendix after months of regulatory negotiations. For supervisors used to intermediated finance, a world where users truly held their own money was unmanageable. Catalini noted the irony: today, open networks are developing compliance tools native to blockchain that could have addressed these concerns more effectively than traditional frameworks. But back then, Libra was forced to strip away decentralization, a change he described as an early signal of where corporate-led projects were heading. His broader lesson was stark: “As long as there is a single throat to choke — or a committee of them — you can't truly rewire the system. Worse, any network with an architect is living on borrowed time.” Catalini placed Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc in that context. Circle launched Arc on Aug. 12, presenting it as a Layer-1 network purpose-built for stablecoin finance. Unlike public chains that rely on volatile gas tokens, Arc uses USDC for fees, offering predictable, dollar-denominated costs. It integrates a built-in foreign exchange engine, promises sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy features. Just weeks later, Stripe and Paradigm unveiled Tempo on Sept. 4, describing it as a payments-first blockchain capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second. Stripe said early design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Revolut, Nubank, Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic and DoorDash. Catalini argued that corporate-led chains like Arc and Tempo risk simply rebuilding the old financial system with new players in charge. He also predicted such networks would fracture geopolitically, with Western and Eastern blocs unlikely to share a single corporate-led infrastructure. Ultimately, Catalini described Stripe's Tempo as a “referendum on the ghost of Libra.” If it thrives, he suggested, it may prove Libra failed because of timing, not design — and show that the dream of open, permissionless money has been overtaken by more pragmatic, centralized solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's elusive, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto has remained in the shadows since his last message in 2011, saying that he had “moved on to other things.” But SharpLink Gaming co-CEO Joseph Chalom has a “wild theory” that Nakamoto will reveal himself once the original cryptocurrency faces an existential threat from quantum computing. Chalom, who co-leads the $3.6 billion Ethereum treasury company, told Decrypt last week that he believes the Bitcoin founder may reveal himself as this hurdle is attempted. “I have a wild idea that at some point—five, 10 years from now—when the Bitcoin network needs to be quantum-proofed, there will be some really important decisions around standards and encryption,” Chalom explained. That's a lot of money to leave on the table,” he added.” This theory, Chalom added, is not based on any facts and is just another bold theory to add to the 17-year mountain of Satoshi speculation. However, Chalom did say that if his theory is right, then he believes Satoshi will reveal himself through “some old, OG accounts” that haven't been active in a long time. At the time of writing, these wallets hold 1.096 million BTC, which is worth approximately $121.9 billion, according to Arkham data. Predictors at Myriad think that such a move is unlikely to be made soon, with 90% voting against Satoshi hitting a $150 billion net worth in September. SharpLink Will Explore Staking Portion of $3.6 Billion Ethereum Treasury on Linea, CEO Says Thousands of theories about Satoshi's real identity have spawned since the Bitcoin white paper was first penned in 2008. Fingers have been pointed at early Bitcoin adopters, government organizations, and even Elon Musk. But Bitcoin backers have yet to agree on a single person. “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” director Cullen Hoback highlighted a forum post from Todd to Satoshi, which the director believed was Todd speaking as if he were in control of both accounts. Todd also pushed back by posting on social media, “I'm not Satoshi.”</p>

Bitcoin's illiquid supply—the portion of coins held by entities with little history of spending—has climbed to a new record high, surpassing 14.3 million BTC in late August, according to Glassnode. 

With 19.9 million BTC currently in circulation, around 72% of the total supply is now illiquid, held by entities such as long-term holders and cold storage investors. This growth highlights a sustained accumulation trend, even during recent market volatility.

In mid-August, bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124,000 before retreating roughly 15%. Despite the price pullback, the illiquid supply continued to rise, showing that holders remain undeterred by short-term corrections. 

Over the past 30 days alone, the net change in illiquid supply has increased by 20,000 BTC, underscoring persistent investor conviction.

The ongoing increase in this category suggests tightening supply dynamics that could set the stage for renewed momentum once sentiment recovers. For now, the trend reflects growing confidence in bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As AI floods hiring with polished but hollow applications, blockchain-based credentials offer verifiable proof of skills over artificial eloquence. Opinion by: Ignacio Palomera, co-founder and CEO of Bondex Employers are inundated with applications that look polished, persuasive and tailored — but often lack any real signal of effort, capability or authenticity. It stops signaling effort or enthusiasm and starts looking more like standardized output. Hiring managers are now staring at inboxes filled with slick, personalized applications that all feel strangely similar. And that's where the real problem kicks in: If everyone sounds qualified on paper, how can you tell who has the skills and knows how to game a prompt? Traditional hiring has long relied on trust-based signals such as resumes, references and degrees, but these have always been weak proxies. Titles can be inflated, education overstated and past work exaggerated. AI blurs things even more, cloaking unverifiable claims in artificial eloquence. For fast-paced, remote-native industries like crypto or decentralized autonomous organization ecosystems, the stakes are even higher, as there's rarely time for deep due diligence. Trust is extended quickly and often informally — risky in a pseudonymous, global environment. More HR tooling or AI detection won't solve this. What's needed is a stronger foundation for trust itself. Consider a hiring manager trying to verify work history, social handles or onchain contributions. It's not just about checking a box to prove that you exist. Related: Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap In this model, your resume becomes a programmable asset. It is not a static PDF but something that can evolve, be queried and, in some cases, be privately verified without revealing every detail. That's where tools like zero-knowledge proofs come in, giving users control over how much they reveal and to whom. Some might argue that this all feels a little too invasive. In practice, however, and especially in Web3, most serious contributors already operate through pseudonymous identities built on provable actions, not job titles. As reputation becomes programmable, entire industries stand to be reshaped. Grants, hiring rounds and even token sales could use provable credentials as filters. This makes trust composable — something that can be built into protocols and platforms by default. What's provable today includes contributions, learning history and verifiable credentials. Blockchain-based identity and credential systems offer a path forward — where individuals can prove their work and hiring decisions can be based on verifiable data, not guesswork. We need to stop pretending that polished language equals proof of skill. If hiring — and broader reputation systems — are to survive the coming AI wave, we need to rebuild the foundation of trust.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has denied recent rumors that the stablecoin issuer is offloading its Bitcoin holdings to buy gold. In a Sunday post on X, Ardoino said the company “didn't sell any Bitcoin,” and reaffirmed its strategy of allocating profits into assets like “Bitcoin, gold, and land.” The comments came in response to speculation from YouTuber Clive Thompson, who cited Tether's Q1 and Q2 2025 attestation data from BDO to claim the firm had reduced its Bitcoin (BTC) position. However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow debunked the claim, noting that Tether transferred 19,800 BTC to a separate initiative called Twenty One Capital (XXI) during the same period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has denied recent rumors that the stablecoin issuer is offloading its Bitcoin holdings to buy gold. In a Sunday post on X, Ardoino said the company “didn't sell any Bitcoin,” and reaffirmed its strategy of allocating profits into assets like “Bitcoin, gold, and land.” The comments came in response to speculation from YouTuber Clive Thompson, who cited Tether's Q1 and Q2 2025 attestation data from BDO to claim the firm had reduced its Bitcoin (BTC) position. However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow debunked the claim, noting that Tether transferred 19,800 BTC to a separate initiative called Twenty One Capital (XXI) during the same period.

Related: Tether scraps plan to freeze USDT on five blockchains Tether's Bitcoin sell-off rumors came as El Salvador revealed it has added 13,999 troy ounces of gold worth $50 million to its foreign reserves, marking its first gold acquisition since 1990. Before turning to gold, El Salvador built a $700 million Bitcoin reserve, holding 6,292 BTC. However, an International Monetary Fund report in July claimed that the Central American country has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin retesting $100,000 would match previous BTC price dips since the end of 2024, Fibonacci retracement analysis shows. Bitcoin sees a modest rebound into the weekly candle close, but traders see key resistance overhead. BTC price action risks a much deeper drop if bulls fail to reclaim that resistance zone. Fibonacci analysis hints that such a drop may not pass more than 10%. Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $111,000 into Sunday's weekly close as analysis saw “promising” recovery signs. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining about 1% on the day to hit local highs of $111,369. The pair's latest dip, which followed US macroeconomic data, saw bulls preserve $110,000 support. Market participants continued to hold diverging views over short-term BTC price action. Popular trader Cipher X suggested that $112,000 could spark new lows should bulls fail to reclaim it next. $BTC holds around $111K, but structure hints at a possible dipIf momentum stalls below $112K, I expect a pullback toward $108K supportNothing major is happening across the market right now - it's the weekend so best to stay patient and relaxed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin adoption among retail users has set new records this year, with transaction volumes through August already exceeding last year's total, a fresh report by CEX.io said. Retail-sized transfers, counting transactions under $250, crossed $5.84 billion in August alone, the highest ever recorded, according to data by Visa and Allium cited in the report. Survey data from emerging markets, asking over 2,600 consumer in Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, reinforced this picture, CEX.io analysts. Nearly 70% of them reported using stablecoins more frequently than last year, and more than three-quarters expect usage to keep rising, the report said. The Tron TRX$0.3359 blockchain, traditionally popular for retail transfers due to its low fees and wide support for Tether's USDT (USDT), has given up market share. In its place, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) emerged as the top choice for retail users, capturing nearly 40% of retail stablecoin activity, the report said. The network's transaction count jumped 75% this year with transfer volume rising 67%. Much of the momentum came after Binance delisted USDT in March for European users and a resurgence of memecoin trading on PancakeSwap on BSC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With lawmakers back in session, one of the most divisive questions in U.S. finance has returned to center stage: should America issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC)? Opponents argue that a retail CBDC could erode civil liberties. Representative Tom Emmer has warned such a system might give Washington direct oversight of citizens' spending habits. His Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act – already passed in the House – seeks to prevent what he calls “programmable money” without cash-like privacy protections. Policy voices counter that the debate often ignores key realities. Sheila Warren of the Project Liberty Institute notes that the Federal Reserve cannot launch a CBDC without congressional approval, and any privacy features would be determined by design choices, not by default. She believes much of the rhetoric reflects politics rather than genuine technological risk. China's e-CNY is already in circulation, while Europe and India are piloting their own versions. Warren suggests wholesale CBDCs, which settle payments between banks, may hold some potential domestically, but she remains skeptical of a retail digital dollar ever launching. Ironically, while lawmakers warn about future state overreach, data collection by private corporations is already pervasive. From AI firms to automakers selling driver information, Warren argues the real privacy risks are present today — long before any digital dollar enters circulation. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has once again demonstrated its conviction in digital assets, boosting positions in two of the sector's most closely watched names: Bullish and BitMine Immersion Technologies. The European Union has reignited its long fight with U.S. tech giants, handing Google a massive €3 billion penalty for allegedly abusing its dominance in digital advertising.

The SEC is set to dismiss its lawsuit against Consensys, marking a turning point in the regulatory battle over MetaMask's compliance with securities laws.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ECB advisor warns euro stablecoins face strategic risk amidst rising dollar dominance The following is a guest post and opinion of Eneko Knörr, CEO and Co-Founder of Stabolut. Months ago, in an op-ed for CryptoSlate, I warned that the EU's flagship crypto regulation, MiCA, would achieve the opposite of its goals. I argued it would strangle euro innovation while cementing the US dollar's dominance for a new generation. At the time, some thought this was alarmist. Today, with grim validation, the same concerns are being echoed from within the European Central Bank itself. In a recent blog post, also highlighted by the Financial Times, ECB advisor Jürgen Schaaf described the state of the euro-denominated stablecoin market as “dismal” and warned that Europe risks being “steamrollered” by dollar-based competitors. This warning comes at a critical time. Yet, in the burgeoning digital economy, these same currencies are nearly invisible. The world's second most important currency, the euro, has been reduced to a digital rounding error. While privately issued, dollar-denominated stablecoins command a market capitalization approaching $300 billion, their euro-denominated counterparts struggle to reach $450 million, according to data from CoinGecko. It means that for every €1 of value transacted on a blockchain, there are nearly €700 in US dollars. This dollarization of the digital world presents a profound strategic risk to Europe's monetary sovereignty and economic competitiveness. The EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation was intended to create clarity, but in its ambition to control risk, it has inadvertently built a cage. While its framework for E-Money Tokens (EMTs) provides a path to regulation, it contains a poison pill for any euro stablecoin with global ambitions. This isn't an accident or a simple oversight; it's a feature designed to ensure no private euro stablecoin can ever truly succeed. For context, the leading dollar stablecoin, Tether (USDT), regularly processes over $50 billion in daily volume. By stifling private innovation, the EU is placing all its bets on a state-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This is not only a slow, centralized answer to a fast-moving, decentralized market, but it also poses a fundamental threat to the privacy of European citizens. It gives the state the potential power to monitor, track, and even control how every citizen uses their own money. While Brussels focuses on building its walled garden, other major economic powers have recognized the strategic importance of privately issued stablecoins. They see them not as a threat but as a vital tool for projecting monetary influence in the digital age. In Japan, regulators have already passed a landmark stablecoin bill, creating clear pathways for the issuance of yen-backed stablecoins. These nations understand that the digital currency war will be won by empowering private innovation, not by centralizing control. If the euro is to compete, Brussels must execute a radical policy U-turn. This requires a clear-eyed strategy that recognizes private innovation will always outpace centralized solutions. Here is a playbook for how Europe can win: The choice is stark: Europe can continue down its path of self-imposed digital irrelevance, or it can unleash its innovators to build the future of finance. Right now, that future is being built almost entirely with American digital dollars, and time is running out to change that.
